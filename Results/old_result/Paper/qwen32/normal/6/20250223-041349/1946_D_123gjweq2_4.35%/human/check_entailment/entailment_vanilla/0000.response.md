Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split an array into the maximum number of non-overlapping segments such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to a given number \( x \).

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an array `arr` and a number `x` as input.
   - It calls `find_max` with the array and the maximum bit position (31, since \(0 \le a_i < 2^{30}\)).

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that tries to split the array into segments based on the current bit position.
   - It takes the current array `cur_arr` and the current bit position `bit` as input.
   - If `bit` is -1, it means all bits have been processed, and it returns the length of the current array, indicating that the array can be split into that many segments.
   - It initializes an empty list `new_arr` and a variable `xor` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array, computing the cumulative XOR of elements.
   - When the XOR value does not have the current bit set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it adds the current XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
   - After the loop, if the final XOR value has the current bit set, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that it's not possible to split the array at this bit.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next lower bit position and stores the result in `thing1`.
   - If the current bit in `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), it returns the maximum of the result of `find_max` on the original array with the next lower bit position and the length of `new_arr`.
   - If the current bit in `x` is not set, it returns `thing1`.

### Issues in the Program

The program's logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operations**:
   - The program incorrectly checks if the current bit is set in the XOR value and `x` using `xor >> bit & 1` and `x >> bit & 1`. This is incorrect for checking if a specific bit is set. Instead, it should use `(xor >> bit) & 1` and `(x >> bit) & 1`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bitwise OR**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments. It only checks if the XOR of each segment has a specific bit set, which is not sufficient to ensure that the bitwise OR of all segment XORs is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Incorrect Base Case**:
   - The base case when `bit` is -1 is incorrect. It should return 0 if no valid segments can be formed, not the length of the current array.

4. **Incorrect Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls are not correctly structured to ensure that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem described.

**Correctness: False**
