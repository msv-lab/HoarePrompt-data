Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 26; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; `word` is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3].**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `word` is updated to be 'aa' concatenated with the character at position `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.
