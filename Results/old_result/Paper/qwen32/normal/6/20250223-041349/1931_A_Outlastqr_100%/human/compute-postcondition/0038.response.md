Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a new integer read from input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' + the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet. If `n` is less than 3, `word` remains an empty string.**
