Let's analyze the given program and the logic it uses to determine the lexicographically smallest word for a given encoded integer value.

### Reasoning:

1. **Encoding Scheme:**
   - Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
   - The encoded value is the sum of the positions of the three letters.

2. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - A word is lexicographically smaller if it comes earlier in the dictionary order.
   - To find the smallest word, we should start with 'a's and then move to larger letters only when necessary.

3. **Logic in the Code:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the encoded value.
   - It then constructs a word based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs a word starting with a specific letter (determined by `n - 53`) followed by 'zz'.
     - If `28 <= n <= 52`, it constructs a word starting with 'a', then a specific letter (determined by `n - 28`), and finally 'z'.
     - If `n == 27`, it constructs the word "aay".
     - If `3 <= n <= 26`, it constructs a word starting with 'aa' and then the specific letter (determined by `n - 3`).

4. **Verification with Example Cases:**
   - **Case 1 (n = 24):** The smallest word is "aav" because 1 + 1 + 22 = 24, and "aav" comes before any other combination that sums to 24.
   - **Case 2 (n = 70):** The smallest word is "rzz" because 18 + 26 + 26 = 70, and "rzz" comes before any other combination that sums to 70.
   - **Case 3 (n = 3):** The smallest word is "aaa" because 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
   - **Case 4 (n = 55):** The smallest word is "czz" because 3 + 26 + 26 = 55, and "czz" comes before any other combination that sums to 55.
   - **Case 5 (n = 48):** The smallest word is "auz" because 1 + 21 + 26 = 48, and "auz" comes before any other combination that sums to 48.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the smallest possible value (3) correctly by returning "aaa".
   - It also handles the largest possible value (78) correctly by returning "zzz".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded integer value based on the given logic and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
