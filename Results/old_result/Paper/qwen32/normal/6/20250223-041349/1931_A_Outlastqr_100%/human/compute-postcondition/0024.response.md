The variable `word` is updated by concatenating the string `'aa'` with the character at the position `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string. Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the character at position `n - 3` will be the `n - 2`-th letter of the alphabet (since indexing starts at 0).

For example, if `n` is 3, the character added will be `'a'` (since `n - 3` is 0, and `alphabet[0]` is `'a'`). If `n` is 4, the character added will be `'b'` (since `n - 3` is 1, and `alphabet[1]` is `'b'`), and so on.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
