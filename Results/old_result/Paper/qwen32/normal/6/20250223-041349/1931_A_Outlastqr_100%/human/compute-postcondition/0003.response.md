Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; `word` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been initialized to an empty string, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged from the initial state.
