The code provided imports the lowercase alphabet from the `string` module and assigns it to the variable `alphabet`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n` as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
