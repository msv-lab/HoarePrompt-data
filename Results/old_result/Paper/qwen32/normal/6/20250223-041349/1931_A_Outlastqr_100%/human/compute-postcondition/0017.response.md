To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to consider the different cases for the value of `n` as described in the initial state.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how `word` is determined based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n` > 52:**
   - `word` is updated to include the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`.
   - For example, if `n` is 53, `word` becomes `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` which is `'azz'`.
   - If `n` is 54, `word` becomes `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` which is `'bzz'`, and so on.

2. **If `n` equals 27:**
   - `word` is the string `'aay'`.

3. **If `n` is between 28 and 52:**
   - `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For example, if `n` is 28, `word` becomes `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` which is `'aaz'`.
   - If `n` is 29, `word` becomes `'a' + alphabet[1] + 'z'` which is `'abz'`, and so on.

4. **If `n` is between 3 and 26:**
   - `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, `word` becomes `'aa' + alphabet[0]` which is `'aaa'`.
   - If `n` is 4, `word` becomes `'aa' + alphabet[1]` which is `'aab'`, and so on.

Since `n` can take on any value between 3 and 78, the value of `word` will vary based on the specific value of `n` for each test case.

Given that the exact value of `n` for each test case is not provided, we can only describe the value of `word` in terms of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n: if n > 52, word is alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'; if n == 27, word is 'aay'; if 28 <= n <= 52, word is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'; if 3 <= n <= 26, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3])**
