The code snippet `z = s.count('mapie')` updates the value of `z` to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`, `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`, `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**.
