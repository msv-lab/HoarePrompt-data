To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y - z)` statement, we need to understand the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the initial state provided.

- `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

The `print(x + y - z)` statement calculates the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', and then subtracts the occurrences of 'mapie'. This subtraction is necessary because occurrences of 'mapie' would otherwise be double-counted if we simply added the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `x` counts each instance of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` counts each instance of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` counts each instance of 'mapie' in `s`.

When `mapie` is counted, both 'map' and 'pie' are included within it. Therefore, to avoid double-counting, we subtract the occurrences of 'mapie' from the sum of 'map' and 'pie'.

Given that the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, we can describe the printed output based on the provided information.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the string s, y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the string s, and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the string s)**
