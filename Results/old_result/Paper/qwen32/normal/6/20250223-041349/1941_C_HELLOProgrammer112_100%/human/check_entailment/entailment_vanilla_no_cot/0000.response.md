Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then calculates `x + y - z`, which does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid "map" or "pie".

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully considers the positions and overlaps of the substrings "map" and "pie". The given solution does not handle these cases properly.
