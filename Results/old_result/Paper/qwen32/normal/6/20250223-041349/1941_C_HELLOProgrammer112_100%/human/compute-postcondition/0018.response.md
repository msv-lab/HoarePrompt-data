The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `x`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`, `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`, `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**.
