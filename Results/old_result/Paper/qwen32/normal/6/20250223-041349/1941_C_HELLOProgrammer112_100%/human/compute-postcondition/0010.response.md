The code snippet updates the value of `x` to be the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the integer value provided by the user input; `s` is the new input string provided by the user; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`.**
