The loop head in the provided for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the range generated by `int(input())` has more elements. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the range. Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that the input value is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute as long as the range generated by `int(input())` has more elements.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the range would have been decremented by 1.
3. To execute one more time, the input value that determines the range should be 1 more than the current state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the input value for the range is still valid and will allow for one more iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.** (Note: The state of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` does not change in relation to the loop head, only the implicit input that determines the loop's continuation changes.)

Since we cannot directly modify the input, we can infer that the state of the loop control is implicitly managed by the decremented range. Thus, the state remains the same in terms of the variables mentioned, but conceptually, the input that controls the loop is adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**
