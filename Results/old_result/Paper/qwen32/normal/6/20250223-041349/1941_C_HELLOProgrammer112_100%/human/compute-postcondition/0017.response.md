The code snippet updates the value of `x` by counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`, `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`, `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**.

In simpler terms, the new value of `x` is the count of 'map' in `s`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
