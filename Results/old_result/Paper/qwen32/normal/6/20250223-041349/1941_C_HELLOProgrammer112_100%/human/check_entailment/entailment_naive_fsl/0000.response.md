Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The problem requires finding the minimum deletions to remove all occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and returns `x + y - z`. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

For example, consider the string "ppiepiepie". The program would count:
- `x = s.count('map')` which is 0
- `y = s.count('pie')` which is 3
- `z = s.count('mapie')` which is 0

The program would then return `0 + 3 - 0 = 3`. However, the correct answer should be 2 because you can remove the first 'p' and the last 'e' to get "piepie", which still contains "pie" twice, or remove the first 'i' and the last 'p' to get "ppiepie", which still contains "pie" twice. The optimal solution would be to remove two characters to break all "pie" substrings.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all cases.
