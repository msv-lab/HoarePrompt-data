Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sm`**

Explanation: The value of `over_sum` is set to the value of `sm`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
