Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, and `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are updated to `[i, j]` and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
