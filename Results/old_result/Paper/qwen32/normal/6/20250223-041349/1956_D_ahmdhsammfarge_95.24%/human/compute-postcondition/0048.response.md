The code snippet assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Given that `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, after the assignment, `over_sum` will also be `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`**. 

In natural language, the output state is: `lst` remains a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` remains 0, `l` remains 1, `over_sum` is now equal to `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` remains 0, `j` remains 1, and `sm` remains `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.
