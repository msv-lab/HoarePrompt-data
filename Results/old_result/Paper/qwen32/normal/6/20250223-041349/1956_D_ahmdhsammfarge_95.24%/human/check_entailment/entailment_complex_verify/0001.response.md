### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: The function is intended to find the best subarray `[i, j]` to perform the operation on, trying to maximize the sum of the array after the operation.
- **Implementation**: The function calculates a sum `sm` which includes the sum of elements before index `i`, the sum of elements after index `j`, and the square of the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`. This is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value of the subarray. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Annotation**: The annotation correctly identifies that the function is trying to maximize the sum by considering the square of the subarray length, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement of using the MEX value.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function is recursive and adds operations to the list `ops`.
- **Implementation**: The function recursively adds operations `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. The logic within this function is not clearly justified by the problem requirements. It does not seem to align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: The annotation correctly identifies that the function adds operations in a recursive manner, but it does not align with the problem's goal of using the MEX value.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: This function performs the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by setting all elements to `n` (the length of the subarray) and adds operations to the list `ops`.
- **Implementation**: The function sets all elements in the subarray `[r, l]` to `n` and adds operations to the list `ops`. This is incorrect because it should set all elements to the MEX value of the subarray.
- **Annotation**: The annotation correctly identifies that the function sets the elements to `n` and adds operations to the list `ops`, but it does not align with the problem's goal of using the MEX value.

#### Main Logic:
- **Finding and Applying Operations**: The main logic repeatedly finds the best subarray using `func_1` and applies the operation using `func_3`. After all possible subarrays are processed, it tries to replace any remaining zeros with ones.
- **Annotation**: The annotation correctly identifies the overall process of finding and applying operations, but it does not align with the problem's goal of using the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly compute the MEX value for subarrays and the operations performed do not align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value. The logic within the functions is flawed and does not guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
