The code snippet replaces the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` with a list containing `n` elements, each of which is `n`. Since `n` is defined as `l - r + 1`, the slice from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) in `lst` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, all of which are `n`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers where the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) have been replaced by `n` elements, each equal to `n`, `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed and contains `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1]]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`.**
