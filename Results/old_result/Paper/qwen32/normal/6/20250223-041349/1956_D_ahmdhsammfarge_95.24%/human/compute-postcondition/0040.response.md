Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`
- `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations
- `i` is 0

The code snippet:
```python
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

Since `i` is 0, `sum(lst[:i])` will be the sum of an empty list, which is 0. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `j` is an index in the list such that `i <= j < len(lst)`.

The expression `(j - i + 1) ** 2` simplifies to `(j - 0 + 1) ** 2` or `(j + 1) ** 2`.

Thus, the new value of `sm` will be:
```python
sm = 0 + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2
```
or
```python
sm = sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2
```

The variables `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2`**.
