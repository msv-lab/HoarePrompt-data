The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `lst`. According to the for loop statement, the loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(lst) - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The variable `lst` remains unchanged as it is the list being iterated over.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 0, `l` is 1, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`**.
