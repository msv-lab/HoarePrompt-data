### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Function `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the subarray `[i, j]` that maximizes the sum when transformed. However, the logic seems flawed. The function calculates a sum `sm` that includes the sum of elements outside the subarray `[i, j]` and the square of the length of the subarray. This does not align with the goal of maximizing the MEX operation's contribution to the sum.
   - Instead of maximizing the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length, it should focus on maximizing the MEX value of the subarray itself, which would be more strategic for the problem.

2. **Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function is recursive and seems to be intended to record operations in `ops` but does so in a way that is not clear or necessary for the problem. It repeatedly appends `[r+1, l+1]` and calls itself recursively, which could lead to an excessive number of operations and is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
   - This function modifies the list `lst` by setting the subarray from index `r` to `l` to the length of that subarray `n`. It also records operations in `ops`.
   - The logic here is partially correct in that it sets the subarray to a uniform value, but the way it does so and the operations recorded might not be optimal or correct for the problem.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program starts by reading the input list and initializing an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - It then uses `func_1` to find the subarray to modify and repeatedly calls `func_3` to perform the MEX operation and record the operations.
   - The program attempts to replace zeros with ones, but this is not a guaranteed optimal strategy for maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided functions and the main program does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the subarray that maximizes the MEX operation's contribution to the sum. The recursive nature of `func_2` and the specific operations recorded by `func_3` are also not optimal or necessary for solving the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
