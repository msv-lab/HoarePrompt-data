Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem statement. Let's examine the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to find the best subarray to replace to maximize the sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly by adding `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to the sum of elements outside the subarray, which is not the correct MEX value calculation. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the length of the subarray.
   - The logic for finding the MEX value is missing entirely. The function should compute the MEX value of the subarray and replace the subarray with this MEX value to maximize the sum.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations, but it does not correctly generate the required operations to achieve the desired result. The recursive calls and operations appended do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function attempts to replace a subarray with its MEX value and generate operations. However, it incorrectly checks for the minimum value in the subarray and appends unnecessary operations. It also does not correctly compute the MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Compute the MEX value for each subarray.
- Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
- Track the operations performed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The correct output is:
```
13 0
```
The provided code might not handle this case correctly because it does not properly compute the MEX value and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
