You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem statement. Let's examine the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to find the best subarray to replace to maximize the sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly by adding `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to the sum of elements outside the subarray, which is not the correct MEX value calculation. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the length of the subarray.
   - The logic for finding the MEX value is missing entirely. The function should compute the MEX value of the subarray and replace the subarray with this MEX value to maximize the sum.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations, but it does not correctly generate the required operations to achieve the desired result. The recursive calls and operations appended do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function attempts to replace a subarray with its MEX value and generate operations. However, it incorrectly checks for the minimum value in the subarray and appends unnecessary operations. It also does not correctly compute the MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Compute the MEX value for each subarray.
- Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
- Track the operations performed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The correct output is:
```
13 0
```
The provided code might not handle this case correctly because it does not properly compute the MEX value and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
