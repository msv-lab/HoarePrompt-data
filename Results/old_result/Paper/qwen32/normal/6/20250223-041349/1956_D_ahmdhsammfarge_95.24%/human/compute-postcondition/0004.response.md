The code snippet appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the condition related to the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` are not affected by this specific line of code. The only change is that `ops` now contains an additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is added to `ops`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is added to `ops` a second time. Additionally, `ops` now contains `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
