To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and affects the variables.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each element starting from the second element (since `i + 1` is the starting point for `j`). For each `i`, `j` iterates from `i + 1` to the end of the list. The variable `sm` is calculated as the sum of the elements before the `i`-th element, the elements after the `j`-th element, and the square of the distance between `j` and `i` plus one. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are updated to `i` and `j`, respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

### Iteration Progression

- **After 1st Iteration (`i=0, j=1`)**: `sm` is calculated as `over_sum - lst[0] + 1`. If `sm > over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated, and `r` and `l` are set to `0` and `1`, respectively.
- **After 2nd Iteration (`i=0, j=2`)**: `sm` is calculated as `over_sum - lst[0] - lst[1] + 4`. If `sm > over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated, and `r` and `l` are set to `0` and `2`, respectively.
- **After 3rd Iteration (`i=0, j=3`)**: `sm` is calculated as `over_sum - lst[0] - lst[1] - lst[2] + 9`. If `sm > over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated, and `r` and `l` are set to `0` and `3`, respectively.

This pattern continues for all possible pairs `(i, j)`.

### Final State

After all iterations, `r` and `l` will hold the indices of the pair `(i, j)` where the calculated `sm` is the maximum. `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations.

### Conclusion

The final output state will be determined by the pair `(i, j)` that maximizes the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. The values of `r` and `l` will be the indices of this pair, and `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm`.

Given the initial state and the pattern of updates, the final state can be described as:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, and `i` and `j` will have completed their iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `r` and `l` will point to the indices of the pair that gives the highest calculated `sm`, and `over_sum` will hold this maximum value.
