Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to `ops`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to `ops` a second time. Additionally, `ops` now contains `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

In natural language: The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to the `ops` list. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, this operation has been added to `ops` a second time. Additionally, the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been added to `ops`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
