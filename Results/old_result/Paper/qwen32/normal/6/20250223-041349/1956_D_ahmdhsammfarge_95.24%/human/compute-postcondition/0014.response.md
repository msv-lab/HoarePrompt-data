The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it depends on, which includes `i` and `len(lst)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` and ensure that the range allows for another iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.
- `r` is 0.
- `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` is 0.
- `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.
- `i` is 0.
- `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.
- `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the range `(i + 1, len(lst))` must still be valid. Since `i` is 0, the range is `(1, len(lst))`. After the first iteration, `j` is 1, so for the next iteration, `j` should be 2, and `len(lst)` must be at least 3 to allow `j` to be 2.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is 0, `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` is 0, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `j` is 2**.
