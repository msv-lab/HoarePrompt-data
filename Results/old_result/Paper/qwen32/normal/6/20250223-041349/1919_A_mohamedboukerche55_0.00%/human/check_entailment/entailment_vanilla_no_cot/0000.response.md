Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play described in the problem. The key issue is in the logic used to determine the winner. The program checks if the sum of coins `(a + b) % 2` is even or odd, which does not align with the optimal strategy for the game.

To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers `a` and `b` and their relative values, not just their sum. Here's a brief explanation of the correct approach:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
2. If both `a` and `b` are even, then Bob wins because Alice will always be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.
3. If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, then Alice wins because she can make the game reach a state where both are odd, putting Bob into a losing position.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, thus leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
