Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
