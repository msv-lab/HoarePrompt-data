To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to follow the behavior of the loop as described and ensure that we account for all possible scenarios based on the values of `arr` and the logic provided.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr`: List of integers.
   - `new_segment`: Initially empty.
   - `max_segment`: Initially `[0, 0]`.
   - `segments_variants`: Initially empty.
   - `max_sum`: Initially `-1`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - Depending on whether `new_segment` is empty and the value of `arr[i]`, it updates `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative and `new_segment` is not empty, `new_segment` is reset and `max_segment` is updated accordingly.
   - If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is updated, and `max_segment` is also updated.
   - `segments_variants` is updated only when `new_segment` is reset.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- **`new_segment`**: After the loop, `new_segment` will be either empty or contain the last contiguous segment of non-negative numbers.
- **`max_segment`**: This will contain the segment with the maximum sum and its start index.
- **`segments_variants`**: This will contain all the segments that were considered as potential maximum segments.
- **`max_sum`**: This will remain `-1` as per the given loop logic, which does not update `max_sum`.

### Detailed Output State:
- `new_segment`: Depending on the input `arr`, this could be an empty list or a list containing the last segment of non-negative numbers.
- `max_segment`: A list containing the sum of the maximum segment and the starting index of that segment.
- `segments_variants`: A list of lists, each sublist representing a segment that was considered for being the maximum segment.
- `max_sum`: Remains `-1`.

### Example:
Let's assume `arr = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`.

- After the loop, `new_segment` could be `[5, 6]` (the last segment of non-negative numbers).
- `max_segment` could be `[7, 3]` (the segment `[3, 4]` with sum `7` starting at index `3`).
- `segments_variants` could be `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4]]` (considering the segments `[3]` and `[3, 4]`).
- `max_sum` remains `-1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, `new_segment` will contain the last contiguous segment of non-negative numbers from `arr`, `max_segment` will contain the segment with the maximum sum and its starting index, `segments_variants` will contain all segments considered as potential maximum segments, and `max_sum` will remain `-1` as per the given loop logic.
