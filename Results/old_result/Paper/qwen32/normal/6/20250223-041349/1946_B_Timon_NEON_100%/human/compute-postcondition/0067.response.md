To determine the final state of the loop, we need to evaluate the loop for all iterations over the `segments_variants` list. Let's go through each iteration and see how `total_max_segment` changes.

### Iteration Breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`
   - `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`
   - `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`
   - `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`
   - `max_sum` is `-1`
   - `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `segment` is `[3, 3, 4]`
   - `total_max_segment[0]` (which is `-1`) is less than `segment[0]` (which is `3`), and `len(segment)` is not `1`.
   - `total_max_segment` is updated to `[3, 3, 4]`.

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `segment` is `[7, 3, 4]`
   - `total_max_segment[0]` (which is `3`) is less than `segment[0]` (which is `7`), and `len(segment)` is not `1`.
   - `total_max_segment` is updated to `[7, 3, 4]`.

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - `segment` is `[7, 3, 6]`
   - `total_max_segment[0]` (which is `7`) is not less than `segment[0]` (which is `7`), so `total_max_segment` remains `[7, 3, 4]`.

5. **Iteration 4:**
   - `segment` is `[5, 6, 6]`
   - `total_max_segment[0]` (which is `7`) is not less than `segment[0]` (which is `5`), so `total_max_segment` remains `[7, 3, 4]`.

### Final Output State:

After all iterations, the `total_max_segment` remains `[7, 3, 4]` because no subsequent segment had a first element greater than `7`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **arr is [1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5], new_segment is [5, 6], max_segment is [7, 3], segments_variants is [[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]], max_sum is -1, total_max_segment is [7, 3, 4].**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations, the `total_max_segment` is `[7, 3, 4]`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
