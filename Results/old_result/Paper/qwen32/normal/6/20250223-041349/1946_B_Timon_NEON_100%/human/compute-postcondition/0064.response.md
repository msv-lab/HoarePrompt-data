The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more elements in `segments_variants` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `segment` was `[7, 3, 4]`. The next `segment` in `segments_variants` is `[5, 6, 6]`.

State: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, `segment` is `[5, 6, 6]`**
