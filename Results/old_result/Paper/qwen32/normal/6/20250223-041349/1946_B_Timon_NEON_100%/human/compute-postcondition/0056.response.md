Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

Explanation: The only change is the addition of the variable `total_max_segment` which is assigned the value `[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
