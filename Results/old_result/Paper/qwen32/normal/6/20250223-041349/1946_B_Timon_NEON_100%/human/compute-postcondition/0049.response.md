The code snippet creates a new list `new_segment` with the first element being `arr[i]` and the second element being `i`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` are not altered directly by this code, but `new_segment` is introduced.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented).
- `max_sum` remains -1.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `arr` remains a list of integers with at least one element.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
- `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[i]` as its first element and `i` as its second element.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`.**
