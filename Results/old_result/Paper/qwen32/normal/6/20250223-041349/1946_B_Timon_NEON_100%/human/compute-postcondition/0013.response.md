The code snippet provided is `new_segment = []`, which reassigns the `new_segment` variable to an empty list. This change affects `new_segment` but does not affect the other variables (`arr`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, or `i`).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element of `arr` at index `i` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[[new_segment[0], new_segment[1], i - 1]]`.**

In simpler terms, `new_segment` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
