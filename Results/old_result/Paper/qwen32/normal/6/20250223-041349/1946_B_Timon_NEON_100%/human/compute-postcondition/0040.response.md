The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by adding the value `i - 1` to the existing list `max_segment`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `max_sum` remains -1; `segments_variants` has a new list appended to it, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`.**
