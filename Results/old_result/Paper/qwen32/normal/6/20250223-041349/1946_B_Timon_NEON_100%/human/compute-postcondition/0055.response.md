The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. The new list is created by concatenating `new_segment` with a list containing the length of `arr` minus one.

Given:
- `arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, so `len(arr) - 1` is `6`.
- `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`.

Thus, the new list to be appended is `[5, 6, 6]`.

The `segments_variants` list, which was initially `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6]]`, will now include the new list `[5, 6, 6]` at the end.

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, `max_segment` is `[7, 3]`, `segments_variants` is `[[3, 3, 4], [7, 3, 4], [7, 3, 6], [5, 6, 6]]`, `max_sum` is `-1`.**
