Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break it down:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This seems correct for ensuring the final answer is within the required range.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices. However, it does not handle all edge cases and logic correctly:
   - It does not handle cases where all numbers are negative correctly.
   - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is not robust enough and can lead to incorrect results.
   - It does not ensure that the maximum subarray sum is correctly identified in all scenarios.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It simply initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

### Issues:
- The program does not perform any operations to insert the sum of subarrays into the original array.
- The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum is incomplete and may not work correctly for all edge cases.
- The program does not iterate over the number of operations `k` to perform the required insertions.
- The final sum of the array after `k` operations is not calculated.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The program should output `96` as explained in the problem description. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly because it does not perform any insertions based on the maximum subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.
