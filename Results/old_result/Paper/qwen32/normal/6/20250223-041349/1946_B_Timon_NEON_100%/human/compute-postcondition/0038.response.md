Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `new_segment` was not an empty list before the if statement, it is now an empty list. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are each increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0 and `new_segment` was not empty, `new_segment` is not defined. `segments_variants` remains the same.**
