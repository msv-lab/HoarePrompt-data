Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is True, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are incremented by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, a new list `max_segment + [i - 1]` is appended to `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`. If `new_segment` is False, `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`, and if `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`.**
