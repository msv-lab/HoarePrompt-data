The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `num_iterations`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value input by the user; `ans` is 0.**
