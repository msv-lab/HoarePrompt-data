Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than or equal to 8; if `i` was originally 6, `s` is now `a[6:9]` and `ans` is 2; if `i` was originally 2, `s` is now `a[2:5]` and `ans` is 0; `i` is now 7 or 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was originally 6, it is now 7, and if `i` was originally 2, it is now 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
