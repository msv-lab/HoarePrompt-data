To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` does not appear to be directly used in the code snippet provided, so it does not affect the value of `ans`.

2. `n` is an input integer. Similar to `t`, `n` does not directly influence the value of `ans` based on the given code snippet.

3. `a` is the input string. The value of `ans` is dependent on the content of this string.

4. `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`.

5. `i` is the smallest integer such that \(i \geq \text{len}(a) - 2\). This variable `i` is not used in the `print(ans)` statement, so it does not affect the output.

To summarize, `ans` is calculated based on the number of times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `a`. Since the exact content of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`)**
