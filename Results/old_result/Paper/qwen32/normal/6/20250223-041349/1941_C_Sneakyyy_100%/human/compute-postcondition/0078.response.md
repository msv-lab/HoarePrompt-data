Postcondition: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 4.**
