The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables (`num_iterations`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) are not affected by the code snippet provided.

If `s` was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` was 1 and `i` was 4 before the increment. Now, `i` becomes 7. Otherwise, `ans` was 0 and `i` was 2 before the increment. Now, `i` becomes 5.

Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`; If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 7. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 5.**
