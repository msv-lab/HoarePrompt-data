### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to count the minimum number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case's string. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a` itself.
2. It initializes a counter `ans` to zero, which will keep track of the number of deletions needed.
3. It iterates through the string `a` using a while loop, checking each substring of length 3.
4. If the substring is either "map" or "pie", it increments the counter `ans` by 1 and skips the next two characters (i.e., it moves the index `i` by 3 positions).
5. If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it simply moves to the next character (i.e., it increments the index `i` by 1).
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of deletions needed to remove non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". The example test cases in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. 

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the given examples.

### Correctness: **True**
