The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can be either 4 or 2 depending on the condition of `s`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is initially 4, and after the increment, `i` becomes 5. Otherwise, `i` is initially 2, and after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of `num_iterations`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`; If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**
