The code snippet assigns the slice of the sequence `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` to the variable `s`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `s` will be the first three elements of the sequence `a`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is the first three elements of the sequence `a`.**
