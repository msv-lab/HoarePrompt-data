To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2`. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: The loop condition involves the variables `i` and `a`.
2. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i < len(a) - 2`.
3. **Current state of variables**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a string equal to the input provided, and its length is not explicitly specified but is at least 3 for the loop to execute (`len(a) - 2` must be greater than 0).

Given the current state, `i` is 0, which is a valid starting point. However, we need to ensure that `len(a) - 2` is greater than 0 so that `i < len(a) - 2` holds true.

Since `a` is a string, its length must be at least 3 for the condition to be satisfied. If the length of `a` is less than 3, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is at least 3.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the length of `a` is at least 3.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length at least 3; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0**
