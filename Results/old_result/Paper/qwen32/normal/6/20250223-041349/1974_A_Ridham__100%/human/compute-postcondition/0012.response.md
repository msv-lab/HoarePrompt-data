The code calculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the given initial state and updates it accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged unless specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

In simple terms, the value of `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
