The code snippet `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to be the integer division of `y` by 2. This means that if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` will be `y // 2`, and if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` will be `y // 2` (which effectively rounds down to the nearest whole number).

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the values `[screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`.**
