The code snippet provided is:

```python
extra_screen = extra_space // 15
```

This line calculates the integer division of `extra_space` by 15 and assigns the result to `extra_screen`. The value of `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

To determine the output state, we need to consider the possible values of `extra_space` and how they affect `extra_screen`.

Given the initial state, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`. The value of `extra_space` can be any integer, and the value of `extra_screen` will be the integer division of `extra_space` by 15.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `extra_screen` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the values `[screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`.**
