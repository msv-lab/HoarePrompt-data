The code snippet modifies the value of `extra_screen` based on the current value of `extra_space`. Specifically, `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This means that `extra_screen` will be the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, plus one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99)
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `result` is an empty list
- `space_x` is equal to `x`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`
- `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`
- `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`
- `extra_space` is not divisible by 15

The only change after executing the code is the value of `extra_screen`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is not divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
