Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The values of `n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are still unknown.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is now an integer that represents the number of test cases, with a value between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values for `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case have not been read yet and remain unknown.
