The code snippet `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 0, so this element will be removed. The value of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a` is not empty (after removing the first element which was 0), `res` is 0.**
