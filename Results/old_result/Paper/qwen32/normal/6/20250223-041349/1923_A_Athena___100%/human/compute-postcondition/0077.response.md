The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the list `a` ends with 0, this operation will remove the 0 from the end of the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers that no longer ends with 0 (the last 0 has been removed), `res` is 0.**
