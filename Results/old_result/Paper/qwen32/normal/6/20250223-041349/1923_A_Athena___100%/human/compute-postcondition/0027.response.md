The code snippet provided is `res += 1`, which increments the variable `res` by 1. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Only the variable `res` is affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is incremented by 1.**
