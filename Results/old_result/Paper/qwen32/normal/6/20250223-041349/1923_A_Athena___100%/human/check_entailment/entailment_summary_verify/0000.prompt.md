You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of cells where each cell is either free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells between the first and last cell that contains a chip.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)
```

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to move chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this should be determined. An operation consists of moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The program simply counts the number of zeros in the trimmed array (after removing leading and trailing zeros). However, this does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations needed to move chips into a contiguous block.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - **Input**: `8 \n 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
     - **Expected Output**: `1` (Move the chip at position 7 to position 5)
     - **Actual Output**: `2` (Counts the two zeros in the middle)

   - **Input**: `9 \n 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
     - **Expected Output**: `3` (Move chips at positions 2 and 7 to positions 4 and 5 respectively)
     - **Actual Output**: `4` (Counts the four zeros in the middle and between the blocks)

### Correctness
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. It overcounts the number of operations by simply counting the zeros in the trimmed array.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation
The program incorrectly counts the number of operations by simply counting the zeros in the trimmed array. It does not account for the correct number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single contiguous block. This can be seen in the example cases where the program's output does not match the expected output.
