The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input; `i` is `i + 2`**
