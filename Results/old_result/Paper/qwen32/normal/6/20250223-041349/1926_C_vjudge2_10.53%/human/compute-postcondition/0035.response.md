The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, and `n` must be at least 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 10.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `str(i)` where `i` is undefined, `last` is the integer representation of the last digit of `word`, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 10**
