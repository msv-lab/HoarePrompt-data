The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `10`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `10`. Since `i` is not less than `10`, the loop would not execute again based on the current state.

However, if we are to adjust the state to make the loop execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value less than `10`. Let's assume we want to make the loop execute for `i = 9` (the last possible value before it stops).

State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i` (specifically, `values[10]` is 10); `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0` except the `i`-th element which is `20`; `total` is 20; `i` is 9**
