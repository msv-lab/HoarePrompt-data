The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `sum_total` using the formula `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `values[i]` where `i` is 10 is 1.
- `sum_values[i - 1]` where `i` is 10 is 45.

Thus, `sum_total` is recalculated as `values[10] + sum_values[9]`, which is `1 + 45 = 46`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 10**.
