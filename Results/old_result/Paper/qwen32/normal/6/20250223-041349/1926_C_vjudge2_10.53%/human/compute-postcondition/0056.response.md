To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the changes in the state after each iteration. 

The loop is defined as:
```python
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])
```

Given the initial state and the state after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- `t` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- `numbers` is a list of integers.
- `values` and `sum_values` are precomputed lists that do not change during the loop execution.
- `total` remains 45 throughout the loop.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that `numbers` must have at least three elements. Specifically:
- After the first iteration, `numbers` must have contained at least one element, `[20]`.
- After the second iteration, `numbers` must have contained at least two elements, `[20, 21]`.
- After the third iteration, `numbers` must have contained at least three elements, `[20, 21, ...]`.

Since we are given the states after the first three iterations, we can assume that `numbers` could be `[20, 21, 22]` or any other list of three integers. However, the problem does not specify the exact elements beyond the first three, so we will assume the simplest case where `numbers` is `[20, 21, 22]` for the sake of this explanation.

The `sum_values` list for `n = 20` is given as:
`[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 52, 59, 70, 86, 108, 137, 174, 220, 223]`

So, the loop will print:
- `sum_values[20]` which is `223`
- `sum_values[21]` which is `220`
- `sum_values[22]` which is `174`

Since the loop iterates over all elements in `numbers`, and we have assumed `numbers` to be `[20, 21, 22]`, the loop will execute three times, and the final state will be the same as the state after the third iteration, except that all elements in `numbers` will have been processed.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is `[20, 21, 22]`, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and additional elements calculated as described, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and additional elements calculated as described, `total` is 45**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the variable `t` remains 0, `numbers` remains `[20, 21, 22]`, `values` and `sum_values` remain unchanged as described, and `total` remains 45.
