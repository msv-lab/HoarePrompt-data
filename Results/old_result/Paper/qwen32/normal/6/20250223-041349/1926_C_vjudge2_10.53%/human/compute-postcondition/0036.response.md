The code snippet provided updates the `word` variable to the string representation of `i`, which is 10. This change will affect the `last` and `remainder` variables since they are derived from `word`.

Given:
- `word` was `str(i)` where `i` was undefined.
- `last` is the integer representation of the last digit of `word`.
- `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed.

After `word = str(i)` where `i` is 10:
- `word` becomes `"10"`.
- `last` becomes `0` (the integer representation of the last digit of `"10"`).
- `remainder` becomes `1` (the integer value of `"10"` with its last digit removed).

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 10**
