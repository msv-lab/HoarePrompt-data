You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing the number provided in each iteration of the loop.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45; `total` is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: - `t` is 0
    #- `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers
    #- `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, and additional elements calculated as described
    #- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and additional elements calculated as described
    #- `total` is 45
    #
    #Specifically for `n = 20`:
    #- `values` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 3]`
    #- `sum_values` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 52, 59, 70, 86, 108, 137, 174, 220, 223]`
    #
    #Output State:
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `numbers` is `[20, 21, 22]`, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and additional elements calculated as described, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and additional elements calculated as described, `total` is 45
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes. The function returns the result for each test case based on the value of `n`.
