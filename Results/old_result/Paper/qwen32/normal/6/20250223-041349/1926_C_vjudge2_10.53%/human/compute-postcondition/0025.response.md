The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`. Given that `total` is initially 20 and `i` is 9, `total` becomes 29. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the 9-th element set to 9 and the 10-th element set to 10; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except the `i`-th element which is 20; `total` is 29; `i` is 9**
