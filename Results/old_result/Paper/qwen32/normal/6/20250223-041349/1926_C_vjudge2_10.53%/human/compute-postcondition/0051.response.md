To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Set to 0.
2. **`numbers`**: A list containing a single element, `[20]`.
3. **`values`**: A list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9. The additional elements are calculated as described, but the exact calculation isn't necessary for this problem.
4. **`sum_values`**: A list of length `max(numbers) + 1`, which is `20 + 1 = 21`. The first 10 elements are explicitly given as `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`. The remaining elements (from index 10 to 20) are not provided, but we can infer they are calculated based on some pattern.
5. **`total`**: Set to 45.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(sum_values[n])`. To determine the output, we need to know the value of `n`. However, `n` is not defined in the initial state provided. Given the context, we can assume `n` is a variable that should be defined before this print statement, but since it's not, we cannot determine its exact value. 

However, if we assume `n` is a valid index within the bounds of `sum_values` (i.e., `0 <= n <= 20`), we can describe the possible outputs based on the known elements of `sum_values`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- If `n` is between 0 and 9, `sum_values[n]` will be one of the explicitly given values: `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.
- If `n` is between 10 and 20, `sum_values[n]` will be one of the calculated values, but since they are not provided, we can only describe it as `sum_values[n]` where `n` is between 10 and 20.

Given that the exact value of `n` is not provided, we need to describe the output in a general form. However, if we assume `n` is a valid index and we focus on the provided values, the most precise description we can give is based on the known elements.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output based on the known values of `sum_values` for `n` between 0 and 9. If `n` is outside this range, we can only describe it as `sum_values[n]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, the output will depend on the value of `n`. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the output will be one of the explicitly given values. If `n` is between 10 and 20, the output will be `sum_values[n]`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided information, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is a valid index in the range 0 to 20, and sum_values[n] is the nth element of the sum_values list)**

However, if we assume `n` is within the range 0 to 9 for a more concrete example:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is a valid index in the range 0 to 9, and sum_values[n] is one of [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45])**
