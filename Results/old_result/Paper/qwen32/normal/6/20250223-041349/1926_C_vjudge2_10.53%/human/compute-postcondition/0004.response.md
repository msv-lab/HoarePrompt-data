Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing the single element `n`; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural language explanation: The list `numbers` now contains one element, which is the input integer `n`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
