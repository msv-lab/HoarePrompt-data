In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `numbers` is mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but it is not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once (since `t` is at least 1).

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The state of `numbers` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is an empty list**
