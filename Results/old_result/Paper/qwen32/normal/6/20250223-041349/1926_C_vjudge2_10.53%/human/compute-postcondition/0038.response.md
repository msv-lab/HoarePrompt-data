The code snippet updates the value of `remainder` by converting the substring of `word` (excluding the last character) to an integer. Given `word` is `"10"`, `word[:-1]` will be `"1"`, and `int("1")` will be `1`. Therefore, `remainder` remains `1`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `"10"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 10**.
