The code snippet `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` takes the last character of the string `word` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `last`. Given that `word` is `"11"`, the last character is `"1"`, and converting it to an integer results in `1`. Therefore, `last` is updated to `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is `"11"`, `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 11**
