Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing the number provided in each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `numbers` list will contain all the integers that were input during each of the `t` iterations of the loop.
