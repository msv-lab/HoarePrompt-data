The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` updates the `i`-th element of the `sum_values` list to the value of `total`. Given that `i` is 9 and `total` is 29, the 9-th element of `sum_values` will be set to 29.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the 9-th element set to 9 and the 10-th element set to 10; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except the 9-th element which is 29; `total` is 29; `i` is 9**.
