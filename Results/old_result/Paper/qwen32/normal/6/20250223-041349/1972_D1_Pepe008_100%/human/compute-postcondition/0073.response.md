The code snippet provided adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, the value of `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\). The value of `i` has already been updated to `i + 1` in the initial state, and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected by the code is `suma`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` is increased by `x`**.
