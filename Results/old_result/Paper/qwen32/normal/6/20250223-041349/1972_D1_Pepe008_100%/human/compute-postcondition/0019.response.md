The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
