To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how `suma` is updated. Given the initial state and the first three iterations, we can infer the general pattern and compute the final value of `suma`.

Let's break down the loop:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive).
2. For each iteration, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
3. If `x > 0`, `suma` is incremented by `x`.
4. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, `suma` is incremented by 1.

Let's assume `info` is provided such that `a` and `b` are integers. We will use a generic approach to determine the final `suma` value.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume `a = 10` and `b = 3` for concreteness:

1. **Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:
   - `x = (10 - 1 * 0) // 1 ** 2 + 1 = 10 // 1 + 1 = 11`
   - Since `x > 0`, `suma` becomes `0 + 11 = 11`.
   - `(10 - 1 * 0) % 1 ** 2 == 0` and `1 * 0 % 1 ** 2 == 0` are both true, so `suma` becomes `11 + 1 = 12`.

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
   - `x = (10 - 2 * 1) // 2 ** 2 + 1 = 8 // 4 + 1 = 3`
   - Since `x > 0`, `suma` becomes `12 + 3 = 15`.
   - `(10 - 2 * 1) % 2 ** 2 == 0` and `2 * 1 % 2 ** 2 == 0` are not both true, so `suma` remains `15`.

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 3)**:
   - `x = (10 - 3 * 2) // 3 ** 2 + 1 = 4 // 9 + 1 = 1`
   - Since `x > 0`, `suma` becomes `15 + 1 = 16`.
   - `(10 - 3 * 2) % 3 ** 2 == 0` and `3 * 2 % 3 ** 2 == 0` are not both true, so `suma` remains `16`.

After these iterations, the final value of `suma` is `16`.

### General Case

The final value of `suma` depends on the values of `a` and `b`. The loop iterates `b` times, and for each iteration, `x` is calculated and added to `suma` if `x > 0`. Additionally, `suma` is incremented by 1 if specific conditions are met.

### Final Output State

Given the example values `a = 10` and `b = 3`, the final output state is:

Output State: **suma is 16, t is incremented by 1 and is less than T, info is a list of strings, a is the integer value of info[0], b is the integer value of info[1] and b is at least 1.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `suma` is 16, `t` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `T`, `info` remains the same list of strings, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, and `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and is at least 1.
