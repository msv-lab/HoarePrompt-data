You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: The final value of `suma - 2` after processing all `T` inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and outputs the result minus 2. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each integer in the range of 1 to 2,000,000, and the cumulative sum of all integers does not exceed 2,000,000.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description:

The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through possible values of `b` and calculating a value `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. It then adds `x` to the sum `suma` and checks if certain conditions are met to add an additional `1` to `suma`. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. The code does not correctly handle the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately reflect this requirement.

2. The code subtracts `2` from `suma` before printing, which does not align with any logical step in the problem description and seems arbitrary.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For `(a, b) = (1, 1)`: `1 + 1 = 2` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 1)`: `2 + 1 = 3` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(2, 1) = 1`.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 2)`: `2 + 2 = 4` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2`.

The provided code does not correctly count these pairs and will likely produce an incorrect result for this test case.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
