Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 6) // 3`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value plus 1.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `suma` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
