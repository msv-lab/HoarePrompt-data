Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The values of `suma`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and the initial increment of `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
