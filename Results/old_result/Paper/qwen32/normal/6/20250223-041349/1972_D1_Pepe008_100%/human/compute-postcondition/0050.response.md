Postcondition: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i != 0`, then `suma` is incremented by `x` plus 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
