To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. In each iteration, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `i` is appended to `output1` and `int(x / i)` is appended to `output2`.

The loop will execute all iterations until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5)`. At the end of the loop, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `output1` will have all the smaller divisors of `x` (up to the square root of `x`), and `output2` will have the corresponding larger divisors of `x`.
