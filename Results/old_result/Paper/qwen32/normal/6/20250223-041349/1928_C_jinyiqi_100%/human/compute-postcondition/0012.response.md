The code snippet `output1.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` itself is not modified by this operation; it is only used as an argument to the `append` method.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
