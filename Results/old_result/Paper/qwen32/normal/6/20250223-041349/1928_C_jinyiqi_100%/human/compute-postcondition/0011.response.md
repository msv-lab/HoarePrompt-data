The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `x`, and `n`. According to the loop statement, `i` iterates from 1 up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as it is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. The values of `x` and `n` remain the same.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i_prev`, we express the state in terms of `i_prev + 1`.

Final State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1**.
