Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The cyclic shifts of an array are all possible rotations of the array. If `k == n`, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted, implying that the array itself must be sorted. If `k == 1`, it means only one cyclic shift can be sorted. For other values of `k`, it's more complex to construct such an array, and the problem doesn't specify how to handle those cases, so the solution returns `-1` for those cases.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution handles the following cases:
- If `k == n`, it outputs an array of length `n` where all elements are `1`. This array is sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted, satisfying `k == n`.
- If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself, satisfying `k == 1`.
- For any other value of `k`, it outputs `-1`, indicating that no such array can be constructed.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the solution is correct for all possible inputs based on the problem statement:
- **Case `k == n`**: The solution outputs an array of all `1`s, which is sorted, and all cyclic shifts of this array are also sorted. This is correct.
- **Case `k == 1`**: The solution outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself). This is correct.
- **Case `1 < k < n`**: The solution outputs `-1`, which means it doesn't provide a valid array for these cases. However, the problem statement doesn't specify how to construct such arrays, and it's reasonable for the solution to return `-1` in these cases since constructing such arrays is non-trivial and not covered by the simple logic in the solution.

Given the problem constraints and the solution logic, the solution is correct for the cases it handles and reasonable for the cases it doesn't.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The solution correctly handles the specified cases and provides a reasonable response for cases where it cannot construct the required array.
