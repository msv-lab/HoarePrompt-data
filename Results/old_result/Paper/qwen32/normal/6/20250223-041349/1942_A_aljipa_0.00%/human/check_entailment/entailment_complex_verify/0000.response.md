### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Let's analyze the given code and the problem requirements in detail.

The program currently handles three specific cases:
1. If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones.
2. If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. For any other value of `k`, it outputs `-1`.

However, these cases do not cover all possible valid inputs:
- The case where `k == 1` is not correctly handled. The output `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and all cyclic shifts of this array are also sorted, which means there would be `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `1`.
- The program does not provide a valid solution for cases where `1 < k < n`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `3 2`:
- The program outputs `-1`, but there is a valid solution: `[1, 2, 1]`.
- The cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 1]` are:
  - `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 1, 1]` (not sorted)
  - `[1, 1, 2]` (sorted)
- This array has exactly `2` sorted cyclic shifts, which matches the requirement.

### Additional Analysis:
- For `k == n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones, which is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array of identical elements are sorted.
- For `k == 1`, the program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which is incorrect because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted, resulting in `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `1`.
- For `1 < k < n`, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not cover all possible valid cases and incorrectly outputs `-1` for some cases where a valid array does exist. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
