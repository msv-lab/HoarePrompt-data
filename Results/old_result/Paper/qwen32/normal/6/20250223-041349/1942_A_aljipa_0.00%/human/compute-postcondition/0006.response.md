The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the values read from the input. The values of `t`, `res`, and any other variables not mentioned in the code snippet remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**
