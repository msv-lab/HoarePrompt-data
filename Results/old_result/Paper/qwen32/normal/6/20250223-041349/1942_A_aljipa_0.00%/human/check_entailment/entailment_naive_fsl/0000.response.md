Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Let's analyze the given code and the problem requirements.

The program currently handles three specific cases:
1. If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones.
2. If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. For any other value of `k`, it outputs `-1`.

However, these cases do not cover all possible valid inputs. Specifically:
- The case where `k == 1` is not correctly handled. The output `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and all cyclic shifts of this array are also sorted, which means there would be `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `1`.
- The program does not provide a valid solution for cases where `1 < k < n`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `3 2`:
- The program outputs `-1`, but there is a valid solution: `[1, 2, 1]`.
- The cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 1]` are:
  - `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 1, 1]` (not sorted)
  - `[1, 1, 2]` (sorted)
- This array has exactly `2` sorted cyclic shifts, which matches the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible valid cases and incorrectly outputs `-1` for some cases where a valid array does exist. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
