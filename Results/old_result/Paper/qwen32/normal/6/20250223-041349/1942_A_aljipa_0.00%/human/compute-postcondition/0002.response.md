The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^3, but `n` and `k` are not defined prior to this code execution.

After executing the code, `n` will hold the first integer from the input, and `k` will hold the second integer from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
