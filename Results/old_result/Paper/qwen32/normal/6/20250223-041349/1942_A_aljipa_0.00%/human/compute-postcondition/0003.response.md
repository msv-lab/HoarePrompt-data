Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing `n` ones.
- If `k` equals `1`, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
- If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, `res` is a list containing `-1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
