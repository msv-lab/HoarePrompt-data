To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the code snippet and the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3 - 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`.
   - `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1.
   - `res` is a list containing `-1` otherwise.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the elements of `res` and print them separated by spaces.

3. **Possible Values of `res`:**
   - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`, which will print numbers from 0 to `n-1` separated by spaces.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

Given these conditions, let's describe the output based on the possible values of `k`:

- **If `k == n`:**
  - `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` (a list of `n` ones).
  - Output: **1 1 1 ... 1** (n times)

- **If `k == 1`:**
  - `res` will be `range(0, n)`, which generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Output: **0 1 2 ... n-1**

- **Otherwise:**
  - `res` will be `[-1]`.
  - Output: **-1**

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times) if k == n; 0 1 2 ... n-1 if k == 1; -1 otherwise**
