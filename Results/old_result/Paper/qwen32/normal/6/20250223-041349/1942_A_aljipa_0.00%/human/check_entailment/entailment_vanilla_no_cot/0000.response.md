Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem. Specifically, the logic for generating the array is too simplistic and does not account for the requirement of exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for a given `n`.

Here are the issues with the current implementation:

1. **When `k == n`:** The program outputs an array of all `1`s, which indeed has `n` sorted cyclic shifts. This part is correct.
2. **When `k == 1`:** The program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array). This part is also correct.
3. **When `1 < k < n`:** The program outputs `-1`, indicating no valid array exists. However, there can be valid arrays for these cases. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

To fix the program, we need to handle the case where `1 < k < n` more carefully. One possible way is to construct an array with `k` sorted segments that can be cyclically shifted to produce `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            # Construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
            res = [1] * k + [i for i in range(k + 1, n + 1)] + [2]
        print(*res)

func()
```

In this corrected version, for `1 < k < n`, the array is constructed such that it has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. This is done by placing `k` ones at the beginning, followed by the numbers from `k+1` to `n`, and ending with a `2`. This ensures that the first `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, and the rest are not.
