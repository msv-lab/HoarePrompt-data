Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3 - 1\).
2. `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. `k` is the second integer from the input.
4. `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k` equals `1`, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the elements of `res` and print them separated by spaces.

### Possible Values of `res`:
1. **If `k` equals `n`**:
   - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - The output will be: `1 1 1 1 1`.

2. **If `k` equals `1`**:
   - `res` will be a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `range(0, 5)`, which unpacks to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The output will be: `0 1 2 3 4`.

3. **Otherwise**:
   - `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
   - For example, if `k` is not equal to `n` or `1`, `res` will be `[-1]`.
   - The output will be: `-1`.

### Final Answer:
The output will depend on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `k` equals `n`, the output will be `n` ones separated by spaces.
- If `k` equals `1`, the output will be integers from 0 to `n-1` separated by spaces.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **[n ones separated by spaces] if k equals n, [integers from 0 to n-1 separated by spaces] if k equals 1, or -1 otherwise**
