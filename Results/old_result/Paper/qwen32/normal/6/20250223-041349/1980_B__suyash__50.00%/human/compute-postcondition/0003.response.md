The code snippet takes the string `a`, splits it into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and then maps these integers into a list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are unchanged; `a` is the string provided by the input; `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`.**
