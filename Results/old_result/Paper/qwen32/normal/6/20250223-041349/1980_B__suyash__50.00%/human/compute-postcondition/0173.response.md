Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
2. `i` is assigned the value 2.
3. `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `l`, `i`, or `k` or any other variables. It simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

### Explanation:
- The list `l` and the integer `i` are defined, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The value of `k` is modified by decreasing it by `dic[l[2]]`, but this operation does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the changes to `k` and the values of `l` and `i`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
