Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `k` is set to `k - dic[l[2]]`, where `dic` is a dictionary.
- `dic` is a dictionary.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The value of `i`, `k`, `l`, and `dic` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the string `'NO'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables or objects.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
