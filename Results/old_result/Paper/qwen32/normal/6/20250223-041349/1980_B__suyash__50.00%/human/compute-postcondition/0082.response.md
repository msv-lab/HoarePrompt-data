Postcondition: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the first element of `l` in `dic`, and the current value of `k` is less than or equal to 0; `a` is the new string provided by the input and must contain at least one word; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string `a` by whitespace and sorted in reverse order; `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`; `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order and must have at least one element; `i` is 0; `b` is a list of integers derived from the string `a`.**
