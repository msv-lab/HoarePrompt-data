Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `fav` is set to `l[i]`, which is the first element of the list `l`.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`, where `dic` is presumably a dictionary.
   - The current value of `k` is less than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('MAYBE')`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine what will be printed. The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `l`, `i`, `fav`, `k`, or `dic`. It simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **MAYBE**
