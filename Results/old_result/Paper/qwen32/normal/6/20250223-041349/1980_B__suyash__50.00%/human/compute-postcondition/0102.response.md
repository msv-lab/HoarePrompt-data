Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('MAYBE')` statement is executed.

Let's break down the given information and the code:

1. `t` is an integer provided by the input, where 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
3. `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
4. `a` is a new string provided by the input and contains at least one word.
5. `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string `a` by whitespace and sorted in reverse order.
6. `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`.
7. `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`.
8. `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order and must have at least one element.
9. `i` is 1.
10. `b` is a list of integers derived from the string `a`.
11. `k` is the original value of `k` minus the count of `l[1]` in `dic`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

The `print('MAYBE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `o`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`, `i`, `b`, or `k`. It simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **MAYBE**
