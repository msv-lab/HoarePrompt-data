To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `vals`. The loop iterates over each element in `vals`, applying the function `func_1` to the current value of `den` and the current element `x` from `vals`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50).
- `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive.
- `den` is initialized to `vals[0]`.

In each iteration of the loop:
- `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

After all iterations, `den` will have been updated to the result of applying `func_1` successively to each element in `vals`.

The final output state will be:
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `vals` remains unchanged.
- `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to all elements of `vals` in sequence.

Hence, the final output state is:

Output State: **N is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); vals is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; den is the result of applying func_1 successively to all elements of vals in sequence.**

In simpler terms, `den` will be the final value after processing all elements in the list `vals` through the function `func_1`.
