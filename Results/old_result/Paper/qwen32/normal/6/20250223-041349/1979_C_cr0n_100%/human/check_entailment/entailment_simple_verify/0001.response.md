Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that if any one of the outcomes wins, the total amount received back (multiplied by the respective multiplier `k_i`) is strictly greater than the total amount bet. Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   - This is used to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the bets in such a way that the conditions of the problem are met.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - Calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_1`.
   - Calculates `vprod`, which is the LCM divided by each multiplier. This gives a set of numbers that, when multiplied by their respective multipliers, will sum up to the LCM.
   - Checks if the LCM minus the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If a valid distribution is possible, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets.

### Key Points to Consider

- The LCM of the multipliers is used to ensure that the distribution is valid across all outcomes.
- The condition `den = den - sum(vprod)` checks if there is a surplus after distributing the bets according to `vprod`. If there isn't, it means the distribution isn't valid.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

Let's go through the annotated code to ensure the program behaves as expected:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the list of multipliers (`vals`).

2. **Calculating LCM**:
   - The initial `den` is set to the first multiplier.
   - The program iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier using `func_1`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is calculated as the LCM divided by each multiplier. This ensures that the sum of `vprod[i] * vals[i]` is equal to the LCM.

4. **Checking Validity**:
   - The program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If valid, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements

- **Ensuring Strictly Greater Return**:
  - The sum of bets is `sum(vprod)`.
  - For each winning outcome `i`, the return is `vals[i] * vprod[i]`.
  - Since `vprod[i] * vals[i]` is equal to the LCM, and the sum of all `vprod[i]` is less than the LCM, the condition `sum(vprod) < vals[i] * vprod[i]` is satisfied for all `i`.

- **Checking Validity Condition**:
  - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the sum of bets is strictly less than the LCM, which is the required condition.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the bets using the LCM of the multipliers and ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The annotations and the logic of the program align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
