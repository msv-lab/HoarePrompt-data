### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` adheres to the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each test case, determine the bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet amount `Σx_i` is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome, i.e., `Σx_i < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - If no such distribution exists, output `-1`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - `func_2` is called for each test case. It reads `N` (number of outcomes) and `vals` (multipliers for each outcome).
   - It computes `den` as the least common multiple (LCM) of all `vals`.
   - It computes `vprod` as a list where each element is `den // vals[i]`.
   - It then adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
   - If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The LCM of `vals` ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all `vals`.
   - The computation of `vprod` as `den // vals[i]` ensures that `den >= vals[i] * vprod[i]` for all `i`.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den`, which should leave `den` as a positive value if a valid distribution exists.
   - The check `if (den <= 0)` ensures that if no valid distribution exists, `-1` is printed.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:
- The program does not guarantee that `Σx_i < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. It only ensures that `den >= vals[i] * vprod[i]` and then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. This does not necessarily mean that the sum of `vprod` is less than `k_i * vprod[i]` for all `i`.

### Correctness:
The program does not necessarily guarantee that the sum of bets is less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, the logic is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
