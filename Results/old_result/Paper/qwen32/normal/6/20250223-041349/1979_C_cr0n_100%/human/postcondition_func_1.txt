The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input. It processes these inputs to compute a list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing a computed denominator `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the final `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.
