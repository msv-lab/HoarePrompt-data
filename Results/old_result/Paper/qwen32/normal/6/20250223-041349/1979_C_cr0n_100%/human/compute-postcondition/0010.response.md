The code snippet calculates `vprod` by dividing `den` by each element in the list `vals` and storing the results in a new list. The values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged, but `vprod` is newly created.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence; `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**
