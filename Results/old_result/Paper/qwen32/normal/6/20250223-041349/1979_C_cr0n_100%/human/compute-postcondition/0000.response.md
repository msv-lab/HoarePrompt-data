The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, with a value between 1 and 50. The variable `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, but it is not modified by the provided code snippet.

Given the code snippet, `N` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the input. The list `vals` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals).**
