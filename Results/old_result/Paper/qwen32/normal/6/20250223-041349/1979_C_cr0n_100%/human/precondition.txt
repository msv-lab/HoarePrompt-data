This problem description does not match the provided function definition `def lcm(a, b):`. The correct function definition should be something like `def distribute_bets(test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. Each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
