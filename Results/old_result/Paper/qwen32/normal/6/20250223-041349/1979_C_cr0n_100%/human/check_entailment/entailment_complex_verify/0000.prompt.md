You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import gcd

cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the least common multiple (LCM) of integers 'a' and 'b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns their least common multiple (LCM).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes (1 <= N <= 50), vals is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals).
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); vals is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; den is the result of applying func_1 successively to all elements of vals in sequence.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive; `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence, minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`; `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[N-1]] (where vprod[i] is the integer division of den by vals[i])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input. It processes these inputs to compute a list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing a computed denominator `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the final `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic of how the bets are calculated and distributed. The program attempts to use a least common multiple (LCM) approach to find a common denominator, but this does not guarantee that the bets will satisfy the condition that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Let's analyze the program with a simple example:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
3
3 2 7

Expected Output:
27 41 12  # or any other valid distribution like 1 1 1
```

The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers (3, 2, 7), which is 42. It then calculates the vprod list as [14, 21, 6] (42 divided by each multiplier). The sum of vprod is 41, and the program subtracts this from the LCM to get den = 1. Since den is greater than 0, it prints the vprod list.

However, the sum of the bets (41) is not less than the amount received for the third outcome (7 * 12 = 84), but it is not strictly less than the amount received for the first outcome (3 * 14 = 42) and the second outcome (2 * 21 = 42). The program should ensure that the total bet (41) is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.

The program does not guarantee this condition for all possible inputs, and thus it is incorrect.

**A Correct Approach:**
A correct approach would be to assign the bets in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. One simple way to do this is to assign bets such that the total bet is 1 less than the minimum amount received for any winning outcome. For example, for the multipliers [3, 2, 7], the bets could be [1, 1, 1], which sums to 3, and this is strictly less than 3*1=3, 2*1=2, and 7*1=7, which is not valid. Instead, we can use bets like [1, 1, 1] and adjust them to ensure the condition is met.

Since the provided program does not handle all cases correctly, the program is incorrect.
