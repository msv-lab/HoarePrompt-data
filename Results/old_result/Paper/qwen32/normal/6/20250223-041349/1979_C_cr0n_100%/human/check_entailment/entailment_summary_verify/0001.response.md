### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that if any one outcome wins, the total amount received back is strictly greater than the total amount bet. Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   - This LCM is used to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the bets in such a way that the conditions of the problem are met.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates `vprod`, which is the LCM divided by each multiplier. This gives a set of numbers that, when multiplied by their respective multipliers, will sum up to the LCM.
   - It checks if the LCM minus the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If a valid distribution is possible, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- The program uses the LCM to ensure that for any winning outcome, the amount received will be strictly greater than the total amount bet.
- The condition `den = den - sum(vprod)` checks if there is a surplus after distributing the bets according to `vprod`. If there isn't, it means the distribution isn't valid.

#### Verification:
Let's verify if the logic holds for the given examples and the problem constraints:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `3 2 7`
   - LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`.
   - `vprod` = `[42/3, 42/2, 42/7]` = `[14, 21, 6]`.
   - `den` = `42 - (14 + 21 + 6)` = `1`.
   - Since `den > 0`, the output is valid. Indeed, `3*14 = 42`, `2*21 = 42`, `7*6 = 42`, and the total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `3 3`
   - LCM of `3, 3` is `3`.
   - `vprod` = `[3/3, 3/3]` = `[1, 1]`.
   - `den` = `3 - (1 + 1)` = `1`.
   - Since `den > 0`, the output is valid. Indeed, `3*1 = 3`, `3*1 = 3`, and the total bet is `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `5 5 5 5 5`
   - LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`.
   - `vprod` = `[5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5]` = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - `den` = `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)` = `0`.
   - Since `den <= 0`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - LCM of `7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13` is `32763`.
   - `vprod` = `[32763/7, 32763/9, 32763/3, 32763/17, 32763/9, 32763/13]` = `[4681, 3641, 10921, 1927, 3641, 2519]`.
   - `den` = `32763 - (4681 + 3641 + 10921 + 1927 + 3641 + 2519)` = `1989`.
   - Since `den > 0`, the output is valid. Indeed, `7*4681 = 32767`, `9*3641 = 32769`, `3*10921 = 32763`, `17*1927 = 32759`, `9*3641 = 32769`, `13*2519 = 32747`, and the total bet is `32763`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `6 3 2`
   - LCM of `6, 3, 2` is `6`.
   - `vprod` = `[6/6, 6/3, 6/2]` = `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - `den` = `6 - (1 + 2 + 3)` = `0`.
   - Since `den <= 0`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `9 4 6 8 3`
   - LCM of `9, 4, 6, 8, 3` is `72`.
   - `vprod` = `[72/9, 72/4, 72/6, 72/8, 72/3]` = `[8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`.
   - `den` = `72 - (8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24)` = `1`.
   - Since `den > 0`, the output is valid. Indeed, `9*8 = 72`, `4*18 = 72`, `6*12 = 72`, `8*9 = 72`, `3*24 = 72`, and the total bet is `71`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine a valid distribution of bets. The check `den = den - sum(vprod)` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The function summary aligns with the behavior of the program, and the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
