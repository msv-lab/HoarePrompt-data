The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `vals`. Therefore, only these variables can be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the last element that was processed from the `vals` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `vals` list that has not been processed yet.

Let's denote the current value of `x` as `vals[k]` where `k` is the current index. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list, i.e., `vals[k+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can only say that `x` should be the next element in the list, and `vals` should still contain at least one more element.

State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive and must have at least one more element; `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`; `x` is the next element in `vals`**
