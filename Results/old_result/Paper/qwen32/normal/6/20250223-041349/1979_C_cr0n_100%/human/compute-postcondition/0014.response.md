Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `N` is an integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50).
- `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive.
- `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to all elements of `vals` in sequence, minus the sum of `vprod`.
- `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Code:
```
return
```

Since the code provided is just `return`, it means the function will return `None` by default.

Output State: **The program returns None**.
