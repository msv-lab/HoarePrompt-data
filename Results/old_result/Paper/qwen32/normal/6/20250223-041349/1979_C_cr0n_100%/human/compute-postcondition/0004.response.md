To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the line `den = func_1(den, x)`. However, the function `func_1` has not been defined in the provided code snippet or initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that `den` will be assigned unless we know the behavior of `func_1`.

Since `func_1` is not defined, we can only state that `den` will be assigned the result of `func_1(den, x)`. All other variables (`N` and `vals`) remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code.

Given this information, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive and must have at least one element; `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`**.

In natural language: The value of `den` is now the result of the function `func_1` with `den` and `x` as its arguments. The values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged.
