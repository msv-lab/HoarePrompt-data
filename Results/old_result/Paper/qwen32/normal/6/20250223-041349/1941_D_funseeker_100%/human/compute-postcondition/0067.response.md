The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, and now it will also contain `(q - r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged as per the provided conditions.

Output State: **`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least two values. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` was '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
In simpler terms, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and all other variables remain as they were.
