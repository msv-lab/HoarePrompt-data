To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the `ans` list is modified.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`, `m`, and `x`**: These are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. However, the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, so we can only use the information that `m` is 0.
2. **`ans`**: This list contains results of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration. If `c` is '0', it only contains `(q + r) % n`. Additionally, if `0` was in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.
3. **`r` and `c`**: These are values returned by the last call to `func_1()`. The exact values are not provided.
4. **`temp`**: This is an empty set and does not affect the `ans` list.

### Analysis of `ans`:
- The `ans` list is modified by adding `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0') for each element `q` in the original `ans`.
- If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.

### What is printed:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the modified `ans` list. Since the exact values of `n`, `r`, `c`, and the initial `ans` list are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, we can describe the process and the final length based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The length of `ans` will depend on the number of elements in the original `ans`, the value of `c`, and whether `0` was in the original `ans` list. If `0` was in the original `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added, which means the length of `ans` will remain the same or increase by 1 if `0` was present.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the modified ans list after the described operations)**
