The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Given that `temp` is an empty set, `ans` will also be an empty set after this assignment. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and the precondition that `m > 0` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
