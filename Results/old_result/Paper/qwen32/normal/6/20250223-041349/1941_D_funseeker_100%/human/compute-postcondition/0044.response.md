The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set that includes the element `(q + r) % n` and also includes `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` includes `(q - r) % n`.**

In simpler terms: The set `temp` now includes the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '0' or '?', `temp` also includes `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
