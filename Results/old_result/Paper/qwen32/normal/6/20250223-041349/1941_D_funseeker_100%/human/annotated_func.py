#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns a string read from standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and thus there are no specific preconditions related to the variables in its signature.
def func_2():

    #The program returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1()`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no input parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is generated by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split element into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the initial player with the ball such that 1 <= x <= n.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the set of players who could end up with the ball after a series of throws based on the initial player and the rules of passing the ball. It prints the number of unique players and their sorted list.
