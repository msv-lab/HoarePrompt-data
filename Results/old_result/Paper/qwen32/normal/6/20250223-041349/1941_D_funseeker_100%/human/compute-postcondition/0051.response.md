The code snippet provided is:

```python
temp = set()
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `temp` to be an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
