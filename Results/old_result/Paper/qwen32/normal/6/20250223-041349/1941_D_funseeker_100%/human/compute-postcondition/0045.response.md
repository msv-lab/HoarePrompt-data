Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set that includes the element `(q - r) % n` and also includes `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set that includes the element `(q + r) % n` and also includes `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` includes only `(q - r) % n`.**
