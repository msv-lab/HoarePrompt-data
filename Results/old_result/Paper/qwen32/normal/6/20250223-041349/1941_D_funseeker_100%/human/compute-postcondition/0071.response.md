Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration, `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `m` is 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The variable `ans` will contain all the computed values based on the operations specified by the characters `c` ('0', '1', or '?') and the integer `r` for each iteration. The variables `n` and `x` will retain their values from the last call to `func_3()`. The variable `temp` will be empty at the end of the loop since it is reset at the beginning of each iteration.
