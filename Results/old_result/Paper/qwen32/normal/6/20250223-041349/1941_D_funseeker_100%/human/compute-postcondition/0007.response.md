Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set. The current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'.**
