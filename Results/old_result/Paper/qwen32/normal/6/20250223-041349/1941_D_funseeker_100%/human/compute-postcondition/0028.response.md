The code snippet provided is `temp = set()`. This line of code reassigns the variable `temp` to a new empty set, effectively clearing any previous contents of `temp` (if any) and making it an empty set again. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`; `ans` is an empty set; `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`; `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`; `temp` is an empty set.**
