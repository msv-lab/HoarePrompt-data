The code snippet provided converts the variable `r` to an integer. This change affects the variable `r` while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` and `c` are the split values from the string returned by `func_1()`.

After the code `r = int(r)` is executed, `r` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, where `m` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.**
