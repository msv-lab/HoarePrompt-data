Postcondition: **`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least one value. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. The condition `c == '1' or c == '?'` is true.**
