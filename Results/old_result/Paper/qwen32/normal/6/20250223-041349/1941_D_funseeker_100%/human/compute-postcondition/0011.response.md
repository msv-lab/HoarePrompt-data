The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` already contains the value `(q + r) % n`. After the execution of the code snippet, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`; `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'; `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
