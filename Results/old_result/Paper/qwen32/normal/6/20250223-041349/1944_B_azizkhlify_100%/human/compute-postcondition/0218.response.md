The code snippet `l = [0] * n` creates a new list `l` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. The other variables `a`, `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, and `r` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `r` retain their previous values; `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**
