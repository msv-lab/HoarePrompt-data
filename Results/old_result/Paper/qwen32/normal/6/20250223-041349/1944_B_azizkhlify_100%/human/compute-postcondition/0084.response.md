The code sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Given that `i` is `n` and `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2, after the execution, `r[a[n] - 1]` will be 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` is a non-negative integer still holds.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `r[a[n] - 1]` equals 0.**
