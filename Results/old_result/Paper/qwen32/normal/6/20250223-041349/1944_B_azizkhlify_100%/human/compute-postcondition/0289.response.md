The given initial state only specifies that `res` must contain at least one element. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(i, end=' ')`, which indicates that the variable `i` is being printed. The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i` or its value.

Since the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine an explicit value for `i`. Therefore, the output will depend on the value that `i` holds at the point of execution of the `print` statement.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i at the point of execution)**
