The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition `n` being greater than 0 remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 1 (since `i` is now 1).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` contains `a[0]`**
