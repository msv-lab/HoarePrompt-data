The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n`.

Given the initial state `i` is `n-1`, the loop will start with `i` being set to `n` at the beginning of the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the range `range(n, 2 * n)` is valid and non-empty.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected, starting with `i` being set to `n` in the first iteration.
