Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is a list of `n` integers; `ul` is `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers; `re` is either `k` if the loop broke early, or less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations; `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` if the loop broke early, or up to the last iteration if the loop completed all iterations; `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations, or the value where `ul` reached `k * 2` if the loop broke early. If `k` is zero, then none of the actions within the if block are performed.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`, `ur` remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is either `k` if the loop broke early, or less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations, `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and contains at least one element, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations, or the value where `ul` reached `k * 2` if the loop broke early

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`, `ur` remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is either `k` if the loop broke early, or less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations, `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `res` after the current `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`, `ur` remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is either `k` if the loop broke early, or less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations, `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `res` after the current `i`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
