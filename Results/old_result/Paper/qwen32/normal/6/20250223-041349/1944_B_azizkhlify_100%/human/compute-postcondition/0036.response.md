Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, except if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0; `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `l[a[1] - 1]`.**
