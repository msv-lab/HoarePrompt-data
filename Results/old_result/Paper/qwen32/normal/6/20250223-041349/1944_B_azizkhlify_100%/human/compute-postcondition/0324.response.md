Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, then prints additional unique integers from the first half until `k` unique integers have been printed. If the count of printed pairs from the first half (`ul`) does not match the count of printed pairs from the second half (`ur`), it prints pairs of integers from the second half that appear exactly twice until the counts match.**
