To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Their Relationships:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is defined by `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero if the if condition is true.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `ul` is defined as:
     - `k * 2` if the loop broke early.
     - `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`.
   - `ur` remains unchanged (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `re` is either:
     - `k` if the loop broke early.
     - Less than `k` if the loop completed all iterations.
   - `res` is a list of elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `res` after the current `i`.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`.
   - `i` is an element from the list `res`.
   - `res` contains elements from `a` that appear exactly once in `l`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `res` contains elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in `l`, `i` will be one of these elements.
   - The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Given the information above, the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will be the next element in the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res` followed by a space)**
