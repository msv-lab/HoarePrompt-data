To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, which means `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1. Since `i` is 0, this implies that the element at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

### What We Need to Print:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
Given that `i` is 0, this simplifies to:
```python
print(a[0], end=' ')
```

### Determining the Value of `a[0]`:
From the condition `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1, we know that `a[0] - 1` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 1. Therefore, `a[0]` must be an integer such that when we subtract 1 from it, we get a valid index of `l` where the value is 1.

However, we do not have the exact list `l` or the exact value of `a[0]`. We only know the relationship between `a[0]` and the list `l`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `a[0]` is an integer that, when decremented by 1, gives an index where the list `l` has a value of 1. Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of this relationship.

### Output:
Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is an integer such that l[a[0] - 1] equals 1)**
