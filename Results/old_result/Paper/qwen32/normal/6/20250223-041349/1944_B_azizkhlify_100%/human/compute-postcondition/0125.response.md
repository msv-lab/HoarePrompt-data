The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Given that `i` is initialized to `n`, the specific index being incremented is `a[n] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and the value at `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value at the index `a[n] - 1` in the list `r` has been increased by 1, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
