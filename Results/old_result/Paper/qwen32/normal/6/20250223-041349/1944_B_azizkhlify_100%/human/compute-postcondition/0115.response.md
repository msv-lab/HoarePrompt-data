The given code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. This operation affects the list `l` at the specific index determined by `a[i] - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0

The value of `n` is not directly affected by the code snippet. The list `l` and the list `a` are affected. The value at `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1.**
