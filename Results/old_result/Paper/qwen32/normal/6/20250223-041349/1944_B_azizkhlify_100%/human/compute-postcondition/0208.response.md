The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the variable `ur` by 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `r[a[i] - 1]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `ur` is increased by 2, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2.**
