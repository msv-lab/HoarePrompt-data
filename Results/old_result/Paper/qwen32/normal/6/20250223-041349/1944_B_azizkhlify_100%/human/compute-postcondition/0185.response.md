The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is being iterated over the elements of the list `res`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `res` after `i`.

Given that `i` is the second element in `res` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `res` must contain at least three elements. In the next iteration, `i` will be the third element in `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `res`**
