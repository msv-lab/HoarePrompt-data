To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `n` must be a non-negative integer.
2. `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
3. The element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is equal to 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `a[i]` is not directly provided in the initial state, but we know that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is equal to 2. This tells us something about the relationship between `a[i]` and the list `r`, but it does not give us the exact value of `a[i]` itself.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the given conditions. The output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an element of the list `a` such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2)**
