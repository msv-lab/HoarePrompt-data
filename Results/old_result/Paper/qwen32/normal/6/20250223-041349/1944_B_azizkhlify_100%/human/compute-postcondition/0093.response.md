The value of `ur` is incremented by 2. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0`, and `ur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0`, `ur` is increased by 2**.
