You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, then prints additional unique integers from the first half until `k` unique integers have been printed. If the count of printed pairs from the first half (`ul`) does not match the count of printed pairs from the second half (`ur`), it prints pairs of integers from the second half that appear exactly twice until the counts match.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always produce correct outputs for the problem description. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. The program attempts to construct two arrays `l` and `r` such that their bitwise XOR is equal. However, the current approach does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

2. The program first handles elements that appear exactly twice in the first half and assigns them to `l`. Then, it handles elements that appear exactly once in the first half and assigns them to `l` until the required length is reached. 

3. For the second half, the program handles elements that appear exactly twice and assigns them to `r` until the XOR condition is met.

4. However, the program does not account for the XOR condition while constructing `l` and `r`. It simply tries to match the length of `l` and `r` without ensuring that their XOR values are equal.

5. Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4 2
   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
   ```
   The program might output:
   ```
   1 1 2 2
   1 1 2 2
   ```
   Here, the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0` and the XOR of `r` is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0`, which is correct. However, the program might also output:
   ```
   1 2 3 4
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   Here, the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4` and the XOR of `r` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4`, which is correct. But it might also output:
   ```
   1 2 1 2
   3 4 3 4
   ```
   Here, the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0` and the XOR of `r` is `3 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 0`, which is correct. However, it might also output:
   ```
   1 2 1 2
   3 4 1 2
   ```
   Here, the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0` and the XOR of `r` is `3 ^ 4 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 4`, which is incorrect.

6. The program does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. It only ensures that the lengths of `l` and `r` are equal.

Thus, the program does not always produce correct outputs for the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
