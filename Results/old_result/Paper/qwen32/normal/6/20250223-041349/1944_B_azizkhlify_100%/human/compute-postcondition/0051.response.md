The code snippet provided appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and `re` is incremented by 1. These conditions remain unchanged except for the modification of the `res` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is incremented by 1, and `res` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.**
