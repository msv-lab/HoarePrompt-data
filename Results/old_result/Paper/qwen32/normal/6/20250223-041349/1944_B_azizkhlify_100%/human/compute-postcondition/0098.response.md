To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet carefully.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `n + 2`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list, but its contents are not explicitly provided.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `i` is at least 2 (when `n` is 0) and can be any integer greater than or equal to 2.
   
2. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is not explicitly provided, so we don't know its exact contents. However, we know that `a[i]` must be a valid index in the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is at least 2, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements (indices 0, 1, and 2).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
Given that `i` is `n + 2` and `a[i]` is an element in the list `a`, the `print` statement will output the value at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is n + 2 and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
