Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `res` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` is true, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `a[i]` is appended to `res`. The execution then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of `t`, `n`, `re`, `res`, and `a` remain as per their previous states except for the changes mentioned.
