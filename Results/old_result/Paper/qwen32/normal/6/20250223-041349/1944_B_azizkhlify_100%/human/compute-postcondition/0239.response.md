The code snippet changes the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` from 2 to 0. The other variables (`n` and the other elements of `l` and `a`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `l[a[i] - 1]` initially equals 2 is still valid, except that `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**
