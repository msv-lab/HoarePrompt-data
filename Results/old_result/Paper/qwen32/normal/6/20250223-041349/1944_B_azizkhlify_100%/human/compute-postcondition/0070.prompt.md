Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is non-zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, with some elements set to 0 if the corresponding number in `a` had a count of 2; `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke early, or `2 * count` if the loop completed all iterations, where `count` is the number of times a number with a count of 2 was found in `l`; `ur` remains unchanged; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations, or the value where `ul` reached `k * 2` if the loop broke early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0. If `re` equals `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `res` includes all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 up to the point where `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `re` equals `k`, then `re` is updated to `k + 1` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `re` is incremented by 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `res` includes `a[i]`. Otherwise, `re` remains unchanged and `res` does not include `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
