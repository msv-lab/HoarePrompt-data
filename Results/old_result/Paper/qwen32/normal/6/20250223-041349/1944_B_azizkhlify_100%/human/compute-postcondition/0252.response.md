The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged, `ul` remains unchanged**
