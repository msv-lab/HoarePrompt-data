To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `n` is a non-negative integer.
2. `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2.
3. `a` is a list of integers.
4. `i` is set to `n + 2`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The value of `n` is not explicitly provided, but it is a non-negative integer.
- The list `r` is defined based on the values in list `a`, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
- The list `a` contains integers, and `i` is calculated as `n + 2`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

- The print statement attempts to access `a[i]` twice.
- `i` is defined as `n + 2`.

### Potential Issues:
- The value of `i` is `n + 2`. If `n` is very small (e.g., 0 or 1), `i` might be out of bounds for the list `a`.
- If `n` is such that `n + 2` is within the bounds of the list `a`, the print statement will output the value at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will attempt to print the value at index `i` of the list `a` twice, where `i` is `n + 2`. However, without knowing the exact value of `n` and the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be printed.

### Output:
Output: **a[n + 2], a[n + 2] (where `a[n + 2]` is the value at index `n + 2` of the list `a`)**
