Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `ul` is not equal to `ur` + 2, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `ur` has been increased by 2. The other conditions remain unchanged: `n` is still a non-negative integer, `ul` is no longer equal to `ur` (it is now `ur + 2` less than `ul`), and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is still 0.
