The only variable in the loop head is `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `remainder_steps` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, `remainder_steps` must be set to a value greater than 0.

State: **`cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`, `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps in the permutation, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` must be greater than 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
