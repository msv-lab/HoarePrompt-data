The code snippet calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. Since `remaining_steps` is initially 0, the result of this operation will also be 0.

Output State: **`cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps, `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps in the permutation, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is 0**.
