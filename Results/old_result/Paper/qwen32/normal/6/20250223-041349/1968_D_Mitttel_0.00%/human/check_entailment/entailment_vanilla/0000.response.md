Reasoning:

The given program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. Let's break down each part to see if they correctly implement the solution to the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `calculate_score` to compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It then compares the scores and returns "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are the same.
   - The function seems to be correctly structured to handle the comparison of scores.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0 and `current_pos` to `start_pos`.
   - It keeps track of visited positions and the number of steps taken.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The function correctly handles the situation when the player enters a cycle and needs to calculate the score for multiple cycles plus any remaining steps.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the number of steps is less than `k` and the player does not enter a cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
   - It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function correctly handles the input reading and output printing.

The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all the cases described in the problem, including detecting cycles, calculating scores for cycles, and handling the remaining steps after cycles are considered. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
