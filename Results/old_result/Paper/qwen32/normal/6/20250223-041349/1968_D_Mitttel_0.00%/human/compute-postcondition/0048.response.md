To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the provided initial state.

1. **Variables and Their Initial States**:
   - `data`: A list of strings.
   - `n`: The integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `k`: The integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `PB`: The integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
   - `PS`: The integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
   - `p`: A list of `n` integers representing the permutation.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers representing the array.
   - `input`: Assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
   - `index`: The final value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `t`: Initialized to 0.
   - `results`: A list containing at least three values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - `result`: The third value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the `results` list.

2. **Understanding the `result` Variable**:
   - The `result` variable is specifically defined as the third element of the `results` list.
   - The `results` list contains values returned from the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

3. **Output of `print(result)`**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the third value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Since the specific implementation and return values of `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's behavior as per the given information.

Therefore, the output will be the third value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Output: **result (where result is the third value returned by func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a))**
