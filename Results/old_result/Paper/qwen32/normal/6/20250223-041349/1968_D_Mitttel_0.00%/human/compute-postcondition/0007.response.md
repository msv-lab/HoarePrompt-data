The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` converts the element at the position `index` in the list `data` to an integer and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns; `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 1; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
