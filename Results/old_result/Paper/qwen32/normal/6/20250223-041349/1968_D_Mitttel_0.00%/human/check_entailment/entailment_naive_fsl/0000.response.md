Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that violate the problem description. Let's analyze the code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function is supposed to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha and determine the winner. However, it calls `calculate_score` without passing the necessary parameters `n`, `k`, `p`, and `a`. This will cause an error because `calculate_score` relies on these parameters to compute the scores correctly.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
    - This function is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It correctly handles the cycle detection and scoring logic. However, it assumes that `k` is a global variable, which it is not. It should take `k`, `p`, and `a` as parameters.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the input and processes each test case. It correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, `func_1` is not correctly defined to handle the required parameters.

### Issues:
- The `calculate_score` function should be modified to accept `k`, `p`, and `a` as parameters.
- The `func_1` function should pass these parameters to `calculate_score`.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score

def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly pass the necessary parameters to the `calculate_score` function, which means it will not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
