Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns; `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which was previously a string. All other variables retain their initial values.
