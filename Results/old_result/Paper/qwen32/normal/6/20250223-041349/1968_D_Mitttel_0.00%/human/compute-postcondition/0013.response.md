The code snippet increments the variable `index` by the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `index` was initially 5, after the operation `index += n`, the new value of `index` will be `5 + n`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[5:5 + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 5 + n; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
