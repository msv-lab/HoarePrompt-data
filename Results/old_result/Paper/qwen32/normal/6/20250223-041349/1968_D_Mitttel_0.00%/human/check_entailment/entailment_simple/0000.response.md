### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by simulating the game for both players, Bodya and Sasha, and calculating their scores based on the rules described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - It handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input and collecting the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` with their respective starting positions.
   - It compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering full cycles and the remaining steps after the cycles.

The logic for detecting cycles and calculating scores is crucial for handling large values of `k` efficiently. The code correctly handles the following scenarios:
- **No cycles**: It simply adds the scores for the first `k` steps.
- **Cycles**: It calculates the score for the steps leading to the cycle, then adds the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps after the cycles.

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the edge cases, such as cycles in the permutation and large values of `k`.

### Correctness: **True**

The code correctly simulates the game and calculates the scores for both players, handling cycles and large values of `k` efficiently. It also correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result for each test case.
