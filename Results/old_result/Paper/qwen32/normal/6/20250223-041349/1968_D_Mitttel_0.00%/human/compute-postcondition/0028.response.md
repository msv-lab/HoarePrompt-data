The code snippet provided is:

```python
result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
```

This line of code assigns the value returned by the function `func_1` with arguments `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` to the variable `result`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are already defined. The function `func_1` is called with these variables, and its return value is stored in `result`.

The other variables (`data`, `input`, `index`, `t`, `results`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 4*n + 4`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `result` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
