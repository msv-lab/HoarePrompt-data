Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing all values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the last value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the `results` list.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain all the values returned by `func_1` for each iteration. The `result` variable will hold the last value from this list. All other variables like `data`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `input`, `index`, and `t` remain unchanged from their last state in the loop.
