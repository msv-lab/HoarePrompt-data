The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `k` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. 

Given the initial state, `index` is defined as `5 + 2*n`. Therefore, `k` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n + 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2*n + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[5:5 + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 2*n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
