The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `remainder_steps`. For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1.

Given the information, the state needs to be adjusted only for `remainder_steps`.

State: **`cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1**.

To clearly indicate the change:
State: **`cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 and is now `remainder_steps - 1`**.
