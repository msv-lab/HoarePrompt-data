You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with these parameters and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. Let's break down each part to see if they correctly implement the solution to the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `calculate_score` to compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It then compares the scores and returns "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are the same.
   - The function seems to be correctly structured to handle the comparison of scores.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0 and `current_pos` to `start_pos`.
   - It keeps track of visited positions and the number of steps taken.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The function correctly handles the situation when the player enters a cycle and needs to calculate the score for multiple cycles plus any remaining steps.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the number of steps is less than `k` and the player does not enter a cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
   - It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function correctly handles the input reading and output printing.

The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all the cases described in the problem, including detecting cycles, calculating scores for cycles, and handling the remaining steps after cycles are considered. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
