Functionality: **The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`, which is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation. The function calculates and returns a `score` based on the values in the array `a` starting from `start_pos`. The score is computed by summing the values of `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps. If a cycle is detected (i.e., `cycle_start` is not equal to -1), the score is adjusted by adding the value of `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for the `remainder_steps` iterations.**
