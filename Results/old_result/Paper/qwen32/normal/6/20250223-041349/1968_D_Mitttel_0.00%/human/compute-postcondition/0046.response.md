To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement executes, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Analysis of the Initial State

1. **`data`**: A list of strings.
2. **`n`**: The integer value of `data[index]`.
3. **`k`**: The integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
4. **`PB`**: The integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
5. **`PS`**: The integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
6. **`p`**: A list of `n` integers representing a permutation.
7. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers representing an array.
8. **`input`**: Assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function (not directly relevant to the print statement).
9. **`index`**: The final value after all iterations of the loop.
10. **`t`**: Initialized to 0.
11. **`results`**: A list containing at least two values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
12. **`result`**: The second value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the `results` list.

### Key Points to Consider

- The `result` variable is specifically the second value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
- The exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `result`.
- However, we know that `result` is derived from the function `func_1` and its computation is based on the provided parameters.

### Conclusion

Given the information, the `print(result)` statement will output the second value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the specific parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.

Output: **result (where result is the second value returned by func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a))**
