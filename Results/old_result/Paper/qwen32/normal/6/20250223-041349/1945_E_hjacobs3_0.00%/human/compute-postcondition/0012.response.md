Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`. `l` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`. `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, which is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `r`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
