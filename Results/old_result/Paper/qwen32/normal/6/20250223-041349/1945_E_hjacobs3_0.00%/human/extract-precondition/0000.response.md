Precondition: **array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found using a modified binary search algorithm. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, and the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
