The code calculates the middle index `mid` of the current search range defined by `l` and `r`. Given `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the new value of `mid` will be `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`**.
