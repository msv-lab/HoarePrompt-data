Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to perform at most two swaps to make the binary search algorithm find the number `x` at the correct position. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The binary search should be implemented as described in the problem statement, with the loop condition `while l < r` and the correct assignment of `l` and `r` based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `x`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**:
   The code only attempts to perform one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. However, the problem allows up to two swaps, and the code does not explore the possibility of using two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format**:
   The output format of the swaps is incorrect. The problem requires the output of the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. The current code prints `1` and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   The code does not handle edge cases where `x` is already at the correct position or where `x` needs to be moved to the correct position using two swaps.

Here is a counterexample where the code does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1 3
```

In this case, the code only performs one swap, but it requires two swaps to make the binary search find `3` at the correct position. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
