Output State: **The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is either equal to `j` or `i` is greater than `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue to compare elements from the start and end of the array, moving towards the center, as long as the elements at those positions are equal. If all compared elements are equal, the loop ends with `i` and `j` pointing to the middle of the array (or just beyond it if the array has an even number of elements). If any pair of elements differ, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will indicate the first pair of differing elements.
