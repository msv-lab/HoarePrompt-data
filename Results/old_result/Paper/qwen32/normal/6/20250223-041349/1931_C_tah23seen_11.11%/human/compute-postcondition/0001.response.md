The code assigns the variable `j` the value of `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `arr`. The other variables, `arr`, `n`, `t`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
