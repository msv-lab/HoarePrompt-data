The `while` loop in question is `while i <= j:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

In the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \).
- The length of `arr` is `n`.
- `t` test cases, with the sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `i` is set to 0 and `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The condition `i <= j` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, the variables `i` and `j` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Analysis:
- If `i` is less than `j`, the loop will execute again without any changes needed.
- If `i` equals `j`, the loop will also execute again as `i <= j` is still true.
- If `i` is greater than `j`, the loop will not execute again, so we need to adjust either `i` or `j` to make `i <= j`.

### Adjustment:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is not greater than `j`. The simplest way to do this is to ensure `i` is equal to `j` or less than `j`. If `i` is greater than `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can adjust `i` to be equal to `j`.

### Conclusion:
If `i` is greater than `j`, we adjust `i` to be equal to `j`. Otherwise, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. `i` must still be less than or equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `j`, adjust `i` to be equal to `j`.**
