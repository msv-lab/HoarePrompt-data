Postcondition: **The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is greater than `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will have crossed each other, indicating that the array is symmetric up to the point where they would have met. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ, with `i` being greater than `j`.**
