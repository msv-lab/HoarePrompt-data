The only condition in the loop head is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, this condition must be true after the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`
- `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`
- `i` is increased by 2

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, after the increment of `i` by 2, `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. After the loop body, `i` becomes `i_prev + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `arr[i_prev + 2]` must be equal to `arr[i_prev + 3]`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that after `i` is increased by 2, the new `arr[i]` (which is `arr[i_prev + 2]`) is equal to the new `arr[i + 1]` (which is `arr[i_prev + 3]`).

State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `arr[i + 2]` is equal to `arr[i + 3]`; `i` is increased by 2**
