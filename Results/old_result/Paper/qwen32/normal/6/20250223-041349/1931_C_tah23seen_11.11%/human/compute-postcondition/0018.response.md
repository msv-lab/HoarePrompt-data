Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0 and `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. `i` must still be less than or equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `j`, `i` is adjusted to be equal to `j`.**
