Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is either equal to `j` or `i` is greater than `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is equal to `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns 2
    #State: `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`. `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns 0 if the entire list is a palindrome, 1 if the list has a single mismatch at the end, and 2 if there is a mismatch that is not at the end.
