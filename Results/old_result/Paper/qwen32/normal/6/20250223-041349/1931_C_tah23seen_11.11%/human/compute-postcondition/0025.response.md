The variables in the loop head are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust these variables so that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` remains true after the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]` after `i` is incremented.

State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `i` is increased by 1**

This ensures that after `i` is incremented, `arr[i]` will still be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
