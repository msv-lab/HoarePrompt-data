Output State: **`lst[x]` contains all elements except the last one that was removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `x` is now equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The list `lst[x]` still contains all the elements except the last one that was removed. The variable `y` still holds the value of the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`. The variable `x` is now equal to the value of `y`. No further changes occur to these variables, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
