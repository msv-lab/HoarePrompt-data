Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[x]` contains one less element than before, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to be the same as `y`. No other variables are affected by this operation.
