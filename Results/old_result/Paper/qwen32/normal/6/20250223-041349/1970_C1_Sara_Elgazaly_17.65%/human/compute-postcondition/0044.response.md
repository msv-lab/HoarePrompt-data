Output State: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element if it was at index 3], ...]`; `y` is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed; `x` is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` has been updated to be the same as `y`, which is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
