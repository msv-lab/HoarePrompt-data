Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a` along with its previous values for all `x-1` iterations, and `_` is incremented to `x-1`. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration. `s` is True.**

Explanation: The only change is that the variable `s` has been assigned the value `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
