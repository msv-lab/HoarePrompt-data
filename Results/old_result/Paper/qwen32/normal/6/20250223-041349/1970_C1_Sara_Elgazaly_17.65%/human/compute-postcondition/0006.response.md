The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `x - 1` times. Since `_` does not retain any state between iterations, we only need to adjust the loop counter to reflect the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs for `x - 1` iterations, at the start of each iteration, the loop counter `_` is implicitly incremented by 1. Therefore, we do not need to explicitly modify `_` in the state description, as it is controlled by the loop itself.

However, since the task specifies that we need to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, we should acknowledge that `x` remains unchanged, and the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `x - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a`. `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
