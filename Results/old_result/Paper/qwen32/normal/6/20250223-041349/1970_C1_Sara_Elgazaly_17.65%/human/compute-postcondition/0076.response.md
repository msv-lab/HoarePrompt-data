Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, and a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. Additionally, the function accepts a list of `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. The function returns a value based on the starting node and the structure of the tree.**
