In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` must be a positive integer**
