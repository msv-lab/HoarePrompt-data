Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the program has read two integers `n` and `k`. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the program has printed either "YES" followed by two integers, or "NO". The conditions for printing "YES" and the specific integers printed remain the same as described in the initial states. The variables `n` and `k` are updated with new values from the input at the start of each iteration, and `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)`. For each pair, it will have printed either "YES" followed by two specific integers or "NO" based on the conditions provided. The values of `n` and `k` will have been updated with each new pair read from the input, and `t` will remain unchanged as it only specifies the number of iterations.
