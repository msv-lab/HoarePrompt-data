The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

The initial state provides some conditions about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`:
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is satisfied.

However, none of these conditions directly affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` and will always output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
