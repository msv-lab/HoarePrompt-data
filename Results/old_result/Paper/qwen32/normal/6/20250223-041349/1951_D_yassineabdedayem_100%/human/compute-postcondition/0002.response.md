The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^18. After the execution of the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, and `t` must be a positive integer.**
