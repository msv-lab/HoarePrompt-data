The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and it is specified that `n` is equal to `k`.
- `t` is a positive integer, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`, we do not need to consider the values of `n`, `k`, or `t` for determining the output.

Output: **YES**
