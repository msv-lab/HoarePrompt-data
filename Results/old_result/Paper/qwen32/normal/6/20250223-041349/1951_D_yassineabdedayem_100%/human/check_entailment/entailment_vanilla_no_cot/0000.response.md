Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. It only handles a few specific cases and does not consider the general scenario where Bob needs to set up multiple stalls with varying prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program should be able to handle cases where `k` is much larger and requires a combination of prices across multiple stalls.

Here are some issues with the current program:
1. It only checks if `n == k` or if `n + 2 > k * 2`. These conditions are not sufficient to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls correctly.
2. It doesn't consider the possibility of using more than two stalls.
3. It doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the stalls with appropriate prices.

A correct solution would involve finding a way to partition `k` into at most 60 parts, each representing the number of jewels Alice buys at each stall, and setting the prices accordingly. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to set up the stalls with decreasing prices, ensuring that Alice buys the exact number of jewels needed.
