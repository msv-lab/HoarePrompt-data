The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer.**
