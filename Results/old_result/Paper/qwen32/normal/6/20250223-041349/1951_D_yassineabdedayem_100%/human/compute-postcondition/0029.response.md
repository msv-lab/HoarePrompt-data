The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop head does not depend on `n`, `k`, or `t` directly for its iteration. The loop will execute `t` times, and each iteration is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Given that the loop head does not involve `n`, `k`, or `t` in a way that requires modification, the state of `n`, `k`, and `t` remains unchanged for each iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k`. Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
