Let's analyze the given initial state and code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
2. `t` is a positive integer (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
3. There are three conditions based on the values of `n` and `k`:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k` (this condition doesn't change the value of `n`).
   - Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the output is hardcoded to be `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
