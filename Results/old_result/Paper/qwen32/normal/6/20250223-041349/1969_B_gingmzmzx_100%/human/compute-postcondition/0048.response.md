To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the calculations that determine the value of `ans`. However, the initial state provided does not explicitly define how `ans` is calculated. It merely states that `ans` is the sum of specific counts. Without the exact formula or additional context, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its definition.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` reflects the total count of `0`s and `1`s.
- `ans` is the sum of specific counts as described.

Since the exact calculation of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` itself.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of specific counts as described)**
