Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `c` is not 0.**
