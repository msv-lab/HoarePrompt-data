The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` will increment `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list with two elements, and `ans` is a variable that could be 0 or the count of zeroes in the list `s` depending on the value of `c`.

- If `cnt[1] > 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt[1] == 0`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
