The given code snippet initializes a list `cnt` with two zeros. The initial state of other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes`) is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`.**
