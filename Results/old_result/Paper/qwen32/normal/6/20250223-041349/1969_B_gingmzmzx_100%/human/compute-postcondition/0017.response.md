Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one more element after the current `c`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `ans + zeroes` if `c` is not 0, and `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - 2)` if `c` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables `ans` based on whether `c` is 0 or not, while keeping the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and the updated `c`) consistent with their descriptions in the precondition.
