Given the initial state, the code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. 

Here are the detailed changes:
- `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, which means if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will increase by 1, and if `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will increase by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
