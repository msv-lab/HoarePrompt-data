The code snippet provided sets `ans` to `0`. The other variables (`cnt`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input, `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`.**
