Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `n` is assigned the value of `t`. Each of the following `t` lines contains a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 2 · 10^5; `s_i` ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted. The sum of the lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` has been assigned the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints regarding the test cases and the binary strings remain unchanged.
