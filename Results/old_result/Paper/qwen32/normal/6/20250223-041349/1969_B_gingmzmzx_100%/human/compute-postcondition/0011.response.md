The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Since `cnt[0]` was incremented by 1, the value of `ans` will be adjusted accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with `cnt[0]` incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**
