Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `n` is assigned the value of `t`. Each of the following `t` lines contains a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 2 · 10^5; `s_i` ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted. The sum of the lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[total number of 0s in s, total number of 1s in s]`, and `ans` is the sum of `1` for each `0` encountered after at least one `1` and `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each `1` encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` reflects the total count of `0`s and `1`s, `ans` is the sum of specific counts as described, and other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cnt is [number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s], ans is the computed sum as described, zeroes is the count of 0s in s.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
