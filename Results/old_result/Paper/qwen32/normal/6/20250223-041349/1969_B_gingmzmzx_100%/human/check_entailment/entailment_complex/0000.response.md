### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program calculates the number of inversions in each binary string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the string. However, the problem specifies that the cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of swaps.

The program does not correctly calculate the cost of operations according to the problem's definition. Instead, it calculates the number of inversions, which is a different metric. The number of inversions gives the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to sort the array, but each operation can shift any substring, not just adjacent elements, and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

### Example:
For the binary string "101011":
- The number of inversions is 5.
- However, the minimum cost to sort it using the allowed operations is 5, but this cost is derived from a different sequence of operations, not just counting inversions.

The program does not take into account the specific cost structure defined in the problem (cost = length of the substring shifted). Therefore, it does not solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it calculates the number of inversions instead of the minimum cost based on the allowed operations and their costs.

**Correctness: False**
