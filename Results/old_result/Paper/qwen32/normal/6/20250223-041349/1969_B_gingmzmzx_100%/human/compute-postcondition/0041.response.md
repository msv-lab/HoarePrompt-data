Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that if `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]`, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0. `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
