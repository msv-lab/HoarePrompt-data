The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 0]` depending on the value of `c`. Since `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `s` is a list of integers, `c` can be either 0 or 1.

If `c` is 0:
- `cnt` was `[1, 0]`.
- After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[2, 0]`.

If `c` is 1:
- `cnt` was `[0, 0]`.
- After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one more element after the current `c`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `c` is not 0. `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
