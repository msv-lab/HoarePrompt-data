The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is unchanged (meaning it has not been incremented yet in this example, so it still holds the value from the previous iteration).
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, but since `g` is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `l` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `l` will still be a list with at least one element.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**
