The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the variable `sumo` by the integer value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `sumo` is initially 0. After executing the code, `sumo` becomes `sumo + a[i]`, which is `0 + a[i]` or simply `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the original list `a`, `sumo` is `a[i]`, `i` is not yet initialized.**

However, since `i` is not initialized in the initial state and the code references `a[i]`, there is an implicit assumption that `i` is initialized to some valid index before this code is executed. Assuming `i` is properly initialized to a valid index, the output state would be as described above. If `i` is not initialized, the code would result in an error. For the sake of this task, we assume `i` is correctly initialized.
