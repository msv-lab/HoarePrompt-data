Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers as input by the user with the first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list separated by spaces, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
