The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The `print` function in Python outputs the specified value to the console. In this case, the value to be printed is `-1`.

The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print(-1)` statement. Therefore, the value of `-1` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print(-1)` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
