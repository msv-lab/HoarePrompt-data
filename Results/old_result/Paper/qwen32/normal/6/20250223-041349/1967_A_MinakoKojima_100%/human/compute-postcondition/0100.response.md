The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The values of `i` and `dif` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; `res` is `res - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; `res` is `res - 1`**.
