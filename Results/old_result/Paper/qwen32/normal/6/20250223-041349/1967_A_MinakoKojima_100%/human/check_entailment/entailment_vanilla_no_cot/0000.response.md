Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score based on the problem description. The logic for distributing the additional cards and calculating the number of valid subarrays is flawed.

Here are a few issues with the program:
1. The program sorts the list of card counts (`a.sort()`), but this does not align with the optimal strategy for maximizing the number of valid subarrays.
2. The logic for distributing the additional cards (`k`) is incorrect. The program attempts to balance the counts of each card type by adding cards to the smallest counts first, but it does not correctly account for the resulting permutations.
3. The final calculation for the score (`ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`) is incorrect and does not properly account for the number of valid subarrays.

A correct approach would involve determining the minimum number of cards needed to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` and then distributing the additional cards in a way that maximizes the number of such permutations. This typically involves using a greedy strategy to balance the counts of each card type as evenly as possible.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.
