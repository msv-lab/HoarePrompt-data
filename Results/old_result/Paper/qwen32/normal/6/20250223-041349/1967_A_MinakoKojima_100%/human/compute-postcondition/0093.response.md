Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` remains `a[0]`. `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `k` is set to 0. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element in both cases. `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0.**
