Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] + dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was true before entering the if condition, otherwise `ans` remains `a[0]`. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was true before entering the if condition, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element. `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `dif` is not 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
