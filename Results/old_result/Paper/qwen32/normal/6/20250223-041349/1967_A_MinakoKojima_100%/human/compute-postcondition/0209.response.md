The only object in the loop head is the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans_list`. If `ans_list` has more than one element, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must contain at least two elements, and `a` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least two elements**
