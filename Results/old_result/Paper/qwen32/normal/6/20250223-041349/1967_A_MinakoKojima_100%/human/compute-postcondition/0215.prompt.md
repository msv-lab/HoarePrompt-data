You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), representing the number of cards of each type initially. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = a[0]
        
        res = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        
        ans += res
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State: ans_list contains the final calculated `ans` values for each test case.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: the loop will print each element in `ans_list` until all elements are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type initially. For each test case, the function returns the result of some computation based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list of card counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
