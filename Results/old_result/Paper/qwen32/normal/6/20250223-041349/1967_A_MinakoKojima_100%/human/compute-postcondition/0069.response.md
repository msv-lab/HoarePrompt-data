Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k` plus `k // n` if `k` is not `0`, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, plus `res`; `k` is not `0` if it was adjusted by `k // n`, otherwise it remains `0`; `res` is the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0` plus `k % n` if `k` is not `0`. Otherwise, `res` remains the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0`; `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and `ans_list` now includes `ans` as its last element.
