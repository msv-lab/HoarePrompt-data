The code snippet provided modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `k // (i + 1)`. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` are not directly modified by this line of code, but their conditions and values from the initial state remain relevant.

Given:
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`
- If `dif` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1

The code snippet:
```
ans += k // (i + 1)
```
Updates `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` is increased by the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` remain as per their initial state conditions.
