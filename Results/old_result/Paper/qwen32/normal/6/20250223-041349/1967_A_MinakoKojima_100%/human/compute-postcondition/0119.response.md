The value of `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. The values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`, `res` is decreased by 1 if `dif` was 0 before this line, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`**.
