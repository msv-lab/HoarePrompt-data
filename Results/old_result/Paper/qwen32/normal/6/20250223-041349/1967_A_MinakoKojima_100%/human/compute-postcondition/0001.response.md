The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value for the number of test cases is greater than 0.

State: **`t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0**
