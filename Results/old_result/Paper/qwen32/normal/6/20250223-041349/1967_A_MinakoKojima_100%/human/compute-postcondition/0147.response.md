The value of `res` is decremented by 1. Initially, `res` is `n - 1`. After the decrement, `res` becomes `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 2`, `ans_list` includes `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `dif` equals 0**.
