The provided Python code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of the other variables (`b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless they depend on the contents of `a` or `b`, which they do not in this snippet.

Since `a` is modified by adding an element, its state changes, and if `a` was previously empty, it is no longer empty. The value of `x` is dependent on the contents of `a`, and since `a` has been modified, `x` will now be the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element being `lit[i]`; `b` is either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
