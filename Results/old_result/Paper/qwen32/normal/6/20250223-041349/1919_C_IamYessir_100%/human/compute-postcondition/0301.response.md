Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `b` includes the element `lit[2]` appended to it.**
