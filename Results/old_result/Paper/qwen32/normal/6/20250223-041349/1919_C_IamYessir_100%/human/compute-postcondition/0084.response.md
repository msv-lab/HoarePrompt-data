The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. Since `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state, the element at index `i + 2` of `lit` is appended to `a`.

The value of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation, as they are determined based on the last elements of `lit` and `b` respectively, and `i` has no direct impact on their values.

The value of `cp` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.

The value of `lit` remains unchanged as appending an element from `lit` to `a` does not modify `lit`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.**
