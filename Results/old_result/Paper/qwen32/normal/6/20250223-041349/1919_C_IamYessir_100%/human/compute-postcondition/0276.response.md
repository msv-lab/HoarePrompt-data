Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, and `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is such that `x < lit[i] <= y`, and `y >= lit[i] > x`.**

In simpler terms: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity. The current `lit[i]` satisfies `x < lit[i] <= y` and `y >= lit[i] > x`.**
