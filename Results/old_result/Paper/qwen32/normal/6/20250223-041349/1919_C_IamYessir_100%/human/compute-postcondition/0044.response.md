Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. Since the else part is not defined, the conditions described in the if part are the only possible outcomes.**
