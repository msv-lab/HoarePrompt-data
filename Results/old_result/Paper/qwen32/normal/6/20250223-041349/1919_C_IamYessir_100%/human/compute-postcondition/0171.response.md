The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. Given that `b` is either an empty list or not, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` will be the last element of `b`.
2. If `b` is an empty list, this code will raise an `IndexError` because you cannot access the last element of an empty list.

However, the problem statement does not specify how to handle the case where `b` is empty. Therefore, we will assume that `b` is not empty based on the provided code snippet.

Thus, the variable `y` will be assigned the last element of `b` without changing the values of other variables. The values of `a`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`**.
