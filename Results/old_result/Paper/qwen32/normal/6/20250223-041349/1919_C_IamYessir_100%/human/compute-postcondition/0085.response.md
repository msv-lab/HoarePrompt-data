The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will gain one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are also not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
