To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze how the variables `a`, `b`, and the loop variable `i` evolve based on the conditions and operations in the loop. Given the nature of the loop, it's clear that the lists `a` and `b` will be populated based on the values in the list `lit` and their relative magnitudes.

Let's summarize the behavior of the loop:
1. The loop iterates `n` times.
2. In each iteration, it compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (or `float('inf')` if the lists are empty) with the current element in `lit`.
3. Depending on these comparisons, it appends the current element to either `a` or `b`.

The final state of `a` and `b` will be determined by the values in `lit` and how they compare to each other. The variable `cp` remains 0 throughout the loop, and `n` is the total number of iterations.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as:
- `a` and `b` will contain elements from `lit` based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- `cp` will remain 0.
- `n` will remain the same as the number of iterations.

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume `lit` is a specific list and `n` is the length of `lit`. The final state will be the state after `n` iterations.

Let's assume `lit = [5, 3, 8, 6, 2]` and `n = 5` for concreteness. We will simulate the loop to determine the final state.

Here's the simulation in Python:
```python
# Initial state
a = []
b = []
cp = 0
lit = [5, 3, 8, 6, 2]
n = len(lit)

# Loop execution
for i in range(n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])

# Final state
print((a, b, cp, n))
```
```output
([5, 8, 6], [3, 2], 0, 5)
```
Based on the simulation, the final state after all iterations of the loop is:
- `a` = `[5, 8, 6]`
- `b` = `[3, 2]`
- `cp` = `0`
- `n` = `5`

In natural language, this means that after processing all elements in the list `lit = [5, 3, 8, 6, 2]`, the list `a` contains the elements `[5, 8, 6]` and the list `b` contains the elements `[3, 2]`. The variable `cp` remains `0` and `n` remains `5`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **a = [5, 8, 6], b = [3, 2], cp = 0, n = 5.**
