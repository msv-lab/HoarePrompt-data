The code snippet assigns the variable `x` the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). The values of `a`, `b`, `cp`, and `n` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is still 0, and `n` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity.**
