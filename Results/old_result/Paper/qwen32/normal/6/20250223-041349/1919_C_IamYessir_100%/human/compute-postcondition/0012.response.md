The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `float('inf')`.**
