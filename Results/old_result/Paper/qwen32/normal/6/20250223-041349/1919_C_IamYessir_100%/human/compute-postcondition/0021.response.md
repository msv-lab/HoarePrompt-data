The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This changes the state of `b` by adding a new element to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`
- `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`

After executing `b.append(lit[i])`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `b` was empty before this operation, `y` is now set to `lit[i]`. If `b` was not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b` before the append operation, but `b` itself has changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, `b` is the previous `b` with `lit[i]` appended, `y` is the last element of the previous `b` if `b` was not empty, otherwise `y` is `lit[i]`.**
