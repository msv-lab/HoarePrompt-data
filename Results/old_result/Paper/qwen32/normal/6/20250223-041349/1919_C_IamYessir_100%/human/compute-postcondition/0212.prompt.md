Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. If `x > y`, then `a` and `x` remain unchanged unless `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, in which case `a` includes `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `x` and `y` retain their values unless `x >= lit[i]`, in which case `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x > y`, then if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > y` and `x` is the last element of `a`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, a new element from `lit[i]` is appended to `a`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `lit[i] < x`, and `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `lit[i] < x`, and `lit[i] <= y`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x > y` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation. If `x > y` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has the element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before appending `lit[i]`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] <= y`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `x < lit[i]`, `a` remains unchanged. If `x <= y` and `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was previously empty or `y` was `float('inf')`. If `x <= y` and `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `x <= y` and `lit[i] <= y` and `y` was not `float('inf')` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `y` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
