The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lit` is appended to `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. The list `a` now includes the element `lit[2]` appended to it.**
