Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list but now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. Currently, `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`.**

In simpler terms, the list `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
