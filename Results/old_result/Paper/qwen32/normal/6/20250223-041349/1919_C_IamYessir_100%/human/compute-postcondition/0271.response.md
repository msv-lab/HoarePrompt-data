The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`, as it gains a new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**
