The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given that `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, after appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `x` will now be equal to `lit[i]`. Since `x` was previously equal to `y` and `x` is now updated, `y` will also be updated to `lit[i]` to maintain the condition that `x` is always equal to `y`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`.**
