Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` is now the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] <= x`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is added to `a` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. Otherwise, there is no change to `a` or `x`.**
