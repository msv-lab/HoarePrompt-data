The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. Given that `a` can be either an empty list or not, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `a` is not an empty list, `x` will be the last element of `a`.
2. If `a` is an empty list, this code will raise an `IndexError` because there is no last element to access. However, since the task specifies to avoid describing how the program runs and to assume the code executes without error, we will assume `a` is not empty.

Given the initial state, `a` and `b` can be either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. After the code execution, the only change is the introduction of the variable `x`, which will hold the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `a`**.
