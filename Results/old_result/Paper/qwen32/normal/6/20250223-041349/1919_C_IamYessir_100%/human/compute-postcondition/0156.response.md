The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `x` is less than `y`.
- `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`:

- `a` is no longer an empty list (if it was) and now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.
- `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`b`, `cp`, `n`, `y`, and `lit[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list and includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
