Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is less than `y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` remains `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty.**
