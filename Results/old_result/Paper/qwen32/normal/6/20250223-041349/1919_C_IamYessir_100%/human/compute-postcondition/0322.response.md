The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so the element at index 3 of `lit` is appended to `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`. `a` now includes the element at index 3 of `lit`.**
