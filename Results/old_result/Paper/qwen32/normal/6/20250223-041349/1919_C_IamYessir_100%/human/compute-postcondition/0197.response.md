The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.

The only change after executing the code is that `b` will have an additional element `lit[i]`. The values of `a`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `b` was previously empty, in which case `y` will now be `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation.**
