The code assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is not an empty list, it has at least one element, and `a[-1]` refers to the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
