The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. However, in the given initial state, there is no mention of a list `b`. Therefore, we must assume that `b` is a list that was not included in the provided initial state. Since the list `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `y` after the execution of the code. However, we can still describe the state of the other variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
