The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a`, making it no longer empty if it was before. The values of `b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is no longer empty and has the element `lit[i]` appended to it; `b` is either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before appending `lit[i]`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
