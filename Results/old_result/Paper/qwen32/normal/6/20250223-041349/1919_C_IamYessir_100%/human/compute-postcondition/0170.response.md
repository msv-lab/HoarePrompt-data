Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, and `x` retain their initial states as described. The variable `y` is newly assigned the value `float('inf')`.
