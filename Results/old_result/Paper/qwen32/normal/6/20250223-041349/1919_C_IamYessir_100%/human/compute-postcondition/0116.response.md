Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `i` is 3. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
