Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is the length of the input list `lit`, `lit` is the list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `b` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `i` is 4. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 5, 6, or 7. Otherwise, `s` remains 4.**
