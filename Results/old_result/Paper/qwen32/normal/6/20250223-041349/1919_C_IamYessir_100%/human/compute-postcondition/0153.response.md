The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means `a` is no longer an empty list (if it was empty before) and now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.

Since `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, after appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `x` will be updated to `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`b`, `cp`, `n`, `y`, and the conditions `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list and includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`.**
