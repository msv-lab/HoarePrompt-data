Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` was 0, or the last element of list `a` before the change otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` was 0 before the if-else block, or the last element of list `b` before the if-else block otherwise. If `y >= lit[3]`, then `b` includes the element `lit[3]` at the end. If `y < lit[3]`, then if `lit[3] > x`, `b` includes the element `lit[3]`, and if `x >= lit[3]` and `lit[3] > y`, then `a` includes the element `lit[3]` appended to it.**
