The code assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the last element of `a`**.
