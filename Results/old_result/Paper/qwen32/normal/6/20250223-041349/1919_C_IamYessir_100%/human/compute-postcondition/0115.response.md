The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element plus 1, and `i` is 3.**
