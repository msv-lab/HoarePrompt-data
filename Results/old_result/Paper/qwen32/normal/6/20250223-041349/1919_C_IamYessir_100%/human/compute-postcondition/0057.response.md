Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` includes an additional element `lit[i]`.**
