Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, then `a` has the element `lit[i]` appended to it. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before appending `lit[i]`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` remains `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
