The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` will have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. Additionally, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
