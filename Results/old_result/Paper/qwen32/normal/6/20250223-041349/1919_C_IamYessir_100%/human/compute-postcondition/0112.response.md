The code snippet provided is `s += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `s` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element. After executing `s += 1`, the value of `s` will be its previous value plus 1. 

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element plus 1. `i` is 2.**
