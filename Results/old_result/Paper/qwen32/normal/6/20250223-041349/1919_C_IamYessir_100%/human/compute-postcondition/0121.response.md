The code snippet provided updates the variable `lit` by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, converting each component to an integer, and then collecting these integers into a list. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this code.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the integer value from `input()`
- `lit` is the input list of integers
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `b` is a list of integers
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty
- `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`

**Code Execution:**
- `lit` is reassigned to a new list of integers obtained from the input.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value from `input()`, `lit` is the new list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b) - 1`.**
