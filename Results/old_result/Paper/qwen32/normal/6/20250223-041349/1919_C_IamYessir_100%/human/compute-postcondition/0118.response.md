To determine the output of the `print(s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the number of elements in `lit`.
- `lit` is the input list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `cp` is 0.
- `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty.
- `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.

The variable `s` is specifically described as the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element. This implies that `s` is a counter that increments each time `b[j] > b[j-1]` for some index `j` in the list `b`.

Given that the exact contents of the list `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe what `s` represents based on the information provided.

Therefore, the output of the `print(s)` statement will be the value of `s`, which is the count of how many times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.

Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element)**
