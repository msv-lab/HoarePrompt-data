The code snippet takes a string `s`, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state does not specify the value of `s`, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `n` and `k`. However, we can state that `n` and `k` will be integers derived from the string `s`. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` and `k` are integers derived from the string `s`.**
