The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to it. Given that `i` is `n`, the element at index `n` in the list `a` is increased by `n + 1`. 

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n-1` incremented by 1 which is `n`.

Since `i` is `n`, the element at index `n` (which is the `n+1`-th element, considering 0-based indexing) is incremented by `n + 1`. This means the list `a` now has an additional element at index `n` that is `n + 1` greater than it was before, or if the list was originally of length `n`, it will now have a length of `n+1` with the new element being `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `n`-th element (originally the last element) is increased by `n + 1`, and any previous elements remain unchanged.**
