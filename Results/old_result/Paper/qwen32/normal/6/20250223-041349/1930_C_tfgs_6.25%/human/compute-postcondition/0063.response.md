The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is the last element of `ans` minus 1. Given the initial state, the last element of `ans` is `-2`, so the new element will be `-3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end, an additional element `-2` at the end, and an additional element `-3` at the end.**
