Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the described algorithm to find the lexicographically largest array `b`. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Handling Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element after adding the index, but it does not correctly account for the fact that only unique elements should be inserted into the set `S`. Instead, the program uses `set(a)` to remove duplicates, which is fine, but it doesn't handle the counts correctly for the final construction of array `b`.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The program attempts to construct array `b` by inserting elements and filling in gaps based on the counts, but it doesn't correctly handle the lexicographical ordering. Specifically, it doesn't ensure that the largest possible elements are chosen at each step.

3. **Handling of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is supposed to keep track of how many elements are missing to reach `n`, but the program does not correctly use it to fill in the gaps with the appropriate values.

To correctly solve the problem, you should:

- Add the index to each element and store the unique values in a set.
- Convert the set to a list and sort it in decreasing order.
- Output this sorted list as the result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    b = sorted(s, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This version correctly implements the described algorithm by maintaining a set of unique values and then sorting them in decreasing order to form array `b`.
