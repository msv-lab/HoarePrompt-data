Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`. If `i > 0`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1 except for `n - i + 1` which has a count of `-adv` and `a[i]` which has a count of `0` if `a[i]` was `n - i + 1` or `0` if `a[i]` was not `n - i + 1` but has been decremented by 1, `cnt` is `0 - adv`, and `ans` is `[n - i - 0, n - i - 1, n - i - 2, ..., n - i - (adv - 1), a[i]]`. If `i <= 0`, `counter` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is `[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements plus `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `adv` is greater than 0 if `i` is greater than 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus the element `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
