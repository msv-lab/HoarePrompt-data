The code snippet `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value in the `counter` dictionary at the key `a[i]` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `adv` is 0.
- `ans` contains `adv` elements plus `a[i]`.
- `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.
- `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.

The code only affects the `counter` dictionary by decrementing the count at the key `a[i]`. Therefore, the value of `counter[a[i]]` is now one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements plus `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**
