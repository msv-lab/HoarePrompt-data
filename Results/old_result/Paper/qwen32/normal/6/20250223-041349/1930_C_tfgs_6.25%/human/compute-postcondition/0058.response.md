The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, and `ans`) do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0`.**
