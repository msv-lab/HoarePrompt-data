You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is increased by `i + 1` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` followed by `-1, -2, ..., -cnt`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the elements of the array. The function returns a value based on the elements of the array, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
