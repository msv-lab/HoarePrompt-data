To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the loop's behavior.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
```

This loop appends to the list `ans` by subtracting 1 from the last element in `ans` for `cnt` times. 

From the given output states:
- After 1 iteration, `ans` has an additional `-1`.
- After 2 iterations, `ans` has additional `-1` and `-2`.
- After 3 iterations, `ans` has additional `-1`, `-2`, and `-3`.

We can see that after `cnt` iterations, `ans` will have `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous one, starting from `-1`.

Given that the initial `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0`, after `cnt` iterations, `ans` will be extended by `cnt` elements: `-1, -2, ..., -cnt`.

Thus, the final `ans` will be the initial `ans` list followed by the sequence `-1, -2, ..., -cnt`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` followed by `-1, -2, ..., -cnt`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will be `[n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0, -1, -2, ..., -cnt]`.
