Postcondition: **`k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`. Either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.**
