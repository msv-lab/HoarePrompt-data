Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `nums`, an integer `k` representing a threshold value, and a list `nums` of `n` integers. It processes the list by reducing pairs of elements based on the value of `k`. The function returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from the list. If there is one element left in the list after all possible reductions and `k` is still sufficient to reduce this element to 0, it returns the count plus one. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed.**
