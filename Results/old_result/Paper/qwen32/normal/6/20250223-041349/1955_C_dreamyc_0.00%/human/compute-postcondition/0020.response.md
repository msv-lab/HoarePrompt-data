Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `nums` is a deque of `n-1` or `n-2` integers depending on the value of `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` has `n-1` integers with `a` appended at the beginning, and `x` is recalculated as min(a, b) after possible modifications to `a` and `b`. If `a` is 0, `nums` has `n-2` integers, and `ans` is set to 1. `x` is min(a, b). `b` is 0. `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
