#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        #The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums` plus 1.
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`. Either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`, which is stored in the variable `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `nums`, an integer `k` representing a threshold value, and a list `nums` of `n` integers. It processes the list by reducing pairs of elements based on the value of `k`. The function returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from the list. If there is one element left in the list after all possible reductions and `k` is still sufficient to reduce this element to 0, it returns the count plus one. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed.
