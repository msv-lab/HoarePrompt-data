Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer representing a threshold value), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). The function processes the list `nums` by reducing its elements based on the value of `k`. If all elements in `nums` are reduced to 0 and removed, the function returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed plus 1. In all other cases, it returns the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed, stored in the variable `ans`.**
