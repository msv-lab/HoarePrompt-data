Postcondition: **`k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions with exactly one element, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
