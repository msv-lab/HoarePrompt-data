`b` is updated to be `b - x`. Since `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, the value of `b` will be reduced by `x`. The other variables (`k`, `nums`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
