The `break` statement in the given code snippet does not affect the values of the variables `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional statement it is placed in. Since no loop or conditional statement is mentioned in the context, we assume that the `break` statement is not relevant to the variables' values.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the only change being the mention that the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and the `break` statement was executed.**
