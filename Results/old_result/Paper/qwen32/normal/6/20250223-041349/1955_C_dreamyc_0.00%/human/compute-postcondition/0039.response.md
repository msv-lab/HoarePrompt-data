The code snippet `a -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `a`. Given that `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, the value of `a` will be reduced by `x`. If `x` is equal to `a`, then `a` will become 0. If `x` is equal to `b`, then `a` will be reduced by `b`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
