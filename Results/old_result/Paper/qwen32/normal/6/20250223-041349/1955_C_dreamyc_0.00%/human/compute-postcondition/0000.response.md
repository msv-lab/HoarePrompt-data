The code snippet converts the list `nums` into a `deque` object. This change affects the data type of `nums` but does not alter the values within it. All other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
