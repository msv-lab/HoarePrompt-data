### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps taken by the program and compare them with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Processing**:
   - The list `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`) and there are still attacks remaining (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, the first and last ships are attacked (their durabilities are reduced).
   - The minimum durability of the two ships is determined (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks `k` is at least twice the minimum durability (`k >= 2 * x`), both ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
   - If one of the ships' durability drops to zero or below, it is considered sunk, and the count `ans` is incremented.
   - If the durability of a ship is greater than zero after the attack, it is put back into the deque.
   - The loop breaks when there are fewer than two ships left or when there are no more attacks left.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and the remaining number of attacks `k` is sufficient to sink this ship (`k >= nums[0]`), the count `ans` is incremented by one.
   - The function returns the count of ships that were sunk.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
6
4 5
1 2 4 3
4 6
1 2 4 3
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
2 2
3 2
2 15
1 5
2 7
5 2
```

**Output:**
```
2
3
5
0
2
2
```

The program correctly computes the number of ships that were sunk for each test case, matching the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

**Correctness: **True**
