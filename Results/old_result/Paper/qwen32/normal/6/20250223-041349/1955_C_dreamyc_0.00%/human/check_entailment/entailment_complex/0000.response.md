### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships that are sunk after the Kraken's attacks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The list `nums` is converted into a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Attacking Ships**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships and there are remaining attacks (`k > 0`).
   - It pops the first (`a`) and last (`b`) ships from the `deque`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability (`x`) between the two ships.
   - If the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is at least `2 * x`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If the durability of a ship becomes zero after the attack, it increments the `ans` counter and does not add the ship back to the `deque`.
   - If the durability of a ship is greater than zero, it adds the ship back to the `deque` at the appropriate end.

4. **Final Attack**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is one ship left in the `deque` and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship, it increments the `ans` counter.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of ships that have sunk for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and accurately counts the number of ships that sink. The use of a `deque` allows for efficient removal and addition of elements from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
