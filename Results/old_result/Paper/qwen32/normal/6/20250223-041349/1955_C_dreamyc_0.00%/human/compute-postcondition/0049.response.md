Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `a` and `b` are the first and last integers removed from `nums` respectively, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` is greater than 0 and `a` is greater than 0 and `k` was initially greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`. If `b` is greater than 0 and either `a` is not greater than 0 or `k` was less than `2 * x`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
