Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: number of ships.
     - `k`: number of attacks.
     - `a`: list of durability values of the ships.
2. **Process:**
   - The Kraken attacks the ships in a specific order: first, last, first, last, and so on.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - When a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the attack sequence.
   - The process continues until all ships have sunk or the Kraken runs out of attacks.
3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the number of ships that were sunk.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a `deque` to efficiently handle the removal of ships from both ends. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of durability values `nums`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to determine the number of ships sunk.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Converts the list `nums` to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It pops the first and last ships' durability values (`a` and `b`).
     - It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` (`x`), which represents the maximum number of attacks that can be evenly distributed between the two ships.
     - If there are enough attacks left (`k >= 2 * x`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
     - If either ship's durability drops to 0, it increments the `ans` counter.
     - If there are not enough attacks left to fully sink both ships, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and enough attacks to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), it increments the `ans` counter.
   - Finally, it returns the number of ships sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attack pattern (first, last, first, last, ...).
- It efficiently manages the removal of ships using a `deque`, which allows for O(1) time complexity for popping from both ends.
- The logic for reducing the durability and counting sunk ships is correct.
- The edge cases, such as when there is only one ship left or when there are not enough attacks to sink any more ships, are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
