The code snippet provided initializes a variable `neg` to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `n` or `s` as they are part of the input and remain unchanged. The variable `neg` is set to 0, so we update its value accordingly.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "+" and "-". The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string of length `n`. `neg` is 0.**
