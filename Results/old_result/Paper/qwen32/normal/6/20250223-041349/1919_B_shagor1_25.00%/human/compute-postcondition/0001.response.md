The code snippet `s = input()` reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, this means that the string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-" will be read and stored in `s`.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "+" and "-". The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string of length `n`.**
