Reasoning:
The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by calculating a value based on the count of "-" characters and the length of the string. However, the logic provided does not align with the problem's requirements for minimizing the penalty.

The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This formula does not correctly compute the minimum penalty based on the described splitting process. The optimal way to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array in such a way that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, which is not implemented in the given code.

The program does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it uses a simple formula that does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
