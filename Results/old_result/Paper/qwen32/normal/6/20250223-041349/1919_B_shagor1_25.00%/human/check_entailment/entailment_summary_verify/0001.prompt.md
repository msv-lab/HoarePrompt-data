You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "+" and "-". For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the length of the string and the count of "-" characters in it. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of "-" characters), otherwise it prints `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Key Points:
1. **Conversion of String to Array**: Each '+' in the string `s` represents `1` and each '-' represents `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For a subarray `b`, the penalty `p(b)` is `|sum(b)| * len(b)`.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total penalty after splitting the array optimally.

### Observations:
- To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subarrays where the sum of elements is `0` because the penalty for such subarrays is `0`.
- If it's not possible to create subarrays with a sum of `0`, then we should create subarrays with the smallest possible absolute sum.

### Provided Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Counting '-' Characters**: The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - If the number of '-' characters (`neg`) is not equal to the length of the string `n` (i.e., `n != neg`), the program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string (i.e., `n == neg`), the program calculates the penalty as `n`.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1**: When `n != neg`
  - This means there are both '+' and '-' characters in the string.
  - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not necessarily correct for minimizing the penalty. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays with minimal penalties.
- **Case 2**: When `n == neg`
  - This means the string consists only of '-' characters.
  - The formula `n` is correct because the only way to split the array is into individual `-1` elements, each contributing `1` to the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty for all cases. Specifically, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not a valid way to compute the minimum penalty for strings containing both '+' and '-' characters.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
