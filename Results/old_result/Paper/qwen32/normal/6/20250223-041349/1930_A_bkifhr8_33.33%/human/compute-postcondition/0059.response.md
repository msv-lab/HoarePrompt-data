Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is the string input by the user, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is the initial `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` converted to integers. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is the initial `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.**
