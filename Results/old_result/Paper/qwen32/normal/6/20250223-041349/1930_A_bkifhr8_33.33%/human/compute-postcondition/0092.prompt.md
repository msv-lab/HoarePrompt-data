Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input by the user (1 <= `t` <= 5000); `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7; `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, and `lst` is a list with fewer than 2 elements, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is either an empty list or a list of two elements, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all pairs of elements processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is either empty or contains two elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
