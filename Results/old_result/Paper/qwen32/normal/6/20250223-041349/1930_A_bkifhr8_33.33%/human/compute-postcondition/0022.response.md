Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `lst` remains a list of 2n strings, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
