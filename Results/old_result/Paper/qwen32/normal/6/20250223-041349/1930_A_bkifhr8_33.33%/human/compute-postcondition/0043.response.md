The code snippet adds the minimum of the two integers obtained from splitting the string `l` by spaces to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was 0. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.**
