The code snippet `lst = l.split(' ')` takes the string `l` and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. Each substring is an element in the list `lst`.

Given the initial state, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, which contains `2n` integers separated by spaces. After executing the code, `lst` will be a list of these `2n` integers as strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`**.
