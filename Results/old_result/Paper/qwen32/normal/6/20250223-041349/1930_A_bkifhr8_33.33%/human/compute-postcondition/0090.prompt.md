Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the new integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is the new string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))], where `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))], where `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If `len(lst)` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers. In both cases, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
