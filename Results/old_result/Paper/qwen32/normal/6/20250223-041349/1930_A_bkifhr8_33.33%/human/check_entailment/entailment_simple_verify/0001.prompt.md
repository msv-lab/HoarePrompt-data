You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves, where each move consists of selecting two integers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both integers from the list. The goal is to find the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score after `n` moves.

### Optimal Strategy
The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest numbers together. This is because pairing the smallest numbers ensures that we add the smallest possible values to the score in each move, which maximizes the final score.

### Program Analysis
Let's walk through the given program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then reads `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then enters a loop to perform `n` moves.

3. **Performing Moves:**
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. However, this condition is incorrect and unnecessary.
   - It attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements to the score and then tries to remove elements from the list. The removal logic is incorrect and will cause an `IndexError` because `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect indices.

4. **Handling the Last Pair:**
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two remaining elements to the score and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not sort the list of integers before processing, which is crucial for the optimal strategy.
- The removal logic inside the loop is incorrect and will cause errors.
- The loop condition and the handling of the last pair are not correctly implemented.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Sort the list of integers.
- Pair the smallest numbers together and add the smaller number in each pair to the score.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the provided program, it is not correct. The program does not follow the optimal strategy and contains logical errors.

Correctness: **False**
