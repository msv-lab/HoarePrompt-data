The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` converted to integers, incremented by the same minimum value. Otherwise, `ans` is the initial `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.**
