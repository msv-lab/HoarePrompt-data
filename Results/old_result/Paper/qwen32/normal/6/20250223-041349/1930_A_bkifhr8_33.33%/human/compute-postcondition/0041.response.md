The code removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces with the first element removed, the element at index 2 is the third element in the original `lst` (after the first element was removed).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed and the third element removed, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` converted to integers.**
