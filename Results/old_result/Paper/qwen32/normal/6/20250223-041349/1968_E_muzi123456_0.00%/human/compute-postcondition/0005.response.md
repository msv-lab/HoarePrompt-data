The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

Let's analyze the code and the initial state given:

- The initial state provides information about variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to a space `' '`.

The `print` function in Python outputs the specified string to the console, and the `end` parameter specifies what to print at the end of the output. By default, `end` is set to a newline character `'\n'`, but in this case, it is explicitly set to a space `' '`.

Therefore, the code will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Output: **1 **
