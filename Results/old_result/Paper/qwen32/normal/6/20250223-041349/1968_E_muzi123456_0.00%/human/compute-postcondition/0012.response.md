Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
  - `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3.
  - `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(i)
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The variable `i` is explicitly set to the value of `n`.
  - `n` is the user input and is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
  - Since `i` is assigned the value of `n`, the variable `i` will have the same value as `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is the same as the value of `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we know that `i` will be the value of `n` as specified by the user input.

Output: **i (where i is the value of n provided by the user input)**
