To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
2. `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

From the description, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, the initial value of `i` before any iterations is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we can only describe `i` in terms of its relationship to its previous value.

Since the exact value of `i` at the beginning of the current iteration is not specified, we can only say that `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as \(i_{\text{prev}}\). Then, the value of `i` at the current iteration is \(i_{\text{prev}} + 1\).

Output: **i (where i is the value of i from the previous iteration plus 1)**
