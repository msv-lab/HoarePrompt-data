The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a single space character. The initial state describes variables `n` and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `n` (which is an integer provided by user input between 2 and 1000) and the iterations of `i` from 1 to `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

The `print(' ')` statement will simply output a space character.

Output: ** ** (a single space character)**
