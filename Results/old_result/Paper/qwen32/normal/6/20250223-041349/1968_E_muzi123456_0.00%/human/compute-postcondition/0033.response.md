The given code snippet is a `print` statement with a specific `end` parameter. The `print` function in Python by default ends with a newline character (`\n`). However, in this case, the `end` parameter is set to a space (`' '`), which means that after printing the specified string, the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

Here, the string `'1'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is. The `end=' '` part ensures that after printing `'1'`, a space character is added instead of a newline.

Since there are no variables or conditions involved in the print statement that depend on the initial state or user input `n`, the output is straightforward and does not change based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 ** (where the trailing space indicates the end=' ' in the print statement)
