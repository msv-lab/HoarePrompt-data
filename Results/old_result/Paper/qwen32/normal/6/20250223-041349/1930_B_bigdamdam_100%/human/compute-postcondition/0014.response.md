The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. Given that `n % 2` is `0` if `n` is even and `1` if `n` is odd, the new value of `ind` will be `1` if `n` is even and `2` if `n` is odd. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the input list, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with values set at even indices from `n` to `n - 2 * (n // 2) + 2` in steps of -2, `ind` is 1 if `n` is even, 2 if `n` is odd.**
