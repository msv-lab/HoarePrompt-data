The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` and `i` increments by 2 in each iteration, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 2, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i + 2`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `p[i]` is `ind - 2`, this state does not affect the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

So, if `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `(x + 2) + 2` which is `x + 4`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the new state in terms of the old `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 4`, `p[i]` is `ind - 2`** (Note that `i` has been incremented by 2 for the next iteration)
