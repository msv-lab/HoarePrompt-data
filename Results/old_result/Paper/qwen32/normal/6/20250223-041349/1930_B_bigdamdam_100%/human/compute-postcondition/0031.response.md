The given code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Based on the initial state provided, the only information given is that `n` must be greater than 0. However, the code does not provide any information about the variables `p`, `i`, or `ind`. We can assume that `p` is a list, and `i` and `ind` are defined in a way that the assignment can be made without errors (i.e., `i` is a valid index for `p` and `ind` is a value that can be assigned to an element in `p`).

Since the values of `p`, `i`, and `ind` are not specified, we can only describe the change in `p` at index `i` to be `ind`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `p[i]` is `ind`.**
