Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `<`, the behavior is as described in the if part. Otherwise, the behavior is as described in the else part.**

Since the if and else parts do not alter the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with the additional detail about the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`.
