Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has determined whether the second last character of the string `b` is `'<'`. If it is, it prints `'No'`; otherwise, it prints `'Yes'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer in their initial state as they have been updated through each iteration, but `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has checked each of the `t` test cases and printed either `'No'` or `'Yes'` based on the condition specified. The loop has finished processing all inputs.
