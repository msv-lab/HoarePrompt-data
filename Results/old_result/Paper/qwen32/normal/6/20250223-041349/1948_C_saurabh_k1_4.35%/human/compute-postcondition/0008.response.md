Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the second last element of `b` is `'<'`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `'<'`. Otherwise, the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`.**
