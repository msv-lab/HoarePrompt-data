Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If it is, the function outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.**
