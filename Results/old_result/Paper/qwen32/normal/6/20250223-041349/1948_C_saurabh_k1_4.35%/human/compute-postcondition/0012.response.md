The code snippet `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input, converts each character of the input into a string, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the previous state of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the second last element of `b` is `'<'`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `'<'`. Otherwise, the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

After executing the code snippet, `b` will be updated to a new list of strings derived from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input; `b` is a new list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input.**
