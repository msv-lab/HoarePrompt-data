The code snippet `a = list(map(str, input()))` reads a new input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The variable `n`, `t`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input; `b` is a new list of strings where each string is a character from the previous input. If `b[n - 2]` equals `<`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed.**
