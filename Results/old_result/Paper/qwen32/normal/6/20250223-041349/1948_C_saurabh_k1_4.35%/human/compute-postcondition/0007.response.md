The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The variable `a` is a list of strings, where each string is a character from the input.
4. The variable `b` is a list of strings, where each string is a character from the new input, and the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print('Yes')` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
