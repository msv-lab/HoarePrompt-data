In the provided task, the loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted directly. The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t` (or the result of `int(input())`).

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The state of `t` should be such that it is a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
