The code snippet `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and then stores these strings in the list `b`. This means that the previous contents of `b` are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.**
