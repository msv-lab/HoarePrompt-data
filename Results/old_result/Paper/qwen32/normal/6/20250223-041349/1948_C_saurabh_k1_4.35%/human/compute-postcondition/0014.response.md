The `print('Yes')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string 'Yes'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`), but none of these are used in the provided code snippet.
2. The `print('Yes')` statement directly outputs the string 'Yes' without referencing any of the variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
