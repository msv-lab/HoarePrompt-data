To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `sng` is a list with at least three elements.
2. `sz` is incremented by 2 but is still less than `k`.
3. `elem` is the third element of `sng`.
4. The condition `sz >= k` is not met, so the code does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

From the above, we know that `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element of the list `sng`. However, the exact elements of `sng` are not provided, so we can only describe `elem` in terms of its position in the list.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Given that `elem` is the third element of the list `sng`, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline, the output will be the third element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the third element of the list sng) **
