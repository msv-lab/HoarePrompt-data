Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is now `sz + 2` (where `sz + 2` is greater than or equal to `k + 2` or `2` if `sz` was initially less than `k`). Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.**
