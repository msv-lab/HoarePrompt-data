Postcondition: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sz` or `elem`.**
