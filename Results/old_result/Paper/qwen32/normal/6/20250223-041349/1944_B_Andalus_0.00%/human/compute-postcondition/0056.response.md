The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the current element being processed in `ldb`.

To execute the loop one more time, `elem` must be the next element in `ldb` after the current one. Since `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `ldb` for `elem` to be assigned to.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least two elements, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the current one. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific changes occur beyond the possible increase in `sz`.**

Since `ldb` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again, and `elem` is currently the second element, the next iteration will have `elem` as the third element in `ldb`.
