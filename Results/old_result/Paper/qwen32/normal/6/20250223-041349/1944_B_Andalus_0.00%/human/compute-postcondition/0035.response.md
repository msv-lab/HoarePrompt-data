The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 4, the element at index 4 in `rgt` is appended to `rdb`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `rgt` and `rdb`, we can only describe the change in terms of the operation performed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also contains `rgt[4]`, and `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `i` is 4**.
