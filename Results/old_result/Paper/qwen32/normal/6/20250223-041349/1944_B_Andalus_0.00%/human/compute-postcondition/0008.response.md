Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the initialization of a new list `sng` as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
