Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to split the array `a` into two parts, `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, such that:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Elements:**
   - `ldb`: List to store elements that appear twice in `lft`.
   - `rdb`: List to store elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
   - `sng`: List to store elements that appear only once in `lft`.

4. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by:
     - Adding pairs of elements from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until the length of `l` and `r` reaches `2k` or more.
     - Adding elements from `sng` to `l` and `r` if `2k` pairs cannot be formed.

### Correctness Issues

1. **Handling `sng` Elements:**
   - The program adds elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r`. However, this does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal because elements in `sng` are not paired and may not balance out in terms of XOR.

2. **Incomplete Handling of `rdb`:**
   - The program only uses `rdb` to form pairs in `r` but does not ensure that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal. It should also consider using `rdb` elements to balance the XOR with `l`.

3. **No Guarantee of Correct XOR:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the final `l` and `r` will have the same XOR value. It merely ensures that `l` and `r` have the same number of elements (`2k`), but not necessarily the same XOR.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal. It only ensures that `l` and `r` have the same length and uses a simplistic approach to fill `l` and `r` with elements from `ldb` and `sng`. This approach does not guarantee the required property of equal XOR.

### Correctness: **False**

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
