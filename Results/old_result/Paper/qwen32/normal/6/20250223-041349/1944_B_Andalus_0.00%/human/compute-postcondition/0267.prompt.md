Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise it is an empty list; `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order. `ldb` is a list containing `lft[4]` if `lft[4]` is equal to `lft[3]`, otherwise it is an empty list. `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Additionally, `sng` contains `lft[4]` if `lft[4]` is not equal to `lft[5]`. `rdb` is an empty list. `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is assigned the values provided by the input. `lst` is a list of integers from the input. `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order. `ldb` is a list containing `lft[4]` and `lft[5]` if `lft[4]` is equal to `lft[3]`, otherwise it contains only `lft[4]`. `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Additionally, `sng` contains `lft[4]` if `lft[4]` is not equal to `lft[5]`, and `sng` includes `lft[5]` if `lft[5]` is not equal to `lft[6]`. `rdb` is an empty list. `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is assigned the values provided by the input. `lst` is a list of integers from the input. `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. `i` is 5. If `lft[5]` is equal to `lft[4]`, `ldb` contains both `lft[4]` and `lft[5]`. If `lft[5]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, `ldb` contains only `lft[4]`. If `lft[5]` is not equal to `lft[6]`, `sng` includes `lft[5]`. Otherwise, `sng` does not include `lft[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
