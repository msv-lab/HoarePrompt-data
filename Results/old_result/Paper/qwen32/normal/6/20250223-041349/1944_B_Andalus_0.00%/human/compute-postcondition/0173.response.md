Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is increased by 2. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`) remain unchanged as per the initial state. The conditions involving `k` and `sz` for exiting the loop or if statement are still applicable but have not been evaluated or changed by this specific code snippet.
