Postcondition: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise it is an empty list; `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.**
