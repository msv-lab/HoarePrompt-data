Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code snippet sorts the list `rgt`, which is the sublist of `lst` starting from the `n`-th element to the end. The other variables remain unchanged.
