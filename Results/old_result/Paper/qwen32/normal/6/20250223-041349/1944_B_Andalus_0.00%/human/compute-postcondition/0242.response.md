The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` updates the value of `lft` to be the first `n` elements of the list `lst`. The other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`; `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element; `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors; `rdb` remains unchanged; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
