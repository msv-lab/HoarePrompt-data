The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 5) of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 5, the element `rgt[5]` is appended to `rdb`. The precondition states that if `rgt[5]` is equal to `rgt[4]`, then `rdb` already contains `rgt[5]`. However, regardless of whether `rgt[5]` is equal to `rgt[4]` or not, the code will append `rgt[5]` to `rdb`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, and `i` is 5; `rdb` contains all previous elements of `rdb` plus `rgt[5]`.**
