Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - The loop will stop as soon as `sz` is no longer less than `k`.
- The final value of `sz` will be the largest even number less than or equal to `k` (or `k` itself if `k` is even).

Assuming `k` is a given constant and the loop runs until `sz` reaches `k`, the final output state will be:

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a list with at least one element; `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 2 but is still less than `k`; `elem` is the second element of `sng`. Since the condition `sz >= k` is not met, the code does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` is a list with at least three elements; `sz` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k`; `elem` is the third element of `sng`. Since the condition `sz >= k` is not met, the code does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
