Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**
