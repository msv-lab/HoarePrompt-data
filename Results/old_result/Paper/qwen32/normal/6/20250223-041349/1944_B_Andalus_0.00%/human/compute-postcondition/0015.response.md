Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
