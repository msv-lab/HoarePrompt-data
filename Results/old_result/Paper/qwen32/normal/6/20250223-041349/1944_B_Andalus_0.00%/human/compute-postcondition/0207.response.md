The code snippet `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given the initial state, `sz` was already greater than or equal to `k` or was 0 if it was less than `k` before the if statement. After the increment, `sz` will be 2 more than its previous value. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is now `sz + 2` (where `sz + 2` is greater than or equal to `k + 2` or `2` if `sz` was initially less than `k`), and `rdb` must contain at least one element.**
