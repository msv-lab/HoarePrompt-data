The code snippet provided is `ldb = []`, which reassigns the list `ldb` to an empty list. This means that any previous contents of `ldb` are discarded and `ldb` now contains no elements.

The other variables (`lft`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, and `rgt`) are not affected by this statement.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors; `rdb` remains unchanged; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]`.**
