The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order
- `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 1
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of

After executing `sz += 1`, `sz` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 2; `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
