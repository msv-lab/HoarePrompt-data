The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, and it is derived from the iterable `rdb`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `rdb` is not empty. The state of `sz`, `x`, `sng`, and `k` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`rdb` must not be empty**
