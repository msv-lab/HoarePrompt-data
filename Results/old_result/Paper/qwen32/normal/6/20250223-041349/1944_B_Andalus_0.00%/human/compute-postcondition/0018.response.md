Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`), and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, and if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains `lft[i]`; otherwise, `sng` is an empty list. `rdb` remains an empty list.**
