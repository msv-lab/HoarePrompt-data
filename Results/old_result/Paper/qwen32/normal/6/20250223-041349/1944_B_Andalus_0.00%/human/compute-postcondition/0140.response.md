The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given the initial state, `lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` remains the same. After executing the code, `sng` will have an additional element which is `lft[i]`. The values of `lft` and `n` remain unchanged, but the value of `sng` is updated.

Output State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.**
