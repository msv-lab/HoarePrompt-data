The code snippet `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **All elements of `sng` up to the index `min(k, len(sng)) - 1` are printed, `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**
