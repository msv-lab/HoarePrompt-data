Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `lft`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged. The variable `sz` is increased by 2 if the initial difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2; otherwise, `sz` stays the same. The variable `elem` retains its value as the next element in `ldb`. The loop or if statement is exited.
