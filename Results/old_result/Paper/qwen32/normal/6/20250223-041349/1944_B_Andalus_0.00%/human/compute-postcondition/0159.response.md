Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, and `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, the list `lft` stays in its original sorted order without any changes. The list `ldb` will have all elements from `lft` that are the same as the element immediately before them. The list `sng` will have elements from `lft` that are unique and not the same as their immediate neighbors.
