The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, which iterates over the elements in `sng`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `sng` contains at least one element. The variables `lft`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `sng` must contain at least one element. The state of `elem` will be determined by the first element in `sng` during the first iteration.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains at least one unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`**
