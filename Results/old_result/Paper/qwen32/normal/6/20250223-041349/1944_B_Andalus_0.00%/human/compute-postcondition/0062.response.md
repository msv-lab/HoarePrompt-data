To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates over the `ldb` list, which contains elements from `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them. During each iteration, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop prints the current `elem` twice and increments `sz` by 2. The loop stops if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After the first iteration, `sz` is increased by 2.
2. After the second iteration, `sz` is increased by another 2.
3. After the third iteration, `sz` is increased by another 2.

This means that after 3 iterations, `sz` has been incremented by 6. Therefore, the loop will continue until `sz` reaches `k` or there are no more elements in `ldb` to process.

### Output State Analysis:
- **`t` and `T`**: These remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: This remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`k`**: This remains unchanged as it is the condition for the loop to stop.
- **`lst`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`lft`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`rgt`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`ldb`**: This list is being iterated over, but its elements are not modified.
- **`rdb`**: This remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`sng`**: This remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`sz`**: This variable is incremented by 2 during each iteration until it reaches `k` or the loop runs out of elements in `ldb`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue to execute until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or there are no more elements in `ldb`. The final value of `sz` will be the highest value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or it will be equal to the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, and `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller.**
