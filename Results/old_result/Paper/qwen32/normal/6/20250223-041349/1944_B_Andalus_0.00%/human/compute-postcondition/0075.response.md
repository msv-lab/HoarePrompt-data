Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, `sz`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
