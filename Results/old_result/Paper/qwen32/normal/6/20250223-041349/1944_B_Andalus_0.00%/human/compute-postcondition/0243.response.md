The code snippet assigns the value of `lst[n:]` to the variable `rgt`. This means that `rgt` will now contain all elements of `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of the list.

Given the initial state, the values of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `rgt`, which is derived from `lst`.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`; `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element; `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors; `rdb` remains unchanged; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]`.**
