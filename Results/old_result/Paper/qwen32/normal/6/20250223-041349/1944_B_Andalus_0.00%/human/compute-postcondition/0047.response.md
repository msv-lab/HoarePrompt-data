To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

From the initial state:
- `t` and `T` are integers between 1 and 5000, inclusive.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft` is a list of the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is a list of the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries.
- `sz` is 0.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Given the context, it is likely that `elem` is a variable that is defined within the scope of the code snippet or a loop that precedes the `print` statement. Since `elem` is not provided, we can only infer that it is some element that is being processed or iterated over.

Given that the `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, it suggests that the same element `elem` is being printed twice, separated by a space, and the output will not be followed by a newline (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, the most precise description we can give is that `elem` is some element being processed, and it will be printed twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the current element being processed)**
