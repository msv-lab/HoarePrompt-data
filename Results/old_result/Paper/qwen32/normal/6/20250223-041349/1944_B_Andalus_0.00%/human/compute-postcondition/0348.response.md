The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `sng`, `sz`, and `elem` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 1 but is still less than `k`; `elem` is the second element of `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
