The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.**
