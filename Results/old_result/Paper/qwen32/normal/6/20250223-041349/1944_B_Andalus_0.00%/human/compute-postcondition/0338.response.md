The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The condition `if sz >= k` is not evaluated in this snippet, so it remains as it was in the initial state. The `rdb` variable is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sz` is increased by 2.**
