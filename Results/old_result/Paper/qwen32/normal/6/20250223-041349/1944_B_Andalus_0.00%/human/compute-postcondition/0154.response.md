Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 1. `i` is 3; `rdb` has `rgt[3]` appended to it.**

In simple terms, the list `rdb` now includes the element `rgt[3]` at the end of it, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
