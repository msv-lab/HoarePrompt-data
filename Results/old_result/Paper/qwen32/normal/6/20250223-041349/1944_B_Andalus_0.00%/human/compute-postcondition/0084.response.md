Output State: **`sz` is 0, all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed, `rdb` must have at least one element, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `sz`, the elements in `sng` up to `sz`, the condition that `rdb` must have at least one element, and the condition that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` all remain unchanged.
