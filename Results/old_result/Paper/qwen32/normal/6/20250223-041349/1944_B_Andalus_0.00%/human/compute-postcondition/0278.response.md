To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables. The loop iterates over the `rgt` list starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list, checking if each element is equal to the one before it. If they are equal, it appends the current element to the `rdb` list.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])
```

We know that `rgt` is a sorted list of elements from `lst[n:]`. The loop will check each element in `rgt` to see if it is a duplicate of the previous element. If it is, that element will be added to `rdb`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- `rgt` has at least 5 elements.
- The loop has iterated 3 times, which means `n` must be at least 5 because `rgt` starts from `lst[n:]`.

After all iterations, the loop will have checked every element in `rgt` starting from index 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, `rdb` will contain all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.

The final output state will be:
- `lft` remains the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` remains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
- `sng` remains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.
- `rdb` will contain all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
- `sz` remains the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- `n` and `k` remain the values provided by the input.
- `lst` remains the list of integers from the input.
- `rgt` remains `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.**
