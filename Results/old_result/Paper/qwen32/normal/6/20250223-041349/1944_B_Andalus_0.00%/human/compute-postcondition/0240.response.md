The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state does not specify any values for `n` or `k`, so these variables are now assigned the values provided by the input. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, and `sz`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input.**
