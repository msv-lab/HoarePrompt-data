To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

The initial state describes several variables:
- `lft`: A sorted list that remains unchanged.
- `ldb`: A list containing duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements.
- `sng`: A list containing unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `k`: An integer variable (its value is not provided but it is used in the condition).
- `sz`: An integer variable that is set to 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the inner loop or if statement is exited.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from either `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng` depending on the code logic that precedes this `print` statement.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can infer that `elem` is an element from one of these lists, but its specific value is not known from the initial state alone. Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end due to `end=' '`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list lft, ldb, or sng)**
