The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `ldb`. None of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list.**
