Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb` now contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it, `rdb`, and `sng` are determined based on the new value of `i` as per the loop logic.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` of the list `lft` has been appended to the list `ldb`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
