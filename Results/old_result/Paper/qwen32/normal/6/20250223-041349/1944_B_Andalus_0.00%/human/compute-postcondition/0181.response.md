To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the loop progresses and terminates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
   - `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
   - `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
   - `sz` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`.
   - For each iteration, if `sz` is less than `k`, it checks if `k - sz` is at least 2.
   - If true, it prints the element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
   - The loop breaks if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` was initially at least 2.
   - **After 2 iterations**: `sz` is 4 if `k - sz` was at least 2 after the first iteration.
   - **After 3 iterations**: `sz` is 6 if `k - sz` was at least 2 after the second iteration.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop continues until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `ldb` is exhausted.
   - If `ldb` has fewer than `k/2` elements, the loop will execute for all elements in `ldb`.
   - If `ldb` has `k/2` or more elements, the loop will stop when `sz` reaches `k`.

Given this, the final output state will be when either:
- `sz` has reached `k`, or
- All elements in `ldb` have been processed.

Let's assume `ldb` has `n` elements and `k` is a given threshold.

**Final Output State**:
- `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
- `ldb` remains unchanged.
- `sng` remains unchanged.
- `sz` will be the minimum of `2 * n` (if all elements in `ldb` are processed) or `k` (if `sz` reaches `k` before all elements are processed).

**Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k`.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `lft`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `sz` will be the smaller of twice the number of elements in `ldb` or the value of `k`.
