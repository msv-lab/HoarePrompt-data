To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz` is 0**: This indicates that `sz` is initialized to 0.
2. **All elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed**: Since `sz` is 0, this means no elements from `sng` have been printed yet.
3. **`rdb` must have at least one element**: This means `rdb` is a non-empty list.
4. **`k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2**: Since `sz` is 0, this implies that `k` must be at least 2.
5. **If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of**: Since `sz` is 0 and `k` is at least 2, this condition is not met, and no breaking out of loops or if statements occurs.
6. **Otherwise, no changes are made to `sz`, `sng`, or `rdb`**: This means that during the execution of the code snippet provided, `sz`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
- **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state provided. However, based on the context, it is likely that `elem` is an element from the `rdb` list, given that `rdb` is the only list mentioned that has elements and no other variables are provided.

### Output Calculation:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and not followed by a newline character due to `end=' '`.

### Final Output:
Given the information provided, the exact value of `elem` is unknown, but the format of the output is clear. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the rdb list)**
