The code snippet provided sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `nums` is updated to be sorted in reverse order. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is the list of integers read from the new input, sorted in descending order.**
