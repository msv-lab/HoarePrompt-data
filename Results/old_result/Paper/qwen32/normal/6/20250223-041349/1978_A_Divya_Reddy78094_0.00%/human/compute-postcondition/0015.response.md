To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 499\). However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `nums[0]` is the first element of the sorted list, which is the largest element.
- `nums[1]` is the second element of the sorted list, which is the second largest element.

Given that `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` will always be the largest number, and `nums[1]` will always be the second largest number in the list.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of the largest and the second largest numbers in the `nums` list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest number and nums[1] is the second largest number in the sorted list `nums`)**
