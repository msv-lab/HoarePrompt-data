You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each integer represents the number of pages in each book. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 500; all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of books and the number of pages in each book. It outputs the sum of the pages of the two books with the most pages for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

The provided program sorts the list of books in descending order of pages and then sums the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages. This approach works because, in order to maximize the total number of pages read, Alice should read the two books with the highest number of pages, regardless of how the other books are divided into the two piles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
2. **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted in descending order. This means the highest number of pages will be at the start of the list.
3. **Summing the Top Two Books**: The program then sums the pages of the first two books in the sorted list, which are the two books with the highest number of pages.
4. **Output**: The sum is printed for each test case.

Since the strategy of picking the two books with the highest number of pages ensures that Alice reads the maximum possible number of pages, and the provided program correctly implements this strategy, the program is correct.
