The given code snippet is:

```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variable `t`**: This represents the number of test cases. Since the problem statement does not require us to iterate through multiple test cases or use `t` in the print statement, we can ignore it for the purpose of this specific print statement.

2. **Variable `n`**: This variable is mentioned in the initial state but is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we can ignore it for the purpose of this print statement.

3. **List `nums`**: This is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means that the largest integer is at index 0, the second largest is at index 1, and so on.

### Calculation for the Print Statement:

- `nums[0]`: This is the first element of the list `nums`, which is the largest integer in the list.
- `nums[1]`: This is the second element of the list `nums`, which is the second largest integer in the list.

The print statement calculates the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

### Output:

Since we do not have the exact values of the integers in the list `nums`, we can only describe the output in terms of the properties of the list. The output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list `nums`)**
