The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given the initial state, `g` is initially `n / 2` and `countmins` is 1. Therefore, after the operation, `g` becomes `n / 2 - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 1`, and `ans` is `n`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
