The given code snippet updates the value of `g` by setting it to `n / count`. Based on the initial state, `count` is 3, so `g` is now `n / 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `n / 3`.**
