The value of `g` is decreased by `countmins`. Given the initial state, `g` is initially `n / count`, and `countmins` is 1. Therefore, after the operation `g -= countmins`, the new value of `g` will be `n / count - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / count - 1`.**
