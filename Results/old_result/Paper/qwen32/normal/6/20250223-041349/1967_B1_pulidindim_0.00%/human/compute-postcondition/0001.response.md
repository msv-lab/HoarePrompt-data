In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, which is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to consider the value of `t`. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `t-1`, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that the problem statement specifies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will always execute as long as `t` is within this range.

The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head. They are mentioned in the context of each test case within the loop, but they do not affect whether the loop itself will execute.

Therefore, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints. No adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0 (initial value before the loop starts)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute as per the given constraints.
