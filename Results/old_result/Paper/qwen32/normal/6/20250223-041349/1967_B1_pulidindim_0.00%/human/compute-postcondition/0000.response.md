Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
