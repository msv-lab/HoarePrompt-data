The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` based on the input, but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, `g`).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `count` is `m + 1` if the loop runs until `count` exceeds `m`, `ans` is the accumulated value after all valid iterations, `countmins` is `count - 1`, and `g` is `n / count - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before `count` reaches `m + 1`.**
