Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal MEX score based on the strategies of Alice and Bob. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program does not simulate the game turns between Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly tries to find the smallest missing non-negative integer (MEX) without considering the optimal moves of both players.

2. The logic in the loop does not correctly account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it. The current logic only checks for the smallest missing number without simulating the game process.

3. The program does not handle cases where multiple elements of the same value exist and how they affect the MEX. Specifically, it does not consider the impact of Alice choosing a number that forces Bob into a suboptimal position.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the frequency of each number and use a strategy that accounts for both players' objectives. Here is a corrected approach:

- Count the frequency of each number in the array.
- Determine the smallest number that appears an odd number of times. This is because Alice can always choose this number on her turn to maximize the MEX.
- If no such number exists, the MEX will be the smallest number that does not appear in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mpp[i] % 2 == 1:
                mex = i + 1
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

This program correctly determines the MEX by considering the optimal moves of both players based on the frequency of each number in the array.
