Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `first`, `arr`, or `mpp`.
