Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-1`, `first` is `True` if there was at least one element in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was not the first such element encountered, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is unchanged, `mpp` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is n, first is True if there is at least one integer in arr that appears exactly once, otherwise False, n is unchanged, arr is unchanged, mpp is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `first` is `True` if there was any integer in `arr` that occurred exactly once, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
