To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the provided loop and the initial conditions. Here is the loop again for reference:

```python
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n` (which will be updated by the loop)
   - `first` is `False`
   - `n` is the input integer (the number of iterations)
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
   - If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
   - If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`, `first` is set to `True`.

### Output States After Iterations:
- **After 1st iteration (`i = 0`):**
  - `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `first` is True or False based on `mpp[0]`.
  
- **After 2nd iteration (`i = 1`):**
  - `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `first` is True or False based on `mpp[1]`.

- **After 3rd iteration (`i = 2`):**
  - `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True or False based on `mpp[2]`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until one of the following conditions is met:
- `i` is not a key in `mpp`, and it will print `i` and break.
- `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, and it will print `i` and break.

If none of these conditions are met during any of the iterations, the loop will complete all `n` iterations. In this case, `i` will be `n` (since the loop variable `i` is updated in each iteration and the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`), and `first` will be `True` if there was any integer in `arr` that occurred exactly once.

### Conclusion:
- **If the loop completes all `n` iterations without breaking:**
  - `i` will be `n`.
  - `first` will be `True` if there was any integer in `arr` that occurred exactly once.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `first` is `True` if there was any integer in `arr` that occurred exactly once, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**
