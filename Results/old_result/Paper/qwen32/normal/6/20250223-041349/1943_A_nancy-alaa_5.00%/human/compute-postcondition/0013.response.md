Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`, and `first` is `False` if the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not met. If `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
