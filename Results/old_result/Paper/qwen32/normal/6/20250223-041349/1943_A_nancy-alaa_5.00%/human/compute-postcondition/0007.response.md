Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
3. `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
4. `first` is `False`.
5. `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is mentioned in the initial state as not being a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`. However, the exact value of `i` is not explicitly provided.
- Since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it means `i` is not one of the elements in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `i` is unknown from the given information except for the fact that it is not in `arr`.
- Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i` as it is, which is not specified in the initial state.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, the output will simply be the value of `i` as it is.

Output: **i (where i is a value not present in the list `arr`)**
