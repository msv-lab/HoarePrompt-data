The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`, which counts the frequency of each element in `arr`. This new `Counter` object is assigned to the variable `mpp`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
