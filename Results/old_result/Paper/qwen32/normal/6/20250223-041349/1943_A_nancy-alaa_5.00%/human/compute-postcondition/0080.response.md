The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is not a key in `mpp`.**
