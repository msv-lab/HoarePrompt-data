The code snippet reassigns `arr` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. The other variables (`i`, `first`, `n`, `mpp`) remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is unchanged.**
