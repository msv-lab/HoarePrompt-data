To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `first` is determined based on the value of `mpp[i]`. However, the value of `first` does not affect what is printed by `print(i)`.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified and does not affect the output of `print(i)`.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the state remains unchanged. However, since `i` is explicitly set to 1, this condition does not change the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 1 and no other part of the code modifies `i`, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
