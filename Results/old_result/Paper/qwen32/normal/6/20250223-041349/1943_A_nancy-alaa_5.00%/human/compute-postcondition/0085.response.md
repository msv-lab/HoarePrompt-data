Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then `i` is not present in the keys of `mpp`. If `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
