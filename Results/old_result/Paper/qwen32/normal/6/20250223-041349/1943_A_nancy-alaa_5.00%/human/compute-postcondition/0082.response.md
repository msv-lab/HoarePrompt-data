Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then `i` is not present in the keys of `mpp`.**
