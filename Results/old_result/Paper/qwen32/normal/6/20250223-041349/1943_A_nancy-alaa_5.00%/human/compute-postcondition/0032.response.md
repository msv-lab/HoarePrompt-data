Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 2` and `n` is greater than `i`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is true, then the condition inside the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition inside the if statement is not satisfied.**
