The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. The variables `i`, `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given that the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by the input, the state of the variables `i`, `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` should remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count, which is managed by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration with respect to the variables provided.

State: **`i` is `n`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise False, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is unchanged, `mpp` is unchanged**.
