For the given task, we need to ensure that the for loop can execute based on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is the input value that determines the number of iterations, which is `n` in the description.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object here is the range determined by the input value `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if the range is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The state needs to ensure that the input value `n` is greater than 0. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 × 10^5, so it already satisfies the condition to execute the loop. However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting the state based on the loop head, we should specify that `n` must be greater than 0.

Since the state already ensures that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), no further adjustment is needed in terms of the value of `n`. The loop will definitely execute given the constraints.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**

However, since the problem specifies that `n` is already within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, we can also state it as:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 × 10^5**

This ensures that the loop will execute as intended.
