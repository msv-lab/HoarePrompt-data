Let's analyze the given code and compare it to the problem requirements step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- Since Alice starts and both players play optimally, Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob will try to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The optimal strategy involves understanding the frequency of each element in `a` and how they can be used to maximize/minimize the MEX.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**: The code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`. It incorrectly assumes that the first missing number after encountering a number with a single occurrence is the MEX.
2. **Handling of Element Frequencies**: The code does not handle the case where multiple elements have the same frequency or when the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob's moves.
3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The code does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply checks for the first missing number based on the frequency of elements, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` when both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**
