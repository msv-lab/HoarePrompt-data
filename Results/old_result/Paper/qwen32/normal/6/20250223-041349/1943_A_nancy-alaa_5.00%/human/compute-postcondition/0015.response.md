Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`, and `first` is `True`. Additionally, `mpp[i]` is equal to 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `first` has been changed to `True`. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
