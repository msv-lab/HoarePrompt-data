To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: It is mentioned as `i is i + 1`, which seems to be a reassignment indicating that `i` is incremented by 1. However, the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, so we can denote it as `i = i_initial + 1` where `i_initial` is the initial value of `i` before the increment.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is mentioned that `n` is greater than `i`, i.e., `n > i`.
3. **Condition involving `mpp`**: If `i` was not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, the exact structure of `mpp` and the context of the loop or if statement are not provided, so we can't determine the exact behavior based solely on this information.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Explanation:
Given the conditions and the code snippet:
- The value of `i` is `i_initial + 1`, where `i_initial` is the value of `i` before the increment.
- The exact value of `i_initial` is not provided, but we know that `i` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` is greater than `i`, but this does not affect the value of `i` directly.
- The condition involving `mpp` does not affect the value of `i` unless it breaks out of the loop or if statement. However, the exact structure of the loop or if statement is not provided, so we can't determine if this condition is met or not.

### Output:
Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the value of `i` as `i_initial + 1`.

Output: **i (where i is i_initial + 1 and i_initial is the initial value of i before the increment)**
