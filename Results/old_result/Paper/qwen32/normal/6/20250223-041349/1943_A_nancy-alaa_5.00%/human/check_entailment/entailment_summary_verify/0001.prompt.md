You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, ensuring that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one is chosen.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code and compare it to the problem requirements step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- Since Alice starts and both players play optimally, Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob will try to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The optimal strategy involves understanding the frequency of each element in `a` and how they can be used to maximize/minimize the MEX.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**: The code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`. It incorrectly assumes that the first missing number after encountering a number with a single occurrence is the MEX.
2. **Handling of Element Frequencies**: The code does not handle the case where multiple elements have the same frequency or when the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob's moves.
3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The code does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply checks for the first missing number based on the frequency of elements, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` when both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**
