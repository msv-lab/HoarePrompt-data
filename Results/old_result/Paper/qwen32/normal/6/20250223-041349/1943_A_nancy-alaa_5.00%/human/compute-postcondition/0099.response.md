Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `n` is greater than 2 (this detail is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement).
3. `first` is True (this detail is also not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement).
4. `arr` is a list of integers (the specific integers are not provided, but this detail is not needed for the `print(i)` statement).
5. `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr` (this detail is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement, unless `i` were to be used to access `mpp`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly given as 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
