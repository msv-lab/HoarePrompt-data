The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the range of the input integer. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the input integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- The conditions involving `B * 2 < C` and `A` are already evaluated and do not affect the loop variable `i`.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**
