Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided example.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given that:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles under promotion.
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the following logic:

1. **If `a * 2 < b`**:
   - It means buying two yogurts separately is cheaper than buying them under promotion. Hence, the cost is `n * a`.
2. **If `a * 2 >= b` and `n` is even**:
   - It means buying two yogurts under promotion is cheaper or equal in price to buying them separately, and `n` is even. Hence, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. **If `a * 2 >= b` and `n` is odd**:
   - It means buying two yogurts under promotion is cheaper or equal in price to buying them separately, and `n` is odd. Hence, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a * 2 < b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print(int(n * b / 2))
        else:
            print(int((n // 2) * b + a))
```

### Example Validation:
Let's validate the program against the provided example.

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `a * 2 = 10` which is not less than `b = 9`.
   - `n` is even.
   - Cost = `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.
   - **Output**: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - `a * 2 = 10` which is not less than `b = 9`.
   - `n` is odd.
   - Cost = `((3 - 1) / 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Output**: `14`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `a * 2 = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - Cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - **Output**: `15`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - `a * 2 = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - `n` is even.
   - Cost = `(4 / 2) * 10 = 20`.
   - **Output**: `20`.

The program produces the correct output for all the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
