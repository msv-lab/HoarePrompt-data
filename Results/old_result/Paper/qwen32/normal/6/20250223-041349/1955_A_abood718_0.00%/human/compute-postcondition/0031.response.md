Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the integer provided as input. For each of these iterations, the loop reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. Depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, it prints specific values as follows:
- If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`.
- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `n` sets of integers `(A, B, C)` and printed the results based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values, and the loop counter `i` will have reached `n`.
