Let's analyze the program and the logic it uses to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts during promotion).

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Case 1: `b * 2 < a`**
     - If the price of two yogurts during promotion (`b`) is less than half the price of buying two yogurts individually (`a * 2`), it is cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs.
     - Therefore, the cost is `n * b` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) * b + a` if `n` is odd.
     - However, the program incorrectly prints `n * a` in this case, which is not optimal.
   - **Case 2: `n % 2 == 0`**
     - If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs.
     - The cost is `(n // 2) * b`.
   - **Case 3: `n % 2 != 0`**
     - If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy `n - 1` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually.
     - The cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Errors in the Program:
- In the first condition (`if B * 2 < C`), the program incorrectly prints `A * B` instead of calculating the cost based on whether `A` is even or odd.
- The print statement `print(X)` in the else block is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
- If `b * 2 < a`, the cost should be:
  - `(n // 2) * b + a` if `n` is odd.
  - `n * b` if `n` is even.
- If `b * 2 >= a`, the cost should be:
  - `(n // 2) * b + a` if `n` is odd.
  - `(n // 2) * b` if `n` is even.

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b * 2 < a:
            cost = (n // 2) * b + (a if n % 2 != 0 else 0)
        else:
            cost = (n // 2) * b + (a if n % 2 != 0 else 0)
        
        print(cost)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the case where `b * 2 < a`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
