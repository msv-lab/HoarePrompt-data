### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts in promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Comparison**:
   - If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buying in pairs using the promotion might be cheaper.

2. **Handling Odd and Even Counts**:
   - If `n` is even, it's straightforward to buy `n/2` pairs.
   - If `n` is odd, buy `(n-1)/2` pairs and one yogurt individually.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:

1. **Reading Inputs**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `2*a < b`, it prints `n*a` (buying all yogurts individually).
   - If `n` is even, it prints `n*b/2` (buying all yogurts in pairs).
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates `X = n // 2` and then prints `X` and `X*b + a` (which seems incorrect as it prints two values instead of one).

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for handling odd `n` is incorrect. Specifically, the line `print(X)` is unnecessary and the final print statement should be `print(X*b + a)` without the extra `print(X)`.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary describes the program's behavior accurately but highlights that the logic for handling odd `n` is flawed. The summary states:

- If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`.
- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.

The issue here is the extra `print(X)` statement, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to print only the final cost.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program is incorrect due to the extra print statement and the incorrect handling of the odd `n` case.

### Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(X * b)
            else:
                print(X * b + a)

# func()  # Uncomment to run the function
```

This corrected version will now correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
