You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the integer provided as input. For each of these iterations, the loop reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. Depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, it prints specific values as follows:
    #- If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
    #- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`.
    #- If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on the conditions involving these integers. Specifically, it prints `A * B` if `B * 2` is less than `C`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts in promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Comparison**: 
   - If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buying in pairs using the promotion might be cheaper.

2. **Handling Odd and Even Counts**:
   - If `n` is even, it's straightforward to buy `n/2` pairs.
   - If `n` is odd, buy `(n-1)/2` pairs and one yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:

1. **Reading Inputs**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `2*a < b`, it prints `n*a` (buying all yogurts individually).
   - If `n` is even, it prints `n*b/2` (buying all yogurts in pairs).
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates `X = n // 2` and then prints `X` and `X*b + a` (which seems incorrect as it prints two values instead of one).

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for handling odd `n` is incorrect. Specifically, the line `print(X)` is unnecessary and the final print statement should be `print(X*b + a)` without the extra `print(X)`.

### Corrected Logic:
- For `n` yogurts:
  - If `2*a < b`, the cost is `n*a`.
  - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n/2)*b`.
  - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n-1)/2)*b + a`.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program is incorrect due to the extra print statement and the incorrect handling of the odd `n` case.

### Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(X * b)
            else:
                print(X * b + a)

# func()  # Uncomment to run the function
```

This corrected version will now correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case.
