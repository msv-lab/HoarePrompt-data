To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and 1 and 30 (inclusive) respectively.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `A * C / 2` multiplies `A` and `C` and then divides the result by 2.
- The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the division to an integer, effectively performing integer division.

### Output:
The output will be the integer result of the division of `(A * C)` by 2. Since `A` and `C` are integers, the result of `A * C` is also an integer. Dividing this integer by 2 and converting it to an integer using `int()` will yield the final output.

### Final Output:
Output: **the integer result of (A * C) / 2** (where A and C are the values of A and C obtained from the input)
