Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The problematic part of the code is:

```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```

Here, the code prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating and printing the total cost. This is incorrect and should be removed. Additionally, the calculation for the total cost when `A` is odd is incorrect. It should be:

```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X * C + B)
```

Let's test the code with an example to see the issue:

For the input:
```
1
3 5 11
```

The correct output should be `15` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles) results in a total of `11 + 5 = 16` burles. However, the given code will print `1` (which is `X`) and then `16` (which is `X * C + B`), which is incorrect.

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            Y = A % 2
            print(X * C + Y * B)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum cost for any number of yogurts `A`, given the prices `B` and `C`.
