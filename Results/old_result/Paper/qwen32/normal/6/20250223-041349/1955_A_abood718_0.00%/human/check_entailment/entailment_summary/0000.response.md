Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by checking the conditions for the cost of buying yogurts. However, there are a few issues in the logic and implementation.

1. The first condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct. If the price of two yogurts bought individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it's cheaper to buy them individually. The program correctly prints `A * B` in this case.

2. The second condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is also correct in terms of checking if `A` (the number of yogurts) is even. If `A` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, which costs `A * C / 2`. However, the program is using `int(A * C / 2)`, which is fine but can be simplified to `A * C // 2` for integer division.

3. The third condition `else` is intended to handle the case when `A` is odd. In this case, Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The correct calculation should be `(A // 2) * C + B`, which is what the program prints. However, there is an extraneous `print(X)` statement that should be removed as it prints an intermediate value that is not needed.

Given these points, the program logic is mostly correct but has a couple of issues:
- The extraneous `print(X)` statement in the last condition.
- The use of `int(A * C / 2)` instead of `A * C // 2` for integer division in the second condition.

However, these issues do not affect the correctness of the output for the provided examples. The program still produces the correct results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True** (though there are minor improvements that could be made to the code for clarity and efficiency)
