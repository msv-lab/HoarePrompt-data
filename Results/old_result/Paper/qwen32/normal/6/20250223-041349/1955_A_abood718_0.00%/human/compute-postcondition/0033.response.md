Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on the conditions involving these integers. Specifically, it prints `A * B` if `B * 2` is less than `C`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`. If `B * 2` is not less than `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.**
