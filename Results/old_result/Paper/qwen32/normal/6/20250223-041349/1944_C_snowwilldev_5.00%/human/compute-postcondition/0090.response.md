Output State: **`i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than 0, the loop has finished executing, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of `i`, `N`, or `cnt[i]`. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `N`, `N` remains greater than 0, and the loop has finished executing. The condition regarding `cnt[i]` and `t` is not affected by this `break` statement.
