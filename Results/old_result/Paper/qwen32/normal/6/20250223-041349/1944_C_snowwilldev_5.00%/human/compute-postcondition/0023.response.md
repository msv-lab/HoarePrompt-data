Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`t`** is either 0 or 2.
2. **`N`** is greater than 0.
3. **`a`** is a list of integers.
4. **`cnt`** is a `defaultdict` where `cnt[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
5. The current value of **`i`** is `N-2`.
6. If `cnt[i] == 1`, then `t` is set to 2; otherwise, `t` remains 0.

### Analysis:
The print statement is `print(i)`. According to the initial state, the current value of `i` is `N-2`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as `N-2`.
- The value of `N` is greater than 0, so `N-2` will be a non-negative integer (it can be 0 if `N` is 2, or a positive integer if `N` is greater than 2).
- The value of `t` does not affect the value of `i`, and thus does not influence the output of the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `N-2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **N-2 (where N is greater than 0)**
