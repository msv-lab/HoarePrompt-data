Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `i` is equal to `N`.
- `N` is greater than 0.
- The loop has finished executing.
- If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, `t` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is equal to `N`. The value of `N` is provided to be greater than 0, and the loop has finished executing. However, the loop's specific behavior and the variable `cnt` are not detailed enough to affect the value of `i` directly, as the print statement only references `i`.

The variable `t` is mentioned but is not relevant to the output of the `print(i)` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will simply be the value of `i`, which is `N`.

Output: **N (where N is greater than 0)**
