Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`, and the current value of `i` is `N-2`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1. If `t` was initially 0, it becomes 1. If `t` was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
