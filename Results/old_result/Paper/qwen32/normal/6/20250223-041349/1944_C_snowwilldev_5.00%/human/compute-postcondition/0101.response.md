Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` such that either `i` appears exactly once in the list `a` or `i` does not appear at all in the list `a`. The function does not return any value; its output is the printed integers for each test case.**
