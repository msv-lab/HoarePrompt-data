The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
