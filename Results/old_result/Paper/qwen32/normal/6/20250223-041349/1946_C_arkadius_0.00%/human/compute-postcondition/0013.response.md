To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and the behavior of the function `func_4`. However, the details of the `func_4` function are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's behavior based on the given inputs.

Given:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `tree` is an instance of `Tree` that has been rooted at node 0.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.

Since the exact behavior and return value of `func_4` are not specified, we can only describe the output as the result of calling `func_4` with the provided arguments.

Output: **result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is an instance of Tree rooted at node 0, n is an integer greater than 1, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n)**
