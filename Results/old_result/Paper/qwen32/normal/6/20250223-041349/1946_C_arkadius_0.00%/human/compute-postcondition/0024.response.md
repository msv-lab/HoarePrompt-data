Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `tree`, `v`, and `x`. `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `v` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. The function calculates and returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of the `good_components_subtree` for all children of `v` plus the count of children where the `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is 1 plus the sum of the `remaining_size_subtree` for all children of `v` where the `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.**
