Output State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). `u` is `u_next`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
