Output State: **The program returns the total count of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex `s` (including `s` itself if `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size >= x`) and the sum of the remaining sizes of all subtrees rooted at `s` where the remaining size is less than `x`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns two values:
1. The number of good components in the subtree starting from vertex `s`, considering `s` itself as a good component if its remaining size is at least `x`.
2. The sum of the sizes of all subtrees rooted at `s` where each subtree's size is less than `x`.
