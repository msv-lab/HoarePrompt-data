The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` remains the same because it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is 2**
