Postcondition: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. `stack` has one less element if it had more than one element before popping. If `postorder` is `False`, the state of `tree` and `stack` remains as per the precondition.**
