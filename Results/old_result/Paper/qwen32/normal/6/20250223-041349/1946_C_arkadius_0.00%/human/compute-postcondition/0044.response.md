Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack` and is `True`, `stack` has one less element. `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping.**
