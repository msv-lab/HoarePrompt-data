The code snippet takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`. After the code executes, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`**.
