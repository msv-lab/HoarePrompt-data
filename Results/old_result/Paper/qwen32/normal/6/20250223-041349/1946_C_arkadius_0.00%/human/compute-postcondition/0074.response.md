Postcondition: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`. If `postorder` is empty, `stack` has `n + 1` elements where the first element is `(v, True)` and the remaining `n` elements are `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`. Otherwise, `stack` has one less element than before.**
