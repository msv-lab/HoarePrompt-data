The code snippet `stack.append((u, False))` adds a new element `(u, False)` to the `stack`. This means `stack` now has one more element than before, specifically the element `(u, False)` is appended to the end of the `stack`.

The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged as they were the values of the last element popped from `stack` before the append operation. The precondition that `stack` had one more element than before, which is `(v, True)`, is still valid except now there is an additional element `(u, False)` at the end of the `stack`.

The precondition that `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element is also still valid as it pertains to the variable `v` which has not been modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`; `stack` has two more elements than before, which are `(v, True)` and `(u, False)`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element.**
