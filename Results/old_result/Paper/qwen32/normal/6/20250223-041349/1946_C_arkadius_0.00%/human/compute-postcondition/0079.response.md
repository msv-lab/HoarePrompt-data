Output State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u`. The current value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
