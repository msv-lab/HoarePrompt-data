Output State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element `u_next` (where `u_next` is the next child after `u_current` in `tree.vertices[v].children`). `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In simpler terms, the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` is increased by the `remaining_size` of vertex `u`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
