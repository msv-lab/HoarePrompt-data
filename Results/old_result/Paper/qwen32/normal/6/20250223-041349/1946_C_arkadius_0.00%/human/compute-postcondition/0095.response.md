Output State: **The stack is empty, and for each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the total count of good components in the subtree rooted at `v` (including `v` itself if `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size >= x`), and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all subtrees rooted at `v` where the remaining size is less than `x`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the stack will be empty, meaning there are no more vertices to process. Each vertex in the tree will have its `good_components` attribute set to the total number of good components in its subtree, including the vertex itself if its `remaining_size` is at least `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of each vertex will be the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children's subtrees where the `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
