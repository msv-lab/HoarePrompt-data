Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` has one less element if `postorder` was `True`, otherwise it has `len(tree.vertices[v].children) + 1` elements which are the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`. `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `postorder` remains `True` if it was `True` in the popped tuple, and `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping. If `postorder` was `False` and `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element, `stack` is updated with the specified tuples.**
