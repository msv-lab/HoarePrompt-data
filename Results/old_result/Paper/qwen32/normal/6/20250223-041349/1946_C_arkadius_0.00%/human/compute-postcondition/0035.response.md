Output State: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` now has one more element which is the tuple `(v, True)`, `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`, `postorder` remains `True` if it was `True` in the popped tuple, and `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping.**

In simpler terms: The variable `v` retains its value as the first element of the last tuple that was popped from `stack`. The variable `postorder` retains its value as the second element of the last tuple that was popped from `stack`. A new tuple `(v, True)` is added to `stack`, increasing its size by one. The `tree` object remains unchanged, and the conditions regarding `postorder` and the state of `stack` (whether it is empty or not) are preserved based on their previous values.
