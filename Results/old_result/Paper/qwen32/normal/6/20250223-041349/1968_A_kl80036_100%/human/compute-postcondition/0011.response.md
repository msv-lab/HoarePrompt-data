Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it is provided for context).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `y`. According to the initial state, `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an input integer, the value of `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is the input integer)**
