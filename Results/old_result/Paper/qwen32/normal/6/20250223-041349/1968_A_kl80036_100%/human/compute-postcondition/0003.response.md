Given the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it provides context).
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, the value of `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

Given that `x` is the first input integer, we cannot determine its exact numerical value without the specific input. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the first input integer)**
