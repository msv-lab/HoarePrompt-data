The given code snippet appends a new value to the `dp` list based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Here's the calculation:

1. `dp[-1]` refers to the last element in the `dp` list, which is `(1 + 2 * (i - 1)) % 1000000016`. Since `i` is 3, `dp[-1]` is `(1 + 2 * (3 - 1)) % 1000000016` which simplifies to `(1 + 4) % 1000000016` or `5`.
2. `dp[-2]` refers to the second last element in the `dp` list, which is `1`.
3. The formula then becomes `(5 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which simplifies to `(5 + 4) % 1000000007` or `9 % 1000000007` which is `9`.

Thus, the new value `9` is appended to the `dp` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [1, 5, 9], `i` is 3**.
