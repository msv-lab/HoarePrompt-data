Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of configurations, but it does not account for all possible scenarios correctly.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach that seems to be incorrectly defined for this problem. The formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` does not accurately represent the number of configurations for placing rooks on a chessboard without attacking each other.

2. **Handling of `n` Reduction:** The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is incorrect. If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2, and if `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1. However, this does not accurately reflect the remaining number of positions available for placing rooks.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:** The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is very large or when `k` is close to `n`, the program might not compute the correct number of configurations.

Here is a potential counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- After the first move (1, 2), the computer places a black rook at (2, 1).
- After the second move (3, 4), the computer places a black rook at (4, 3).
- The only remaining valid move is placing a rook at (2, 3) and (3, 2), which results in the same configuration.

**Actual Output:**
The program might not correctly compute this and could output an incorrect number of configurations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible cases and scenarios correctly.
