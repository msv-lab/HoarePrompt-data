### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an `n x n` chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player and the computer alternate turns, with the computer mirroring the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - After `k` moves, we need to determine the number of possible final configurations of the board.
   - The configurations are to be counted modulo `10^9+7`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move reduces the number of available positions for future moves:
     - If a move is not on the diagonal (`r != c`), both `r` and `c` rows/columns are occupied, reducing `n` by 2.
     - If a move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), only one row/column is occupied, reducing `n` by 1.
   - After `k` moves, the remaining number of positions to be filled is `n - 2k` for non-diagonal moves and `n - k` for diagonal moves combined, effectively reducing `n` by `2k - d`, where `d` is the number of diagonal moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board using a dynamic programming approach.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` non-attacking rooks.
   - This recurrence relation is derived from considering the placement of the first rook and the remaining placements.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then processes each of the `k` moves, adjusting `n` based on whether the move is diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations and prints the result modulo `10^9+7`.

5. **Function Summary Evaluation:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1(n)` always results in the integer 39, which is incorrect.
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to compute the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks, which should vary with `n` and not always return 39.
   - The recurrence relation and dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` are correct, but the summary is inaccurate.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for adjusting `n` based on the moves is correct.
   - The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks.
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect function summary. While the implementation logic and dynamic programming approach are correct, the summary of `func_1(n)` being always 39 is false.

Final: **False**
