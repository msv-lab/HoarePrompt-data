Reasoning: The provided program contains a significant issue that makes it incorrect based on the problem description and the execution summary. The program is supposed to compute the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the game has continued from the k moves, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, the function `func_1(n)` is not correctly implemented to achieve this. 

The execution summary indicates that for any input `n`, the function `func_1(n)` always returns 39, which is incorrect as demonstrated by the provided example outputs. For instance, in the first test case, the expected output is 3, not 39. Similarly, for the second and third test cases, the expected outputs are 331 and 671968183, respectively, which are not produced by the function.

The logic in `func_1(n)` seems to be attempting to compute something related to the number of configurations, but it does not correctly account for the rules of the game and the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the function should consider the remaining available positions for placing rooks after the k moves and compute the number of ways to fill these positions such that no two rooks attack each other.

Given the discrepancy between the expected outputs and the actual outputs produced by the function, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
