To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value that will be appended to the `dp` list based on the provided formula:

```
dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
```

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a list with values `[5, 9]`.
- `i` is `4`.

Let's calculate the new value to be appended to `dp`:
- `dp[-1]` is the last element of `dp`, which is `9`.
- `dp[-2]` is the second last element of `dp`, which is `5`.
- `i` is `4`.

Substitute these values into the formula:
```
new_value = (9 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 5) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
          = (9 + 2 * 3 * 5) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
          = (9 + 30) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
          = 39 % 1000000016
          = 39
```

The new value `39` is appended to the `dp` list, making `dp` now `[5, 9, 39]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [5, 9, 39], `i` is 4**.
