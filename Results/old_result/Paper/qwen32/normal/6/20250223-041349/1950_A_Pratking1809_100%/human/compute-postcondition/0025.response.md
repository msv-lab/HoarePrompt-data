Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true; otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is evaluated but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
