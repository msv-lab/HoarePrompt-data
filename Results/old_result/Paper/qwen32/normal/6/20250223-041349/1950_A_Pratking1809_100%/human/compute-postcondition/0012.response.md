The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `q` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `q`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1**
