You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `q`. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, and for each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` were read from the input and the appropriate condition (`STAIR`, `PEAK`, or `NONE`) was printed based on the comparison of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each ranging from 0 to 9) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions:

- **Stair**: The condition `a < b < c` is checked, and if true, it prints "STAIR".
- **Peak**: The condition `a < b > c` is checked, and if true, it prints "PEAK".
- **Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible combinations of digits a, b, and c within the range 0 to 9. It processes multiple test cases as specified by the input integer `t`. The logic is straightforward and covers all edge cases, such as when all digits are the same (which would result in "NONE"), or when the digits are in decreasing order (which would also result in "NONE" unless they form a peak).

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
