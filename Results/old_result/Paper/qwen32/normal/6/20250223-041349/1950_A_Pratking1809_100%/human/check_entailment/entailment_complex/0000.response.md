Reasoning:
The provided function `func` correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `q` from the input. It then iterates `q` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` which corresponds to the "stair" condition. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It checks if `a < b > c` which corresponds to the "peak" condition. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, the function prints the appropriate string based on the conditions met by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The function correctly handles all possible combinations of inputs as per the problem description and the given example. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
