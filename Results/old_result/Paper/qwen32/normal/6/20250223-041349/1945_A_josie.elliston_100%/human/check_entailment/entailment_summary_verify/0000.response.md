Let's analyze the code and the original assessment systematically to determine if the program is correct or incorrect based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

### Problem Recap:
- **Introverts (a):** Must be in tents alone.
- **Extroverts (b):** Must be in tents with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c):** Can be in tents alone, with one other, or with two others.
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
   - Checks if the number of extroverts (`b`) is divisible by 3.
   - If not, it checks if the remainder of extroverts plus universals is at least 3, indicating that the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a tent.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals by 3, rounding up if necessary (`ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`).

2. **Function `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

### Function Summary:
- `func_2` takes three non-negative integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) and returns the sum of introverts and the number of tents required for extroverts and universals, or `-1` if it's not possible.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:
The original assessment points out a specific case where the code might fail:
- **Case:** `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`
  - According to the problem, 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form a single tent.
  - `func_1` returns `None` because `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 1 < 3` is `True`.
  - Therefore, `func_2` returns `-1`, which is incorrect.

### Additional Test Cases:
Let's consider a few more cases to ensure the code's correctness:
- **Case:** `a = 0`, `b = 3`, `c = 0`
  - 3 extroverts can form a single tent.
  - `func_1` returns `1`.
  - `func_2` returns `0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
- **Case:** `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
  - 1 introvert needs a single tent.
  - `func_1` returns `0`.
  - `func_2` returns `1 + 0 = 1`, which is correct.
- **Case:** `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 2`
  - 2 extroverts and 2 universals can form two tents.
  - `func_1` returns `2`.
  - `func_2` returns `0 + 2 = 2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The code does not handle all cases properly, particularly when the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough universals to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts.

**Final:** **False**
