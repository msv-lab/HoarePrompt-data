### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to ensure they correctly implement the logic needed to solve it.

**Problem Breakdown:**
- **Introverts (a):** Each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
- **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c):** Universals can go in any tent configuration.

**Objective:**
- Find the minimum number of tents required to satisfy the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, return -1.

**Logic Needed:**
1. **Tents for Introverts:** Each introvert needs one tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
2. **Tents for Extroverts:** Each extrovert needs a tent with two others, so we need to form groups of three for extroverts. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to check if we can use universals to complete the groups.
3. **Using Universals:**
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, then we need `3 - (b % 3)` universals to complete the last group of extroverts.
   - If we don't have enough universals, it's impossible to form the required groups, and we should return -1.
   - Otherwise, we can form the groups and calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.

**Function Analysis:**

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - **Purpose:** Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - **Logic:**
    - If `b % 3 != 0`, check if we have enough universals to complete the last group.
    - If not, return `None`.
    - Otherwise, return the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3.
  - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and ensures that we have enough universals to form complete groups.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of tents needed.
  - **Logic:**
    - Call `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
    - If `func_1` returns `None`, return -1 (impossible to form groups).
    - Otherwise, return the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.
  - **Correctness:** The function correctly combines the number of tents needed for introverts with the result from `func_1`.

**Conclusion:**
The provided functions correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. They handle all edge cases, including when it's impossible to form the required groups for extroverts.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The provided functions correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. They handle the requirements for introverts, extroverts, and universals, and correctly return the minimum number of tents or -1 if it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences.
Correctness: **True**
