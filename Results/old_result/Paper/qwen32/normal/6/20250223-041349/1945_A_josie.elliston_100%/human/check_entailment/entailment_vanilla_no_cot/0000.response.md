To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Let's break down the logic behind the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to determine the number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - It first checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (less than 3) can be accommodated with the universals to form a tent of 3.
   - If the remaining extroverts cannot be accommodated with the universals, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed for these participants.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals according to the rules, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.

Now, let's consider some edge cases and test cases to verify the correctness of the program:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
  - 1 tent for 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 3.
  - The program should output: 3.

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 tent for 3 extroverts.
  - 1 extrovert and 1 universal are left.
  - The program should output: -1 (as the remaining extrovert cannot form a tent with the universal).

- **Test Case 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 tent for 3 extroverts.
  - 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 3.
  - The program should output: 3.

- **Test Case 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - The extrovert and the universal cannot form a valid tent together.
  - The program should output: -1.

- **Test Case 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 tent for 3 extroverts.
  - 1 tent for 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 3.
  - The program should output: 3.

- **Test Case 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
  - 19 tents for the introverts.
  - 2 tents for 6 extroverts.
  - 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
  - 5 tents for 16 universals.
  - Total tents: 28.
  - The program should output: 28.

The program logic seems correct for the provided test cases and edge cases. It correctly handles the conditions where it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and calculates the minimum number of tents needed otherwise.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
