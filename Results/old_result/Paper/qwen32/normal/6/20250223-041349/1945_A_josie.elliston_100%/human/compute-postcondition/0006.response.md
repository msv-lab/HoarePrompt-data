Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. If certain conditions are met (not explicitly detailed in the output description), the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
