### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least two friends come to the party. According to the problem description, if there exists a pair of friends \( i \) and \( p_i \) such that \( v[v[i]] = i \), then sending invitations to these two friends is sufficient, and the answer is 2. If no such pair exists, Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends to ensure that at least two come to the party.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list \( p \) of best friends.
3. It checks if there exists any \( i \) such that \( v[v[i]] = i \). If such an \( i \) is found, it prints 2 and exits the function.
4. If no such \( i \) is found, it prints 3.

The reasoning and implementation align with the problem description. Therefore, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
