The given `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `2`.

Let's break down the provided initial state to ensure it doesn't affect the print statement:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers provided in the input, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement is `print(2)`, it will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, or `i`.

Output: **2**
