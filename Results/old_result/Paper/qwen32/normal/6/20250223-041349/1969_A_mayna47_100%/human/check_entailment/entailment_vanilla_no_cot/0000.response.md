Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then only 2 invitations are needed. However, this is not always the case.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
1 4 3 2
```
In this scenario, the friendships are arranged in a cycle: 1's best friend is 4, 4's best friend is 3, 3's best friend is 2, and 2's best friend is 1. In this case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 people to ensure that at least 2 come to the party (for example, inviting 1, 2, and 3 would result in 2 and 3 attending).

The program incorrectly prints `2` for this case, as it only checks for pairs of mutual best friends and does not consider cycles or other configurations that might require more invitations. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.
