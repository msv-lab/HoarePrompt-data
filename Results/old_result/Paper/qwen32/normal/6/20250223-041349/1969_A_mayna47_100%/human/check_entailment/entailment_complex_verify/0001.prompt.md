You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without finding any `i` such that `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. The variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from the input. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such index is found after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. The key points to consider are:

1. **Friendship Pairs**: Each friend \( i \) has a best friend \( p_i \) such that \( p_i \ne i \) and all \( p_i \) are distinct.
2. **Invitation Requirement**: A friend \( i \) will attend the party if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive invitations.
3. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least two friends attend.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem with the following logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list of best friends \( p \).

2. **Checking for Direct Pairs**:
   - It iterates through each friend \( i \) and checks if \( v[v[i]] = i \). This condition would indicate a mutual friendship where \( i \) and \( p_i \) are best friends of each other.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only two invitations are needed: one for \( i \) and one for \( p_i \).

3. **Fallback Case**:
   - If no such mutual pair is found, it defaults to printing `3`.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for all possible scenarios. Here’s why:

- **Mutual Pairs**: The program correctly identifies pairs where \( v[v[i]] = i \) and returns `2` if such a pair exists. This is correct because it's the minimum number of invitations needed in this case.
  
- **Non-Mutual Pairs**: However, the program assumes that if no mutual pair is found, the answer is always `3`. This is incorrect. There are scenarios where the minimum number of invitations is `2` even if no mutual pairs exist.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
4
2 4
```
Here, \( p_1 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 4 \), and \( p_3 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). There are no mutual pairs, but Monocarp can invite friends `1` and `3`, and both `2` and `4` will attend the party. Thus, the correct answer is `2`, not `3`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all scenarios correctly. It fails to consider cases where the minimum number of invitations is `2` even in the absence of mutual pairs.
