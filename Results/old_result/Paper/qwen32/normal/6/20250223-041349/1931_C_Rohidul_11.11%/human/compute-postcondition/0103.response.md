Postcondition: **`r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
