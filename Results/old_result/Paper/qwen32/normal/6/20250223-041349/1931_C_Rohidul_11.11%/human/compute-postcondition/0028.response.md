Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is the first index from the end where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**
