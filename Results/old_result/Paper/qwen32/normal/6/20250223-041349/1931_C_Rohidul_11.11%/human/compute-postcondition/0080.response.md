The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given the initial state, `st` was 1, so after the increment, `st` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n > 1`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**.
