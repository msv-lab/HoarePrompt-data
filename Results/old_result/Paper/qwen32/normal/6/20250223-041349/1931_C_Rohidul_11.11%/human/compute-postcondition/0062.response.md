Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, `r` is `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, otherwise the index where the sequence of equal elements stops, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops, `ans` is `r - l` if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and all elements are the same, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**
