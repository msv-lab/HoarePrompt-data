The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the length of the longest contiguous subarray in `a` that can be removed such that the first and last elements of the remaining array are different. If all elements are the same, it returns the length of the array minus one. If no elements can be removed while keeping the first and last elements different, it returns 0.
