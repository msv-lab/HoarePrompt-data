To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **`r > l`**: This condition ensures that `r` is greater than `l`. Given that `r` is initialized to `n - 1` and `l` is initialized to the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, we need to ensure that `r` is indeed greater than `l`.

2. **`a[r] == a[r - 1]`**: This condition ensures that the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

### Analysis:

- **`r` and `l` Initialization**:
  - `r` is initialized to `n - 1` (the last index of the list `a`).
  - `l` is initialized to the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same.

- **Adjusting `r` and `l`**:
  - If `l` is `n - 1`, it means all elements in the list `a` are the same. In this case, `r` is also `n - 1`, and `r > l` is false, so the loop will not execute. To make the loop execute, we need to adjust `l` to be less than `r` such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
  - If `l` is not `n - 1`, it means there is at least one element in the list `a` that is different from the previous one. In this case, we need to ensure that the last element `a[r]` is equal to the second last element `a[r - 1]` for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

- If `l` is `n - 1`, adjust `l` to be `n - 2` (or any index less than `r`) to ensure `r > l` and make sure `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true.
- If `l` is not `n - 1`, ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]` by adjusting the elements in the list `a` accordingly, but since we can only adjust `r` and `l`, we need to make sure the list is such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

Given the constraints, the simplest way to ensure the loop can execute is to adjust `l` if it is `n - 1` to be `n - 2` and ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `l` is `n - 2` if `l` was `n - 1` otherwise `l` remains the same, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` and all elements are the same, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`**.
