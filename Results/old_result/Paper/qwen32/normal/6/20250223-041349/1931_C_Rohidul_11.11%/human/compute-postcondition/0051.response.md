The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 1`. After executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

Here are the updated values of the variables:
- `r` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `l` is `n - 2` if `l` was `n - 1` otherwise `l` remains the same, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` and all elements are the same, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**
