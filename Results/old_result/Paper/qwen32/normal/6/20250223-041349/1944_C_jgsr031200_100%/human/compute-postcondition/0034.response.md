Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. `n` is at least 0. `i` is 4. If `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without making any changes to the values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, or `i`. The value of `cou` is only incremented if `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, but since the `break` statement is encountered, no changes are made to `cou` in this case.
