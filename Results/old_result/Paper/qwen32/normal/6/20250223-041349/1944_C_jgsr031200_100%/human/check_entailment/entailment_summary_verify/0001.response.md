Let's systematically evaluate the provided Python program based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis Recap

The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to manipulate an array `a` to maximize or minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations Recap

1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice moves an element from `a` to `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes an element from `a` without adding it to `c`.
4. **Optimal Strategies**:
   - Alice should aim to move the smallest possible integers to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from moving the smallest possible integers to `c` to minimize the MEX.
5. **Significance of Frequencies**:
   - Integers appearing twice or more do not affect the final MEX because they can be moved to `c` and then removed by Bob, or vice versa.
   - The MEX will be determined by integers that appear exactly once or are missing from `a`.

### Function Summary Recap

The `func_1` function:
- Takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
- Uses a frequency array `freq` to count occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- Iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer that appears exactly once or is missing from the list.
- Prints this integer, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Program Code Analysis

The program:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
- Calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case.

The `func_1` function:
- Initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to zero.
- Counts occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- Iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer that appears exactly once or is missing.
- Prints this integer.

### Validation Against Function Summary

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. The function correctly identifies the smallest integer that appears exactly once or is missing from the array, which aligns with the definition of the MEX.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends. The program efficiently counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr` and finds the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which is indeed the MEX of `c`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, taking into account the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Final: True**
