To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers with `n` elements, where each element `arr[i]` satisfies `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)`.
2. **`freq`**: A list of `n + 1` integers, where `freq[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
3. **`n`**: The number of elements in `arr`, which is at least 0.
4. **`i`**: A variable that is incremented by 1.
5. **`cou`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 if `freq[i]` is exactly 1 before the if statement; otherwise, it remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but there is no explicit loop or initialization of `i` in the provided snippet. The value of `i` before the `print` statement is not explicitly given.
- The `freq` list and the `cou` variable are mentioned but are not directly relevant to the value of `i` that will be printed.
- Since the value of `i` is not explicitly initialized or provided in the initial state, we can infer that `i` could be any integer value that it was set to before the `print` statement. However, based on the context, it is likely that `i` is being used in a loop or some form of iteration, but the exact value is not specified.

Given the information provided, we can only describe `i` in terms of its role and the context it is used in. Since there is no specific value given for `i` before the `print` statement, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is the current value of the variable `i` at the point of execution.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is the current value of the variable i at the point of execution)**
