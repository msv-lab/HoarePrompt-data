The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or alter the conditions of the loop. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. `n` is at least 0. `i` is 4. If `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0. If `cou` was 2 or `freq[i]` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
