The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `cou` with the value of `0`. This does not affect the existing variables `arr` or `freq`. The list `arr` remains a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. The list `freq` remains a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 0.**
