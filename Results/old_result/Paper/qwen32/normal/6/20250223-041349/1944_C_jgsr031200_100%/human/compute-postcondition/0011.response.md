The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect any variables or their values directly. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `freq`, and `cou` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 0; `n` must be at least 0; the current value of `freq[i]` is at least 2.**
