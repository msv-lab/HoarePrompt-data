### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally according to the rules described in the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It iterates through the input array `arr` and increments the count of each integer in the `freq` array.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - It then iterates through the `freq` array to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `arr` (which is the MEX).
   - The variable `cou` is used to count the number of times an integer appears exactly once in `arr`.
   - The loop breaks and the MEX is printed when either:
     - The count of an integer is 0 (indicating that integer is the MEX).
     - The count of two different integers is exactly 1 (which means the MEX is the smallest integer not appearing in `arr` or appearing exactly once, considering the optimal play).

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**: The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the frequency of elements in the input array. This is valid because:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The MEX is determined by the smallest integer not present or appearing exactly once in the final array `c`. Since the order of elements in `c` does not affect the MEX, the optimal strategy for both players can be inferred by counting the frequency of elements in `arr`.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
  - If all elements in `arr` are the same, the MEX is 0.
  - If all elements from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`, the MEX is `n`.

- **Time Complexity**: The program runs in O(n) time per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the optimal play of Alice and Bob by counting the frequency of elements in `arr` and determining the smallest non-negative integer not present or appearing exactly once.

**Correctness: True**
