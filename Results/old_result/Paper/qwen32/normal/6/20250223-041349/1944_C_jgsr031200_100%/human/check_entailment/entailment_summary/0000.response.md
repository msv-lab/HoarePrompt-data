### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the final score of a game between Alice and Bob, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements from the array `a` have been processed. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

The provided program's function `func_1` calculates the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the list or is missing from the list. This aligns with the definition of MEX because:

1. **Frequency Counting**: The function first counts the frequency of each element in the array using a frequency array `freq`.
2. **Finding MEX**: It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and finds the smallest value that either appears exactly once in the array or is missing.

This approach ensures that the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` (which is the final state of `a` after the game) is found, which is exactly the MEX of `c`.

The program correctly handles the game's dynamics by focusing on the frequency of elements in the array, which is sufficient to determine the MEX without simulating the actual turns of Alice and Bob. This is because the optimal strategy for both players will ultimately result in the same set of elements being present in `c`, and the MEX is a property of the set of elements, not the order in which they are added.

### Correctness:

Since the function `func_1` correctly computes the MEX based on the frequency of elements, and this MEX represents the final score of the game when both players play optimally, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
