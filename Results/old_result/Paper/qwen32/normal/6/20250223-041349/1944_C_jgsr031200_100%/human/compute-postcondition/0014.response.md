Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 1; `n` must be at least 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is exactly 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables, including `arr`, `freq`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
