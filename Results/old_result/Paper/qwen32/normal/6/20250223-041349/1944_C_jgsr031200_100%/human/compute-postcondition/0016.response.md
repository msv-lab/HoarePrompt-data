Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 0. If `freq[i]` is at least 2, its value remains unchanged. The current value of `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.**
