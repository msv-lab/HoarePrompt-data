Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `f` or the loop continues.**
