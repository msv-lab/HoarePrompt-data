The code snippet provided is `ck = 1`. This line sets the value of the variable `ck` to 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the first element of the input list; `ck` is 1; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is 1.**
