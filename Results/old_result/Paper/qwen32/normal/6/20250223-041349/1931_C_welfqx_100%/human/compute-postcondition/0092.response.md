The code snippet provided is `symb1 = num[0]`. This line of code reassigns the value of `symb1` to be the first element of the list `num`. Since `symb1` was already defined as the first element of `num` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `symb1`. Therefore, the state of `symb1` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the new input integer.
- `f` remains 1.
- `num` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `onum` remains the same as the new `num`.
- `symb2` remains the last element of the new `num`.
- `ck` remains 1.
- `cn` remains 1.
- `r` remains `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the postcondition remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the postcondition remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`.**
