Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer input that is either 1 or `f` equals 1.
3. **`f`**: An integer that is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal; otherwise, `f` is 1.
4. **`num`**: A new input list of integers.
5. **`onum`**: An input list of integers.
6. **`symb1`**: The first element of the input list `onum`.
7. **`symb2`**: The first element of the input list `onum` (so `symb1` and `symb2` are the same).
8. **`ck`**: Its value depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`.
9. **`r`**: It is incremented by 1 if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(0)
```
This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `0`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the number `0`.

Output: **0**
