Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, and `r` is `r_prev + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, no changes are made to `f` and the loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
