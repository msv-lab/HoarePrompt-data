Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `r`, and `cn` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 4, and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
