Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0, `r` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, then no changes are made to `f`, `r`, or `j`.**
