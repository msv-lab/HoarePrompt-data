The code snippet `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by the value of `ck`. 

Given the initial state, `cn` is initially equal to `n`. After the execution of the code, `cn` becomes `n + ck`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `symb1` is equal to `symb2`; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is `n + ck`; `ii` is the index where the loop broke or `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations; `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`.**
