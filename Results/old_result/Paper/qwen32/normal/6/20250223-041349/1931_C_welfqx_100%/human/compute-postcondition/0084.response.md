The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state and the variables described do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print(0)` statement will always output `0` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and `j`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(0)` statement is a direct output of the integer `0`.
2. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, or `j` are used in the `print` statement.
3. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the value provided in the statement itself.

Output: **0**
