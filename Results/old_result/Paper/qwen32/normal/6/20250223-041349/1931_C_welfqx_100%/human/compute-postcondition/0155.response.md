The code snippet provided assigns the first element of the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. However, since `symb1` was already initialized to the first element of the input list `num` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `symb1`.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the fact that the assignment operation is performed, which does not alter the value of `symb1` in this specific case.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the first element of the input list; `ck` is 1; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is 1.**
