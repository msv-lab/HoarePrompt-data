The provided code snippet is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`, overwriting the previous value of `n`.

Given the Initial State, `n` is already described as an integer greater than or equal to 2. However, the code will change this value to whatever integer is input by the user, as long as it adheres to the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (which pertains to `t`, not `n`).

Here is the Output State after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is the input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, `r` is `r + 1`, `j` is determined based on the conditions provided for the elements in `num`.**

In simple terms, the value of `n` is now whatever integer was input by the user, and all other variables remain unchanged.
