Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the postcondition remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2; otherwise, `cn` is 1. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the state remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2; otherwise, `cn` is 1. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the state remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`. `i` is `n - 1`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 2. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 2. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `cn`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
