Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
The task is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation consists of selecting a subarray and assigning a value to all its elements. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through multiple test cases. For each test case, it first checks if all elements in the array are already equal. If they are, the cost is 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the cost by considering the longest sequence of equal elements from the start and the end of the array.

The program uses the following logic:
1. **Check if all elements are the same**: If all elements are the same, the cost is 0.
2. **Calculate the longest sequence of equal elements from the start**: It counts how many elements from the beginning of the array are the same.
3. **Calculate the longest sequence of equal elements from the end**: It counts how many elements from the end of the array are the same.
4. **Combine sequences if they have the same element**: If the first and last sequences have the same element, it combines their lengths.
5. **Calculate the minimum cost**: The minimum cost is the total number of elements minus the length of the longest sequence (or combined sequence).

### Correctness Evaluation
The program correctly handles cases where all elements are the same, returning a cost of 0. For other cases, it attempts to minimize the cost by considering the longest sequences of equal elements from both ends. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum cost in all scenarios.

### Counterexample
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The program will calculate the longest sequences from the start and end as `[1]` and `[1]` respectively, leading to a cost of `5 - 1 = 4`. However, the optimal solution is to change the middle element to either `1` or `3`, resulting in a cost of `3 - 2 = 1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for all possible arrays. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
