Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: An integer input and must be greater than 1.
3. **`f`**: Set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
4. **`num`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **`j`**: Set to \(n - 2\).
6. **`onum`**: A reversed copy of the `num` list.
7. **`symb1`**: The first element of the `num` list.
8. **`symb2`**: The last element of the `num` list.
9. **`ck`**: The count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached.
10. **`cn`**: If `symb1` (first element) is equal to `symb2` (last element), then `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`. Initially, `cn` is not mentioned to be defined, so we assume it starts at 0.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```
To understand what this will print, we need to determine the values of `n`, `cn`, and `ck`.

- **`n`**: This is given as an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- **`ck`**: This is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached.
- **`cn`**: This is the sum of its previous value and `ck` if `symb1` (first element) is equal to `symb2` (last element). Since `cn` is not mentioned to be initialized to any value, we assume it starts at 0. Therefore, if `symb1 == symb2`, `cn` will be equal to `ck`; otherwise, it remains 0.

### Determining the Output:
- If `symb1 == symb2`, then `cn` will be `ck`, and `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`. So, the expression `n - max(cn, ck)` simplifies to `n - ck`.
- If `symb1 != symb2`, then `cn` remains 0, and `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`. So, the expression `n - max(cn, ck)` simplifies to `n - ck`.

In both cases, the output is `n - ck`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - ck (where n is the number of elements in the list `num` and ck is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached)**
