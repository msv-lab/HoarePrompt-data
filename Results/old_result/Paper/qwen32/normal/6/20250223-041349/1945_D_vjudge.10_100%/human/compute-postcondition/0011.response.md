Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n); `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `pergunta`.
