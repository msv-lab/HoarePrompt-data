You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and m is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and `x + a[i]` for `i < m`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n); `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `-1`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the initial value of pergunta before any updates)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` each containing `n` elements, and an integer `m`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
