The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n - 2`**
