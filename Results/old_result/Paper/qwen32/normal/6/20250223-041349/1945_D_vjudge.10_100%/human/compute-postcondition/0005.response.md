The code snippet `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. The values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged unless the condition `i < m` is met, which is not addressed in the given code snippet. Therefore, we only focus on the change in `x`.

Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
