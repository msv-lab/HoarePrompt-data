Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue, but the current implementation does not properly account for the cost of bribing people and moving through the queue.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')` but is not updated correctly within the loop.
2. The cost calculation inside the loop does not properly account for the cost of bribing multiple people and moving through the queue.
3. The logic for determining the minimum cost is incorrect. The current implementation only considers the cost of bribing a single person to move to a position and does not account for the cost of moving through the queue.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a priority queue (min-heap) can be used to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position in the queue. The current implementation does not handle these aspects correctly.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Use a priority queue to always consider the minimum cost to move to the next position.
2. Keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position in the queue.
3. For each position, calculate the cost of bribing the person at that position and moving through the queue.
4. Stop when Kirill reaches one of the first `m` positions.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would be more involved than the provided code.
