Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-2 <= 49, and `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The condition `len(s) < 200` does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.**
