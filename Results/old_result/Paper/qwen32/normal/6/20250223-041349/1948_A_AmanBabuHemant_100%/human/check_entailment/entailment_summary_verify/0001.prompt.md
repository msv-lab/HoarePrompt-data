You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd, in which case it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a 'special' character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.

### Requirements:
1. **Special Characters Definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
   - The first 'A' is not special.
   - The second 'A' is special (it is equal to its left neighbor).
   - The third 'A' is not special.
   - The 'B' is special (it is equal to its left neighbor).
   - The first 'A' in the second group of 'A's is special (it is equal to its left neighbor).
   - The second 'A' in the second group of 'A's is not special.
   - Both 'C's are special (each is equal to its left neighbor).
   - The second 'C' is also special (it is equal to its right neighbor).

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print "NO" if it's impossible to create such a string.
   - Otherwise, print "YES" followed by a string that meets the criteria.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where special characters must be paired (each special character must be equal to exactly one neighbor, and each such pair contributes two special characters).
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string of the form "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This string will have exactly `n` special characters:
   - Each "AAB" pattern contributes two special characters (the first 'A' and the 'B').
   - Since the pattern is repeated `n // 2` times, there will be exactly `2 * (n // 2) = n` special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd by printing "NO". It also correctly constructs a suitable string when `n` is even, ensuring that the string has exactly `n` special characters and is of length at most 200.

Therefore, the program is correct.
