To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Condition for Special Characters**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed by the pattern used in the program.
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The string is constructed using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This pattern ensures that every 'A' in the middle of `'AAB'` is a special character because it is equal to one neighbor ('A' on the left) but not the other ('B' on the right).
   - The pattern `'AAB'` contributes exactly 2 special characters per repetition because the middle 'A' in each `'AAB'` is a special character.
   - Therefore, for `n` special characters, we need `n // 2` repetitions of `'AAB'`.

4. **Length Check**:
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. If not, it prints "NO".
   - Given that the maximum value of `n` is 50, the maximum length of the string `s` will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions for the number of special characters and constructs a valid string when possible. It also correctly checks the length constraint.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
