Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 49; `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, no further changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200. No further changes are made to `t` or `n` regardless of whether the condition `len(s) < 200` is true or false.**
