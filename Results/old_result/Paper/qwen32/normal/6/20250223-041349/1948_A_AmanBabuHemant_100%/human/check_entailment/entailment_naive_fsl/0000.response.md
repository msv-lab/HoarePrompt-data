Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly states that it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string, which is not true.

For example, consider the case where `n = 1`. According to the problem description, we need a string with exactly 1 special character. The string "AA" has exactly 1 special character (the 'A' at position 1 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor). Therefore, the output for `n = 1` should be:

```
YES
AA
```

However, the program will output "NO" for `n = 1` because it checks if `n` is odd and immediately concludes that no suitable string exists in that case.

To fix the program, we need to handle both even and odd values of `n` correctly. For odd `n`, we can construct a string like "AA" repeated `(n-1)//2` times followed by "A", which will have exactly `n` special characters. For even `n`, the current approach of repeating "AAB" is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'A'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

```

This corrected program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly and ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the resulting string.
