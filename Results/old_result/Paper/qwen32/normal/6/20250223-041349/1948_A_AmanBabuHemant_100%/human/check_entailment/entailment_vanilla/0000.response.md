Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: 
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Special Character Explanation**:
   - For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
     - Position 1: 'A' is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
     - Position 3: 'A' is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
     - Position 5: 'A' is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
     - Position 6: 'A' is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.
     - Position 7: 'A' is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.
     - Position 8: 'C' is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.
   - Hence, there are 6 special characters in "AAABAACC".

3. **Constraints**:
   - The number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of special characters, `n`, is between 1 and 50.

4. **Output**:
   - If it's not possible to construct such a string, print "NO".
   - If it is possible, print "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution includes the following logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of special characters `n` is read.

2. **Determine Feasibility**:
   - If `n` is odd, the solution prints "NO".
   - If `n` is even, the solution constructs a string `s` by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times.

3. **Constructing the String**:
   - The constructed string `s` is checked to see if its length is less than 200.
   - If the string is valid, it prints "YES" followed by the string.
   - If the string's length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The solution correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters because each special character requires a pair (either a left or right neighbor to match).
   - Hence, printing "NO" for odd `n` is correct.

2. **Even `n` Case**:
   - For even `n`, the solution constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times.
   - In the string "AAB":
     - The first 'A' is special (matches the second 'A').
     - The second 'A' is special (matches the first 'A').
     - The 'B' is not special.
   - By repeating "AAB", we ensure that every 'A' in the pattern is special, leading to exactly `2 * (n // 2) = n` special characters.
   - The constructed string's length is `3 * (n // 2)`, which will never exceed 200 given the constraints (since `n` is at most 50).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the solution correctly identifies it as impossible and prints "NO".
   - For `n = 2`, the solution correctly constructs "AAB" and prints "YES" followed by "AAB".

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
