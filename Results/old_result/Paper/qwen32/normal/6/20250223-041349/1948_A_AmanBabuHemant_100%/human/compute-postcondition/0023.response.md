The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 49
- `n` is the input integer (no changes are made to `n`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-2 <= 49, `n` is the input integer.**
