Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-2 \leq 49\). This means \(t\) can range from 2 to 51.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `s` is a string consisting of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'NO'.

### Final Answer:
Output: **NO**
