Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with different lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. So, for example, an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length, a square has four, a pentagon has five, and so on.

Given that, the key point here is that each polygon must have sides of the same length, and each stick can only be used in one polygon. Also, sticks cannot be broken, so each side of a polygon must be exactly one stick.

So, for each unique stick length, I can potentially form one or more polygons, but each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of that length (since the smallest regular polygon is a triangle with 3 sides).

Wait, actually, a digon is a two-sided polygon, but it's not a regular polygon in the usual Euclidean geometry sense, so I think the problem is considering polygons with at least 3 sides.

Therefore, for each unique stick length, the number of polygons I can make is the floor division of the number of sticks of that length by the number of sides required for a polygon (which is at least 3 for a triangle).

But hold on, the problem seems to allow forming polygons with any number of sides, as long as all sides are equal. So, for a given stick length, if I have, say, 4 sticks, I can make one square (which is a regular 4-gon). If I have 5 sticks, I can make one regular pentagon. So, it's not necessarily that I have to use as many sticks as possible in one polygon; rather, I can choose to make multiple polygons with different numbers of sides, but given that all sides must be the same length, and no stick is used in more than one polygon, it seems that for each unique stick length, the maximum number of polygons I can make is simply the floor division of the number of sticks of that length by 3, since a triangle is the smallest polygon.

But let's look at the example provided to see if that matches.

In the third test case:

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

So, n=6, sticks are 2,2,3,3,3,3.

Unique lengths: 2 (occurs twice), 3 (occurs four times).

For length 2: two sticks, which is not enough to form any polygon (since at least three sticks are needed), so zero polygons.

For length 3: four sticks, which can form one square (4-sided polygon), so one polygon.

Total polygons: 1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Unique lengths: 2 (occurs five times), 4 (occurs four times).

For length 2: five sticks. Can form one pentagon (5-sided polygon), so one polygon.

For length 4: four sticks. Can form one square, so one polygon.

Total polygons: 2, matching the sample output.

So, based on this, it seems that for each unique stick length, the number of polygons I can form is floor(number of sticks of that length / 3), since a triangle is the smallest polygon requiring 3 sticks.

Wait, but in the third test case, for length 3, I have four sticks, and I can form one 4-sided polygon, which is better than floor(4/3)=1 (since 4/3 is 1.333, floor is 1), but in this case, forming a square uses all four sticks, which is more efficient in terms of using sticks than forming a triangle.

But according to the problem statement, each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick is used in more than one polygon. So, for length 3, I have four sticks: I can choose to form one 4-sided polygon, or I could choose to form one 3-sided polygon and have one stick left over, but since the goal is to maximize the number of polygons, forming one 4-sided polygon is better than forming one 3-sided polygon and leaving one stick unused.

Wait, but in terms of the number of polygons, both choices result in one polygon. So, in this case, it doesn't matter.

But consider if I had, say, 5 sticks of length 3. I could form one 3-sided polygon and have two sticks left over, or one 4-sided polygon and have one stick left over, or one 5-sided polygon using all five sticks. But again, in terms of the number of polygons, it's still just one polygon.

So, perhaps the floor division by 3 is a valid way to calculate the maximum number of polygons for each unique stick length.

Wait, but let's think about having 6 sticks of the same length. I could form two triangles, which would be two polygons, or one hexagon, which is one polygon. So, in this case, floor(6/3)=2, which matches the maximum number of polygons I can form.

Similarly, with 7 sticks: I could form two triangles and have one stick left over, or one triangle and one quadrilateral, or one pentagon and one stick left over, but the maximum number of polygons is two (two triangles).

Wait, but with 7 sticks, floor(7/3)=2, which matches that.

With 8 sticks: floor(8/3)=2, and I could form two triangles and have two sticks left over, or one triangle and one pentagon, or one square and one quadrilateral, but again, the maximum number of polygons is two.

So, it seems that floor(number of sticks / 3) gives the maximum number of polygons I can form for each unique stick length.

Therefore, to solve the problem, I need to:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, the number of sticks.

b. Read the list of stick lengths, a.

c. Count the frequency of each unique stick length.

d. For each unique stick length, calculate floor(count / 3) and sum these values across all unique lengths.

e. Output this sum.

Looking back at the sample input and output, this seems to align.

In the third test case:

Length 2: count=2 -> floor(2/3)=0

Length 3: count=4 -> floor(4/3)=1

Total: 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

Length 2: count=5 -> floor(5/3)=1

Length 4: count=4 -> floor(4/3)=1

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, matching the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = 1

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0

cnt = dict()

for x in a:

cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1

for x in cnt.values():

ans += x // 3

print(ans)

First, there's an initial assignment t = 1, which is immediately overwritten by t = int(input()). This seems redundant and unnecessary, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the program, as t is correctly read from input later.

Then, for each test case, it calls func_1().

In func_1():

- It reads n and the list of stick lengths a.

- Initializes ans to 0.

- Creates a dictionary cnt to count the frequency of each stick length.

- Iterates through the counts and adds floor(count / 3) to ans for each unique stick length.

- Prints ans.

This seems to match the approach I've outlined.

However, I need to double-check if floor(count / 3) is always the correct way to calculate the maximum number of polygons.

Let's consider some edge cases:

1. n=1: Only one stick, can't form any polygon. floor(1/3)=0, which is correct.

2. n=3: Three sticks of the same length, can form one triangle. floor(3/3)=1, correct.

3. n=4: Four sticks of the same length, can form one square. floor(4/3)=1, which is correct.

4. n=5: Five sticks of the same length, can form one pentagon. floor(5/3)=1, which is correct.

5. n=6: Six sticks of the same length, can form two triangles or one hexagon. floor(6/3)=2, which matches the maximum number of polygons.

6. n=7: Seven sticks, can form two triangles and have one left over. floor(7/3)=2, correct.

7. n=8: Eight sticks, can form two triangles and have two left over, or one triangle and one pentagon. floor(8/3)=2, correct.

8. n=9: Nine sticks, can form three triangles, or one triangle and one hexagon, or one pentagon and one square. floor(9/3)=3, which is the maximum number of polygons.

So, in all these cases, floor(count / 3) gives the correct maximum number of polygons that can be formed from sticks of a single length.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct.

I should also consider if there are any constraints or special cases that might cause the program to fail.

Given that n can be up to 100, and t up to 100, the program should run efficiently since it's O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.

Also, the stick lengths are between 1 and 100, which is fine for the dictionary approach.

I don't see any issues with the code in terms of syntax or logic.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness: True**
