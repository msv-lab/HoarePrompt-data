Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n, and f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) is greater than f(x, z). Here, f(l, r) is the XOR of all elements from a_l to a_r.

First, I need to understand what f(x, y) represents. It's the XOR of elements from a_x to a_y. Similarly, f(y, z) is the XOR from a_y to a_z, and f(x, z) is the XOR from a_x to a_z.

So, the condition is f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z). I need to find all tuples where this inequality holds.

I recall that XOR has some properties that might be useful here. For instance, XOR is associative and commutative, which could help in simplifying the expression.

Let me try to simplify f(x, y) XOR f(y, z). Since f(x, y) is a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y, and f(y, z) is a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z, then f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) would be:

(a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

Because XOR is associative and commutative, and XORing a value with itself cancels out, this simplifies to:

a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

Which is exactly f(x, z).

Wait a minute, that can't be right. Because if f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) simplifies to f(x, z), then the condition becomes f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is only true when f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is never true. But that can't be, because the example shows that there are tuples where this condition holds.

Let me double-check the simplification. f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) should be:

(a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

When I XOR these two, the a_y terms should cancel out, leaving me with a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think differently. I know that f(x, z) = f(x, y) XOR f(y, z), because XOR represents the cumulative XOR from x to z as the XOR from x to y and from y to z, without double-counting y if y > x.

But according to the problem, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z). Given that f(x, z) = f(x, y) XOR f(y, z), then the condition is f(x, z) > f(x, z), which doesn't make sense because it should be equal.

I must be missing something here. Maybe I need to consider the properties of XOR more carefully.

Let me consider specific values. Take the first example:

Array: [6, 2, 4]

Let's list all possible tuples (x, y, z):

(1,1,1): f(1,1)=6, f(1,1)=6, f(1,1)=6 → 6 XOR 6 = 0 > 6? No.

(1,1,2): f(1,1)=6, f(1,2)=6 XOR 2=4, f(1,2)=4 → 6 XOR 4 = 2 > 4? No.

(1,1,3): f(1,1)=6, f(1,3)=6 XOR 2 XOR 4=0, f(1,3)=0 → 6 XOR 0 = 6 > 0? Yes.

(1,2,2): f(1,2)=4, f(2,2)=2, f(1,2)=4 → 4 XOR 2 = 6 > 4? Yes.

(1,2,3): f(1,2)=4, f(2,3)=2 XOR 4=6, f(1,3)=0 → 4 XOR 6 = 2 > 0? Yes.

(1,3,3): f(1,3)=0, f(3,3)=4, f(1,3)=0 → 0 XOR 4 = 4 > 0? Yes.

(2,2,2): f(2,2)=2, f(2,2)=2, f(2,2)=2 → 2 XOR 2 = 0 > 2? No.

(2,2,3): f(2,2)=2, f(2,3)=2 XOR 4=6, f(2,3)=6 → 2 XOR 6 = 4 > 6? No.

(2,3,3): f(2,3)=6, f(3,3)=4, f(2,3)=6 → 6 XOR 4 = 2 > 6? No.

(3,3,3): f(3,3)=4, f(3,3)=4, f(3,3)=4 → 4 XOR 4 = 0 > 4? No.

So, only tuples (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,3) satisfy the condition, totaling 4, which matches the first output.

Wait, but according to my earlier simplification, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) should be equal to f(x,z), but in this case, for (1,1,3), f(1,1)=6, f(1,3)=0, so 6 XOR 0 = 6 > 0, which holds. For (1,2,2), 4 XOR 2 = 6 > 4, holds. For (1,2,3), 4 XOR 6 = 2 > 0, holds. For (1,3,3), 0 XOR 4 = 4 > 0, holds.

So, in these cases, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) is not equal to f(x,z), which contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying f(x,y) XOR f(y,z). Let me think again.

I know that f(x,z) = f(x,y) XOR f(y,z), assuming y >= x.

But then, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = f(x,z), so the condition is f(x,z) > f(x,z), which should always be false, but in the example, there are tuples where it's true.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that XOR doesn't necessarily preserve the ordering of integers. That is, even if a XOR b = c, it doesn't mean that c > a or c < a in a consistent way.

Perhaps I need to look at the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

Let me consider that a XOR b can be greater than, equal to, or less than a or b, depending on the values.

So, perhaps directly computing f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) and comparing it to f(x,z) for each tuple is not efficient, given the constraints.

Given that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, a O(n^3) approach is impossible. I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can precompute prefix XORs to quickly compute f(x,y).

Let me define prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, f(x,y) = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]

Similarly, f(y,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

And f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, the condition becomes:

(f(x,y) XOR f(y,z)) > f(x,z)

Which is:

((prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]) XOR (prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1])) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Simplify the left side:

prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]

Since XOR is associative and commutative:

prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]

Let me group prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], which is f(x,z), and prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[y], which is a_{y}.

Wait, prefix[y] = prefix[y-1] XOR a[y], so prefix[y] XOR prefix[y-1] = a[y]

So, the expression becomes:

f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

So, the condition simplifies to:

f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

Now, this is more manageable.

So, for each tuple (x,y,z) with x <= y <= z, we have:

f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

Now, I need to find the number of such tuples where this inequality holds.

This seems more tractable.

Now, I need a way to count the number of tuples where f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

Given that x <= y <= z, perhaps I can iterate over y and for each y, compute the number of (x,z) pairs where x <= y and z >= y, such that f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

But this still seems O(n^3), which is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider fixing y and then considering all possible x and z such that x <= y and z >= y.

For a fixed y, f(x,z) can be expressed as prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, for fixed y, I need to count the number of pairs (x,z) with x <= y and z >= y such that (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]) XOR a[y] > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Let me denote p = prefix[x-1], q = prefix[z]

So, for fixed y, I need to count the number of pairs (p,q) where p is among prefix[0], prefix[1], ..., prefix[y-1], and q is among prefix[y], prefix[y+1], ..., prefix[n], such that (q XOR p) XOR a[y] > (q XOR p)

Simplify the left side:

(q XOR p XOR a[y]) > (q XOR p)

Let me denote r = q XOR p

So, the condition becomes (r XOR a[y]) > r

Wait, so for each y, I need to count the number of (p,q) pairs where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], and (q XOR p XOR a[y]) > (q XOR p)

But this still seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each y, a[y] is fixed, and I need to consider the XOR of f(x,z) with a[y].

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of bits.

I recall that for XOR operations, considering each bit independently can be helpful.

Let me consider the binary representation of the numbers.

Let me consider the bits from the most significant to the least significant.

I need to find when f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

I know that in binary numbers, if the XOR of two numbers in a certain bit position results in a '1' where the original number had a '0', then the XORed number is larger.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the highest bit where f(x,z) XOR a[y] differs from f(x,z).

If that bit is set in f(x,z) XOR a[y] and not set in f(x,z), then f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

But I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Let me consider the inequality f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

I can think of it as f(x,z) XOR a[y] - f(x,z) > 0

But XOR is not directly related to subtraction in a straightforward way.

Maybe I need to consider the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over y, and for each y, consider a[y], and then for all possible x <= y and z >= y, compute f(x,z) and check if f(x,z) XOR a[y] > f(x,z)

But this is still O(n^3), which is too slow for n up to 1e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider precomputing all possible f(x,z) for x <= y and z >= y.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of prefix XORs.

Let me compute the prefix XOR array, where prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, for a fixed y, I need to count the number of pairs (x,z) with x <= y and z >= y such that (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a[y]) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Let me denote p = prefix[x-1], which for x <= y, p is in prefix[0], prefix[1], ..., prefix[y-1]

And q = prefix[z], which for z >= y, q is in prefix[y], prefix[y+1], ..., prefix[n]

So, for fixed y, I need to count the number of pairs (p,q), where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], such that (q XOR p XOR a[y]) > (q XOR p)

Let me denote r = q XOR p

So, the condition is (r XOR a[y]) > r

Now, I need to find the number of pairs (p,q) where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], and (r XOR a[y]) > r, where r = q XOR p

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over y, and for each y, consider a[y], and then count the number of pairs (p,q) where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], and (q XOR p XOR a[y]) > (q XOR p)

Wait, perhaps I can group the terms differently.

Let me consider that q XOR p is r, and then r XOR a[y] is r XOR a[y]

So, I need to count the number of r where r XOR a[y] > r

Is there a way to count the number of r that satisfy this condition?

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look at the binary representation of r and a[y].

Let me consider the binary representation from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.

I need to find the bits where r XOR a[y] differs from r.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the bits where a[y] has a '1'.

If a[y] has a '1' in a certain bit position, then XORing r with a[y] will flip that bit in r.

If that flipped bit in r XOR a[y] is '1' and in r it was '0', then r XOR a[y] would be greater than r.

But I need to consider all bit positions.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given r, r XOR a[y] > r is equivalent to r < r XOR a[y]

So, I need to find the number of r where r < r XOR a[y]

I need to find the number of r where r < r XOR a[y]

I recall that for any r and a[y], r < r XOR a[y] if and only if the leading bit that differs between r and r XOR a[y] is set to '1' in r XOR a[y] and '0' in r.

Since XOR flips the bits where a[y] has '1', so if a[y] has a '1' in a certain bit position, that bit in r is flipped in r XOR a[y]

Therefore, r < r XOR a[y] if the highest bit where a[y] has a '1' is flipped from '0' to '1' in r.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the bit position where a[y] has the highest '1' bit.

Let me denote k as the highest bit where a[y] has a '1'.

Then, for r, if the k-th bit is '0', then r XOR a[y] will have the k-th bit set to '1', making r XOR a[y] > r.

If the k-th bit of r is '1', then r XOR a[y] will have the k-th bit set to '0', making r XOR a[y] < r.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a[y] has a '1' in the k-th bit, then:

- If r has a '0' in the k-th bit, then r XOR a[y] will have '1' in the k-th bit, which is greater than r.

- If r has a '1' in the k-th bit, then r XOR a[y] will have '0' in the k-th bit, which is less than r.

So, r XOR a[y] > r if and only if r has a '0' in the k-th bit, where k is the highest set bit in a[y].

Wait, is that accurate?

Let me consider an example.

Suppose a[y] = 6, which is 110 in binary.

The highest set bit is the third bit (from the right, starting at 1).

So, k = 3.

Then, for r:

- If r's third bit is 0, then r XOR 6 will set the third bit to 1, making it larger than r.

- If r's third bit is 1, then r XOR 6 will set the third bit to 0, making it smaller than r.

Wait, but what about lower bits?

For example, r = 010 (2 in decimal), a[y] = 110 (6), r XOR a[y] = 100 (4), which is greater than 2.

Another example, r = 101 (5), a[y] = 110, r XOR a[y] = 011 (3), which is less than 5.

So, in this case, r XOR a[y] > r if r's third bit is 0.

Wait, but 4 > 2 and 3 < 5, as shown.

So, in general, for a[y] with highest set bit at position k, r XOR a[y] > r if and only if r's k-th bit is 0.

Is this always true?

Let me consider another example.

Let a[y] = 5, which is 101 in binary. Highest set bit is the third bit.

r = 010 (2), r XOR a[y] = 111 (7) > 2

r = 100 (4), r XOR a[y] = 001 (1) < 4

r = 001 (1), r XOR a[y] = 100 (4) > 1

r = 111 (7), r XOR a[y] = 010 (2) < 7

So, in these cases, when r's third bit is 0 (like 2 and 1), r XOR a[y] > r; when r's third bit is 1 (like 4 and 7), r XOR a[y] < r.

Therefore, the condition r XOR a[y] > r holds if and only if r's k-th bit is 0, where k is the highest set bit in a[y].

This seems to hold.

So, for each y, I can determine k as the position of the highest set bit in a[y].

Then, for that y, the number of pairs (p,q) where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], and r = q XOR p has the k-th bit as 0.

Since r = q XOR p, and p and q are from different subsets of prefix arrays, I need to count the number of pairs where q XOR p has the k-th bit as 0.

Now, how can I efficiently count the number of such pairs?

Let me consider that for each bit position, I can count how many p and q have that bit set or not.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain counts of the bits for p and q.

Let me consider that for each bit position, I can keep track of how many p have that bit set and how many have it not set, similarly for q.

Then, for a specific k, the number of r = q XOR p where the k-th bit is 0 is equal to the number of pairs where the k-th bit of q XOR p is 0.

Now, the k-th bit of q XOR p is 0 if and only if the k-th bits of q and p are equal.

That is, both q and p have the k-th bit as 0, or both have it as 1.

So, the number of such pairs is:

- Number of p and q where k-th bit is 0 in both + number of p and q where k-th bit is 1 in both.

Which is:

- (number of p with k-th bit = 0) * (number of q with k-th bit = 0) + (number of p with k-th bit = 1) * (number of q with k-th bit = 1)

So, for each y, I can determine k as the highest set bit in a[y], and then compute this count for that k.

Now, I need to precompute for each bit position, the number of p and q where that bit is set or not.

Given that p is in prefix[0..y-1] and q is in prefix[y..n], I can maintain prefix counts for each bit position.

Let me try to outline this approach:

1. Precompute the prefix XOR array: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] XOR a[i]

2. For each y from 1 to n:

a. Determine k as the position of the highest set bit in a[y]

b. Count the number of pairs (p,q) where p is in prefix[0..y-1], q is in prefix[y..n], and the k-th bit of q XOR p is 0

c. Which is equal to:

- (number of p with k-th bit = 0) * (number of q with k-th bit = 0) + (number of p with k-th bit = 1) * (number of q with k-th bit = 1)

3. Sum these counts over all y to get the total number of tuples

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to precompute for each y, the counts of p and q for each bit position.

Let me think about how to maintain these counts.

I can maintain for each bit position, the count of p with that bit set in prefix[0..y-1], and the count of q with that bit set in prefix[y..n]

I can precompute two arrays:

- pre[k]: array of size y, where pre[k][i] is the number of p in prefix[0..i] where the k-th bit is set

- suf[k]: array of size y, where suf[k][i] is the number of q in prefix[i..n] where the k-th bit is set

Wait, but this would still be O(n * 32), which is acceptable since n <= 1e5 and 32 bits.

Wait, but 1e5 * 32 is around 3e6 operations, which should be fine.

So, here's the plan:

- For each bit position k from 0 to 31:

- Compute pre[k][i]: number of p in prefix[0..i-1] where the k-th bit is set

- Compute suf[k][i]: number of q in prefix[i..n] where the k-th bit is set

- Then, for each y from 1 to n:

- Determine k as the highest set bit in a[y]

- Then, the number of pairs where q XOR p has the k-th bit as 0 is:

- pre[k][y] * suf[k][y] + (y - pre[k][y]) * (n - y - suf[k][y + 1])

Wait, let's see:

- pre[k][y] is the number of p in prefix[0..y-1] with k-th bit set

- suf[k][y] is the number of q in prefix[y..n] with k-th bit set

- Then, the number of pairs where both p and q have k-th bit set is pre[k][y] * suf[k][y]

- The number of pairs where both p and q have k-th bit not set is (y - pre[k][y]) * (n - y - suf[k][y + 1])

Wait, but suf[k][y] is the number of q in prefix[y..n] with k-th bit set.

Wait, actually, I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me think again.

For a given y:

- p is in prefix[0..y-1]

- q is in prefix[y..n]

- pre[k][y] is the number of p in prefix[0..y-1] with k-th bit set

- suf[k][y] is the number of q in prefix[y..n] with k-th bit set

Then, the number of pairs where both p and q have k-th bit set is pre[k][y] * suf[k][y]

The number of pairs where both p and q have k-th bit not set is (number of p in prefix[0..y-1] with k-th bit not set) * (number of q in prefix[y..n] with k-th bit not set)

Which is (y - pre[k][y]) * (n - y + 1 - suf[k][y])

Wait, n - y + 1 is the number of q in prefix[y..n], so the number with k-th bit not set is (n - y + 1 - suf[k][y])

But in the code, it might be easier to use n - y instead of n - y + 1, depending on how the arrays are indexed.

I need to be careful with the indexing.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

First, compute the prefix XOR array.

Then, precompute for each bit position k, the prefix and suffix counts.

- pre[k][i] = number of prefix[j] for j from 0 to i-1 where prefix[j] has k-th bit set

- suf[k][i] = number of prefix[j] for j from i to n where prefix[j] has k-th bit set

Then, for each y from 1 to n:

- Determine k as the highest set bit in a[y]

- If a[y] is 0, then there is no highest set bit, but a[y] is at least 1 as per the constraints, since 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

- So, k is well-defined for a[y] >= 1

- Then, the number of pairs where q XOR p has k-th bit 0 is pre[k][y] * suf[k][y] + (y - pre[k][y]) * (n - y - suf[k][y]])

- Add this to the answer

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, I need to make sure that my implementation is optimized.

I can precompute the prefix and suffix counts for each bit position.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Pseudocode:

for each test case:

read n

read array a of size n

compute prefix[0 to n], where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] XOR a[i]

for each bit position k from 0 to 31:

pre[k][0] = 0

for i from 1 to n:

pre[k][i] = pre[k][i-1] + (prefix[i-1] & (1 << k)) != 0

suf[k][n+1] = 0

for i from n downto 1:

suf[k][i] = suf[k][i+1] + (prefix[i] & (1 << k)) != 0

ans = 0

for y from 1 to n:

a_y = a[y]

k = highest set bit in a_y (0-indexed)

ans += pre[k][y] * suf[k][y] + (y - pre[k][y]) * (n - y - suf[k][y])

print(ans)

But this seems inefficient because for each y, I'm looking up pre[k][y] and suf[k][y], and k depends on a[y].

But since k depends on a[y], and a[y] can be up to 1e9, I need to find the highest set bit for each a[y].

To optimize, perhaps I can precompute k for each a[y] beforehand.

Also, to further optimize, maybe I can iterate over k and sum over y for each k.

Wait, but since k depends on y, it might be more straightforward to iterate over y and determine k for each y.

However, this approach would be O(n * 32), which should be acceptable given the constraints.

Wait, but in the initial approach, pre[k][i] is a 2D array of size 32 * (n+1), which might be too memory-consuming, since n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5.

But if I can reuse the arrays between test cases, it should be fine.

Alternatively, I can manage memory carefully.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to implement a similar approach.

Let me analyze the given code.

Given Code:

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

func_1()

def func_1():

print('-----------------')

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

prefix = [0]

for v in arr:

prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])

print(arr, prefix)

pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]

suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]

for i in range(32):

pre[i][0] += 1

for i in range(n, 0, -1):

cur = prefix[i]

for j in range(32):

if cur >> j & 1:

suf[j][1] += 1

else:

suf[j][0] += 1

print(pre)

print(suf)

ans = 0

for i in range(1, n + 1):

y = arr[i - 1]

k = y.bit_length() - 1

ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

c = prefix[i]

for j in range(32):

if c >> j & 1:

pre[j][1] += 1

suf[j][1] -= 1

else:

pre[j][0] += 1

suf[j][0] -= 1

print(ans)

So, in this code:

- It reads T test cases.

- For each test case, it calls func_1().

- In func_1():

- Reads n and the array arr.

- Computes the prefix XOR array.

- Initializes pre and suf as lists of lists, each of size 32 (for each bit position), with two elements: [count_0, count_1]

- Initializes pre[i][0] += 1 for all i, which seems to account for prefix[0] = 0.

- Then, for i from n downto 1, updates suf[j][1] or suf[j][0] based on whether prefix[i] has the j-th bit set.

- Then, iterates over i from 1 to n:

- y = arr[i-1]

- k = y.bit_length() - 1 (highest set bit in y, 0-indexed)

- ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

- c = prefix[i]

- Updates pre[j] and suf[j] based on c's bits.

- Finally, prints ans.

Now, let's see if this aligns with the approach I outlined.

- It computes the prefix XOR array correctly.

- It initializes pre and suf for each bit position.

- pre[i][0] counts the number of p with the i-th bit unset.

- pre[i][1] counts the number of p with the i-th bit set.

- Similarly for suf.

- It seems to maintain pre and suf such that for each bit position, pre[k][0] is the number of p with k-th bit unset, pre[k][1] is the number of p with k-th bit set, and similarly for suf.

- For each y, it determines k as the highest set bit in a[y].

- Then, it adds pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] to ans.

- This corresponds to the number of pairs
