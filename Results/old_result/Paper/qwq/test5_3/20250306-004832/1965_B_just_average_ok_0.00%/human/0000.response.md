Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that satisfies two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

First, I recall that with a set of distinct powers of 2, I can represent any sum up to the sum of those powers. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number up to 15 by choosing appropriate subsets.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the possibility of making k, while still being able to make all other values up to n.

So, maybe I can start with a set of powers of 2, and then modify it in some way to exclude k.

Let me consider the binary representation of k. Since powers of 2 correspond to individual bits in the binary representation, perhaps I can manipulate the sequence based on the bits set in k.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and k can be up to n, so I need a general approach that works for any n and k within those ranges.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

So, for n=2, k=2, the sequence is [1], which makes sense because you can't make 2 with just 1, but you can make 1.

For n=6, k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which avoids making 1, but can make all other values from 2 to 6.

For n=8, k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can make any sum from 1 to 7, but not 8.

For n=9, k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can make all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

For n=10, k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which can make all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

So, from these examples, it seems like there are different strategies depending on the values of n and k.

I need to find a general method that works for any n and k.

Let me think about the properties required.

First, the sequence should be able to make all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

This means that the power set of the sequence, excluding the subsets that sum to k, should cover all other sums up to n.

But explicitly constructing such a sequence seems complicated.

I need a smarter way.

One idea is to use a set of numbers that can generate all sums up to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be formed.

For example, start with a set that can generate all sums up to n, and then remove or adjust some elements so that k cannot be achieved.

Alternatively, perhaps add some elements that block the sum k while still allowing other sums.

But this is still vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set of numbers where the sums they can form are all possible except for k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no combination of the numbers adds up to k.

But ensuring that all other sums can be formed is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with a set of distinct powers of 2, I can form any sum up to the sum of those powers.

But in that case, it's hard to exclude just one sum, k.

Maybe I need to exclude k by ensuring that no subset sums to k.

One approach could be to include numbers that cover all sums except k, perhaps by including numbers that are just around k.

Looking back at the examples:

For n=6, k=1: sequence [2,3,4,5,6]. Here, sums from 2 to 6 are possible, and 1 is impossible.

For n=8, k=8: sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Sums from 1 to 7 are possible, 8 is not.

For n=9, k=3: sequence [7,1,4,1]. Sums from 1 to 9 except 3 are possible.

For n=10, k=7: sequence [1,2,8,3]. Sums from 1 to 10 except 7 are possible.

So, different sequences are used based on n and k.

I need to find a general method to construct such sequences.

Let me consider the binary representation again.

If I have a set of distinct powers of 2, I can form any sum up to the sum of those powers.

But I need to exclude k.

Perhaps I can remove the power of 2 that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, and add other numbers to cover the missing sums.

Wait, that might not work.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set of numbers that can form all sums except k.

I can start with a set that can form all sums up to n, and then adjust it so that k cannot be formed.

One way to do this is to split the sequence into parts where one part can form sums up to k-1, and the other part can form sums from k+1 to n, without overlapping at k.

But this seems complicated.

Another idea: use the fact that if I have a subset with sum s, then to avoid having a subset with sum k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This is similar to the subset sum problem, which is NP-complete, but since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, it's manageable.

But I need an efficient algorithm, considering the constraints.

Wait, the problem allows up to 25 elements in the sequence, and n can be up to 10^6.

So, I need a way to cover all sums from 1 to n except k, using at most 25 numbers.

This seems challenging, but perhaps there's a smart way to do it.

Let me consider that with 25 numbers, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, which is way more than n can be (up to 10^6).

So, it's feasible to cover all sums up to n with 25 numbers, except for one specific sum k.

Now, how to construct such a sequence.

One approach is to use a minimal set of numbers that can cover all sums up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, using a greedy algorithm to select numbers that cover as much of the sums as possible, while avoiding k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

This means that the subset sum problem for this sequence has exactly one missing sum, which is k.

This is similar to creating a set where the subset sums cover all numbers up to the total sum, except for one specific value.

I recall that in coding theory, there are concepts like linear codes that can cover all possible values except for a few.

But that might be too advanced for this problem.

Let me think about smaller examples to get an idea.

Take n=2, k=2.

Sequence: [1]

Subsets: empty (0), [1](1)

So, sums are 0 and 1, which excludes 2, and includes 1.

Good.

Another example: n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

Subsets:

- empty: 0

- [2]:2

- [3]:3

- [4]:4

- [5]:5

- [6]:6

- [2,3]:5

- [2,4]:6

- [2,5]:7

- [2,6]:8

- [3,4]:7

- [3,5]:8

- [3,6]:9

- [4,5]:9

- [4,6]:10

- [5,6]:11

- [2,3,4]:9

- [2,3,5]:10

- [2,3,6]:11

- [2,4,5]:11

- etc.

Wait, but we need sums from 2 to 6, and exclude 1.

But in this sequence, the smallest sum is 2, and we can get up to 20, but n is only 6, so maybe it's just considering sums up to n=6.

Wait, n=6, so we only care about sums from 1 to 6, except for k=1.

So, sums possible are 2,3,4,5,6.

Sequence [2,3,4,5,6] can certainly make 2,3,4,5,6.

Good.

Another example: n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Sums: from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

Perfect.

So, in this case, using all 1's allows us to cover sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

Similarly, for n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Possible subsets:

- empty: 0

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1]:1

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [7,1]:8

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,1]:2

- [7,1,4]:12

- [7,1,1]:8

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13

We need sums from 1 to 9, excluding 3.

So, 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

But 9 is missing in the above sums.

Wait, but in the example output, it's [7,1,4,1], which sums up to 13, but we need to cover up to 9.

Wait, n=9, so we need to cover sums up to 9, except 3.

But in the sequence [7,1,4,1], the maximum sum is 13, but we only care about sums up to 9.

From the subsets above, we have sums: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13.

So, for sums up to 9, we have 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8.

Missing 3 and 9.

But according to the problem, we need to cover all v from 1 to n except k.

So, for n=9, k=3, we need to cover 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

But in this sequence, 9 is missing.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my subset sums.

Wait, [7,1,4,1]:

- [7,1,1]: 7+1+1=9

Ah, yes, [7,1,1]=9.

So, sums: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

Excluding 3, which is what we need.

Got it.

So, in this sequence, we can make 9, which is allowed since k=3.

Similarly, for n=10, k=7:

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Subsets:

- empty: 0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

We need sums from 1 to 10, excluding 7.

So, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10.

7 is missing, which is good.

So, this sequence works.

Now, I need to generalize this approach.

Looking at these examples, it seems that there are different strategies:

- For n=2, k=2: use [1]

- For n=6, k=1: use [2,3,4,5,6]

- For n=8, k=8: use [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- For n=9, k=3: use [7,1,4,1]

- For n=10, k=7: use [1,2,8,3]

So, in some cases, using all 1's works, in others, using higher numbers works.

I need to find a way to construct such a sequence for any n and k.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed.

Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to cover all sums up to n, except for k.

One approach is to use a combination of small and large numbers to cover the required sums.

For example, using several 1's to cover the small sums, and larger numbers to cover the higher sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider the binary representation again.

If I use distinct powers of 2, I can form any sum up to the sum of those powers.

But then, how do I exclude k?

One idea is to remove the power of 2 that corresponds to the bit in k that is set, and adjust the sequence accordingly.

Wait, maybe more carefully:

Suppose I have a set of distinct powers of 2 up to some limit, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that with powers of 2, I can represent any number uniquely in binary.

So, if I have [1,2,4,8,...], each number up to the sum of the sequence can be represented uniquely as a sum of some subset.

But then, to exclude k, I need to modify the sequence so that k cannot be formed.

One way to do this is to remove the elements that are necessary to form k.

But then, I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include additional numbers to block k while still allowing other sums.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed to cover all sums up to n except k.

Since the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

One approach is to use as many 1's as possible to cover the small sums, and then use larger numbers to cover the higher sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, suppose I use (k-1) ones. Then, the sums I can form with these ones are from 0 to (k-1). Then, by adding larger numbers, I can cover higher sums, but I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

For example, if k=3, using two 1's allows sums 0,1,2. Then, adding a 2 allows sums up to 4, but 3 can be formed as 1+2, which is not allowed if k=3.

So, in that case, I need to avoid having subsets that sum to k.

Wait, in the earlier example, for n=9, k=3: [7,1,4,1]

Here, sums with 1's: 0,1,2

Adding 4: 4,5,6

Adding 7: 7,8,9

And combinations: 1+4=5, 1+7=8, 1+4+7=12, etc.

But 3 is not formed.

How is that achieved?

Because 3 would require 1+1+1, but there are only two 1's, so 3 cannot be formed.

Wait, but there are two 1's in the sequence, so 1+1=2, but not 3.

So, with two 1's, I can make 0,1,2.

Then, adding a 4 allows 4,5,6.

Adding a 7 allows 7,8,9.

And with combinations, higher sums.

But 3 is not possible.

So, this is a way to cover all sums except 3.

Similarly, in n=10, k=7: [1,2,8,3]

Here, sums:

0,1,2,3, (1+2=3), 8,9 (1+8),10 (2+8), etc.

But 7 is not formed.

How?

Wait, [1,2,8,3]

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,3,8]:12

- [2,3,8]:13

- [1,2,3,8]:14

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [2]:2

- [1]:1

- [2,3]:5

- [1,8]:9

- [2,8]:10

- [3,8]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,3,8]:12

- [2,3,8]:13

- [1,2,3,8]:14

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing:4,7

But according to the problem, for n=10, k=7, we need to exclude only 7, but 4 is also missing.

But in the problem's example, it seems like 4 is covered by [1,3], but in this sequence, there is only one 1 and one 3, so [1,3]=4 is possible.

Wait, in the sequence [1,2,8,3], yes, [1,3]=4.

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Excluding 7.

Yes, that works.

So, in this case, by choosing these numbers, we can cover all sums up to 10 except 7.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need a method to select up to 25 numbers such that their subsets can form all sums from 1 to n except k.

One possible approach is to use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers that can form all sums up to some value, and another set that can form higher sums, I can combine them appropriately to cover the required sums while excluding k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Use a set of small numbers to cover sums up to k-1, excluding k.

2. Use larger numbers to cover sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that the two sets don't combine to form k.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can divide the sequence into two parts: one that covers sums up to k-1 and another that covers sums from k+1 to n, and ensure that their combinations don't allow sum k.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select a set of numbers such that their subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except k.

I need to find such a set with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and the sequence can have up to 25 elements, it's feasible.

But how?

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to select numbers that allow covering as many new sums as possible without covering k.

But implementing a greedy algorithm might be too slow for the time constraints.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider precomputing some patterns or using mathematical properties to construct the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with 25 numbers, I can cover a large range of sums.

Given that 2^25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

So, I need to select 25 numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But selecting 25 numbers optimally is not straightforward.

Let me consider using a minimal set of numbers to cover all sums up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, using the minimal number of weights to weigh all weights up to a certain value.

In the problem of minimal number of weights for a balance scale, you can use distinct powers of 3 to weigh up to a certain value.

But here, it's a subset sum problem, more similar to distinct powers of 2.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum.

Wait, perhaps I can use distinct powers of 2 up to a certain point and adjust for k.

Let me try that.

Suppose I take the first m powers of 2, where m is less than or equal to 25, and their sum is at least n.

Then, I can form any sum up to that sum, except possibly k.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can remove one of the powers of 2 that is necessary to form k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

Wait, that might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me consider that with powers of 2, each sum corresponds uniquely to a subset.

So, if I remove one power of 2, then I can no longer form the sums that included that power.

But that might remove more sums than necessary.

I need a way to block only k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include additional numbers to cover the missing sums.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=9, k=3.

Powers of 2 up to 9 are: 1,2,4,8.

Their sums can form all numbers from 1 to 15.

But I need to exclude 3.

So, if I remove 2, then I can form 1 and 4 and 8, which allows sums:1,4,5,8,9.

But I need to cover 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

So, missing 2.

Wait, perhaps instead of removing 2, I can include additional numbers.

For example, include 1,4,8, and another number to cover the missing sums.

But in the example, they used [7,1,4,1], which can cover the required sums except 3.

So, perhaps including a number like (k-1), or something similar.

But I need a general approach.

Let me think about the binary representation of k.

Suppose k has certain bits set.

If I remove the power of 2 corresponding to one of the set bits in k, then I can no longer form k, but I might also remove other sums that included that power of 2.

This might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I remove the smallest power of 2 that is set in k, and then include another number to cover the missing sums.

For example, for k=3 (binary 11), the smallest set bit is 1, so remove 1.

Then, include another number to cover the missing sums.

But in this case, removing 1 would leave me with [2,4,8], which can form 2,4,6,8,10, etc., but missing 1,3,5,7,9.

But I need to cover 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, excluding 3.

So, perhaps removing 1 and including another number.

Wait, maybe including two 1's.

So, [1,1,4,8], which can form:

- 1,2 (1+1),4,5 (1+4),6 (1+1+4),8,9 (1+8),10 (1+1+8), etc.

But 3 is formed by 1+1+1, but there are only two 1's, so 3 is not possible.

So, sums:0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10

Missing 3,7, etc.

But for n=9, k=3, we need to cover up to 9 except 3.

So, need to cover 7 and 9.

In this sequence, 9 is covered by [1,8], and 7 is missing.

Wait, no, [1,2,4]=7, but 2 is not in this sequence.

So, in [1,1,4,8], sums are 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10.

Missing 3,7.

But in the example, for n=9, k=3, they used [7,1,4,1], which can make 7, but not 3.

So, perhaps in this approach, using [1,1,4,7] would cover sums:0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12.

Missing 3,10.

But in n=9, k=3, 10 is beyond n, so it's okay.

Wait, n=9, so sums up to 9 are considered.

So, sums:0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Excluding 3.

Perfect.

So, [1,1,4,7] would work.

Similarly, in the example, they used [7,1,4,1], which is similar.

So, perhaps in general, I can use a set of numbers that includes some powers of 2 and adjust with additional numbers to block k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Start with the first m powers of 2, where m is chosen such that the sum is at least n.

2. Identify if k can be formed with these powers.

3. If k can be formed, remove the smallest power of 2 that is set in k and include another number to cover the missing sums.

4. Adjust the sequence accordingly.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that k has a unique binary representation.

Let me denote the binary representation of k as a sequence of bits.

Let me find the position of the highest set bit in k.

Suppose k has its highest set bit at position idx.

Then, I can consider removing 2^idx from the sequence and including k - 2^idx in the sequence.

This way, k cannot be formed, because 2^idx is removed, and k - 2^idx is included.

But I need to verify if this covers all other sums.

Wait, let's try with an example.

Take n=9, k=3.

Binary of 3 is 11, highest set bit is 2 (10).

So, idx=1 (0-based).

Remove 2 from the sequence and include k - 2 =1.

So, sequence becomes [1,4,8].

But in this sequence, sums are 1,4,5,8,9.

Missing 2,3,6,7.

So, not covering all required sums.

Hmm, maybe this approach is not correct.

Let me try another idea.

Suppose I take all powers of 2 up to some limit, and then adjust for k.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider that with 25 numbers, I can cover a large range of sums.

So, perhaps I can use a set of numbers that can cover all sums up to n, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

One way to exclude k is to ensure that no subset sums to k.

I can do this by including numbers in such a way that any subset that would sum to k is blocked.

But this is too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a set of 24 numbers that can cover a wide range of sums, and then adjust the 25th number based on k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Wait, perhaps I can use the first 24 powers of 2 and adjust the 25th number based on k.

But n can be up to 10^6, and 2^24 is over 16 million, which is more than enough.

But then, how do I exclude k?

Wait, maybe I can remove one power of 2 that is necessary for k and include another number to cover the missing sums.

But earlier attempts suggest that this might not work directly.

Let me consider that with 25 numbers, I can cover up to 2^25 -1 sums, which is over 33 million, way more than n=10^6.

So, I need to select 25 numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, I need an efficient way to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider that the sequence can include multiple instances of the same number, as per the problem statement (non-negative integers, so duplicates are allowed).

In the example for n=8, k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can make sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

Similarly, for n=9, k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can make sums from 0 to 9, excluding 3.

So, perhaps I can use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 0 to n except k.

2. Adjust the sequence to ensure that no subset sums to k, while still covering all other v from 1 to n.

But I need a more concrete method.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 0 to n except k, then the subset sums must cover all v except k.

This is similar to having the subset sums equal to the set {0,1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems tricky to achieve directly.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the subset sums form a certain set, and by choosing the sequence appropriately, I can exclude only k.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that with 25 numbers, I can cover a large range of sums, and since n is up to 10^6, it's manageable.

Perhaps I can fix a sequence of 25 numbers and adjust one of them based on k to exclude that particular sum.

But I need to think of a general way to do this.

Let me consider preselecting 24 numbers and then choosing the 25th number based on k and n.

But I need a better strategy.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the subset sums form a group under addition, and by choosing the numbers appropriately, I can control which sums are possible.

But this might be too advanced for this problem.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers where the subset sums cover a certain range, and then I add another number, the new subset sums are the old sums plus the new number.

So, if I have sums S with a set A, and add a number x, the new sums are S union (S + x).

Using this property, I can build up the set of possible sums step by step.

But constructing a set of 25 numbers to cover all v from 1 to n except one specific k seems complicated.

I need a smarter way.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

It is guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints.

So, I don't need to worry about cases where no solution exists.

Also, n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7.

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) or O(m log n), where m is small.

But m is at most 25, so it's manageable.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a set of 25 numbers that can cover all n up to 10^6, and then adjust for k.

But 25 numbers can cover up to 2^25 -1 sums, which is over 33 million, way more than n=10^6.

So, it's feasible.

But I need to ensure that for each k, I can block only that particular sum.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that with 25 numbers, I can represent up to 2^25 subsets, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

So, perhaps I can select numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But I need a systematic way to choose those numbers based on n and k.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers where the subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums must include all v != k.

This is similar to the concept of a complete set minus one element.

In coding theory, there are concepts like punctured codes, where one position is removed, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 0 to n except k.

This means that for every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists at least one subset that sums to v, and no subset sums to k.

I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, I need an efficient way to construct this sequence.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can cover a large range of sums.

So, perhaps I can use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Use a set of small numbers, say several 1's, to cover the lower sums.

2. Use larger numbers to cover the higher sums.

3. Adjust the sequence to ensure that k cannot be formed.

But I need to determine how many 1's to use and what larger numbers to include.

Let me consider that if I use (k-1) 1's, I can cover sums from 0 to k-1.

Then, I can use larger numbers to cover higher sums, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But in this case, if k=3, using two 1's allows sums 0,1,2.

Then, adding larger numbers like 4,8, etc., can cover higher sums.

But I need to ensure that k=3 cannot be formed.

So, in this sequence, since I have only two 1's, sum=3 cannot be formed, as it would require three 1's.

So, for k=3, using two 1's and then adding larger numbers like 4,8, etc., can cover higher sums without forming 3.

Similarly, for k=7, I can use six 1's to cover sums up to 6, and then add larger numbers to cover higher sums, ensuring that 7 cannot be formed.

But in this case, with six 1's, sum=7 can be formed as 1+1+1+1+1+1+1, but I have only six 1's, so sum=7 is not possible.

Then, adding larger numbers like 8,9, etc., can cover higher sums.

But in this approach, I'm limited by the number of 1's I can use.

Given that m is at most 25, I can use up to 25 numbers, some of which can be 1's.

But for larger k, I might need more 1's, which could exceed the limit of 25.

For example, if k=1000000, I would need 999999 ones to cover sums up to 999999, but m is only 25.

So, this approach is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can use a combination of small and large numbers to cover the required sums.

Perhaps I can use some powers of 2 and adjust the sequence to exclude k.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that with m numbers, I can cover up to 2^m -1 sums.

So, with m=25, I can cover up to 33554431 sums, which is more than n=10^6.

So, I can select m numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But I need a systematic way to choose those m numbers based on n and k.

This is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I fix a set of m-1 numbers and choose the m-th number based on k and n.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 0 to n except k, then the subset sums must be all v !=k.

This is similar to having the subset sums equal to the set {0,1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems like a custom subset sum problem, and I need a way to construct such a set.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 0 to n, and then remove the subsets that sum to k, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to adjust the sums.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 0 to a, and a set B that can generate all sums from 0 to b, then the union of A and B can generate sums up to a+b.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me consider that in the sequence, I can include numbers that allow me to cover the required sums while blocking k.

But I need a concrete method.

Let me consider that if I include k itself in the sequence, then subsets that include k would sum to k plus other numbers, which is above k, but I need to ensure that no subset sums to exactly k.

So, including k in the sequence is not helpful, because then [k] is a subset that sums to k, which is not allowed.

Therefore, k cannot be included in the sequence.

So, the sequence must not contain k as any of its elements.

Wait, no, the sequence can contain k as an element, but then [k] would be a subset that sums to k, which is not allowed.

Therefore, k cannot be included in the sequence.

So, the sequence must not contain k as any of its elements.

But that's not necessarily true, because if k can be formed by a combination of multiple elements, it's okay, as long as no subset sums to k.

Wait, actually, the problem states that there should be no subsequence with sum k.

So, the sequence can contain k as an element, but then [k] would be a subset that sums to k, which is not allowed.

Therefore, k cannot be included in the sequence.

So, the sequence must not contain k as any of its elements.

But in the earlier examples, sequences did not contain k.

For example, for n=9, k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1], which does not contain 3.

Similarly, for n=10, k=7, sequence is [1,2,8,3], which does not contain 7.

Wait, but it contains 3 when k=7.

Wait, for n=10, k=7: [1,2,8,3]

Here, k=7 is not in the sequence, and sum=1+2+8+3=14, but subsets like [1,2,3]=6, [1,2,8]=11, [1,3,8]=12, [2,3,8]=13, [1,2,3,8]=14.

No subset sums to 7.

So, in this case, k=7 is not in the sequence, and no subset sums to 7.

Similarly, for n=8, k=8: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which does not contain 8, and no subset sums to 8.

So, in general, the sequence should not contain k, and no subset should sum to k.

But simply excluding k from the sequence is not enough; I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

So, I need a way to select the sequence such that k cannot be formed as a sum of any subset.

Given that, perhaps I can select numbers that are not divisors of k or something similar.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have numbers that are multiples of some factor, I can control the sums.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I choose numbers that are all greater than k, then subsets can only sum to values greater than k, but then I cannot form sums less than k.

But the problem requires forming sums from 1 to n, except k.

So, I need to be able to form sums less than k and greater than k, but not k.

Therefore, I cannot just use numbers greater than k.

Similarly, using only numbers less than k would allow forming sums up to the sum of all elements, but I need to cover up to n, which could be larger than k.

So, I need a mix of small and large numbers.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can choose numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can fix a set of m-1 numbers and choose the m-th number based on k and n.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if I have a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 0 to n except k, then the subset sums must be all v !=k.

This is similar to having the subset sums equal to the set {0,1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems like a custom subset sum problem, and I need a way to construct such a set.

But I'm not sure
