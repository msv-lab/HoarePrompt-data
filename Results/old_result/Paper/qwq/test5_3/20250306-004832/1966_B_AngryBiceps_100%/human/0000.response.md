Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid of squares, each being either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations on the grid where I select two squares of the same color, and then all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners get changed to that color.

The question is, can I make the entire grid have squares of the same color—either all 'W' or all 'B'—by performing any number of these operations?

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. So, it's like filling a rectangle with the color of the endpoints.

I need to think about what this operation allows me to do. It seems like it can help me spread a color over a region, but only if I have two squares of that color to define the rectangle.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

2 1

W

B

Output: NO

In this case, it's a 2x1 grid, with the first square 'W' and the second 'B'. Since the grid is only two squares, and they are different colors, I can't perform any operation because I can't find two squares of the same color to define a rectangle. So, it's impossible to change anything, hence "NO".

Example 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Output: YES

This is a larger grid, and apparently, it's possible to make all squares the same color with some operations. But I need to figure out the general approach, not just this specific case.

Example 3:

1 1

W

Output: YES

This is a single square, which is already uniform, so no operation is needed, and it's "YES".

Example 4:

2 2

BB

BB

Output: YES

Again, all squares are already 'B', so no operation is needed.

Example 5:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Output: YES

This grid alternates colors in a checkerboard pattern. I need to see if I can make all squares the same color.

Example 6:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

Output: NO

Here, the grid has two rows of 'BB' and two rows of 'WW'. It's not possible to make all squares the same color because any operation on 'BB' affects only those squares, and similarly for 'WW', but there's no way to change the 'WW' to 'B' or vice versa.

Wait, actually, if I select two 'B's, I can change a rectangle to 'B', but that only affects the 'B's, not the 'W's. Similarly for 'W's. So, if there are isolated regions of 'W's and 'B's, it might be impossible to统一 them.

Example 7:

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

Output: YES

Some arrangement where it's possible.

Example 8:

1 5

WBBWB

Output: NO

A single row with alternating 'W's and 'B's.

From these examples, it seems that if there are connected regions of the same color that can influence each other, it might be possible to make the entire grid uniform. But if there are separated regions of different colors that can't influence each other, then it's impossible.

I need to think in terms of connectivity. If all 'W's form a connected region and all 'B's form a connected region, and they intersect in a way that allows operations to spread one color to the other, then it might be possible.

But that seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = []

first_row = ''

last_row = ''

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, the code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and m, the grid dimensions, and then reads the grid row by row.

It then constructs two strings: first_row, which seems to be composed of the last row's first characters, and last_row, which seems to be composed of the last characters of each row.

Wait, actually, for each row, it appends the first character to first_row and the last character to last_row. So, first_row is the vertical strip from top-left to bottom-left, and last_row is the vertical strip from top-right to bottom-right.

Then, it checks:

1. If the first row is uniform (all same color) and the last row is uniform (all same color), and they are different, then print 'NO'.

2. Else, if the first_row string is uniform and the last_row string is uniform, and they are different, then print 'NO'.

3. Otherwise, print 'YES'.

I need to see if this logic is correct.

Let me think about the first condition:

If the first row is uniform and the last row is uniform, and they are different, then it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Why is that?

Well, if the first row is all 'W' and the last row is all 'B', then to make the entire grid 'W', I would need to somehow change the last row from 'B' to 'W'. But since the last row is all 'B', and the first row is all 'W', there's no way to perform an operation that affects both, because any operation would require selecting two squares of the same color.

So, I can't change 'B's to 'W's or vice versa in this scenario, hence "NO".

Similarly, the second condition checks if the leftmost column is uniform and the rightmost column is uniform, and they are different, then "NO".

This seems to cover cases where there are completely separate regions of 'W's and 'B's that can't influence each other.

But is this sufficient? Are there cases where this logic fails?

Let me consider a grid where the first row is uniform 'W', the last row is uniform 'B', but there are some 'W's and 'B's in between that might allow operations to spread the color.

For example:

n=3, m=3

W W W

W B W

B B B

Here, the first row is 'WWW', the last row is 'BBB', which are different and uniform, so according to the code, it should print 'NO'. But is that correct?

Wait, in this case, I can select (1,1) and (3,3), both 'B', and change the entire grid to 'B'. So, it's possible to make the entire grid 'B'. But according to the code, it would print 'NO', which is incorrect.

So, this seems like a flaw in the code's logic.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misread the code.

Looking again, the first_row is constructed by taking the first character of each row, and last_row by taking the last character of each row.

Wait, no, the code does:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

So, a[-1] is the last row, so first_row is the last row's first character, and last_row is the last row's last character.

Wait, no, it's in the loop:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

# After all rows are read, a[-1] is the last row

first_row += a[-1][0]  # append the first character of the last row

last_row += a[-1][-1]  # append the last character of the last row

Wait, but then first_row and last_row are being built by appending characters from the first and last positions of the last row, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, looking carefully:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

# After each row is appended, a[-1] is the last row

first_row += a[-1][0]  # append the first character of the last row

last_row += a[-1][-1]  # append the last character of the last row

But this means that first_row and last_row are being built by repeatedly appending the first and last characters of the last row, n times.

That can't be right. If n=3, m=3, and the last row is 'B B B', then first_row would be 'B B B' (first character of last row, repeated 3 times), and last_row would be 'B B B' (last character of last row, repeated 3 times).

But that doesn't seem useful.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

But this is inside the loop that reads each row. So, for each row read, it appends the first character of the last row to first_row and the last character of the last row to last_row.

So, if n=3, m=3, and the last row is 'B B B', then first_row would be 'B B B' and last_row would be 'B B B'.

But that doesn't make sense. It should probably be building the first and last columns.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me try to correct it.

To build the first column, it should be taking the first character of each row.

Similarly, for the last column, the last character of each row.

So, first_row should be ''.join([row[0] for row in a])

And last_row should be ''.join([row[-1] for row in a])

But in the code, it's doing first_row += a[-1][0] for each row, which is incorrect.

So, this seems like a bug in the code.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color ('W' or 'B') using a series of operations where we select two squares of the same color and change all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**:
   - If the grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), we can immediately return "YES".
   
2. **Check for Connectivity**:
   - We need to check if there is a path of the same color connecting the top and bottom rows or the leftmost and rightmost columns. This ensures that operations can spread the color across the entire grid.
   
3. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - If the first and last rows are uniformly different colors.
   - If the first and last columns are uniformly different colors.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, data[idx].split())
        idx += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(data[idx])
            idx += 1
        # Check if the grid is already uniform
        all_W = all(cell == 'W' for row in a for cell in row)
        all_B = all(cell == 'B' for row in a for cell in row)
        if all_W or all_B:
            print("YES")
            continue
        # Check first and last rows
        first_row = a[0]
        last_row = a[-1]
        if len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and first_row[0] != last_row[0]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        # Check first and last columns
        first_col = ''.join(row[0] for row in a)
        last_col = ''.join(row[-1] for row in a)
        if len(set(first_col)) == 1 and len(set(last_col)) == 1 and first_col[0] != last_col[0]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        # If none of the above conditions are met, it's possible to make the grid uniform
        print("YES")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**:
   - We first check if the entire grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'). If so, we immediately return "YES".

2. **Check for Uniform First and Last Rows**:
   - If the first row is uniformly one color and the last row is uniformly the other color, it's impossible to make the grid uniform because there's no way to change one uniform row to match the other using the allowed operations.

3. **Check for Uniform First and Last Columns**:
   - Similarly, if the first column is uniformly one color and the last column is uniformly the other color, it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it means there are sufficient connections of the same color across the grid, allowing us to perform operations to make the entire grid uniform. Hence, we return "YES".
