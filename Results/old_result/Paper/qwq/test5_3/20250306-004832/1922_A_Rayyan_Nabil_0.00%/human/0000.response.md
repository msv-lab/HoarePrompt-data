Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match this template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at position i, then the string must have exactly that letter at that position. If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, then the string must have a different lowercase letter at that position.

So, for example, if t has 'a' at position i, then s must have 'a' at position i. If t has 'A' at position i, then s must have any letter except 'a' at position i.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make that position in t lowercase or uppercase, based on the conditions for a, b, and c.

Let's consider position i.

I have a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to choose t[i], which can be either lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, say 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'X', then a[i] and b[i] must be any letter except the lowercase 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

Wait, no. If t[i] is 'X', then a[i] and b[i] must be different from 'x', and c[i] must be 'x' for it not to match.

Wait, actually, for c not to match, it must violate the template at some position.

So, for t[i] being 'X', a[i] and b[i] must be different from 'x', and c[i] must be equal to 'x' to not match.

Alternatively, if t[i] is lowercase 'x', then a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

So, for each position i, I have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

I need to choose for all positions in a way that satisfies the conditions for a, b, and c.

This sounds like a problem where I need to check for each position what constraints are imposed by a, b, and c.

Let me try to formalize the conditions.

For position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then:

  - a[i] must be 'x'

  - b[i] must be 'x'

  - c[i] must not be 'x'

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

  - a[i] must not be 'x'

  - b[i] must not be 'x'

  - c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position i, I need to choose whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to make sure that for all positions, the choices are consistent.

Let me think about what constraints this imposes.

For position i:

- If a[i] != b[i], then it's impossible to choose t[i] that satisfies both a and b.

  - If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', which requires a[i] == b[i] == 'x'.

  - If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then both a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', so a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x'.

  - But if a[i] != b[i], then in the lowercase case, a[i] == b[i] == 'x' can't hold if a[i] != b[i].

  - In the uppercase case, a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x', but since a[i] != b[i], this can still hold.

  - However, I need to ensure that for c[i], if t[i] is uppercase 'X', then c[i] == 'x', and if t[i] is lowercase 'x', then c[i] != 'x'.

  - So, if a[i] != b[i], then I can only choose t[i] as uppercase 'X' if a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

  - But since a[i] != b[i], and both must not be 'x', this requires that a[i] and b[i] are different and neither is 'x'.

  - Additionally, c[i] must be 'x'.

  - But this seems too specific. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal and c[i] must be different.

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from c[i]'s corresponding letter.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of possibilities for each position.

For each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then:

  - a[i] == 'x'

  - b[i] == 'x'

  - c[i] != 'x'

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

  - a[i] != 'x'

  - b[i] != 'x'

  - c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position, I have to choose one of these two options, and all choices must be consistent across all positions.

This seems like a problem where I need to check for each position whether there exists a choice (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the conditions based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Moreover, the template t must be such that all positions satisfy their individual choices.

So, for the entire string, it's a matter of checking, for each position, whether there's a valid choice (lowercase or uppercase), and that these choices don't contradict each other.

Wait, but the template t is a single string that combines all positions.

I need to make sure that the choices for each position are independent or that they can be combined into a single template string.

Let me consider that for each position, I can make an independent choice, as the template's characters are considered separately.

So, perhaps I can treat each position independently and see if there's any position where neither choice works.

Wait, but the problem requires that a and b match the template, and c does not.

So, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where c violates the template's condition.

But a and b must match the template on all positions.

So, I need to ensure that:

- For all positions i, a matches t.

- For all positions i, b matches t.

- There exists at least one position j where c does not match t.

Given that, I can think of it as:

- For each position i, t must be chosen such that a and b both match it.

- Additionally, there must be at least one position where c does not match t.

Now, for each position i, since both a and b must match t, I need to find a t[i] that is compatible with a[i] and b[i].

Then, across all positions, I need to ensure that c does not match at least one position.

Wait, more precisely:

- For all positions, a matches t.

- For all positions, b matches t.

- There exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, I need to find a template t such that:

- a and b both match t on all positions.

- c does not match t on at least one position.

To find if such a t exists, I can consider the constraints imposed by a and b, and then see if there's a way to set t so that c fails to match t in at least one position.

First, since a and b must both match t, I need to find a t that is compatible with both a and b.

Then, ensure that c does not match this t in at least one position.

Let's think about how to construct t for each position.

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

  - Then, for t[i], I can choose:

    - Lowercase t[i] = a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i].

    - Uppercase t[i] = a[i].upper(), provided that c[i] == a[i].

  - Wait, if t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i], then c[i] must not be equal to a[i].

  - If t[i] is uppercase and equal to a[i].upper(), then c[i] must be equal to a[i].

  - So, if a[i] == b[i], then I can choose:

    - t[i] = a[i] (lowercase), but only if c[i] != a[i].

    - t[i] = a[i].upper() (uppercase), but only if c[i] == a[i].

  - So, in this case, I have to choose t[i] based on c[i].

  - If c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

  - If c[i] == a[i], then I can choose t[i] = a[i].upper() (uppercase).

  - But I need to ensure that c does not match t in at least one position.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

  - This is more complicated.

  - If a[i] != b[i], then for t[i], it's harder to satisfy both a and b.

  - If I choose t[i] as lowercase 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', but since a[i] != b[i], this is impossible.

  - Therefore, I must choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', which requires that a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

  - But since a[i] != b[i], and both must not be 'x', this imposes that a[i] and b[i] are different and neither is 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

  - This is a specific condition that may not always hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for positions where a[i] == b[i], I have more flexibility, and for positions where a[i] != b[i], I have less flexibility.

Moreover, I need to ensure that c does not match t in at least one position.

So, perhaps I can choose t such that for some position where c differs from a and b, I can make t's choice force c to mismatch.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

So, position 1:

a[1] = 'a'

b[1] = 'b'

c[1] = 'c'

I need to choose t[1]:

- If t[1] is lowercase, say 'x', then:

  - a[1] == 'x' (requires 'a' == 'x')

  - b[1] == 'x' (requires 'b' == 'x')

  - But 'a' != 'b', so cannot have 'x' equal to both 'a' and 'b'.

  - Hence, cannot choose lowercase for t[1].

- If t[1] is uppercase, say 'X', then:

  - a[1] != 'x' (requires 'a' != 'x')

  - b[1] != 'x' (requires 'b' != 'x')

  - c[1] == 'x' (requires 'c' == 'x')

  - So, set t[1] = 'C', then:

    - 'a' != 'c'

    - 'b' != 'c'

    - 'c' == 'c'

  - Hence, a and b match t, and c does not match t.

So, in this case, it's possible.

In the second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a'

b[1] = 'b'

c[1] = 'a'

- If t[1] is lowercase 'x':

  - 'a' == 'x'

  - 'b' == 'x'

  - 'a' != 'x'

  - But 'a' == 'x' and 'b' == 'x' requires 'a' == 'b', which is not true.

  - So, cannot choose lowercase.

- If t[1] is uppercase 'X':

  - 'a' != 'x'

  - 'b' != 'x'

  - 'a' == 'x'

  - But 'a' != 'x' and 'b' != 'x', and 'a' == 'x', which is contradictory.

  - So, cannot choose uppercase.

Hence, no valid t for position 1, so "NO".

In the third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

I need to find a template t such that a and b match t, but c does not.

Looking at the positions where a and b differ:

For example, position 1: a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l'

So, for t[1], cannot choose lowercase, must choose uppercase 'M' or 'L', but need to see what c[1] is ('a').

Wait, I need to think more carefully.

In this case, it's complex to analyze manually, but apparently, it's possible, as the output is "YES".

In the fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a'

b[1] = 'a'

c[1] = 'a'

- Choose t[1] lowercase 'a':

  - a[1] == 'a'

  - b[1] == 'a'

  - c[1] != 'a' (but c[1] == 'a', so cannot choose lowercase.

- Choose t[1] uppercase 'A':

  - a[1] != 'a' (but 'a' != 'a' is false)

  - b[1] != 'a' (but 'a' != 'a' is false)

  - c[1] == 'a'

  - Since a[1] != 'a' is false, cannot choose uppercase.

Hence, no valid t for position 1, so "NO".

From these examples, it seems that when a[i] == b[i], I have to choose t[i] accordingly based on c[i], and when a[i] != b[i], it's more restrictive.

I need to generalize this.

Let me try to formalize the conditions for each position i.

For position i:

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- Subcase 1: c[i] != a[i]

  - Choose t[i] as lowercase a[i]. Then:

    - a[i] == t[i]

    - b[i] == t[i]

    - c[i] != t[i]

  - This satisfies all conditions.

- Subcase 2: c[i] == a[i]

  - Cannot choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], because c[i] == a[i].

  - Must choose t[i] as uppercase a[i].upper().

    - Then:

      - a[i] != a[i].upper()'s lowercase version (which is a[i])

      - b[i] != a[i].upper()'s lowercase version (which is a[i])

      - c[i] == a[i]

    - But a[i] != a[i] is false, so cannot choose uppercase.

  - Hence, only possible if c[i] != a[i].

Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

- Cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because t[i] would have to be equal to both a[i] and b[i], which is impossible.

- Must choose t[i] as uppercase t[i].

  - Then:

    - a[i] != t[i].lower()

    - b[i] != t[i].lower()

    - c[i] == t[i].lower()

  - So, t[i].lower() must be such that:

    - a[i] != t[i].lower()

    - b[i] != t[i].lower()

    - c[i] == t[i].lower()

  - Therefore, t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i], and b[i] != c[i].

  - So, only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, summarizing:

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

  - Possible only if c[i] != a[i], by choosing t[i] as lowercase a[i].

  - If c[i] == a[i], then cannot choose lowercase.

  - Cannot choose uppercase because it would require a[i] != a[i].upper().lower() = a[i], which is false.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must choose t[i] as uppercase.

  - Requires that:

    - a[i] != t[i].lower()

    - b[i] != t[i].lower()

    - c[i] == t[i].lower()

  - Hence, t[i].lower() must be c[i], and a[i] != c[i], and b[i] != c[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Only possible to choose t[i] as lowercase a[i] if c[i] != a[i].

- If c[i] == a[i], then no valid choice.

For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Only possible to choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper(), but only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, no valid choice.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa", the output is "NO", which matches this reasoning because for position 1, a[1]='a', b[1]='b', c[1]='a'. Since a[1] != b[1], must choose t[1] as uppercase, but c[1] = 'a', so t[1].lower() = 'a', but a[1] != 'a' is false, so cannot choose uppercase. Hence, no valid t for position 1.

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder", output is "YES", so there must be a way to choose t for all positions such that a and b match t, and c does not match t in at least one position.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for positions where a[i] == b[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i] only if c[i] != a[i], or choose uppercase only if c[i] == a[i] and a[i] != c[i], which is impossible.

Wait, no, for a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

- If c[i] == a[i], then choose t[i] as uppercase a[i].upper(), but this requires that a[i] != a[i].upper().lower() = a[i], which is false.

- Hence, only possible if c[i] != a[i].

But in the third test case, there are positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], so according to this, it should be "NO", but the output is "YES", so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that c does not match t in at least one position, but a and b match t in all positions.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I cannot make t[i] such that c does not match t at that position, but I can make c not match t at some other position.

Wait, maybe I need to make sure that there is at least one position where c does not match t, while a and b match t in all positions.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I have to choose t[i] as uppercase a[i].upper(), which requires that a[i] != a[i] and b[i] != a[i], which is false, so cannot choose.

Hence, in such positions, I cannot choose any t[i] that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, for the entire template to satisfy the conditions, for all positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I cannot find a valid t[i].

Hence, in such cases, it's impossible to have such a template t.

But in the third test case, the output is "YES", which suggests that there are positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], allowing me to choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper(), making c not match t at that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t, and for all other positions, a and b match t.

So, perhaps I can choose t[i] for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i] as lowercase a[i], and for positions where a[i] != b[i], choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper(), provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, c will not match t at those positions where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] == c[i], which is always true, but need to ensure that a and b match t at those positions.

Wait, no, for positions where a[i] != b[i], choosing t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper() requires that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which may or may not hold.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], and for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase, provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t, it's acceptable.

Wait, but c must not match t in at least one position, but a and b must match t in all positions.

So, perhaps I can choose t[i] for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i] as lowercase a[i], and for positions where a[i] != b[i], choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that c[i] == t[i].lower().

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to find a template t such that:

- For all i, a matches t.

- For all i, b matches t.

- There exists at least one i where c does not match t.

Given the matching rules:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then s[i] must be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from t[i].lower().

So, for a and b to match t at all positions, and c to not match t at least in one position.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can independently choose whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Then, I need to make sure that:

- For all i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- For all i, if t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower().

- There exists at least one i where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i].

  - If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == t[i].lower().

So, for each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase a[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase x, where x.lower() != a[i], x.lower() != b[i], and c[i] == x.lower().

Wait, more precisely:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], then:

  - a[i] == t[i]

  - b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i]

  - So, this is possible only if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase X, where X.lower() is some letter y:

  - a[i] != y

  - b[i] != y

  - c[i] == y

  - So, y must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Therefore, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

  - If c[i] == a[i], then cannot choose lowercase.

    - Try to choose t[i] as uppercase z, where z.lower() != a[i] and z.lower() != b[i], but c[i] == z.lower().

    - But c[i] == a[i], so z.lower() == a[i].

    - But then z.lower() == a[i], but t[i] being uppercase z requires a[i] != z.lower() and b[i] != z.lower(), which is a[i] != a[i] and b[i] != a[i].

    - a[i] != a[i] is false, so cannot choose uppercase.

    - Hence, if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], no valid choice for t[i].

- If a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must choose t[i] as uppercase z, where z.lower() == c[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

  - So, only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, the general rule is:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

  - If c[i] == a[i], no valid choice.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Can choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper(), but only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, to have a valid template t:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Must have c[i] != a[i].

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Moreover, the template t is constructed by choosing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]:

  - t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]:

  - t[i] = c[i].upper().

Also, need to ensure that c does not match t in at least one position.

Given the above, I can implement the following logic:

- For each test case:

  - Read n, a, b, c.

  - Check for each position i from 0 to n-1:

    - If a[i] == b[i]:

      - Ensure that c[i] != a[i].

    - If a[i] != b[i]:

      - Ensure that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

  - If all such conditions hold for all positions where a[i] == b[i] or a[i] != b[i], then it's possible, so print "YES".

  - Else, print "NO".

Wait, but in the first case:

n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c"

- a[0] != b[0], so need c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0], which is 'c' != 'a' and 'c' != 'b', which is true, so "YES".

In the second case:

n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa"

- Position 0: a[0] == b[0] and c[0] == a[0], which violates the condition, so "NO".

In the third case:

n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder"

- Need to check for each position:

  - Where a[i] == b[i]:

    - Ensure c[i] != a[i].

  - Where a[i] != b[i]:

    - Ensure c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- If all such positions satisfy these conditions, then "YES".

In the fourth case:

n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc"

- Position 0: a[0] == b[0] == 'a', c[0] == 'a', which violates c[0] != a[0], so "NO".

Hence, the condition is that for all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions hold for all positions, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the third test case, there might be positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], and positions where a[i] != b[i], with c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, I need to check that for all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If both these conditions hold for all positions, then "YES", else "NO".

This seems to be a correct way to determine the answer.

Now, looking back at the given program:

def func():

    t = int(input())

    l = 'YES'

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = input()

        b = input()

        c = input()

        for i in range(n):

            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

                l = 'YES'

        else:

            l = 'NO'

        print(l)

This seems incorrect.

Wait, in the code:

for i in range(n):

    if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

        l = 'YES'

else:

    l = 'NO'

print(l)

This loop sets l to 'YES' if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and sets l to 'NO' only if for all positions, a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i].

But according to my earlier reasoning, the conditions are more specific.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

In Python, the 'else' clause on a loop is executed only if the loop finishes normally, without encountering a 'break'.

So, in this code:

for i in range(n):

    if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

        l = 'YES'

else:

    l = 'NO'

print(l)

This means that if, for any i, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then l is set to 'YES' and the loop exits (since there's no break, it continues until the end).

Wait, no, without a break, it will check all i and set l to 'YES' every time the condition is met, and finally, if the loop completes without the condition being met, l is set to 'NO'.

But this doesn't enforce the necessary conditions.

According to my earlier reasoning, I need to check for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

But in this code, it's checking if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which is not the same.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

For example, in the first test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

- a[0] != c[0] ('a' != 'c') and b[0] != c[0] ('b' != 'c'), so l = 'YES'

- Loop ends, print 'YES' correctly.

In the second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

- For i=0: a[0] != c[0] ('a' != 'a') is false, and b[0] != c[0] ('b' != 'a') is true, so a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] is false.

- For i=1: a[1] != c[1] ('a' != 'a') is false, and b[1] != c[1] ('b' != 'a') is true, so a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] is false.

- Loop ends without setting l to 'YES', so l = 'NO'

- Which matches the correct output.

In the third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

- Need to check for each position:

  - If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

  - If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- But in the given program, it's checking if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for each position and setting l to 'YES' if this condition holds for any position.

- This is not sufficient, as per my earlier reasoning.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

A correct program should check for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- If all positions satisfy these conditions, then "YES", else "NO".

But the given program only checks if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which is not the same.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{false}} \]
