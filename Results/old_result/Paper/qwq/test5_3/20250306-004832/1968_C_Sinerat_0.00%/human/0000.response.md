Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x2 to xn, and I need to find an array a with elements from a1 to an that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each ai is between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, xi equals ai modulo a(i-1).

And I need to find any such array a that meets these conditions.

First, I need to understand what xi = ai mod a(i-1) means. The modulo operation gives the remainder when ai is divided by a(i-1). So, ai = k * a(i-1) + xi for some integer k, where 0 ≤ xi < a(i-1).

This means that ai is somehow related to a(i-1) through this equation. I need to find values for a1 to an that satisfy this relationship for each i from 2 to n.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by choosing a1 arbitrarily and then determine the other ai based on that.

Wait, but a1 isn't constrained directly by any xi, except indirectly through a2. So, I can choose a1 freely, as long as the subsequent ai satisfy ai = k * a(i-1) + xi.

But choosing a1 too small might cause problems, especially if xi are large. I need to make sure that xi < a(i-1), because the modulo operation requires that.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's given that 1 ≤ xi ≤ 500, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, xi can be up to 500, and n can be up to 500.

In the sample input, for the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

a2 mod a1 = 5 mod 3 = 2 = x2

a3 mod a2 = 4 mod 5 = 4 = x3

a4 mod a3 = 9 mod 4 = 1 = x4

That makes sense.

Another sample input:

n = 3

x = [1,1]

Output:

a = [2,5,11]

Check:

5 mod 2 = 1 = x2

11 mod 5 = 1 = x3

Good.

So, how to find such an array a?

One way is to choose a1, then set a2 = k2 * a1 + x2, a3 = k3 * a2 + x3, and so on, where k2, k3, ... are integers chosen such that a(i) is within the limits.

But I need to ensure that a(i-1) > x(i), because in modulo operation, the divisor must be greater than the remainder.

Wait, actually, in Python, c mod d is defined for any integers c and d, as long as d != 0, and it's c - floor(c/d)*d.

But in standard mathematical terms, for positive integers, c mod d is the remainder when c is divided by d, with 0 ≤ c mod d < d.

So, to satisfy ai mod a(i-1) = xi, I need ai >= xi, and a(i-1) > xi.

Wait, a(i-1) must be greater than xi, because in modulo operation, the divisor should be greater than the remainder.

So, a(i-1) > xi.

Therefore, for each i from 2 to n, a(i-1) > xi.

Given that xi can be up to 500, a1 must be greater than x2, a2 > x3, and so on.

So, in the sample input, a1 = 3 > x2 = 2

a2 = 5 > x3 = 4

a3 = 4 > x4 = 1

Wait, but a3 = 4 > x4 = 1 is fine, but a2 = 5 > x3 = 4 is also fine.

Another sample:

a = [2,5,11]

2 > 1, 5 > 1, 11 > nothing (since n=3)

Similarly, in the first sample, a1=3 > x2=2, a2=5 > x3=4, a3=4 > x4=1.

So, it seems that choosing a1 > x2, and then a2 = k2 * a1 + x2, and a3 = k3 * a2 + x3, and so on, ensuring that a(i-1) > xi for each step.

But how to choose the ks?

Well, ks can be chosen such that a(i) is within the limits, say, less than or equal to 10^9.

One simple way is to choose k=1 for all, so a(i) = a(i-1) + xi.

Wait, that's what the given program does: it sets a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1.

Let me see if that works.

In the first sample:

a0 = 3

a1 = 3 + 2 = 5

a2 = 5 + 4 = 9

a3 = 9 + 1 = 10

But the sample output has a3 = 9, not 10.

Hmm, maybe there's more than one possible solution.

But according to the problem, any correct a is acceptable.

So, if a3 = 10, is that correct?

Let's check:

a2 mod a1 = 5 mod 3 = 2 = x2

a3 mod a2 = 10 mod 5 = 0 ≠ x3=4

Oh, wait, that's not matching.

So, the program's approach doesn't work in this case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Wait, the program sets a[0] = 500, and then a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1.

Wait, n=4, x=[2,4,1], so x[i-1] for i=1 to 3: x[0]=2, x[1]=4, x[2]=1

So, a[0]=500

a[1]=500 + 2=502

a[2]=502 + 4=506

a[3]=506 + 1=507

Now, check:

a2 mod a1 = 502 mod 500 = 2 = x2

a3 mod a2 = 506 mod 502 = 4 = x3

a4 mod a3 = 507 mod 506 = 1 = x4

So, in this case, it works.

But in the first sample input, if I set a1=500, a2=500+2=502, a3=502+4=506, a4=506+1=507, which seems correct, but the sample output has a1=3, a2=5, a3=4, a4=9, which also works.

So, both are correct.

But in the first sample, a3=4, and a4=9, so 9 mod 4 =1, which matches x4=1.

But in the program's approach, a3=506, a4=507, 507 mod 506=1, which matches x4=1.

So, it seems to work.

But earlier, when I tried a different k, it didn't work.

Wait, maybe the program's approach always works, but my earlier manual calculation was wrong.

Let's see why my earlier manual calculation didn't work.

I set a0=3, a1=3+2=5, a2=5+4=9, a3=9+1=10.

Then, a2 mod a1 =5 mod 3=2=x2, a3 mod a2=10 mod 5=0≠4=x3.

So, it failed.

But according to the program's approach, a3 should be a2 + x3=5+4=9, not 10.

Wait, I see, I made a mistake in the manual calculation.

If I set a3=a2 + x3=5+4=9, then a3=9, and a4=a3 + x4=9+1=10.

Wait, but in the sample, a4=9, which might be incorrect.

Wait, no, in the sample, for n=4, x=[2,4,1], output is a=[3,5,4,9]

So, a1=3, a2=5, a3=4, a4=9

Check:

5 mod 3 =2=x2

4 mod 5=4=x3

9 mod 4=1=x4

Perfect.

But according to the program's approach, a0=500, a1=500+2=502, a2=502+4=506, a3=506+1=507

Which also works:

502 mod 500=2=x2

506 mod 502=4=x3

507 mod 506=1=x4

So, both are correct.

So, the program's approach seems to work.

But why does it work?

Let me see.

If I set a1 to some value greater than x2, then set a2=a1 + x2, so a2 mod a1 = x2, since a1 + x2 mod a1 = x2.

Similarly, a3=a2 + x3, so a3 mod a2 = x3.

And so on.

So, in general, setting a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] ensures that a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i-1].

Wait, but in the manual calculation earlier, when I set a1=3, a2=5, a3=4, a4=9, it worked, but a3=4 which is less than a2=5, and a4=9 which is greater than a3=4.

But according to the program's approach, a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1], which ensures that a[i] > a[i-1], assuming x[i-1] > 0, which it is since 1 ≤ xi ≤ 500.

Wait, but in the sample input, a3=4 < a2=5, which is allowed because a2 > a3 in that case.

But according to the program's approach, a[i] > a[i-1], which also works.

So, both are acceptable.

But the problem allows any a that satisfies the conditions.

So, as long as a[i-1] > xi, and a[i] = k * a[i-1] + xi for some integer k, it's acceptable.

The program chooses k=1 for all steps, which seems to work.

But in the manual calculation, I chose a1=3, a2=5, a3=4, a4=9, which has a3=4 < a2=5, but still satisfies a2 mod a1=2, a3 mod a2=4, a4 mod a3=1.

So, it's acceptable.

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=2, x=[1]

So, need to find a1 and a2 such that a2 mod a1 =1.

Let's set a1=2, a2=3.

3 mod 2=1, which is correct.

According to the program, a1=500, a2=500+1=501.

501 mod 500=1, which is correct.

Edge case 2: n=2, x=[500]

Need a1 and a2 such that a2 mod a1=500.

So, a1 must be greater than 500.

Set a1=501, a2=501 +500=1001.

1001 mod 501=1001 - 501*1=1001-501=500, which is correct.

Another way: set a1=1000, a2=1000 +500=1500.

1500 mod 1000=500, which is correct.

So, the program's approach works here as well.

Edge case 3: n=3, x=[1,1]

According to the program, a1=500, a2=500+1=501, a3=501+1=502.

Check:

501 mod 500=1=x2

502 mod 501=1=x3

Which is correct.

But in the sample input, for n=3, x=[1,1], output is a=[2,5,11]

Check:

5 mod 2=1=x2

11 mod 5=1=x3

Both are correct.

Edge case 4: n=2, x=[500]

a1=500, a2=500+500=1000.

1000 mod 500=0 ≠500.

Wait, that's not right.

Wait, according to the modulo operation, 1000 mod 500=0, but we need it to be 500.

Wait, but 1000 mod 500=0, which is not equal to x2=500.

So, this is a problem.

Wait, does that mean the program's approach fails here?

Wait, no, because in this case, a1=500, a2=500+500=1000, and 1000 mod 500=0 ≠500.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that 1 ≤ xi ≤500, and a1 must be greater than xi.

So, in this case, a1=500, and x2=500, but a1 should be greater than x2.

Wait, a1 must be greater than x2, which is 500 in this case.

But a1=500 is not greater than x2=500.

So, the program sets a1=500, but a1 needs to be greater than x2=500.

Hence, in this case, the program's approach fails.

So, to fix this, perhaps a1 should be set to x2 + 1, or some value greater than x2.

In this case, set a1=501, then a2=501+500=1001.

1001 mod 501=1001-501*1=500, which is x2=500.

So, it works if a1 > x2.

But in the program, a1 is fixed at 500, which may not be greater than x2 if x2=500.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier cases, it worked.

But in this particular case, it fails.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, 1 ≤ xi ≤500, and n ≥2.

So, if x2=500, and a1=500, then a1 is not greater than x2, hence a2 mod a1 =0 ≠500.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, to make it correct, a1 should be set to x2 +1, or more generally, to max(x2,1) +1, to ensure a1 > x2.

Hence, the program should set a1 to x2 +1, or some value greater than x2.

In the sample input, for n=2, x=[500], a1=501, a2=501+500=1001, which works.

Similarly, for n=3, x=[1,1], a1=2, a2=2+1=3, a3=3+1=4, which works: 3 mod 2=1, 4 mod 3=1.

Hence, the corrected approach is to set a1 to x2 +1, and then a[i]=a[i-1]+x[i-1] for i from 2 to n.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=4, x=[2,4,1], x2=2, so a1=3, a2=5, a3=9, a4=10.

Wait, but in the sample output, a4=9, which also works.

So, setting a1=x2 +1=3, a2=3+2=5, a3=5+4=9, a4=9+1=10.

But sample output has a4=9, which might be achieved by choosing different ks.

But the important thing is that the program's approach needs to ensure a1 > x2.

Hence, the program should set a1 to x2 +1, not fixed at 500.

But in the program, a[0]=500, which may not be greater than x[0]=x2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first sample input, x2=2, and a1=500>2, which works.

In the second sample input, x2=1, a1=500>1, which works.

In the third sample input, x2=4, a1=500>4, which works.

But in the fourth sample input, x2=500, a1=500= x2, which is incorrect, because a1 must be greater than x2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

To fix it, set a1 = x2 +1, or a1 = max(x2,1) +1.

But in the problem, x2 can be up to 500, so a1 can be set to x2 +1, which is at most 501.

But to generalize, perhaps set a1 to x2 +1.

Wait, but in the sample input where x2=500, a1=501, which is acceptable.

But in the program, a[0]=500, which is not greater than x2=500 in that case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct an array \( a \) such that for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \). The challenge is to ensure that \( a_{i-1} > x_i \) for the modulo operation to hold true.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup:** We need to carefully choose \( a_1 \) such that it is greater than \( x_2 \). To achieve this, set \( a_1 = x_2 + 1 \). This ensures \( a_1 > x_2 \).

2. **Constructing the Array:** For each subsequent element \( a_i \), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \). This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \), given that \( a_{i-1} > x_i \).

3. **Constraints Handling:** By setting \( a_1 = x_2 + 1 \), we handle the edge case where \( x_2 \) is equal to the upper limit, ensuring \( a_1 > x_2 \).

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        x = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n - 1]))
        idx += n - 1
        a = [0] * n
        if n >= 2:
            a[0] = x[0] + 1  # Set a1 to x2 + 1 to ensure a1 > x2
            for i in range(1, n):
                a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        else:
            # n=1 case, but according to problem, n >=2
            pass
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Initial Setup:** We read all input data at once for efficiency. We parse the number of test cases \( T \) and process each test case one by one.
  
- **Array Construction:** For each test case, we read \( n \) and the array \( x \). We initialize \( a \) as an array of zeros. We set \( a_1 = x_2 + 1 \) to ensure \( a_1 > x_2 \). Then, for each \( a_i \) from \( a_2 \) to \( a_n \), we set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \). This guarantees that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

- **Output:** We print the array \( a \) for each test case in the required format.

This approach ensures that all conditions are met efficiently within the given constraints.
