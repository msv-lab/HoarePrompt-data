Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations are allowed and how they affect the array. The operation can be applied to any element that is at least 10, and when applied, that element is replaced by its individual digits in the same order.

So, for example, starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], if I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I then apply it to 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. And if I apply it to 67, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

In another example, [12, 28, 5], if I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Then, applying it to 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted. If I try applying the operation to different elements, I might not be able to get a sorted array.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no operations are needed.

From these examples, it seems that the operation allows me to break down numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits, which can then be rearranged to form a sorted array.

Now, I need to think about how to approach this problem systematically. Since the operation can be applied any number of times, I need to consider all possible sequences of operations and check if any of them lead to a sorted array.

However, considering all possible sequences could be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 50. So, I need a more efficient way to determine if it's possible to sort the array.

Let me consider what happens when I apply the operation to an element. Essentially, I'm replacing the element with its digits. So, for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and so on.

If I consider the final array after all possible operations have been applied, it would consist only of single-digit numbers because any number greater than or equal to 10 can be broken down into its digits.

So, the question reduces to whether it's possible to break down the array into single-digit numbers and arrange them in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but the operation specifies that the digits are inserted in the same position as the original element. That means the relative order of the digits inserted is preserved.

So, for example, in [12, 3, 45, 67], applying the operation to 12 first gives [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], and then applying it to 45 gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], and finally applying it to 67 gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

In this case, the array becomes sorted. But is there a way to determine this without simulating all possible operations?

Maybe I can think of it as flattening the array by breaking down all elements greater than or equal to 10 into their digits, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.

But wait, in the second example, [12, 28, 5], flattening it would give [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted. Is there any way to apply operations in a different order to get a sorted array? For example, if I apply the operation to 28 first, it becomes [12,2,8,5], and then applying it to 12 gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is still not sorted.

Alternatively, if I could rearrange the elements after breaking them down, but according to the problem, the digits are inserted in the same position, so the relative order should be preserved.

Therefore, it seems that flattening the array by breaking down all elements greater than or equal to 10 into their digits, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted, is the way to go.

But I need to confirm this with the examples.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67], flattening gives [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

In the second example, [12,28,5], flattening gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

In the third example, [0,0], it's already sorted.

So, this seems to align with the examples.

But wait, is it always true that flattening the array in this way will give me the correct result? Let's think about possible edge cases.

Consider [10, 1]. Flattening gives [1,0,1], which is not sorted. Indeed, 1 > 0, so it's not sorted.

Another example: [11, 11], flattening gives [1,1,1,1], which is sorted.

Another example: [20, 3], flattening gives [2,0,3], which is not sorted because 0 < 2.

Wait, but according to the problem, we have to make it sorted in non-decreasing order. So, [2,0,3] is not sorted, but [0,2,3] is sorted. However, according to the operation, we can't rearrange the digits; we can only insert them in the same position.

Therefore, in the case of [20,3], flattening gives [2,0,3], which is not sorted, and there's no way to make it sorted because the 0 is after the 2.

Another example: [100,10], flattening gives [1,0,0,1,0], which is [1,0,0,1,0]. This is not sorted because 0 < 1.

If I try to apply operations in a different order, say apply to 10 first, getting [100,1,0], then apply to 100, getting [1,0,0,1,0], which is the same as before.

Alternatively, apply to 100 first, getting [1,0,0,10], then apply to 10, getting [1,0,0,1,0], same result.

So, it seems that flattening the array by breaking down all elements greater than or equal to 10 into their digits, in order, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted, is the correct approach.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if not func_1(list1):

if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

a = list1[p - 1]

list1.pop(p - 1)

list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

list1.insert(p, a % 10)

if func_1(list1):

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

def func_1(lst):

sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

return lst == sorted_lst

This code seems to be trying to apply the operation iteratively to elements that are greater than 10 and out of order, and then checking if the list is sorted.

However, there are a few issues with this approach.

First, the operation can be applied any number of times, in any order, and the code only attempts to apply it in a specific way, which might not cover all possible sequences of operations.

Second, the operation is applied in a loop that iterates from the second element to the end, and only applies the operation if the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is greater than 10.

But this might not be sufficient to explore all possible ways of breaking down the elements.

For example, in the first example, [12,3,45,67], applying the operation to 12 first gives [1,2,3,45,67], and then applying it to 45 gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], and finally to 67 gives [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

But the code might not necessarily perform all these operations in this order.

Moreover, the code calls func_1(list1) multiple times within the loop, which checks if the list is sorted after each operation. If it's already sorted, it stops, otherwise, it continues.

But this might not be enough to reach the fully flattened state, where all elements are single digits.

Additionally, the operation is applied in a specific way: it replaces the element with its tens digit and units digit in the same position. But in the code, it's using a //10 and %10, which for a two-digit number is correct, but what about numbers with more than two digits? Wait, the problem states that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99, so all numbers have at most two digits, so this is fine.

However, the main issue is that the code is not guaranteed to explore all possible operations and sequences to reach a sorted array.

A better approach would be to fully flatten the array by breaking down all elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits, and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

To do this, I can create a new list by iterating through the original array and, for each element, if it's greater than or equal to 10, insert its digits into the new list, else, insert the element itself.

Then, I can check if this new list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This approach ensures that I've considered the fully broken-down version of the array and can directly check if it's sorted.

Let's see how this would work with the examples.

First example: [12,3,45,67]

- 12 >= 10 -> insert 1, 2

- 3 < 10 -> insert 3

- 45 >= 10 -> insert 4, 5

- 67 >= 10 -> insert 6, 7

Resulting list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

Second example: [12,28,5]

- 12 >= 10 -> insert 1, 2

- 28 >= 10 -> insert 2, 8

- 5 < 10 -> insert 5

Resulting list: [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

Third example: [0,0]

- 0 < 10 -> insert 0

- 0 < 10 -> insert 0

Resulting list: [0,0], which is sorted.

This seems to align with the expected outputs.

Now, let's consider some additional test cases to verify this approach.

Test case 1: [10,1]

- 10 >= 10 -> insert 1,0

- 1 < 10 -> insert 1

Resulting list: [1,0,1], which is not sorted.

Test case 2: [11,11]

- 11 >= 10 -> insert 1,1

- 11 >= 10 -> insert 1,1

Resulting list: [1,1,1,1], which is sorted.

Test case 3: [20,3]

- 20 >= 10 -> insert 2,0

- 3 < 10 -> insert 3

Resulting list: [2,0,3], which is not sorted.

Test case 4: [100,10]

- 100 >= 10 -> insert 1,0,0

- 10 >= 10 -> insert 1,0

Resulting list: [1,0,0,1,0], which is not sorted.

Test case 5: [0,10]

- 0 < 10 -> insert 0

- 10 >= 10 -> insert 1,0

Resulting list: [0,1,0], which is not sorted.

Test case 6: [5,25,3]

- 5 < 10 -> insert 5

- 25 >= 10 -> insert 2,5

- 3 < 10 -> insert 3

Resulting list: [5,2,5,3], which is not sorted.

Test case 7: [1,11,2]

- 1 < 10 -> insert 1

- 11 >= 10 -> insert 1,1

- 2 < 10 -> insert 2

Resulting list: [1,1,1,2], which is sorted.

From these test cases, it seems that the approach of fully flattening the array and checking if the resulting list is sorted works correctly.

Therefore, I can conclude that the correct way to solve this problem is to break down all elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits, maintaining their relative order, and then check if the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, looking back at the given program, it seems to be attempting to apply the operation in a specific way, but it might not always reach the fully flattened state, and it might not correctly determine if the array can be sorted.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
