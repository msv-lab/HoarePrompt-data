Alright, I've got this problem to check if a given password is strong based on specific conditions. Let's break it down.

First, the conditions for a strong password are:

1. It should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there should be another letter or the string ends).

3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with a password of length n, where n is between 1 and 20, and it's guaranteed that the password consists only of lowercase letters and digits.

Looking at the provided program:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it reads n and the password.

- It calls func_1(n, password) and prints the result.

Now, let's look into func_1:

- It separates the password into letters and digits.

- It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order and if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

- It also checks that no digit comes after a letter in the password.

- If all these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

Let's see if this aligns with the problem requirements.

Condition 1: Only lowercase letters and digits.

- The problem states that the input passwords consist only of lowercase letters and digits, so we don't need to handle other characters.

Condition 2: No digit should come after a letter.

- This means that all letters, if present, must come before any digits.

- In other words, the password should have all letters first (in sorted order), followed by all digits (also in sorted order).

Condition 3: Digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Condition 4: Letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, the password should have all letters first (sorted), followed by all digits (sorted).

Looking back at func_1:

- It separates letters and digits into two lists and checks if each list is sorted.

- Then, it checks that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

- If both lists are sorted and no digit comes after a letter, it returns 'YES'.

Wait a minute, if the letters are sorted and digits are sorted, and no digit comes after a letter, does that ensure the password is correctly structured?

Let me think about this.

Suppose the password is 'a1b2'. According to the conditions:

- Letters are 'a' and 'b', which are sorted.

- Digits are '1' and '2', which are sorted.

- No digit comes after a letter? Let's see: 'a' is followed by '1' (which is allowed since '1' is a digit and 'a' is a letter, but according to condition 2, there should be no digit after a letter unless all letters are before all digits.

Wait, condition 2 says: there should be no digit that comes after a letter, meaning that all letters should precede any digits.

But in 'a1b2', 'b' comes after '1', which is a letter after a digit, which should be allowed only if all letters are before any digits.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me rephrase condition 2: there should be no digit that comes after a letter, meaning that after any letter, the next character should also be a letter or it should be the end of the string.

In other words, all letters must appear before any digits in the password.

So, in 'a1b2', 'b' comes after '1', which violates condition 2.

But according to func_1, it separates letters and digits, checks if each is sorted, and checks that no digit comes after a letter.

But in 'a1b2', letters are 'a' and 'b', sorted; digits '1' and '2', sorted; and it checks if any digit comes after a letter in the original string.

In 'a1b2', '1' comes after 'a', which is allowed only if all letters are before any digits.

But 'b' comes after '1', which violates condition 2.

So, func_1 should return 'NO' for 'a1b2', which it does because 'b' comes after '1'.

Wait, but in func_1, it checks for no digit coming after a letter.

Wait, let's look at the check in func_1:

for i in range(len(password) - 1):

if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():

return 'NO'

This checks if any letter is followed directly by a digit.

In 'a1b2', 'a' is followed by '1', which is a digit, so it would return 'NO'.

But according to condition 2, there should be no digit after a letter, meaning that after any letter, there should not be a digit unless all letters are before all digits.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting condition 2.

Let me read it again: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

So, in other words, once a digit appears, no more letters can follow.

This is equivalent to saying that all letters must come before any digits.

So, the password should have all letters first (sorted), followed by all digits (sorted).

func_1 checks:

- That letters are sorted.

- That digits are sorted.

- That no letter is followed by a digit in the original password.

Wait, but in 'a1b2', 'a' is followed by '1', which is a digit after a letter, so it should return 'NO', which it does.

Another example from the test case:

Input:

4

12ac

Output:

YES

Wait, but '12ac' should be 'NO' because 'a' comes after '2', which violates condition 2.

Wait, no, '12ac' is '1', '2', 'a', 'c'.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's given as '12ac' and the output is 'YES'.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the sample input.

Wait, the sample input is:

5

4

12ac

5

123wa

9

allllmost

5

ac123

6

011679

Outputs:

YES

NO

YES

NO

YES

Wait, for '12ac', which is n=4, password='12ac'.

According to the conditions:

- Letters: 'a', 'c', sorted.

- Digits: '1', '2', sorted.

- No digit comes after a letter: in '12ac', 'a' comes after '2', which is a letter after a digit, which should be invalid.

But the sample output is 'YES'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, re-reading condition 2: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

In '12ac', 'c' is the last character, so 'a' is followed by 'c', which is a letter, and 'c' is followed by end of string.

So, no digit comes after a letter.

Therefore, '12ac' is valid.

Wait, but the digits '1' and '2' come before the letters 'a' and 'c', which satisfies condition 2.

Similarly, in 'ac123', letters 'a' and 'c' are followed by digits, which violates condition 2.

Wait, but in '12ac', digits come before letters, which is allowed.

Wait, no, in '12ac', digits '1' and '2' are followed by letters 'a' and 'c', which should be invalid according to condition 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, condition 2 says: there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

In '12ac', '2' is a digit that comes before 'a', which is a letter, but 'a' comes after '2', which is a letter after a digit.

But condition 2 says: there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

So, in '12ac', 'a' is a letter, followed by 'c', which is a letter, and 'c' is followed by end of string.

So, no digit comes after a letter.

Hence, it's valid.

I think I misinterpreted condition 2 earlier.

Condition 2 is: there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

In other words, no digit should appear after any letter in the password.

Which means that all letters must appear before any digits in the password.

In '12ac', letters 'a' and 'c' appear after digits '1' and '2', which violates condition 2.

But according to the sample input, for '12ac', the output is 'YES'.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the condition.

Let me re-read condition 2 carefully: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

So, after any letter, the next character should be another letter or the string should end.

In '12ac':

- '1' is a digit, followed by '2', which is a digit.

- '2' is followed by 'a', which is a letter.

- 'a' is followed by 'c', which is a letter.

- 'c' is followed by end of string.

So, no digit comes after a letter.

Hence, it's valid.

Wait, but in '12ac', '2' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter.

Does this violate condition 2?

Condition 2 says: there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

In this case, '2' is a digit coming after '1', which is a digit, not a letter.

So, it's allowed.

Hence, '12ac' is valid.

I think I was confused earlier.

So, in '12ac', digits '1' and '2' come first, followed by letters 'a' and 'c'.

No letter is followed by a digit, which satisfies condition 2.

In 'ac123', letters 'a' and 'c' are followed by digits '1', '2', and '3', which violates condition 2.

Hence, 'ac123' should be 'NO', as per the sample input.

So, func_1 seems to correctly implement this check.

Now, let's see how func_1 does it.

It separates letters and digits into two lists and checks if each list is sorted.

Then, it checks that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

Wait, but in '12ac', digits '1' and '2' are before letters 'a' and 'c', so no digit comes after a letter.

In 'ac123', letters 'a' and 'c' are followed by digits '1', '2', and '3', so digits come after letters.

Hence, func_1 correctly identifies 'ac123' as invalid.

Another sample input is 'allllmost', which is only letters, sorted, so it should be 'YES'.

'011679' is only digits, sorted, so 'YES'.

'123wa' is digits '1','2','3' followed by letters 'w','a', which violates condition 2, hence 'NO'.

So, func_1 seems to correctly handle these cases.

Now, is there any edge case that func_1 might miss?

Consider a password with only letters, sorted: 'aabc', which should be 'YES'.

Only digits, sorted: '1123', 'YES'.

Only letters, not sorted: 'bac', 'NO'.

Only digits, not sorted: '1232', 'NO'.

Letters and digits mixed, with letters before digits, both sorted: 'abc123', 'YES'.

Letters and digits mixed, with digits before letters, both sorted: '123abc', 'YES'.

Wait, but according to condition 2, all letters must come before any digits.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits."

And "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

So, if letters come before digits, it's allowed.

Hence, '123abc' is valid, as is 'abc123'.

But according to condition 2, in 'abc123', digits come after letters, which should be invalid.

Wait, but the problem says: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

So, in 'abc123', digits come after letters, which violates condition 2.

Wait, but in the sample input, '12ac' is 'YES', which has digits before letters.

Wait, no, '12ac' has digits '1','2' followed by letters 'a','c'.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, in '12ac', digits come first, then letters, which is allowed.

In 'ac123', letters come first, then digits, but according to condition 2, it's invalid because digits come after letters.

Wait, no, condition 2 says: there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

So, in 'ac123', 'c' is a letter followed by '1', which is a digit, hence violating condition 2.

In '12ac', '2' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter, but '2' is not coming after 'a', because '2' comes before 'a'.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Let me think differently.

Condition 2 implies that all letters must precede any digits.

So, in the password, if there are both letters and digits, all letters must come before any digits.

Additionally, letters must be sorted among themselves, and digits must be sorted among themselves.

Hence, the password should have all letters first (sorted), followed by all digits (sorted).

Hence, 'abc123' is valid, '123abc' is invalid.

Wait, but according to condition 2, in '123abc', letters come after digits, which should be allowed, but according to the sample input, '123wa' is 'NO'.

Wait, in '123wa', letters 'w','a' come after digits '1','2','3', which violates condition 2.

Hence, '123wa' is 'NO', as per the sample input.

But in 'abc123', letters come before digits, which should be allowed, but according to condition 2, it's invalid.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Problem statement says: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

So, in 'abc123', 'c' is a letter followed by '1', which is a digit, which violates condition 2.

Hence, 'abc123' should be 'NO'.

In '123wa', '3' is a digit followed by 'w', which is a letter, meaning a letter comes after a digit, which violates condition 2.

Hence, '123wa' is 'NO'.

In '12ac', '2' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter, but in this case, letters come after digits, which violates condition 2.

Wait, but according to the sample input, '12ac' is 'YES'.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the sample input again.

Wait, the sample input is:

5

4

12ac

5

123wa

9

allllmost

5

ac123

6

011679

Outputs:

YES

NO

YES

NO

YES

Wait, for '12ac', which is '1','2','a','c', digits '1','2' followed by letters 'a','c', which should be invalid because letters come after digits, violating condition 2.

But the sample output is 'YES'.

This suggests that my interpretation of condition 2 is incorrect.

Maybe condition 2 allows digits to come before letters, but not letters to come after digits.

Wait, re-reading condition 2: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

So, if a letter appears in the password, all digits must come before any letters.

In other words, all letters must be at the end of the password, and all digits at the beginning.

Hence, in '12ac', digits '1','2' are before letters 'a','c', which is allowed.

In 'ac123', letters 'a','c' are before digits '1','2','3', which violates condition 2.

Hence, 'ac123' is 'NO'.

In '123wa', digits '1','2','3' are before letters 'w','a', but letters appear after digits, which violates condition 2.

Hence, '123wa' is 'NO'.

In 'allllmost', only letters, sorted, 'YES'.

In '011679', only digits, sorted, 'YES'.

So, func_1 seems to correctly handle these cases.

Now, how does func_1 ensure this?

It separates letters and digits into two lists and checks if each list is sorted.

Then, it checks that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

Wait, but in '12ac', digits come before letters, so no digit comes after a letter.

Hence, it's valid.

In 'ac123', letters are followed by digits, so digits come after letters, which violates condition 2.

Hence, it's invalid.

So, func_1 seems to correctly implement this logic.

But is there a better way to check this?

Perhaps we can check that the password is divided into two parts: sorted letters followed by sorted digits.

Wait, but according to condition 2, letters should come before digits.

Hence, we can first separate the password into letters and digits.

Ensure that all letters are sorted and all digits are sorted.

And that no letter comes after any digit in the original password.

Wait, but condition 2 says no digit comes after a letter, which implies that all letters must come before any digits.

Hence, in the original password, letters should appear before digits.

So, func_1 checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if any letter is followed by a digit.

Wait, but in '12ac', '2' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter.

Does func_1 correctly handle this?

In func_1, it checks for any position where a letter is followed by a digit.

In '12ac', '2' is followed by 'a', but '2' is not a letter, so it doesn't trigger the condition.

Hence, it doesn't return 'NO' for '12ac'.

Wait, but in 'ac123', 'c' is a letter followed by '1', which is a digit, so it would return 'NO'.

Hence, func_1 seems to correctly handle '12ac' as 'YES' and 'ac123' as 'NO'.

But according to the problem, '12ac' should be 'YES', as per the sample input.

Wait, but according to condition 2, '12ac' has digits before letters, which should be allowed, as long as no digit comes after a letter.

Hence, func_1 correctly identifies '12ac' as 'YES'.

Similarly, 'ac123' has letters followed by digits, which violates condition 2, hence 'NO'.

So, func_1 seems correct.

Is there any other aspect I'm missing?

Condition 3 and 4 require that letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

func_1 separates letters and digits and checks if each group is sorted.

Hence, it covers conditions 3 and 4.

Condition 1 is already satisfied as per the problem statement.

Condition 2 is handled by ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit in the original password.

Wait, but in '12ac', letters come after digits, which seems to violate condition 2.

But according to the sample input, '12ac' is 'YES'.

Hence, perhaps condition 2 allows letters to come after digits as long as no digit comes after a letter.

Wait, re-reading condition 2: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends)."

Hence, digits can come before letters, as long as no digit comes after a letter.

So, in '12ac', digits come before letters, and no digit comes after a letter.

Hence, it's valid.

In 'ac123', letters are followed by digits, hence digits come after letters, which violates condition 2.

Hence, func_1 correctly handles this.

Therefore, the given program seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
