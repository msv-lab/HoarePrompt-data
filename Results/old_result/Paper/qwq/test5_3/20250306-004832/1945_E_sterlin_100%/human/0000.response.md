Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x using a binary search algorithm. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can perform at most two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the permutation in such a way that after performing the binary search, the value at position l is equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. For example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, we're applying it to an unsorted array, which is unusual. The algorithm described is a bit peculiar. It initializes l to 1 and r to n+1, which is different from the standard binary search where l is 0 and r is n. Also, the condition in step 1 is to stop when r - l = 1, which makes sense because it's trying to converge to a single index.

The midpoint is calculated as m = floor((r + l) / 2). Then, if p_m <= x, set l = m; else, set r = m. This continues until r - l = 1.

The task is to perform at most two swaps on the permutation before running this binary search so that after the search, p_l equals x.

It's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient. That's an important point to keep in mind.

Let's think about how binary search works on a sorted array. In a sorted array, binary search efficiently finds the target by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. But here, the array isn't sorted, and we can make at most two swaps to make the binary search yield the correct result.

I need to consider where x should be in the array for the binary search to find it correctly. Since the binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted array, I need to adjust the array so that after the search process, p_l equals x.

Let me try to simulate the binary search on a few examples to understand what's happening.

Take the first example from the sample input:

n = 6, x = 3

p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This is already sorted. Let's see how the binary search proceeds.

Initialize l = 0, r = 6

While r - l > 1:

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p[3] = 4 <= 3? No, so r = 3

Now, l = 0, r = 3

m = floor((0 + 3)/2) = 1

p[1] = 2 <= 3? Yes, so l = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2

p[2] = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2

p[2] = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, so stop.

p_l = p[2] = 3, which is equal to x. So, no swaps are needed.

Hence, the output is 0.

This makes sense.

Another sample input:

n = 6, x = 5

p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Let's simulate the binary search.

l = 0, r = 6

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p[3] = 5 <= 5? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4

p[4] = 2 <= 5? Yes, so l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5

p[5] = 4 <= 5? Yes, so l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5

p[5] = 4 <= 5? Yes, so l = 5

Now, r - l = 1, stop.

p_l = p[5] = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, swaps are needed.

Looking at the sample output, it says:

1

3 4

 meaning one swap: swap indices 3 and 4.

Let's see what that does.

Original p: [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Swapping indices 3 and 4: p[3] = 5 and p[4] = 2

After swap: [3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 4]

Now, run the binary search again.

l = 0, r = 6

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p[3] = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4

p[4] = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5

p[5] = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5

p[5] = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, r - l = 1, stop.

p_l = p[5] = 4, which is still not 5.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. According to the sample output, it should be correct.

Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the indices. Let's check the sample input again.

Wait, the sample input shows:

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

And the output is:

1

3 4

So, swapping indices 3 and 4.

In 0-based indexing, that would be swapping p[2] and p[3], which are 6 and 5.

Wait, but in the problem, indices seem to be 1-based.

So, indices 3 and 4 refer to p[2] and p[3] in 0-based indexing.

So, swapping p[2] = 6 and p[3] = 5, resulting in p = [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]

Now, let's run the binary search again.

l = 0, r = 6

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p[3] = 6 <= 5? No, so r = 3

Now, l = 0, r = 3

m = floor((0 + 3)/2) = 1

p[1] = 1 <= 5? Yes, l = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2

p[2] = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2

p[2] = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, stop.

p_l = p[2] = 5, which equals x=5.

So, one swap was sufficient.

Good, that makes sense.

Another sample input:

n = 5, x = 1

p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Sample output:

2

2 4

1 5

Meaning two swaps: first swap indices 2 and 4, then swap indices 1 and 5.

Let's see what that does.

Original p: [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Swap 2 and 4 (1-based): p[1] and p[3], which are 5 and 2.

New p: [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

Then swap 1 and 5: p[0] and p[4], which are 3 and 1.

New p: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

Now, run the binary search.

l = 0, r = 5

m = floor((0 + 5)/2) = 2

p[2] = 4 <= 1? No, so r = 2

Now, l = 0, r = 2

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1

p[1] = 2 <= 1? No, so r = 1

Now, l = 0, r = 1

m = floor((0 + 1)/2) = 0

p[0] = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 0

Now, r - l = 1, stop.

p_l = p[0] = 1, which equals x=1.

So, two swaps were needed in this case.

From these examples, it seems that by performing at most two swaps, we can adjust the permutation so that the binary search finds the correct value.

Now, I need to find a general strategy to determine which swaps to perform.

Let's think about the binary search process.

The binary search starts with l=0 and r=n+1, which is unusual. Wait, in the problem statement, it says l=1 and r=n+1, but in the sample, it seems like l and r are 0 and n.

I need to be careful with the indexing.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

"two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared."

Then, in the loop:

1. If r - l = 1, end the loop

2. m = floor((r + l)/2)

3. If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m

Note that in Python, list indices start at 0, but in the problem, indices start at 1.

So, p_m refers to p[m-1] in Python indexing.

I need to be consistent with the indexing.

To avoid confusion, I'll use 1-based indexing for p, aligning with the problem's notation.

So, p[1], p[2], ..., p[n]

In Python, this corresponds to p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]

Now, understanding the binary search:

It starts with l=1 and r=n+1.

It loops until r - l =1.

In each iteration:

m = floor((r + l)/2)

if p[m] <= x, set l = m

else, set r = m

At the end, p[l] should be equal to x.

I need to ensure that after at most two swaps, this condition holds.

First, let's consider the case where no swaps are needed.

If the binary search, as described, already results in p[l] = x, then we're done.

From the first sample input, this was the case.

So, the first thing to check is whether, without any swaps, the binary search yields p[l] = x.

If yes, output 0.

If not, proceed to see if one swap can fix it.

If one swap isn't enough, then use two swaps.

The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient.

So, I need to find the minimal number of swaps (up to two) that make p[l] = x after the binary search.

Now, how to approach this?

I need to simulate the binary search to find the final l.

Then, check if p[l] == x.

If yes, output 0.

If not, see if I can swap elements to make p[l] = x with one or two swaps.

But there's a catch: the value of l depends on the array's configuration.

If I swap elements, it may change the path of the binary search, leading to a different l.

So, it's not just about making p[l] = x; l itself depends on the array's arrangement.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I should consider where x should be placed so that the binary search ends up with p[l] = x.

Let's think about the binary search process.

It repeatedly narrows down the interval [l, r) until r - l =1.

At each step, it chooses m = floor((l + r)/2), looks at p[m], and decides whether to set l = m or r = m based on p[m] <= x.

This is similar to a binary search, but it's not the standard way because in standard binary search, we have a sorted array.

Here, the array is permutation, so all elements are distinct.

I need to find a way to adjust the array with at most two swaps so that after the binary search process, p[l] = x.

Given that two swaps are always sufficient, there must be a general approach.

Let me consider the final l after the binary search.

I need p[l] = x.

But l is determined by the sequence of m's chosen during the binary search, which depends on the values in p.

So, perhaps I can think about where x should be placed to ensure that the binary search ends at that position.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the binary search terminating at a position where p[l] == x, and ensure that x is placed there.

But it's complicated because the binary search's path depends on the array's values.

Wait, maybe I can simulate the binary search to find out what l would be, given the current permutation.

Then, check if p[l] == x.

If yes, output 0.

If not, see if I can make p[l] == x by swapping some elements.

But as l depends on the array's configuration, swapping might change l.

This seems recursive and complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that with two swaps, I can place x in a desired position, and adjust one other element to not interfere with the binary search path.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider the positions that the binary search visits.

In the binary search process, it visits m = floor((l + r)/2) at each step.

I could trace the path that the binary search takes and see where it ends up.

Then, if p[l] != x, perhaps by swapping x with some other element along the path, I can make p[l] == x.

But again, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the properties of the binary search.

In standard binary search on a sorted array, l and r converge to the position where the element should be.

Here, the array is not sorted, so the search is effectively navigating through the array based on the values.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the value at the final l and see if swapping it with x would make p[l] == x.

But if I do that, it might affect the earlier steps of the binary search.

Wait, maybe I can perform the binary search to find the final l, then:

- If p[l] == x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p[l] with x, making p[l] == x.

But, this might not work because swapping p[l] with x could have affected earlier steps of the binary search, changing the path taken.

So, that might not be sufficient.

Perhaps I need to ensure that the path taken by the binary search is not affected by the swaps.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the positions of the elements that are visited during the binary search path, ensuring that they lead to p[l] == x.

But again, it's complex.

Let me look back at the sample inputs.

In the second sample:

n=6, x=5

p=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

After swapping indices 3 and 4 (1-based, so p[2]=6 and p[3]=5), we get p=[3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then, the binary search path is:

l=1, r=7

m=floor((1+7)/2)=4, p[4]=6 >5, so r=4

Now, l=1, r=4

m=floor((1+4)/2)=2, p[2]=1 <=5, so l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3, p[3]=5 <=5, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=floor((3+4)/2)=3, p[3]=5 <=5, so l=3

Now, r - l =1, stop.

p_l = p[3]=5 ==x=5.

So, one swap was enough.

But in the third sample, two swaps were needed.

I need a general strategy.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in the desired position and adjust one other element to not mess up the binary search path.

But I need a systematic way to determine which elements to swap.

An alternative approach is to consider that with two swaps, I can effectively place x in any position I want, as long as I also adjust another element to maintain the necessary conditions for the binary search to reach that position.

Wait, perhaps I can aim to place x in the position where the binary search would end up, and adjust another element to ensure that the search path leads to that position.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x wherever I want, and also place another element to correct any disruption caused by the first swap.

But this is still not concrete enough.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Perform the binary search to find the final l.

2. If p[l] == x, output 0.

3. Else, see if swapping p[l] with x makes p[l] == x, and ensures that the binary search still reaches l.

- If yes, output 1 swap: swap l and x's positions.

- If not, perform two swaps:

a. Swap x with some temporary position.

b. Swap that temporary position with l.

- Choose the temporary position carefully to not disrupt the binary search path.

This might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, perform the binary search to find l.

If p[l] == x, we're done.

Else, consider swapping x and p[l].

After this swap, p[l] == x, and p[pos_x] == p[l], where pos_x is the original position of x.

Now, check if the binary search would still reach l with this new arrangement.

If yes, then one swap is sufficient.

If not, we need a second swap.

For the second swap, we can swap p[l] with another element to correct any issues caused by the first swap.

But this is still unclear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I identify the path that the binary search takes to reach l.

Then, ensure that after swaps, the values along this path are such that the search still reaches l, and p[l] == x.

This seems complicated, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can make the array sorted enough for the binary search to find x correctly.

But given that the array is a permutation, and n can be up to 2e5, sorting isn't practical.

I need a more efficient approach.

Looking back at the problem, it's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient.

So, there must be a general way to achieve this.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position I choose, and adjust one other element to maintain the necessary conditions for the binary search.

Wait, perhaps I can aim to place x in the position where the binary search would end up, and ensure that the search reaches that position.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array into segments and narrows down based on the comparisons.

If I can arrange the array so that the comparisons lead the search to the position where x is placed, that would work.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that in the binary search process, the value at each m determines whether to go left or right.

So, if I can control these values to guide the search to the desired position, that would solve the problem.

But again, it's not clear how to do that with at most two swaps.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can fix any inversion in the array that is causing the binary search to go wrong.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

First sample:

n=6, x=3

p=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Already sorted, so no swaps needed.

Second sample:

n=6, x=5

p=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

Swapped indices 3 and 4 (p[2] and p[3]): [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then, the search reaches l=2, p[2]=5==x=5.

Third sample:

n=5, x=1

p=[3,5,4,2,1]

Swapped indices 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swapped indices 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Search reaches l=1, p[1]=1==x=1.

In both cases, the swaps were aimed at bringing x to the position where the binary search would end up.

It seems like the strategy is to:

1. Perform the binary search to find the final l.

2. If p[l] == x, do nothing.

3. Else, swap x and p[l], and check if this makes p[l] == x and doesn't disrupt the binary search path.

- If yes, output 1 swap.

- If not, perform an additional swap to correct any issues.

But I need a way to implement this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to note that with two swaps, I can place x in any cycle involving at most two swaps.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position, and adjust another element to maintain the necessary conditions.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in the desired position, and if needed, swap another element to ensure that the binary search path is not disrupted.

But I need to define what the desired position is.

Perhaps the desired position is where the binary search would end up if the array were sorted.

But the array isn't sorted, and I can't sort it.

Wait, perhaps I can consider where x should be in a sorted array.

In a sorted array, x would be at position x, since it's a permutation from 1 to n.

But in this problem, the array isn't sorted, and the binary search isn't guaranteed to work correctly.

So, that might not help directly.

Let me consider that the binary search is effectively partitioning the array into segments and narrowing down based on the comparisons.

If I can arrange the array so that the comparisons lead the search to the position where x is placed, that would work.

But again, it's not clear how to do that with at most two swaps.

I need to find a systematic way to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position I choose, and adjust another element to not interfere with the search path.

But I need to define what "not interfering" means.

Perhaps I can choose a temporary position to place x, perform the binary search, and then swap it to the desired position.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can fix any two elements that are causing the binary search to fail.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in the desired position and fix one other element to ensure the search path is correct.

But I need to define what the desired position is and what fixing another element entails.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I perform the binary search to find where it ends up.

If p[l] == x, great.

Else, I need to make p[l] == x.

To do that, I can swap p[l] with x.

But this might have affected earlier steps of the binary search.

So, perhaps I need to swap another element to correct that.

In other words, perform two swaps: first swap p[l] with x, then swap p[l] with another element to fix any disruption.

But I need to choose which element to swap secondly.

This still seems unclear.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in the desired position and adjust another element to maintain the necessary inequalities for the binary search path.

But I need to define what those inequalities are.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can make any even permutation.

But since n is up to 2e5, and I just need at most two swaps, this seems too broad.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position, and place another element in its original position.

But I need to ensure that the binary search reaches the desired position.

This still doesn't give me a clear path forward.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array into halves and chooses one half based on the comparison.

So, perhaps I can arrange the halves such that the search ends up where x is placed.

But again, it's not clear how to do that with swaps.

I need to find a way to make this work efficiently, as n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 2e4.

So, I need an O(n) or O(log n) time per test case, but since n*t can be up to 4e9, which is too much, I need a better approach.

Wait, n*t is up to 4e9, which is too slow.

But the problem says that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2e5, which is manageable.

So, I need an O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.

But I need to find a way to solve each test case in linear time.

Now, perhaps I can precompute some values.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array based on m = floor((l + r)/2), and updates l or r based on p[m] <= x.

I need to simulate this search to find the final l.

Then, check if p[l] == x.

If yes, output 0.

Else, see if one swap can fix it.

If not, use two swaps.

To implement this efficiently, I need to simulate the binary search to find l.

Given that n is up to 2e5, and t is up to 2e4, but sum of n over t is up to 2e5, it
