Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (between 2 and n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

First, I need to understand what this operation does. It seems like it's designed to reduce the values of three consecutive elements in a specific way. By choosing different i's and applying the operation multiple times, Rudolf can manipulate the array to try to reach all zeros.

I need to figure out if, for any given array, it's possible to apply these operations in such a way that every element becomes zero.

Let me think about the constraints. The array has at least 3 elements, and the operations can only be applied to indices from 2 to n-1. Also, the operations involve subtracting values from three consecutive elements each time.

I should consider what effects these operations have on the array. Each operation reduces the middle element by 2 and the adjacent elements by 1. It's like spreading out减 reductions across three elements.

I wonder if there's a mathematical way to model this. Maybe I can think of it in terms of linear algebra, where each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array vector.

Let's define the array as a vector A = [a1, a2, ..., an]. Each operation corresponds to subtracting a vector like [0, ..., 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, ..., 0] where the non-zero elements are at positions i-1, i, and i+1.

So, the problem reduces to whether we can find a linear combination of these operation vectors that results in the zero vector, starting from the given vector A.

This sounds like solving a system of linear equations. The question is whether the vector A is in the span of the operation vectors.

But with large n (up to 2*10^5), solving this directly is not feasible. I need a smarter approach.

Maybe I can look for invariants or properties that must hold for the array to be reducible to all zeros.

Let me consider the sum of all elements in the array. Each operation reduces the total sum by 4 (since -1 -2 -1 = -4). So, for the array to be reducible to zero, the initial sum must be divisible by 4.

Wait, but that's not necessarily sufficient. There might be other constraints.

Let me look at smaller examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take n=3:

Array: [1, 3, 1]

Applying operation at i=2:

a1 = 1 - 1 = 0

a2 = 3 - 2 = 1

a3 = 1 - 1 = 0

Now array is [0,1,0]. Can't apply any more operations because i=2 is the only possible choice, but a2=1 which is less than 2. So, it's not possible to reduce to all zeros.

Another try: [2,4,2]

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=2-1=1

a2=4-2=2

a3=2-1=1

Now [1,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2 again:

a1=1-1=0

a2=2-2=0

a3=1-1=0

Success! So, [2,4,2] can be reduced to [0,0,0].

Comparing [1,3,1] and [2,4,2], both have the same sum (5 and 8, which are both divisible by 4), but one works and the other doesn't. So, sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

I need to find additional constraints.

Let me think about the differences between elements. Maybe looking at the differences between consecutive elements can reveal something.

Define d1 = a2 - a1

d2 = a3 - a2

and so on.

In the first example [1,3,1]:

d1 = 3-1=2

d2 = 1-3=-2

In the second example [2,4,2]:

d1 = 4-2=2

d2 = 2-4=-2

Both have d1=2 and d2=-2.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, in both cases, d1 + d2 = 0.

But in the first case, sum is 5, which is not divisible by 4, but in the second case, sum is 8, which is divisible by 4.

Wait, no, sum in the first case is 1+3+1=5, not divisible by 4, so it's inconsistent with the second case where sum is 8, divisible by 4.

But in the first case, sum is 5, which is not divisible by 4, and it cannot be reduced to zero, which aligns with the earlier thought that the sum must be divisible by 4.

But in the second case, sum is 8, which is divisible by 4, and it can be reduced to zero.

So, sum divisible by 4 is necessary.

But in both cases, d1 + d2 = 0.

So, maybe the condition is that the sum is divisible by 4 and d1 + d2 + ... + dn-1 = 0.

But in both cases, d1 + d2 = 0.

Wait, in both cases, n=3, so only d1 and d2.

But in general, for n elements, we have n-1 differences.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the sum of differences is zero, which is always true because d1 + d2 + ... + dn-1 = an - a1.

So, if a1 = an, then d1 + ... + dn-1 = 0.

But in the examples, a1 and a3 are different.

Wait, in [1,3,1], a1=1, a3=1, so a1 = a3.

In [2,4,2], a1=2, a3=2, so a1 = a3.

Wait, in both cases, a1 = a3.

Is that a general condition?

Wait, no. Consider [0,0,0], which can be reduced to zero, and a1=a3=0.

Or [1,1,1], sum=3, not divisible by 4, cannot be reduced to zero.

Wait, [1,1,1], a1=a2=a3=1, sum=3, not divisible by 4, cannot be reduced to zero.

So, a1=a3 is not sufficient.

Wait, maybe a1=a3 and sum divisible by 4.

In the first example [1,3,1], a1=a3=1, sum=5, not divisible by 4, cannot be reduced.

In the second example [2,4,2], a1=a3=2, sum=8, divisible by 4, can be reduced.

Another example: [0,0,0], a1=a3=0, sum=0, divisible by 4, can be reduced.

[1,1,1], a1=a3=1, sum=3, not divisible by 4, cannot be reduced.

So, it seems that a1=a3 and sum divisible by 4 are necessary conditions.

But are they sufficient?

Let me try another example.

Take n=4, [2,4,4,2].

Sum is 12, which is divisible by 4, and a1=a4=2.

Can I reduce this to zero?

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=2-1=1

a2=4-2=2

a3=4-1=3

a4=2

Now array is [1,2,3,2]

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=1-1=0

a2=2-2=0

a3=3-1=2

a4=2

Now [0,0,2,2]

Apply operation at i=3:

a2=0-1=-1

a3=2-2=0

a4=2-1=1

But negative numbers don't make sense in this context, as the problem likely assumes non-negative integers.

So, maybe I can't have negative numbers, meaning that operations can only be applied if a[i-1] >=1, a[i] >=2, and a[i+1] >=1.

In the above step, a2=0, which is less than 1, so I can't apply the operation at i=2.

Wait, a2=0, which is less than 2, so I can't apply the operation at i=2.

Similarly, at i=3, a2=0 <1, a3=2>=2, a4=2>=1, but a2 <1, so can't apply.

So, I'm stuck with [1,2,3,2], cannot reduce to zero.

Wait, perhaps I chose the wrong sequence of operations.

Let me try a different approach.

Start with [2,4,4,2]

Apply operation at i=3:

a2=4-1=3

a3=4-2=2

a4=2-1=1

Now array is [2,3,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=2-1=1

a2=3-2=1

a3=2-1=1

a4=1

Now [1,1,1,1]

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=1-1=0

a2=1-2=-1

a3=1-1=0

a4=1

Can't have negative numbers, so this is invalid.

Alternatively, apply operation at i=3:

a2=1-1=0

a3=1-2=-1

a4=1-1=0

Again, negative numbers.

So, seems like [2,4,4,2] cannot be reduced to zero, even though a1=a4 and sum is divisible by 4.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first example, [1,3,5,5,2] can be reduced to zero, and in the second example, [2,4,4,5,1] cannot.

Looking back at the first example:

[1,3,5,5,2]

Apply operation at i=4:

a3=5-1=4

a4=5-2=3

a5=2-1=1

Now [1,3,4,3,1]

Apply operation at i=3:

a2=3-1=2

a3=4-2=2

a4=3-1=2

a5=1

Now [1,2,2,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2:

a1=1-1=0

a2=2-2=0

a3=2-1=1

a4=2

a5=1

Now [0,0,1,2,1]

Apply operation at i=4:

a3=1-1=0

a4=2-2=0

a5=1-1=0

Now [0,0,0,0,0]

Success!

So, in this case, it worked.

But in the previous n=4 example, it didn't work.

So, perhaps there are more constraints beyond sum divisible by 4 and a1=aN.

Maybe I need to look at cumulative sums or something similar.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the operations in reverse. Instead of starting from A and applying operations to reach zero, think of starting from zero and building up to A by undoing the operations.

Each operation in reverse would add 1 to a[i-1], 2 to a[i], and 1 to a[i+1].

So, to reach A from zero, I need to find a sequence of such reverse operations.

This seems similar to solving a system where each operation corresponds to adding a specific vector to the array.

In linear algebra terms, I need to see if A is in the span of these operation vectors.

But with large n, this isn't practical.

Maybe I can look for patterns in the differences between elements.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 2 to n.

In the first example:

a = [1,3,5,5,2]

d = [3-1=2, 5-3=2, 5-5=0, 2-5=-3]

In the second example:

a = [2,4,4,5,1]

d = [4-2=2, 4-4=0,5-4=1,1-5=-4]

In the third example:

a = [0,1,3,3,1]

d = [1-0=1,3-1=2,3-3=0,1-3=-2]

In the fourth example:

a = [5,6,0,2,3,0]

d = [6-5=1,0-6=-6,2-0=2,3-2=1,0-3=-3]

Looking at these difference arrays, I need to find a way to relate them to the operations allowed.

Wait, maybe I can think of the operations affecting the differences.

Each operation at index i would change d[i] and d[i+1].

Specifically, operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

After operation at i, d[i] = (a[i]-2) - (a[i-1]-1) = a[i] - a[i-1] -1 = d[i] -1

Similarly, d[i+1] = a[i+1] - a[i] = (a[i+1]-1) - (a[i]-2) = a[i+1] - a[i] +1 = d[i+1] +1

So, operation at i decreases d[i] by 1 and increases d[i+1] by 1.

That's interesting.

So, each operation adjusts d[i] and d[i+1].

Therefore, the operations allow me to adjust the differences between consecutive elements in a specific way.

Specifically, I can decrease d[i] by 1 and increase d[i+1] by 1, for any i from 2 to n-1.

Now, to make the entire array zero, I need all a[i] to be zero.

Which implies that all d[i] should be zero, since d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1], and if a[i]=0 for all i, then d[i]=0 for all i.

So, the goal is to adjust the differences d[i] to zero using these operations.

Given that each operation decreases d[i] by 1 and increases d[i+1] by 1, it's similar to shifting a "deficit" or "surplus" from one difference to the next.

This resembles the concept of potential functions or flows, where I can shift values between adjacent positions.

Given that, I can model this as trying to make all d[i] equal to zero by shifting values between d[i] and d[i+1].

This seems similar to saying that the sum of d[i] from j to k can be adjusted by applying operations between j and k.

But d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1], and the sum of d[i] from 2 to k is a[k] - a[1].

So, the cumulative sum of d[i] up to k is a[k] - a[1].

For the entire array, the sum of d[i] from 2 to n is a[n] - a[1].

Therefore, the condition a[n] = a[1] must hold for the differences to be adjustable to zero.

Wait, but in the first example, a[1]=1, a[5]=2, which are not equal, but it seems like it can still be reduced to zero.

Wait, no, in the first example, after operations, it does reach zero, but according to this, a[1] should equal a[5].

But in the example, a[1]=1, a[5]=2 initially, and after operations, a[1]=0, a[5]=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the sum of d[i] from 2 to n is zero, meaning a[n] - a[1] = 0, so a[n] = a[1].

But in the first example, a[n] != a[1], yet it can be reduced to zero.

Wait, in the first example, after operations, a[1]=0, a[5]=0, which satisfies a[1]=a[5].

But initially, a[1]!=a[5].

So, maybe during the operations, a[1] and a[n] can be adjusted independently.

Wait, but a[1] and a[n] can only be affected by operations at i=2 and i=n-1 respectively.

Operation at i=2 affects a[1], a[2], a[3]

Operation at i=n-1 affects a[n-2], a[n-1], a[n]

So, a[1] can be decreased by operations at i=2, and a[n] can be decreased by operations at i=n-1.

But operations at i=2 can only decrease a[1] by up to a[2]-1, assuming a[3] is sufficient.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the cumulative sums.

Let me try to define s[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]

Then, operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, s[j] for j < i-1 remains unchanged.

s[j] for j = i-1 decreases by 1.

s[j] for j = i decreases by 3.

s[j] for j = i+1 decreases by 4.

s[j] for j > i+1 decreases by 4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the array in terms of its discrete second derivative or something similar.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that in some problems involving operations on sequences, it's useful to consider the prefix sums or similar concepts.

Let me try defining prefix sums.

Define p[0] = 0

p[1] = a[1]

p[2] = a[1] + a[2]

...

p[n] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[n]

Now, consider the operation at index i:

a[i-1] -=1 => p[i-1] -=1, p[i] -=1, p[i+1] -=1

a[i] -=2 => p[i] -=2, p[i+1] -=2, ...

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of invariants.

Is there some quantity that remains unchanged no matter how many operations are performed?

One such invariant could be the sum of the array elements, modulo 4, since each operation reduces the sum by 4.

Wait, but the sum must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce to zero.

But as seen in earlier examples, this is necessary but not sufficient.

I need more invariants.

Another invariant could be the equality of a[1] and a[n], because operations seem to relate them in some way.

Wait, in the first example, a[1]=1, a[5]=2, and sum=1+3+5+5+2=16, which is divisible by 4, and it can be reduced to zero.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, a[1] should equal a[n], but here they are different.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my thinking.

Let me consider the operations again.

Each operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, the total sum decreases by 4 each time.

Now, to make all a[j]=0, the initial sum must be divisible by 4.

Additionally, perhaps there are constraints on the differences or on prefix sums.

Let me consider defining b[i] = a[i] - a[i-1], for i=2 to n.

Then, b[2] = a[2] - a[1]

b[3] = a[3] - a[2]

...

b[n] = a[n] - a[n-1]

Then, sum of b[2 to n] = a[n] - a[1]

Each operation at i changes b[i] -=1 and b[i+1] +=1

So, operation at i transforms b[i] to b[i]-1 and b[i+1] to b[i+1]+1

This is similar to shifting units from b[i] to b[i+1]

Therefore, the operation allows me to adjust b[i] and b[i+1] in a specific way.

The goal is to make all b[i]=0.

Given that operations allow shifting units from b[i] to b[i+1], it's similar to moving "deficits" or "surpluses" along the array.

Therefore, for it to be possible to make all b[i]=0, the cumulative sum of b[i] from any point should be achievable through these shifts.

But the sum of b[2 to n] = a[n] - a[1]

For the entire array to be zero, a[n] should be equal to a[1].

Wait, but in the first example, a[1]=1, a[5]=2, which are different, yet it can be reduced to zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the cumulative sum being adjust able.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the cumulative sum of b[i] from 2 to k should be less than or equal to some value for all k.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that operations allow me to adjust b[i] and b[i+1] in a way that I can move values from b[i] to b[i+1].

Therefore, to make all b[i]=0, I need to ensure that there are no "blocks" that prevent the adjustment.

This seems similar to the concept of flows in networks, where I can shift values between nodes.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a system where b[i] can be adjusted by operations affecting b[i] and b[i+1].

In such a system, the only invariant is the total sum of b[2 to n], which is a[n] - a[1].

For the array to be reducible to zero, this sum must be zero, meaning a[n] = a[1].

Additionally, the sum of a[i] must be divisible by 4.

But in the first example, a[1]=1, a[5]=2, which are different, yet it can be reduced to zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that example.

Let me check the first example again.

Given a=[1,3,5,5,2]

Apply operation at i=4:

a[3]=5-1=4

a[4]=5-2=3

a[5]=2-1=1

Now a=[1,3,4,3,1]

Apply operation at i=3:

a[2]=3-1=2

a[3]=4-2=2

a[4]=3-1=2

a=[1,2,2,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2:

a[1]=1-1=0

a[2]=2-2=0

a[3]=2-1=1

a=[0,0,1,2,1]

Apply operation at i=4:

a[3]=1-1=0

a[4]=2-2=0

a[5]=1-1=0

a=[0,0,0,0,0]

Success.

But according to my earlier thought, a[1]=1 and a[5]=2 are different, yet it can be reduced to zero.

So, perhaps my assumption that a[1] must equal a[n] is incorrect.

Maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the sum of a[i] is divisible by 4, and a[1] + a[n] is even.

Wait, in the first example, a[1]=1 and a[5]=2, which sum to 3, which is odd.

In the second example, a[1]=2 and a[5]=1, sum=3, odd, and it cannot be reduced to zero.

In the third example, a=[0,1,3,3,1], a[1]=0, a[5]=1, sum=1, odd, and it can be reduced to zero according to the sample output.

Wait, no, according to the sample output, the third example can be reduced to zero.

Wait, sample output shows:

YES

NO

YES

NO

NO

NO

NO

Corresponding to the 7 test cases.

So, for the third example, which is the third YES.

Wait, but a[1]=0, a[5]=1, which sum to 1, odd, yet it's YES.

So, my assumption that a[1] + a[n] must be even is incorrect.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the operations can be represented as a matrix, and the problem is to solve a system of linear equations.

But with n up to 2e5, that's not feasible.

Another idea: perhaps I can iterate through the array and greedily apply operations where possible.

Start from i=2 to n-1, and whenever a[i] >=2 and a[i-1] >=1 and a[i+1] >=1, apply the operation.

Repeat this until no more operations can be applied.

Then, check if the array is all zeros.

But this might not be efficient enough for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system of equations where each equation corresponds to the value of a[i], and the variables are the number of operations applied at each index.

Let me define o[i] as the number of times operation is applied at index i.

Then, for each a[i], I can write an equation based on how operations affect it.

For i=1:

a[1] - o[2] = 0

For i=2 to n-1:

a[i] - 2*o[i] - o[i-1] - o[i+1] = 0

For i=n:

a[n] - o[n-1] = 0

So, the system of equations is:

a[1] - o[2] = 0

a[2] - 2*o[2] - o[1] - o[3] = 0

...

a[n-1] - 2*o[n-1] - o[n-2] - o[n] = 0

a[n] - o[n-1] = 0

Wait, but o[i] are the operations applied at i, which correspond to the number of times the operation is applied at that index.

This seems like a system of linear equations that needs to be solved for o[i].

But solving this for large n is not practical.

Perhaps I can find a way to solve this system efficiently.

Looking at the equations:

From the first equation: o[2] = a[1]

From the last equation: o[n-1] = a[n]

Then, plugging o[2] into the second equation: a[2] - 2*a[1] - o[1] - o[3] = 0

Similarly, o[1] is not defined, since operations start from i=2.

Wait, o[1] doesn't exist, since operations are from i=2 to n-1.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to find another way.

Let me look back at the operations.

Each operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, to make a[j]=0 for all j, I need to find a combination of operations such that the total subtraction from each a[j] equals a[j].

This can be represented as a system of linear equations, but again, that's not efficient for large n.

Perhaps I can look for patterns in the array that allow me to apply operations in a certain way.

Wait, maybe I can consider the array as a system where each operation affects three consecutive elements.

This resembles the idea of tiling or covering the array with triplets.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: try to reduce the array step by step, starting from one end.

For example, start from the left, and try to make a[1]=0 by applying operations at i=2 as much as possible.

Then move to a[2], and so on.

Let me try this approach.

Start with a[1]. To make a[1]=0, I need to apply operations at i=2 exactly a[1] times, since each operation at i=2 subtracts 1 from a[1].

After applying operation at i=2, a[1] decreases by 1, a[2] by 2, and a[3] by 1.

So, if a[1] > 0, I need to apply operation at i=2 a[1] times.

But I need to ensure that a[2] and a[3] are sufficient for these operations.

Similarly, after making a[1]=0, move to a[2], and make it zero by applying operations at i=3, and so on.

This seems like a greedy approach.

Let me formalize this:

Initialize an array o of size n-2 (since operations are from i=2 to i=n-1).

For i from 1 to n:

if i=1:

o[1] = a[1]

a[1] -= o[1]

a[2] -= 2*o[1]

a[3] -= o[1]

elif i from 2 to n-1:

o[i-1] = min(a[i] // 2, a[i-1], a[i+1])

a[i] -= 2*o[i-1]

a[i-1] -= o[i-1]

a[i+1] -= o[i-1]

elif i=n:

if a[n] != 0:

Impossible

else:

continue

Finally, check if all a[j]=0.

This seems like a possible approach.

But I need to verify if this works with the first example.

First example: [1,3,5,5,2]

Set o[1] = a[1] =1

a[1] -=1 =>0

a[2] -=2 =>3-2=1

a[3] -=1 =>5-1=4

Now a=[0,1,4,5,2]

Next, i=2:

o[1] is already set to 1.

a[2] =1, which is less than 2, so cannot apply any operations at i=2.

Move to i=3:

o[2] = min(a[3]//2, a[2], a[4]) = min(4//2=2,1,5)=1

Apply operation:

a[2] -=1 =>0

a[3] -=2 =>4-2=2

a[4] -=1 =>5-1=4

Now a=[0,0,2,4,2]

Next, i=4:

o[3] = min(a[4]//2, a[3], a[5]) = min(4//2=2,2,2)=2

Apply operation twice:

First application:

a[3] -=1 =>1

a[4] -=2 =>2

a[5] -=1 =>1

Now a=[0,0,1,2,1]

Second application:

a[3] -=1 =>0

a[4] -=2 =>0

a[5] -=1 =>0

Now a=[0,0,0,0,0]

Success.

So, this greedy approach seems to work for this example.

Let me try it on the second example: [2,4,4,5,1]

Set o[1] = a[1]=2

a[1]-=2 =>0

a[2]-=4 =>4-4=0

a[3]-=2 =>4-2=2

Now a=[0,0,2,5,1]

Next, i=2:

a[2]=0 <2, cannot apply operation at i=2

Move to i=3:

o[2] = min(a[3]//2, a[2], a[4]) = min(2//2=1,0,5)=0

Cannot apply operation

Next, i=4:

o[3] = min(a[4]//2, a[3], a[5]) = min(5//2=2,2,1)=1

Apply operation:

a[3] -=1 =>1

a[4] -=2 =>3

a[5] -=1 =>0

Now a=[0,0,1,3,0]

Cannot make a[3], a[4], a[5] zero with remaining operations.

Hence, it's not possible to reduce to zero, which matches the sample output.

So, this greedy approach seems to work for these examples.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

1. Set o[1] = a[1]

2. For each i from 1 to n:

- If i=1:

- o[1] = a[1]

- a[1] -= o[1]

- a[2] -= 2*o[1]

- a[3] -= o[1]

- Else if i from 2 to n-1:

- o[i-1] = min(a[i] // 2, a[i-1], a[i+1])

- a[i-1] -= o[i-1]

- a[i] -= 2*o[i-1]

- a[i+1] -= o[i-1]

- Else if i=n:

- If a[n] != 0:

- Impossible

3. Finally, check if all a[j]=0

If yes, then "YES", else "NO"

This seems efficient enough for n up to 2e5, as it's O(n).

Now, looking back at the given program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

Given program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

l = input()

lst = list(map(int, l.split()))

func_2(lst, n)

def func_1(list, n):

for i in range(n):

if list[i] != 0:

return False

return True

def func_2(list, n):

for i in range(1, n - 1):

while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):

list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]

list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

if list[i - 1] != 0:

print('no')

return

if func_1(list, n):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, func_2 is trying to implement something similar to the greedy approach.

It iterates from i=1 to n-2 (Python's range(1, n-1) is i=1 to i=n-2 inclusive), and for each i, it tries to apply operations as long as a[i]>1 and a[i-1]>0 and a[i+1]>0.

However, the way it's implemented seems incorrect.

In the while loop:

while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):

list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]

list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

This seems to be trying to apply operations list[i-1] times, which might not be correct.

In the greedy approach, for each i from 2 to n-1, we should apply operations o[i] = min(a[i]//2, a[i-1], a[i+1]) times.

But here, it's subtracting list[i-1] times the operation, which is different.

Moreover, the condition in the while loop is confusing.

I think the given program has a flaw in how it applies the operations.

A better way would be to iterate through the array and apply the operations in a single pass, as per the greedy algorithm I described earlier.

Therefore, I think the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
