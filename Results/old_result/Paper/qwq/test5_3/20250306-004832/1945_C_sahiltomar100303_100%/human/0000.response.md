Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference for which side they want to live on, represented by a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 means they want to live on the left side and 1 means the right side.

The task is to decide where to build this road so that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. Satisfaction means that they get to live on the side they wanted. The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house, or after the last house.

The goal is to choose the position for the road that minimizes the absolute difference between the number of houses on one side and half the total number of houses. If there are multiple positions that satisfy the condition and have the same minimum difference, we should choose the smaller position.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have a sequence of houses with their side preferences. We need to split this sequence at some point and ensure that on each side, at least half of the residents are getting the side they want.

Let me think about what needs to be done step by step.

1. **Input and Parsing:**

   - The input consists of multiple test cases.

   - For each test case:

     - The first line is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), the number of houses.

     - The second line is a string of length n consisting of 0s and 1s, representing the side preferences of the residents.

   - The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

2. **Understanding the Requirements:**

   - We need to choose an index i (0 ≤ i ≤ n), where:

     - If i = 0, the road is before the first house, so the entire village is on the right side.

     - If i = n, the road is after the last house, so the entire village is on the left side.

     - If 0 < i < n, the first i houses are on the left side, and the remaining (n - i) houses are on the right side.

   - For each side, at least half of the residents should be satisfied with their side.

     - For the left side (houses 1 to i):

       - At least ceil(i / 2) residents want to live on the left side (i.e., have a_j = 0).

     - For the right side (houses i+1 to n):

       - At least ceil((n - i) / 2) residents want to live on the right side (i.e., have a_j = 1).

3. **Objective:**

   - Among all possible i that satisfy the above conditions, choose the one where |i - n/2| is minimized.

   - If there are multiple such i, choose the smallest i.

4. **Approach:**

   - We need an efficient way to calculate the number of satisfied residents on each side for different values of i.

   - Since n can be up to 3·10^5 and there are up to 2·10^4 test cases, we need an optimized solution.

5. **Initial Thoughts on Solution:**

   - Precompute the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s from the start and from the end.

   - For each possible i, calculate the number of satisfied residents on both sides using these cumulative counts.

   - Check if the conditions are met and keep track of the i with the smallest |i - n/2|.

6. **Optimization Considerations:**

   - Since n is large, we need O(n) time per test case.

   - Precomputing prefix and suffix sums of 0s and 1s will help in achieving this.

7. **Edge Cases:**

   - All residents want to live on the left side.

   - All residents want to live on the right side.

   - Minimum and maximum values of n.

   - When n is odd and even (since ceil division behaves differently).

8. **Implementation Plan:**

   - Read the number of test cases t.

   - For each test case:

     - Read n and the string a of length n.

     - Compute prefix sums for 0s and 1s.

     - Compute suffix sums for 0s and 1s.

     - Iterate through all possible i from 0 to n:

       - Calculate the number of satisfied residents on the left side (0s in the first i houses).

       - Calculate the number of satisfied residents on the right side (1s in the last (n - i) houses).

       - Check if both conditions are met.

       - If so, calculate |i - n/2| and keep track of the minimum.

     - Output the smallest i among those that satisfy the conditions with the minimum |i - n/2|.

9. **Testing:**

   - Use the provided example to verify the correctness.

   - Consider edge cases to ensure the solution handles them properly.

Now, looking at the given program, I need to determine if it correctly implements this logic and meets the requirements.

Let's analyze the code step by step.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal position to build a road that divides the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side assignment. The goal is to minimize the distance from the middle of the village.

### Approach
1. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Counts**:
   - Calculate the cumulative counts of residents who want to live on the left side (0s) and right side (1s) from the start and end of the village.
   
2. **Check Conditions for Each Possible Division**:
   - For each possible position `i` (0 to n), calculate the number of satisfied residents on both sides.
   - Ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   
3. **Minimize Distance from the Middle**:
   - Track the position `i` that minimizes `|i - n/2|`.
   - If multiple positions have the same distance, choose the smallest `i`.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        s = data[idx]
        idx += 1
        prefix_zero = [0] * (n + 1)
        prefix_one = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                prefix_zero[i+1] = prefix_zero[i] + 1
                prefix_one[i+1] = prefix_one[i]
            else:
                prefix_zero[i+1] = prefix_zero[i]
                prefix_one[i+1] = prefix_one[i] + 1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        best_i = -1
        for i in range(n + 1):
            left_count = i
            right_count = n - i
            left_satisfied = prefix_zero[i]
            right_satisfied = prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i]
            left_half = (left_count + 1) // 2
            right_half = (right_count + 1) // 2
            if left_satisfied >= left_half and right_satisfied >= right_half:
                current_diff = abs(i - n // 2)
                if current_diff < min_diff:
                    min_diff = current_diff
                    best_i = i
                elif current_diff == min_diff:
                    best_i = min(best_i, i)
        print(best_i)

# To use this function, ensure that the input is provided correctly.
# For example, in a script:
# func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - We maintain two arrays `prefix_zero` and `prefix_one` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s up to each position in the string.

2. **Checking Each Position**:
   - For each possible division position `i`, compute the number of satisfied residents on both sides using the prefix sums.
   - Check if the number of satisfied residents meets the required threshold for each side.

3. **Minimizing the Distance**:
   - Track the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.
   - If multiple positions have the same difference, choose the smallest `i`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution within the given constraints, achieving O(n) time complexity per test case.
