Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, understanding the game mechanics:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, and deletes it from `a`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c` (the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`).

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

Goal: Find the game's final score if both play optimally.

Input:

- Multiple test cases, starting with `t` (number of test cases).

- For each test case:

- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5).

- A list of `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an` (0 ≤ ai < n).

- Sum of `n` over all test cases ≤ 2*10^5.

Output:

- For each test case, output the game's score.

Example:

- Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

- Output:

2

1

0

Alright, let's try to understand what's happening here.

MEX Explanation:

- MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it.

- For [2,2,1], MEX is 0.

- For [3,1,0,1], MEX is 2.

- For [0,3,1,2], MEX is 4.

Game Dynamics:

- Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible.

- Bob wants to minimize MEX, which means he wants to prevent Alice from having small integers in `c`.

- Alice has the first move, and she can choose to add elements to `c`, while Bob can only remove elements from `a`.

Wait, actually, Bob deletes the element he picks from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`. So, Bob is just removing elements from `a`, not adding them anywhere.

Wait, no. Let's read again:

- On Alice's turn: pick from `a`, append to `c`, delete from `a`.

- On Bob's turn: pick from `a`, delete from `a`.

So, Bob doesn't add anything to `c`; he just removes an element from `a`.

So, Alice is building `c` by picking elements from `a` and adding them to `c`, while Bob is just removing elements from `a`.

The game ends when `a` is empty.

Objective is to find the MEX of `c` when both play optimally.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Given that, Alice would want to include as many small integers in `c` as possible, while Bob would want to hinder her by removing elements from `a` that could potentially be added to `c`.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Total turns: `n` turns, since `a` has `n` elements.

Alice moves first, then Bob, alternating until `a` is empty.

Alice's move: choose an element from `a`, add it to `c`, delete it from `a`.

Bob's move: choose an element from `a`, delete it from `a`.

So, in each turn, one element is removed from `a`, and possibly added to `c` (only if it's Alice's turn).

At the end, `c` will have elements chosen only by Alice.

Bob can influence what Alice can choose by deleting elements from `a` on his turn.

So, Bob can prevent Alice from choosing certain elements by deleting them before Alice can.

Given that, Bob will try to delete elements that are crucial for Alice to achieve a higher MEX.

Alice will try to select elements that help her achieve a higher MEX, while considering that Bob will be deleting elements to counter her.

MEX is about the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c`.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many of the smaller integers in `c` as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having those smaller integers in `c`.

Given that, Bob will try to delete elements that Alice needs to achieve a higher MEX.

Let's consider the example provided:

Test case 1:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0,0,1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [0,1], c = [1]

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1], c = [1,0]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1,0]

MEX of c = [1,0] is 2.

Is this the optimal outcome?

Let's see if Alice can force a higher MEX.

Suppose Alice chooses 0 first:

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [0,1,1], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [1,1], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [1], c = [0,1]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [0,1]

MEX of c = [0,1] is 2 again.

Another choice:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0,0,1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes [0,0], c = [1]

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [0], c = [1,0]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes empty, c = [1,0]

Again, MEX is 2.

Seems like 2 is the optimal score.

Test case 2:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1,2,3], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes [2,3], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 2, a becomes [3], c = [0,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a becomes empty, c = [0,2]

MEX of c = [0,2] is 1.

But the output is 1.

Is this optimal?

Alternative:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0,2,3], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [2,3], c = [1]

- Alice chooses 2, a becomes [3], c = [1,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a becomes empty, c = [1,2]

MEX is 0.

Wait, but the output is 1, so perhaps 1 is better.

Wait, Alice can choose 0 first to ensure MEX is 1.

So, perhaps 1 is the minimal MEX Alice can achieve, considering Bob's opposition.

Test case 3:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1]

MEX of c = [1] is 0.

Which matches the output.

Alright, now, to generalize this.

I need to find a way to compute the MEX of `c` when both play optimally.

Let me think about the game in terms of who has more control over the elements in `c`.

Alice is the one choosing elements for `c`, but Bob can interfere by deleting elements from `a` that Alice might want.

So, it's like Alice is trying to collect the smallest possible integers in `c`, and Bob is trying to prevent her from doing so by deleting those elements.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in `a`.

Since 0 ≤ a_i < n, frequencies are important.

Let's consider that for each number k (starting from 0 upwards), Alice wants to have at least one copy in `c`.

Bob will try to prevent that by deleting those elements.

Given that Alice moves first, she can pick an element, and Bob can delete an element.

Wait, more precisely, in terms of turns:

- Total of n turns, alternating between Alice and Bob, Alice starting first.

- Alice picks an element to add to `c` and deletes it from `a`.

- Bob picks an element to delete from `a`.

So, in total, Alice will have ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob will have floor(n/2) turns.

But, since Bob can delete elements that Alice might need, it's not just about the number of turns.

Let me think in terms of available elements.

Suppose we sort the array a in non-decreasing order.

Then, try to see how many of the smallest k integers (0,1,2,...,k-1) Alice can guarantee to have at least one of each in `c`, despite Bob's deletions.

So, for each k, check if Alice can ensure that all integers from 0 to k-1 are included in `c`.

If she can, then MEX would be at least k.

We need to find the maximum k for which this is possible.

So, for a given k, we need to check if Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c`, given that Bob is trying to prevent it.

To model this, let's consider the frequencies of numbers from 0 to k-1 in a.

Let freq[j] be the frequency of number j in a.

Total available numbers from 0 to k-1 is sum(freq[j] for j in 0 to k-1).

Alice needs to collect one of each j from 0 to k-1.

Bob can delete elements to prevent Alice from collecting some j.

Since Alice moves first, she can pick elements in a strategic order.

Total turns: n, Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

Wait, but Bob can delete elements that Alice needs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick elements from 0 to k-1 before Bob deletes them all.

Wait, more formally:

For a given k, suppose the total frequency of numbers from 0 to k-1 is f.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements.

But Bob can choose to delete elements from 0 to k-1 to prevent Alice from collecting all of them.

So, the number of elements from 0 to k-1 that Bob can delete is up to floor(n/2).

Alice needs to collect at least one of each j from 0 to k-1.

So, for each j in 0 to k-1, if freq[j] > 0, Alice needs to pick at least one of them before Bob deletes all of them.

Wait, more precisely:

For each j in 0 to k-1, if freq[j] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can delete all of them before Alice can pick any.

Hence, Alice cannot collect j in c.

So, for Alice to be able to collect j, freq[j] > floor(n/2).

Because then, even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements of j, there will still be some left for Alice to pick.

Wait, but Alice picks first, so she can pick an element before Bob deletes it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick elements from 0 to k-1.

Let me consider that Alice and Bob take turns, Alice first.

Total moves: n, Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

For Alice to collect all j from 0 to k-1, she needs to pick at least one of each before Bob deletes them all.

So, for each j in 0 to k-1, the number of times Alice can pick j before Bob deletes them all is:

If freq[j] > floor(n/2), then Alice can pick at least ceil(freq[j] - floor(n/2)) of them.

But since Alice can only pick ceil(n/2) elements in total, need to see if she can allocate her picks to get at least one of each j.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimal number of picks Alice needs to collect one of each j from 0 to k-1, considering Bob's deletions.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can think of it as a game where Alice wants to collect a set of numbers, and Bob wants to prevent her from doing so.

This seems similar to a game where Alice needs to collect a certain set, and Bob is trying to block her.

Maybe I can model it using the concept of the minimal number of moves required for Alice to collect the necessary elements, considering Bob's opposition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of duplicates for each number.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice can be more certain of getting at least one into `c`, because even if Bob deletes some, there are others left.

So, perhaps I can group numbers into those with frequency > floor(n/2), which Alice can be sure to pick at least one, and those with frequency <= floor(n/2), which Bob can delete all of them.

Hence, for numbers j from 0 to k-1, if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can pick at least one, else Bob can delete them all.

So, the minimal MEX would be the smallest j such that freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Wait, no.

Wait, MEX is the smallest j not in c.

So, if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can ensure that j is in c.

Otherwise, Bob can ensure that j is not in c.

Hence, the minimal MEX would be the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

But let's verify this with the sample input.

Test case 1:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2

floor(n/2)=2

So, freq[0]=2 > 2? No, freq[0]=2 > floor(n/2)=2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

Wait, floor(4/2)=2.

So, freq[0]=2 <= 2.

Hence, Bob can delete all 0's or all 1's.

Wait, but in the sample, the MEX is 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, maybe it's freq[j] > floor(n/2) allows Alice to pick at least one.

Wait, freq[j] > floor(n/2) means that even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, there's still at least one left for Alice to pick.

Hence, Alice can pick j if freq[j] > floor(n/2).

So, the minimal MEX is the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

In test case 1:

freq[0]=2 > 2? No, 2 > 2 is False, so MEX=0.

But in the sample, MEX is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, in test case 1, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2.

floor(n/2)=2.

So, freq[0]=2 > 2? No.

Wait, but in the sample, MEX is 2, meaning that c contains 0 and 1.

But according to my earlier logic, since freq[0] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all 0's, so Alice cannot guarantee to have 0 in c.

But in the sample explanation, c ends up with 0 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can pick elements in a way that ensures she gets the necessary j's.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of elements and the number of turns.

Let me try a different approach.

Let's consider that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves to pick elements into c.

Bob has floor(n/2) moves to delete elements from a.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of c, which is the smallest missing integer not in c.

Bob wants to minimize it.

To find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve despite Bob's opposition.

I need to find the smallest integer j such that, even if Alice tries to include j in c, Bob can prevent it.

In other words, for each j, if the frequency of j is greater than what Bob can delete, then Alice can include j in c.

Otherwise, Bob can prevent Alice from including j in c.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Because if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can pick at least one j into c, even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements.

If freq[j] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all occurrences of j before Alice can pick any.

Hence, the minimal MEX is the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2

floor(n/2)=2

So, freq[0]=2 > 2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

Wait, according to this, MEX should be 0, but in the sample, MEX is 2.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, freq[j] > floor(n/2) allows Alice to pick at least one j into c.

So, for j=0, freq[0]=2 > 2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

So, Bob can delete all 0's.

Similarly, for j=1, freq[1]=2 > 2? No.

So, Bob can delete all 1's.

Hence, c would be empty, and MEX would be 0.

But in the sample, c ends up with [1,0], MEX=2.

So, perhaps my earlier logic is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice can pick elements in a way that she can still include j even if freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of elements Alice can pick and the dependencies between different j's.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick elements compared to Bob's deletions.

Total elements: n.

Alice picks ceil(n/2) elements into c.

Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements from a.

But Bob can choose which elements to delete, to minimize the MEX.

So, Bob would want to delete elements that help in making smaller integers missing from c.

Alice wants to include smaller integers in c.

Hence, Alice would prioritize picking smaller integers, and Bob would try to delete those.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and see how many smallest integers Alice can include in c.

Let me sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Then, Alice can try to pick the smallest available integers, and Bob can try to delete elements to prevent that.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider tracking the availability of each integer.

Initialize a frequency map for each j from 0 to some maximum value.

Then, simulate the game:

- While a is not empty:

- Alice picks the smallest available j and adds it to c.

- Bob picks an element to delete, trying to hinder Alice.

But simulating turn by turn would be too slow, as n can be up to 2e5.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements, and she wants to include as many small integers as possible.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements, trying to prevent Alice from including small integers.

Hence, for each integer j, starting from 0 upwards, check if freq[j] > floor(n/2).

If freq[j] > floor(n/2), then even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, there will still be at least one j left for Alice to pick.

Hence, Alice can include j in c.

Otherwise, Bob can delete all occurrences of j, preventing Alice from including j in c.

Hence, the minimal MEX would be the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2

floor(n/2)=2

So, freq[0]=2 <= 2, freq[1]=2 <=2.

Hence, MEX should be 0, but in the sample, it's 2.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding.

Wait, if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can pick at least one j into c.

Otherwise, Bob can delete all j's.

Hence, Alice can include all j's where freq[j] > floor(n/2).

The MEX would be the smallest j not in c, i.e., the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

But in the first test case, freq[0]=2 <=2, freq[1]=2 <=2.

Hence, MEX should be 0, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include some j's even if freq[j] <= floor(n/2), if there are multiple copies.

Wait, in the first test case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2.

Bob can delete floor(n/2)=2 elements.

Bob can delete two 0's, leaving Alice with only 1's, or delete two 1's, leaving Alice with only 0's.

In either case, Alice can pick one 0 and one 1 in her two moves.

Hence, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Hence, perhaps my earlier condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be freq[j] < ceil((n+1)/2).

Wait, in the first test case, ceil(4/2)=2.

So, freq[j] < 2 would be freq[j]=1.

Hence, for j with freq[j] >=2, Alice can include at least one in c.

Hence, in this case, both freq[0]=2 and freq[1]=2, so Alice can include both 0 and 1, MEX=2.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

ceil(n/2)=2

So, freq[j]=1 < 2, so Alice cannot include any j in c.

Wait, but in the sample, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal MEX as the smallest j where the cumulative frequency of 0 to j is <= floor(n/2).

Wait, let's try that.

In the first test case:

j=0: freq[0]=2 <=2, so MEX=0.

But sample output is 2.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps cumulative frequency.

j=0: freq[0]=2 <=2, so MEX=0.

But sample output is 2.

Again, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can pick elements in a way that maximizes the number of unique small integers in c.

Bob tries to minimize that.

Hence, perhaps it's about the number of unique integers Alice can include in c.

Wait, but MEX is about the smallest missing integer.

So, it's not just about unique integers, but about including the smallest integers.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice can include at least one of each j from 0 to k-1 in c, then MEX would be k.

So, the largest possible k where this holds would be the MEX.

Hence, to maximize k, Alice needs to include as many small j's as possible.

Bob tries to minimize k by preventing Alice from including some small j's.

Hence, for each j, starting from 0 upwards, check if Alice can include at least one j in c.

If she can, then MEX is the first j where she cannot.

So, for j from 0 upwards, if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one j in c.

Else, Bob can delete all j's.

Hence, MEX would be the smallest j where freq[j] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but in the first test case, freq[0]=2 <=2, so MEX should be 0, but sample output is 2.

Hence, perhaps this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if freq[j] > floor(n/2), Alice can include j in c.

Hence, in the first test case, freq[0]=2 <=2, so Alice cannot guarantee to include 0.

But in the sample, c includes 0 and 1.

Wait, maybe there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include j if freq[j] > floor(n/2), but in the first test case, freq[0]=2 <=2, but still c includes 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, and she can pick different j's.

Hence, if the sum of freq[j] for j from 0 to k-1 > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one of each j from 0 to k-1 in c.

Because Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements, but if the total available is more than that, Alice can pick enough to cover all j's.

Wait, perhaps that's the way.

Let's define:

For a given k, sum_freq_k = sum(freq[j] for j from 0 to k-1)

If sum_freq_k > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one of each j from 0 to k-1 in c.

Because even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, there will still be at least one of each j left for Alice to pick.

Hence, MEX would be the smallest k where sum_freq_k <= floor(n/2).

This seems promising.

Let's check with the first test case:

k=0: sum_freq_0=0 <=2, so MEX=0.

But sample output is 2.

Not
