Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me starting first. Each player takes n turns, so overall, there are 2n turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets one point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

The problem says that Nene is very smart and always plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My task is to figure out, given my hand of cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, assuming Nene also plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

So, there are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards.

During the game, we take turns playing one card at a time, starting with me, and we do this n times each, for a total of 2n turns.

On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, checks if that number is already on the table, and if it is, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

The table starts empty, and it accumulates cards as we play them.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find out the maximum score I can achieve, playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it.

We have a set of cards, with numbers from 1 to n, each appearing twice. Me and Nene have n cards each, and we take turns playing them, starting with me. Each turn, we play one card, and if the number on that card is already on the table, we get a point.

The goal is to maximize my score, knowing that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine, given that she plays optimally.

I need to model this game and find out the best possible score I can get.

Let me look at the example provided to understand better.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, Nene's cards must be 2,3,4,4 (since each number appears twice).

The example describes a possible sequence of moves:

1. I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

2. Nene plays one of her 4's. Table: [1,4]

3. I play my other 1. Now, 1 is already on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

4. Nene plays her other 4. 4 is already on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

5. I play my 2. Table: [1,4,1,4,2]

6. Nene plays her 2. 2 is already on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2]

7. I play my 3. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

8. Nene plays her 3. 3 is already on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3]

So, my total score is 1, and Nene's is 3.

The problem states that this is the best I can do, so the answer is 1.

In the second test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards would be the remaining ones: 3,6,3,6,4,1,2,7

Wait, hold on. Each number appears twice, so:

Numbers 1 to 8, each appearing twice.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards are the remaining ones: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6

Wait, that doesn't add up. Let's count:

Total cards: two each of 1 to 8, so 16 cards.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5 (that's 8 cards)

So, Nene's cards are the remaining 8: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6

Wait, that's 9 cards. Something's wrong.

Wait, no, Nene has 8 cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6 doesn't make sense, that's 9.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Total cards: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards are the remaining ones: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6

Wait, that's still 9 cards. Oh, I see, I miscounted my cards.

Wait, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5 – that's one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, two 8's, two 5's.

Total unique numbers I have: 7,4,1,2,5,8

But numbers 3 and 6 are missing in my hand, so Nene must have both 3's and both 6's, plus the remaining instances of other numbers.

Wait, total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

I have one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, two 8's, two 5's.

So, total cards I have: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, Nene has the remaining cards: one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, one 8, one 5, two 3's, two 6's.

Wait, but that's 8 cards for Nene: 7,4,1,2,8,5,3,3,6,6 is 10 cards. Wait, something's off.

Wait, total should be 16 cards: two each of 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5 (8 cards)

Nene's cards: the remaining ones: one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, one 8, one 5, two 3's, two 6's.

Wait, that's 8 cards: 7,4,1,2,8,5,3,3,6,6 – no, that's 9 cards. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my counting.

Wait, maybe the problem meant that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck, but in the input, it's allowed that some integers appear only once in my hand, but in total, they appear twice when considering both hands.

Wait, in the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

Total: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's.

In the second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6

Wait, that's 9 cards. Maybe there's a typo in the problem or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps Nene has only one of some cards, but that can't be, since each number appears exactly twice.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards should be: the other instances.

Wait, for numbers I have two of, Nene has none, and for numbers I have one of, Nene has one.

So, for 5 and 8, I have two each, so Nene has none.

For 7,4,1,2, I have one each, so Nene has one each.

Plus, Nene has two each of 3 and 6, since I have none.

So, Nene's cards: 7,4,1,2,3,3,6,6

That's 8 cards, which matches.

Earlier mistake was including 5 and 8 in Nene's hand, which shouldn't be there since I have two of them.

So, corrected: Nene has 7,4,1,2,3,3,6,6

Ok, now I need to think about the game mechanics.

The game consists of 2n turns, with me and Nene alternating, me starting first.

Each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, checks if that number is already on the table, and if it is, they get a point. Then, the card is placed on the table.

The table starts empty.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find the maximum score I can achieve, given that Nene plays optimally.

I need to model this game to find the optimal strategy for both players.

First, I need to understand what it means for Nene to play optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, given that she can see all the cards on the table at each turn.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where both players are trying to maximize their own scores, considering the opponent's moves.

However, in this case, Nene has a secondary objective: to minimize my score when multiple moves lead to the same maximum score for her.

This makes it a bit more complex.

I need to find a way to model this.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

First, let's consider that the game is fully deterministic, as all moves are known in advance (since both players know their own cards and can see the table).

But since the order in which cards are played affects the scoring, I need to consider the sequence of moves.

This seems complicated, as the number of possible sequences is factorial in nature, which isn't feasible for n up to 2e5.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

Each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

Me and Nene have n cards each, so each number can be distributed between us in different ways.

Specifically, for each number, I can have zero, one, or two cards of that number.

But, since each number appears exactly twice in total, if I have zero cards of a number, Nene has both; if I have one, Nene has one; if I have two, Nene has none.

Given that, I can categorize the numbers based on how many cards I have for each number.

Let's define:

- For each number x from 1 to n:

- If I have two cards of x, then Nene has none.

- If I have one card of x, then Nene has one card of x.

- If I have zero cards of x, then Nene has two cards of x.

So, for each number x, I can know how many cards I and Nene have.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene alternately playing one card at a time, starting with me.

At each turn, the player chooses one card from their hand, plays it, and scores a point if that number is already on the table.

The table starts empty.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among those, to minimize my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, considering Nene's behavior.

This seems like a minimax problem, where I need to maximize my score, considering that Nene will respond in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes mine.

This is similar to game tree evaluation, but it's too large for that approach.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the scoring.

A player scores a point whenever they play a card with a number that is already on the table.

So, the score depends on the order in which cards are played.

Specifically, for a number that appears twice, the player who plays the second card of that number scores a point.

Because when the second card is played, the first one is already on the table.

So, for each number that appears twice, the player who plays the second card of that number will score a point.

Given that, the problem reduces to determining, for each number that appears twice, who plays the second card of that number.

My score will be the number of numbers for which I play the second card.

Nene's score will be the number of numbers for which she plays the second card.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to find the maximum score I can achieve.

Wait, but in the first test case, my score is 1, and Nene's is 3.

Let's see:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

So, for number 1: I have two cards, so I play both. The second 1 I play will score a point because the first 1 is already on the table.

For number 2: I have one and Nene has one. So, one of us will play the second 2.

For number 3: I have one and Nene has one. So, one of us will play the second 3.

For number 4: Nene has two, so she plays both. The second 4 she plays will score a point.

In the sequence provided:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4]

3. I play 1, table: [1,4,1], I score 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,4], Nene scores 1 point

5. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2], Nene scores 1 point

7. I play 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3], Nene scores 1 point

So, my score is 1, Nene's is 3.

In this case, for number 2, Nene played the second 2, so she scored a point.

Similarly, for number 3, Nene played the second 3, so she scored another point.

For number 4, Nene played both cards, so she scored one point from the second 4.

For number 1, I played both cards, so I scored one point from the second 1.

Hence, my score is 1, Nene's is 3.

The problem states that this is the best I can do, so the answer is 1.

In this scenario, it seems that for numbers where I have two cards, I can score one point, and for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, Nene can score the point by playing the second card.

Is that always the case?

Wait, but Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, perhaps in some cases, she can force me to play the second card of a number, giving her more points.

Wait, but in the first test case, if I play 1 first, then Nene plays 4, then I play 1 and score a point, then Nene plays 4 and scores a point, then I play 2, Nene plays 2 and scores a point, then I play 3, Nene plays 3 and scores a point.

So, my score is 1, Nene's is 3.

Is there any other way for me to play to get more than one point?

Suppose I play 2 first, instead of 1.

Then:

1. I play 2, table: [2]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4]

3. I play 1, table: [2,4,1]

4. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4,1,4], Nene scores 1 point

5. I play 1, table: [2,4,1,4,1], I score 1 point

6. Nene plays 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,3]

7. I play 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,3,3], I score 1 point

8. Nene plays the remaining 4, but she already played both 4's.

Wait, Nene has only one 4 left after playing one 4.

Wait, in this scenario, Nene has two 4's initially.

So, in the first turn, Nene plays one 4, then in the fourth turn, she plays the second 4 and scores a point.

But in this alternative sequence, if I play 2 first, then 1, then 1, then Nene plays 4, 4, then I play 3, Nene plays 3 and scores a point.

So, my score is 1 (from playing the second 1), and Nene's score is 2 (from playing the second 4 and the second 3).

Wait, that's better for me, as I have 1 point and Nene has 2.

But the problem states that in the first test case, the answer is 1, meaning that even in the best case, I can only get 1 point.

So, perhaps in some cases, Nene can force me to play the second card of a number, but in this alternative sequence, my score is 1 and Nene's is 2.

Is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

Nene is trying to maximize her score and, among those, minimize my score.

So, in the first test case, if I play 2 first, then Nene can choose to play 4.

Then I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1 and score 1 point, Nene plays 3, I play 3 and score 1 point, Nene plays nothing.

Wait, but Nene has two 4's, so she plays both.

Wait, in this alternative sequence, I end up with 1 point (from playing the second 1) and Nene has 2 points (from playing the second 4 and the second 3).

But the problem says that the best I can do is 1 point.

So, perhaps in some sequences, Nene can force me to play the second card of a number where she has one card, thus maximizing her score.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for numbers where I have two cards, I can score one point by playing the second card.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, whoever plays the second card scores a point.

Nene wants to maximize her score, so she will try to play the second card for as many of these numbers as possible.

But since I'm playing first in each pair of turns, I can try to influence the order in which cards are played.

This seems complicated.

Is there a better way to model this?

Let me think about the numbers where I have two cards.

For those, I can arrange to play the second card after Nene has played some other cards, potentially maximizing my chances to score.

Similarly, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, I need to decide the order in which we play those.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of graph theory or some other combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the maximum score I can achieve based on the distribution of cards.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs where I have two cards and the number of pairs where I have one card and Nene has one.

For each number where I have two cards, I can score one point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

For each number where I have one card and Nene has one, it's a competition between me and Nene to play the second card.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to play the second card for as many of these numbers as possible.

So, for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, Nene can score one point per number, assuming she plays optimally.

Therefore, in the first test case:

- I have two 1's, so I can score one point.

- For numbers 2 and 3, I have one each, and Nene has one each.

- Nene can score one point for each of these numbers by playing the second card.

- For number 4, Nene has two, so she can score one point by playing the second 4.

So, total points:

- Me: 1 (from playing the second 1)

- Nene: 1 (from playing the second 2) + 1 (from playing the second 3) + 1 (from playing the second 4)

Hence, my score is 1, Nene's is 3.

In this case, I can only get one point, and Nene can get three.

So, the answer is 1.

In the second test case, the answer is 2.

Let's see:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6 (wait, earlier mistake, Nene has 7,4,1,2,3,3,6,6)

Wait, n=8, so numbers 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6

Wait, that's 9 cards, but n=8, so Nene should have 8 cards.

Wait, perhaps I have two 8's and two 5's, so Nene has none of those.

Thus, Nene has: one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 7, two 3's, two 6's.

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6 (9 cards), but n=8, so 8 cards.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Total cards: two each of 1 to 8, so 16 cards.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5 (8 cards)

Nene's cards: the remaining ones: one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 7, two 3's, two 6's.

Wait, that's 8 cards: 1,2,4,5,7,3,3,6,6 is 9 cards. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, total cards: two each of 1 to 8, so 16 cards.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5 (8 cards: one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, two 8's, two 5's)

So, Nene's cards: the remaining ones: one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, one 8, one 5, two 3's, two 6's.

Wait, that's 8 cards: one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, one 8, one 5, two 3's, two 6's.

Wait, but in total, for numbers 1,2,4,5,7,8, there are two cards each, so:

- For 1: I have one, Nene has one

- For 2: I have one, Nene has one

- For 4: I have one, Nene has one

- For 5: I have two, Nene has none

- For 7: I have one, Nene has one

- For 8: I have two, Nene has none

- For 3:
