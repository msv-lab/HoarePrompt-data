Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number on it, and checks if there's already a card with that number on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is turn-based, with me going first.

- Each player plays n cards.

- Points are scored based on whether the number being played is already on the table.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

My goal is to find out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example provided to get a better grasp.

Example Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

So, for n=4 and my cards being 1,1,2,3, the output is 1.

Let me try to simulate this.

Given n=4, so there are 8 cards in total: two of each number from 1 to 4.

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Therefore, Nene's cards must be 2,3,4,4.

Now, let's see how the game can play out.

Turn 1: I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one of her 4's. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play my other 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays her other 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

Turn 5: I play my 2. Table: [1,4,1,4,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays her 2. Since 2 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2]

Turn 7: I play my 3. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 3. Since 3 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3]

So, I got 1 point, and Nene got 3 points.

The explanation says that I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

Let me try another ordering.

Turn 1: I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one of her 4's. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play my 2. Table: [1,4,2]

Turn 4: Nene plays her 2. Since 2 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,2,2]

Turn 5: I play my other 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,2,2,1]

Turn 6: Nene plays her other 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,2,2,1,4]

Turn 7: I play my 3. Table: [1,4,2,2,1,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 3. Since 3 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,2,2,1,4,3,3]

Again, I get only 1 point.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's try a different approach.

Turn 1: I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one of her 4's. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play my 3. Table: [1,4,3]

Turn 4: Nene plays her 2. Table: [1,4,3,2]

Turn 5: I play my other 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,3,2,1]

Turn 6: Nene plays her other 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,3,2,1,4]

Turn 7: I play my 2. Since 2 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,3,2,1,4,2]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 3. Since 3 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,3,2,1,4,2,3]

Wait, in this scenario, I got 2 points!

But according to the explanation, it's not possible to get more than 1 point. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe Nene won't play her 2 in turn 4 if she's playing optimally.

Let me think again.

Nene's strategy is to maximize her score first and minimize mine second.

In turn 2, Nene has cards 2,3,4,4.

If she plays a 4, then in later turns, when I play my 1, and then my other 1, I get a point.

Alternatively, if she plays a 2 in turn 2, then in turn 3, if I play my 1, and then in turn 5, if I play my other 1, I get a point.

Wait, but in the previous simulation, I got 2 points.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming Nene's optimal play.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the frequencies of the numbers in my hand and Nene's hand.

Given that each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, and I have some cards, Nene has the remaining ones.

So, for each number, I can see how many I have and thus know how many Nene has.

For example, in the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, Nene has 2,3,4,4

So, for number 1: I have 2, Nene has 0

Number 2: I have 1, Nene has 1

Number 3: I have 1, Nene has 1

Number 4: I have 0, Nene has 2

Now, the key is to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

I need to think about the sequence in which we play our cards to maximize my points.

Let me consider that Nene will always play in a way that maximizes her points first and minimizes mine second.

So, she will try to pair her cards to get points, but also make sure that I get fewer points.

In the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has none.

So, if I play one 1 first, then Nene can play any of her cards.

If she plays a 2, then when I play my second 1, it's already on the table (from my first play), so I get a point.

But wait, no, the table starts empty.

Wait, in the first turn, I play one 1, table: [1]

Nene's turn: she plays a 2, table: [1,2]

My turn: I play my second 1, which matches the 1 already on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1]

Nene's turn: she plays her 3, table: [1,2,1,3]

My turn: I play my 3, which matches the 3 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,3]

Nene's turn: she plays her 4, table: [1,2,1,3,3,4]

My turn: I don't have any more cards.

Wait, n=4, so each plays 4 cards.

Wait, in the first simulation, there were 8 turns, but actually, each plays n=4 cards.

Wait, the problem says "take 2n turns", but it's "n turns each".

Wait, the problem says: "take 2n turns, i.e., each person takes n turns, starting with you."

So, total 2n turns, n turns each.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, so 4 turns each, total 8 turns.

But in the example, it shows 8 turns, with alternating plays.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I only played 4 cards, as per n=4.

Wait, but in the first simulation, I played all my cards: two 1's, one 2, one 3.

Nene played: one 4, one 4, one 2, one 3.

Wait, but according to the distribution, Nene has two 4's, one 2, and one 3.

So, that matches.

But in the first simulation, I got one point, in the second simulation, I got two points.

But according to the explanation, it's only possible to get one point.

So, perhaps my second simulation is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can't play my cards in any order I want; Nene's optimal play might prevent me from getting two points.

Let me consider that Nene can see all the cards on the table and play accordingly.

So, if I play my first 1, then Nene can choose to play a card that minimizes my future points.

Perhaps, in the second simulation, Nene would not play her 2 in turn 2 if she sees that it allows me to get two points.

Wait, maybe Nene would play her 4 first, to pair it later.

Let me try:

Turn 1: I play one 1, table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one 4, table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play my other 1, matching the 1 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays her other 4, matching the 4 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

Turn 5: I play my 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays her 2, matching the 2 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2]

Turn 7: I play my 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 3, matching the 3 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3]

So, I got only one point.

In the earlier simulation where I got two points, perhaps Nene would adjust her play to prevent that.

Wait, in that simulation:

Turn 1: I play one 1, table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one 2, table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play my other 1, matching the 1 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays her 3, table: [1,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play my 2, matching the 2 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays her 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4]

Turn 7: I play my 3, matching the 3 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 4, matching the 4 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4]

Wait, in this simulation, I got two points, but according to the explanation, it's only possible to get one point.

What's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the points.

In turn 5, I play my 2, which matches the 2 on the table, so I get 1 point. Total points so far: 1

In turn 7, I play my 3, which matches the 3 on the table, so I get another point. Total points: 2

But according to the explanation, it's only possible to get one point.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding Nene's optimal play.

Nene wants to maximize her score first and minimize mine second.

In this simulation, she allowed me to get two points, which seems suboptimal for her.

So, perhaps in turn 2, Nene should have played her 4 instead of her 2.

Let's try that:

Turn 1: I play one 1, table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one 4, table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play my other 1, matching the 1 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays her other 4, matching the 4 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

Turn 5: I play my 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays her 2, matching the 2 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2]

Turn 7: I play my 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 3, matching the 3 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3]

In this case, I only get one point.

Alternatively, if in turn 2, Nene plays her 2, then:

Turn 1: I play one 1, table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one 2, table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play my other 1, matching the 1 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays her 3, table: [1,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play my 2, matching the 2 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays her 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4]

Turn 7: I play my 3, matching the 3 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her 4, matching the 4 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4]

Here, I got two points.

But according to the explanation, it's only possible to get one point.

Wait, maybe in the first simulation, Nene can play her 4 in turn 2 to prevent me from getting two points.

But in that case, I still get one point.

Wait, perhaps Nene can force me to get only one point by playing her cards in a certain way.

Let me think differently.

I need to find a general strategy to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me consider the frequencies.

For each number, I know how many I have, and thus how many Nene has.

Let me denote:

- For each number x from 1 to n:

- count_x: total number of cards with x (always 2)

- my_count_x: number of x's I have in my hand (0, 1, or 2)

- nene_count_x: number of x's Nene has (2 - my_count_x)

My goal is to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Nene's goal is to maximize her points first and minimize mine second.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players are playing optimally.

I need to find a way to model this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial game.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider that:

- For a number x where I have two cards, Nene has none.

- For a number x where I have one card, Nene has one.

- For a number x where I have zero cards, Nene has two.

So, for numbers where I have two cards, I can potentially get one point from them, by playing the second one after the first one is on the table.

But Nene can try to interfere with that.

Wait, but since Nene has no cards of that number, she can't play any card of that number.

So, for numbers where I have two cards and Nene has none, I can always get one point from that number.

Similarly, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, it's possible that I can get a point if I play my card after Nene plays her card.

But Nene will try to play her card in a way that minimizes my points.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing the numbers.

Let me consider that:

- For each number x, there are two cards: one or two in my hand, and the rest in Nene's hand.

- The game is about ordering the plays to maximize overlaps.

This seems complex.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample input:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Output: 1

Second sample input:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Output: 2

Third sample input:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Output: 1

Fourth sample input:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Output: 0

Fifth sample input:

n=1

My cards: 1

Output: 0

From these, I can see that:

- When I have two cards of the same number and Nene has none, I can get one point from that number.

- In the first sample, I have two 1's, and Nene has none, so I can get one point.

- In the second sample, perhaps I have two 8's and two 5's, but Nene has some of them.

Wait, in the second sample:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have:

- 7: 1

- 4: 1

- 1: 1

- 2: 1

- 8: 2

- 5: 2

Thus, Nene has:

- 7: 1

- 4: 1

- 1: 1

- 2: 1

- 8: 0

- 5: 0

- And for numbers not in my hand: 3,6,9,10 (assuming n=8, numbers from 1 to 8), but 9 and 10 are beyond n=8, so likely numbers are from 1 to 8.

Wait, n=8, numbers from 1 to 8.

So, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Thus, Nene has: 7,4,1,2 (one of each), and no 8's or 5's.

So, similar to the first test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, Nene has none of those.

So, perhaps I can get one point for each pair I have exclusively.

Wait, but in this case, output is 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have two 1's, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have exclusively.

In the first test case, I have one pair of 1's.

In the second test case, I have two pairs: 8's and 5's.

Yes, output is 2.

In the third test case, n=8, my cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have:

- 7:1

- 1:1

- 4:2

- 5:1

- 3:1

- 2:1

- 6:1

Thus, Nene has:

- 7:1

- 1:1

- 4:0

- 5:1

- 3:1

- 2:1

- 6:1

- And 8:2, but 8 is not in my hand.

Wait, n=8, numbers from 1 to 8.

My hand: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have two 4's, Nene has none.

So, output is 1, which matches the number of pairs I have exclusively.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards:1,2,3

So, I have one of each, Nene has the other one of each.

So, I have no exclusive pairs, output is 0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards:1

So, I have one 1, Nene has one 1.

No exclusive pairs, output is 0.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

Wait, but in the second test case, I have two numbers with two cards each (8 and 5), and Nene has none of those, so I can get two points.

Similarly, in the first test case, I have one number with two cards (1), and Nene has none, so I can get one point.

In the third test case, I have one number with two cards (4), and Nene has none, so I can get one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no numbers with two cards, so I can get zero points.

So, perhaps the answer is simply the number of numbers for which I have two cards.

But wait, in the first simulation I did, even though I have two 1's, I only get one point, because Nene can play in a way to prevent me from getting more points.

But according to this pattern, it seems that the answer is the number of numbers for which I have two cards.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps this is the case.

Let me think about why this is so.

For each number where I have two cards and Nene has none, I can always play one card, and then the other card later, getting one point from the second card.

Nene can't interfere with this because she has no cards of that number.

So, for each such number, I can get one point.

In addition, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, it's more complicated.

But in the sample inputs, it seems that I can't get any points from those numbers, as Nene can play her card in a way to prevent me from getting a point.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have two cards.

In the first test case, I have one such number (1), output is 1.

In the second test case, I have two such numbers (5 and 8), output is 2.

In the third test case, I have one such number (4), output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no such numbers, output is 0.

This seems to match the sample outputs.

So, perhaps the answer is simply the number of numbers for which I have two cards.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me think of a scenario where this doesn't hold.

Suppose n=3, my cards are 1,1,2, and Nene has 2,3,3.

According to my hypothesis, I have one pair (1), so I should
