Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations I can perform and how they affect the array. The key point is that I can only perform the operation on elements that are at least 10, and when I do, I replace that element with its individual digits in the same position.

I need to check if, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me look at the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 45: [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - If I split 67: [12, 3, 45, 6, 7]

   - If I split both 12 and 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - If I split 12 and 67: [1, 2, 3, 45, 6, 7]

   - If I split 45 and 67: [12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   - If I split all three: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   Among these, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - Possible splits:

     - Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

     - Split 28: [12, 2, 8, 5]

     - Split both 12 and 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

   - None of these seem to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

So, from these examples, it seems like I need to explore different ways of splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 and check if any of those configurations result in a sorted array.

But exploring all possible configurations could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 50, and each element could be split into up to two digits. So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about what happens when I split a number:

- If I have a number like 12, splitting it into 1 and 2 increases the length of the array by 1 (from 1 element to 2 elements).

- Similarly, splitting 45 into 4 and 5 also increases the length by 1.

- Splitting 10 into 1 and 0 does the same.

So, the array can grow in length based on how many splits I perform.

My goal is to have the final array sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to consider that splitting a number into digits can change the relative order of elements in the array.

Let me consider the first example again: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- If I split 12 into 1 and 2, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

- Alternatively, if I split 45 into 4 and 5, the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is not sorted because 12 > 3.

- If I split both 12 and 45, I get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is sorted.

So, in this case, it's possible to achieve a sorted array.

In the second example: [12, 28, 5]

- Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5] – not sorted.

- Split 28: [12, 2, 8, 5] – not sorted.

- Split both: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5] – not sorted.

- Split neither: [12, 28, 5] – not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to get a sorted array.

In the third example: [0, 0]

- No splitting needed; already sorted.

So, the task is to determine for each test case whether it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 any number of times.

I need to find an efficient way to check this.

One approach could be to iterate through the array and decide for each number whether to split it or not, in a way that maintains the sorted order.

But since splitting a number can affect the positions of subsequent elements, this might be tricky.

Another idea: since splitting a number into digits can only decrease the value of the elements (since digits are at most 9), I need to ensure that the split digits don't disrupt the sorted order.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 actually decreases the values, and the array becomes sorted.

But in the second example, splitting 12 and 28 doesn't help because the digits might be placed in positions where they disrupt the order.

Maybe I can model this as inserting digits in place of the original numbers, and check if there's a way to do this such that the array is sorted.

But this seems a bit vague. Let's think differently.

Let's consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each number can be either kept as is (if less than 10) or split into its digits (if 10 or more).

So, for each element in the array, I have two choices:

1. Keep it as is (if it's less than 10, I have no choice but to keep it).

2. Split it into its digits (if it's 10 or more).

Then, I need to check if there's a way to make these choices such that the resulting sequence of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a decision problem where I need to explore different configurations based on choices for each element.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each element can be either kept as is or split (if >=10), the number of possible configurations could be up to 2^n, which for n=50 is too large to handle directly.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the constraints:

- n is between 2 and 50.

- Each a_i is between 0 and 99.

- Operations can be performed any number of times, but only on elements >=10.

I need to find a way to determine if the array can be sorted without explicitly generating all possible configurations.

Maybe I can think in terms of the maximum possible value at each position if I choose to split or not.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the possible ranges of values at each position, considering whether to split or not.

But that sounds complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start from the left.

- At each position, decide whether to split the number or not, and keep track of the maximum value so far.

- Ensure that the next value (or values, if splitting) are greater than or equal to the previous one.

This seems similar to depth-first search with pruning to avoid exploring impossible paths.

But with n up to 50, this might still be too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this or find a pattern?

Wait, perhaps I can flatten the array by splitting all possible numbers >=10 and then check if there's a subsequence that is sorted.

But that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Another idea: since splitting a number >=10 into digits can only decrease the values, I need to ensure that the sequence can be made non-decreasing by possibly decreasing some values to their digits.

This sounds similar to checking if one array can be made non-decreasing by modifying some elements, but with the constraint that modifications are specific (splitting into digits).

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider the problem in terms of constraints.

I need to have a sequence where each element is >= the previous one.

Each original element can be either kept as is (if <10) or split into its digits (if >=10).

So, for each position, I have a set of possible values: if a_i <10, only a_i; if a_i >=10, either a_i or its digits.

I need to choose one possibility for each position such that the resulting sequence is sorted.

This sounds like a graph where each position has possible values, and I need to pick a path through these values that is non-decreasing.

This is starting to sound like a graph path problem, which might be too slow for n=50.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Iterate through the array from left to right.

- Keep track of the maximum value seen so far.

- For each element, consider whether to split it or not, and choose the option that allows the sequence to remain sorted.

- If splitting allows the sequence to continue being sorted, choose to split; otherwise, keep it as is.

- If at any point, neither option allows the sequence to continue being sorted, then it's impossible.

But this might not work because choosing to split or not at one position can affect the possibilities for future positions.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i][j]: whether it's possible to make the first i elements sorted, with the i-th element being j.

But I need to define j appropriately.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] represents the possible last values of the sequence after processing the first i original elements.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I process the array from left to right, and maintain a sorted sequence.

For each original element, I have two choices: keep it as is (if <10) or split it into digits (if >=10).

I need to choose for each element which option to take, ensuring that the sequence remains sorted.

This sounds like a decision tree, where each node represents a choice for an element, and I need to see if there's a path that leads to a sorted sequence.

But with n=50, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can be seen as inserting multiple smaller elements into the array, which can help in making the array sorted.

But I need a way to decide where and when to split.

Another idea: try to split all numbers >=10 and see if the resulting array can be rearranged to be sorted.

But the problem is that the positions matter; I can't rearrange the elements freely.

I have to maintain the relative order of the elements as they were in the original array, except for the inserted digits taking the place of the split number.

Wait, no. Actually, when I split a number, I replace it with its digits in the same position.

So, the digits are inserted in place of the original number, maintaining their order.

For example, [12, 3, 45, 67]:

- Split 12: [1,2],3,45,67

- Split 45: 1,2,3,4,5,67

- Split 67: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

So, the digits are inserted in the same order as the original number.

Given that, I need to consider all possible ways of splitting numbers >=10 and check if any of these configurations result in a sorted array.

But again, with n=50, this is not practical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than or equal to the next element.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 allows the array to be sorted because 2 <= 3.

Similarly, splitting 45 into 4 and 5 allows 5 <=67.

But in the second example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2, and 28 into 2 and 8, results in [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted because 8 >5.

So, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where, for each element, if it's >=10, I can choose to keep it or split it, and ensure that the sequence remains sorted.

I need to ensure that after any splits, the sequence is non-decreasing.

I need to find a way to check this efficiently.

Another angle: think about the maximum possible value at each position if I choose to split or not.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, considering the possibilities of splitting.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize max_so_far = -1

For each element in the array:

- If the element <10:

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- Option 1: Keep the element as is

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element

- Option 2: Split the element into digits

- For each digit, ensure digit >= max_so_far, and set max_so_far = digit

- If neither option is possible, return False

- If at least one option is possible, proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

But this seems incomplete because splitting an element into multiple digits affects the subsequent elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the digits as separate elements in the sequence.

So, for each original element, I have to decide whether to keep it as is or split it into digits, and then check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a recursive function with memoization, where the state is the current position and the previous value.

Let me define a function that, given the current position and the previous value, decides whether to keep the current element or split it, ensuring that the sequence remains sorted.

But with n=50, this might still be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting an element into digits can be seen as inserting multiple elements in place of one, and I need to ensure that these inserted digits are in non-decreasing order with respect to the previous and next elements.

So, for each element:

- If it's <10, no choice: keep it.

- If it's >=10, choose to keep it or split it into digits.

- If I keep it, ensure it's >= the previous element.

- If I split it, ensure that all its digits are >= the previous element and that they are in non-decreasing order among themselves.

Wait, but digits of a number are not necessarily in non-decreasing order.

For example, 45 splits into 4 and 5, which is fine, but 54 splits into 5 and 4, which is not sorted.

So, if I split a number, I have to consider its digits in the original order, not necessarily in sorted order.

Wait, no: in the first example, splitting 45 into 4 and 5 maintains their order, so 4 comes before 5.

But in the second example, splitting 28 into 2 and 8 maintains their order, so 2 comes before 8.

But in the third example, splitting 54 into 5 and 4 would have 5 before 4, which is not sorted.

So, splitting a number into digits in their original order can lead to a sequence that is not sorted.

Hence, I need to be careful about the order of digits when splitting.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element."

So, for 45, it's 4 and then 5.

For 28, it's 2 and then 8.

For 54, it's 5 and then 4.

So, in the case of 54, splitting it into 5 and 4 would result in 5 followed by 4, which is not sorted.

Hence, if I have [54, 3], splitting 54 into 5 and 4 would give [5,4,3], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to sort.

Wait, but in this example, even keeping 54 as is would give [54,3], which is not sorted.

So, it's impossible to sort this array.

But in the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 into 1 and 2 gives [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, in that case, it's possible.

Hence, the key is to choose which elements to split in a way that the resulting sequence is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a choice for an element (split or not), and edges represent the possibility of moving from one choice to another while maintaining the sorted order.

Then, I can check if there's a path from the first element to the last that maintains the sorted order.

But with n=50, this might still be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting an element into digits can be seen as inserting multiple elements in place of one, and I need to ensure that the entire sequence is sorted.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the last value in the current sequence, considering the possibilities of splitting or not.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element in the array:

- If element <10:

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- Option 1: Keep the element as is

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Option 2: Split the element into its digits

- For each digit:

- If digit >= prev, set prev = digit

- Else, cannot split

- If neither option is possible, return False

- Else, proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

Wait, but this doesn't account for the fact that splitting an element into multiple digits affects the subsequent elements.

For example, in [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 into 1 and 2 affects the position of 3.

So, this approach might not work.

I need a way to handle the variable-length sequence resulting from splitting.

Perhaps I can think in terms of merging the splits.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the array and simulate the splits.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that, given the current position and the previous value, decides whether to split or not.

But again, recursion with n=50 is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with a sequence of digits, and I need to ensure that this sequence, combined with the rest of the array, forms a non-decreasing sequence.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array, and for each element, if it's >=10, consider both options: keeping it or splitting it, and check if either leads to a sorted sequence.

But again, this seems too slow for n=50.

I need to find a more efficient way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the sequence sorted if the digits are smaller than or equal to the next element.

Wait, but in practice, splitting can introduce smaller values that might disrupt the order.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum and minimum values after splitting.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each element the possible values: either the element itself (if <10) or its digits (if >=10).

Then, I can try to select one value from each element's possible values and check if there's a combination that results in a sorted sequence.

But this still seems too slow.

I need to find a pattern or a property that allows me to determine the possibility without exploring all combinations.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can only decrease the value, and digits are at most 9.

So, if I have an element that is >=10 and the next element is smaller than some digit in the current element, then I must split the current element to insert its digits, and ensure that the digits are <= the next element.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think about the first example: [12,3,45,67]

- 12 >=10, and 3 <12, so I must split 12 into 1 and 2.

- Then, 1 <=3, and 2 <=45, and 45 <=67.

- So, it's possible.

In the second example: [12,28,5]

- 12 >=10, and 28 >=12, so I can keep 12.

- Then, 28 >=28, and 5 <28.

- So, I must split 28 into 2 and 8.

- Now, the sequence is [12,2,8,5].

- 12 >=12, 2 <12, so it's not sorted.

- Alternatively, if I split 12 into 1 and 2, then [1,2,28,5].

- 1 <=2, 2 <=28, but 28 >5, so must split 28 into 2 and 8.

- Then, [1,2,2,8,5].

- 1 <=2 <=2 <=8, but 8 >5, so not sorted.

- Hence, impossible.

In the third example: [0,0]

- Both <10, and 0 <=0, so sorted.

So, in the first example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 allows the sequence to be sorted.

In the second example, no matter what splits I make, I can't get a sorted sequence.

Hence, the answer is YES for the first test case and NO for the second.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever an element is >=10 and the next element is smaller than it, I must split it.

Then, I can check if after splitting, the sequence can be made sorted.

Wait, but splitting introduces multiple digits in place of one number, which complicates the indexing.

I need a way to handle this.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits effectively replaces that number with a sequence of digits, and I need to ensure that this sequence is sorted with respect to the previous and next elements.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array, and whenever I encounter a number >=10, I consider both options: keeping it or splitting it, and see which option allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

I can implement this using a stack or some other data structure to keep track of the current sequence.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each number >=10, if I keep it, it must be >= the previous element in the sequence.

If I split it, each digit must be >= the previous element in the sequence, and the digits must be in non-decreasing order among themselves.

Wait, but digits are in their original order, not necessarily sorted.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that the digits are in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but in the first example, 45 splits into 4 and 5, which is fine because 4 <=5.

But in [54,3], splitting 54 into 5 and 4 is not sorted because 5 >4.

Hence, perhaps I need to ensure that when I split a number, its digits are in non-decreasing order.

But that's not always possible, as in the case of 54.

Hence, perhaps I can only split numbers whose digits are in non-decreasing order.

But in the first example, 45's digits are in order (4 <=5), and 67's digits are in order (6 <=7).

In the second example, 28's digits are in order (2 <=8), but splitting leads to issues because the digits might not align properly with the rest of the array.

Wait, maybe I need to check two things:

1. For numbers >=10 that I choose to split, their digits must be in non-decreasing order.

2. The resulting sequence after splitting must be sorted.

But this seems incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each number >=10 whether its digits are in non-decreasing order.

If they are, then splitting it won't disrupt the order.

If they aren't, splitting it will make the sequence unsorted at that point.

But in the first example, even though 12's digits are in order (1 <=2), splitting it allows the sequence to be sorted.

In the second example, 12 and 28 both have digits in order, but splitting them doesn't lead to a sorted sequence.

Hence, just checking if digits are in order is not sufficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each number >=10, I can choose to keep it or split it, and I need to ensure that the sequence remains sorted after these choices.

I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the array and the choice made for that position, and edges represent possible transitions to the next position.

Then, I can search for a path from the start to the end that maintains the sorted order.

But with n=50, this is not practical.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that the operation of splitting a number into digits can be seen as inserting the digits in place of the number, and I need to ensure that the entire sequence is sorted.

Hence, I can think of the array as a sequence where some positions can be replaced by their digits, and I need to check if there's a way to replace them such that the sequence is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, considering the possibilities of splitting.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize max_so_far = -1

For each element in the array:

- If element <10:

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- Option 1: Keep the element as is

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element

- Option 2: Split the element into digits

- For each digit:

- If digit >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = digit

- Else, cannot split

- If neither option is possible, return False

- Else, proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

But as I thought earlier, this doesn't fully account for the positions of the digits after splitting because splitting can insert multiple digits in place of one element, which affects the alignment with subsequent elements.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need to find a different way.

Let me consider that the operation of splitting a number into digits can be done any number of times, but only on numbers >=10.

Hence, I can think of fully expanding the array by splitting all possible numbers >=10 into their digits.

Then, check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

But the problem is that splitting is mandatory only if you choose to do it; you can choose not to split some numbers >=10.

Hence, I need to consider all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting for each number >=10.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to make the first i elements sorted, considering the choices made for splitting or not.

But with n=50, this might still be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than or equal to the next element.

Wait, but in practice, it's more nuanced.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and simulate the splits where necessary.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize an empty list to build the sorted sequence.

Iterate through each element in the array:

- If the element <10:

- Append it to the sequence.

- If it's >=10:

- Check if splitting it would help in maintaining the sorted order.

- If splitting, insert its digits into the sequence.

- If not splitting, insert the element as is.

- After inserting, check if the sequence is still sorted.

- If at any point the sequence is not sorted, try the other option (split or not split).

- If neither option works, return False.

At the end, return True.

But this is still too vague and might not be efficient enough.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with its digits in the same order.

Hence, I can think of the array as being expanded by splitting all numbers >=10 into their digits.

Then, I can check if this expanded array can be sorted by choosing which splits to perform.

But this is still not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible value at each position after considering splits.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element in the array:

- If element <10:

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- digits = list of digits in the element (in order)

- Option 1: Keep the element as is

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Option 2: Split the element into digits

- For each digit in digits:

- If digit >= prev, set prev = digit

- Else, cannot split

- If neither option is possible, return False

- Else, proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

This seems similar to what I thought earlier, but perhaps it's sufficient.

Let me test this logic with the first example: [12,3,45,67]

- element=12 >=10

- Option 1: keep 12

- 12 >= -1, set prev=12

- Option 2: split 12 into 1 and 2

- 1 >= -1, set prev=1

- 2 >=1, set prev=2

- So, splitting is possible with prev=2, which is better than keeping 12 with prev=12.

- Now, choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

- Choose splitting, so prev=2

- Next element=3 <10

- 3 >=2, set prev=3

- Next element=45 >=10

- Option 1: keep 45

- 45 >=3, set prev=45

- Option 2: split 45 into 4 and 5

- 4 >=3, set prev=4

- 5 >=4, set prev=5

- So, splitting is possible with prev=5, which is better.

- Choose splitting, so prev=5

- Next element=67 >=10

- Option 1: keep 67

- 67 >=5, set prev=67

- Option 2: split 67 into 6 and 7

- 6 >=5, set prev=6

- 7 >=6, set prev=7

- So, splitting is possible with prev=7.

- Choose splitting, so prev=7

- End of array, return True.

Hence, according to this logic, it's possible to sort the array.

In the second example: [12,28,5]

- element=12 >=10

- Option 1: keep 12

- 12 >= -1, set prev=12

- Option 2: split 12 into 1 and 2

- 1 >= -1, set prev=1

- 2 >=1, set prev=2

- So, splitting is possible with prev=2.

- Choose splitting, so prev=2

- Next element=28 >=10

- Option 1: keep 28

- 28 >=2, set prev=28

- Option 2: split 28 into 2 and 8

- 2 >=2, set prev=2

- 8 >=2, set prev=8

- So, splitting is possible with prev=8.

- Choose splitting, so prev=8

- Next element=5 <10

- 5 >=8? No.

- Cannot keep 5.

- Hence, return False.

Hence, according to this logic, it's impossible to sort this array.

In the third example: [0,0]

- element=0 <10

- 0 >= -1, set prev=0

- Next element=0 <10

- 0 >=0, set prev=0

- End of array, return True.

So, this logic seems to work for these examples.

Hence, I can implement this approach.

Implement a function that iterates through the array, and for each element, if it's >=10, consider both options: keeping it or splitting it into digits, and choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

If at any point neither option is possible, return False.

At the end, return True.

To implement this, I can use a loop that keeps track of the previous value (prev), and for each element, choose the best option (keep or split) based on whether it allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

I need to ensure that when splitting, I insert all the digits in order and check if they are >= prev.

Also, I need to handle the case where splitting introduces multiple digits, which may affect the comparison with subsequent elements.

Wait, but in the above logic, when splitting, I set prev to the last digit inserted.

Hence, the next element must be >= that last digit.

This seems to handle the alignment correctly.

Hence, I can proceed with this approach.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

I need to handle multiple test cases, so I'll need to read t, then for each test case, read n and the array a.

Then, apply the above logic to determine if it's possible to sort the array.

Finally, output YES or NO for each test case.

I need to make sure that the code is efficient enough, considering that n can be up to 50 and t up to 1000.

Hence, an O(n) solution per test case should be acceptable.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

Define a function that takes the array a and returns True if it's possible to sort it, else False.

Initialize prev = -1

Iterate through each element in a:

- If element <10:

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- Option 1: keep the element

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Option 2: split the element into digits

- For each digit in the element (from left to right):

- If digit >= prev, set prev = digit

- Else, cannot split

- If neither option is possible, return False

- Else, choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

- Proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

But I need to decide which option to choose: keep or split.

I should choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted and leads to the smallest possible prev, to maximize the flexibility for future elements.

Wait, no. I should choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted and leads to the largest possible prev, to minimize the constraints for future elements.

Wait, actually, I need to choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted and maximizes prev, so that future elements have stricter constraints, making it less likely to violate the sorted order.

But I'm getting confused.

Actually, I should choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted and minimizes prev, to give more flexibility to the next elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both options and see which one allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

But in practice, choosing to split or not depends on the specific values.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider both options and see if at least one of them leads to a sorted sequence.

In other words, if either keeping the element or splitting it allows the sequence to continue being sorted, then proceed with that choice.

If neither option works, then it's impossible.

Hence, in code, for each element, check both options and see if at least one leads to a sorted sequence.

If both options fail, return False.

Otherwise, choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted and update prev accordingly.

Implementing this logic requires careful handling of the prev value for each option.

Given that, perhaps I can implement it as follows:

Initialize prev = -1

For each element in a:

- If element <10:

- If element >= prev, set prev = element

- Else, return False

- Else (element >=10):

- Option 1: keep the element

- If element >= prev:

- temp_prev = element

- Proceed to the next element with temp_prev

- Option 2: split the element into digits

- For each digit:

- If digit >= prev:

- Update prev to the last digit

- Proceed to the next element

- Else:

- Cannot split

- If neither option is possible, return False

- Else, choose the option that allows the sequence to continue being sorted.

- Proceed to the next element

At the end, return True

But in code, I need to simulate choosing one option at a time and updating prev accordingly.

Hence, I need to keep track of prev for each choice.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Define function can_sort(a):

prev = -1

for num in a:

if num <10:

if num < prev:

return False

prev = num

else:

# Option 1: keep the number as is

if num >= prev:

option1 = True

new_prev1 = num

else:

option1 = False

# Option 2: split the number into digits

digits = [each digit of num from left to right]

current_prev = prev

for digit in digits:

if digit >= current_prev:

current_prev = digit

else:

option2 = False

break

else:

option2 = True

new_prev2 = digits[-1]

# Check if at least one option is possible

if option1 or option2:

if option1 and option2:

# Choose the option that minimizes prev

if new_prev1 < new_prev2:

prev = new_prev1

else:

prev = new_prev2

elif option1:

prev = new_prev1

else:

prev = new_prev2

else:

return False

return True

This seems like a reasonable approach.

Let me test this pseudocode with the first example: a = [12,3,45,67]

- num=12 >=10

- Option1: 12 >= -1, option1=True, new_prev1=12

- Option2: digits=[1,2]

- 1 >= -1
