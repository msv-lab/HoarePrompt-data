Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if, after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero), the array can be sorted in non-descending order. That means the array should be in ascending order, with duplicates allowed.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I choose an element that's at least 10, I can replace it with its individual digits. So, for example, 12 can be replaced with 1 and 2. If I have 10, it becomes 1 and 0. Got it.

Now, I need to think about how to use this operation to sort the array. Since I can apply this operation any number of times, I need to see if by breaking down some or all of the two-digit numbers into single digits, I can arrange the array in non-descending order.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - If I split 67: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   - Any of these can be sorted, but in the first example, it says splitting the first element (12) leads to [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is not sorted, but it's possible to split further to make it sorted.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

   - Split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

   - Split 5: it's already a single digit.

   - No matter how I split, I can't get a non-descending sequence.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

So, the goal is to see if, by splitting the two-digit numbers into their digits, I can arrange the array to be sorted.

Now, thinking about how to approach this programmatically. I need to process each test case separately, since there can be multiple test cases.

Given that n can be up to 50, and a_i up to 99, it's not too large, so efficiency might not be a big issue.

First, I need to read the number of test cases, t. Then, for each test case, read n and the array a of n integers.

For each test case, I need to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-descending order by applying the operation any number of times.

I need to think about what operations I can perform and how they affect the array.

Observations:

- Single-digit numbers don't need to be split; they can stay as they are.

- Two-digit numbers can be split into their constituent digits.

- The operation can be applied any number of times, but once a number is split, it's replaced by its digits, and those digits are just part of the array.

- The operation can be applied to any element that's >= 10, and this can be done multiple times.

- The question is whether, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-descending order.

Strategy:

- For each test case, consider all possible ways to split the numbers that are >= 10.

- For each possible combination of splitting or not splitting these numbers, check if the resulting array can be sorted in non-descending order.

- If any such combination leads to a sorted array, then the answer is YES; otherwise, it's NO.

But considering that n can be up to 50, and each element that's >=10 can be either split or not, this could lead to exponential time complexity, which is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Alternative approach:

- Think about the digits that make up the numbers in the array.

- Each number that's >=10 can be represented as a sequence of its digits, or as the number itself.

- But since the operation allows me to choose to split any number >=10, I can choose to split all of them into their digits.

- So, one extreme is to split all numbers >=10 into their digits, and the other extreme is to leave them as they are.

- I need to see if there's a way to choose which numbers to split so that the resulting array is sorted.

- But checking all possible combinations is not efficient.

Another idea:

- Consider the array as a sequence of digits and numbers.

- For numbers >=10, consider them as potential sequences of digits.

- Try to arrange these sequences in a way that, when concatenated, they form a non-descending sequence.

- This seems complicated.

Wait a minute. Maybe I can think of it differently.

If I choose to split all numbers >=10 into their digits, what would the array look like? It would be an array of single digits.

Then, if I sort this array of single digits, it would be sorted in non-descending order.

But the problem is not to sort the array after splitting all numbers, but to see if, by choosing which numbers to split, I can get a sorted array.

Wait, but the problem allows me to perform the operation any number of times, which means I can split any number of the numbers >=10, and the question is if the resulting array can be sorted.

But it's not clear if I can rearrange the array after splitting; the sample input suggests that the digits are inserted in the same position.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in the order they appear in that element."

So, the digits replace the number, but maintain their relative order.

For example, splitting 12 in [12, 3, 45, 67] gives [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], where 1 and 2 are in the same position as 12 was.

Similarly, splitting 45 gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67].

So, the array's order is preserved except for the positions where numbers are split into digits.

Given that, I need to see if, by splitting some numbers, I can make the array sorted.

Now, to make it sorted, for every position i < j, a_i <= a_j must hold.

So, I need to ensure that after splitting, the array is sorted.

But checking all possible combinations is not efficient.

Is there a way to model this more efficiently?

Maybe I can think in terms of the possible values that each position can take, considering whether to split the number or not.

For example, if a number is >=10, it can either stay as is or be split into its digits.

Then, for each position, I can have a set of possible values: the number itself if it's <10, or the number itself or its digits if it's >=10.

Then, I need to choose, for each position, whether to split or not, such that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a graph where each position has possible states, and I need to choose a path that leads to a sorted array.

But this seems complicated.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits always results in digits that are less than or equal to the number itself.

Wait, no. For example, 12 splits into 1 and 2, both less than 12.

45 splits into 4 and 5, both less than 45.

So, splitting a number >=10 replaces it with digits that are less than or equal to the original number.

But, in the array, after splitting, these digits are inserted in the same position.

So, the array's length increases if a number is split into multiple digits.

Now, to check if the array can be sorted, I need to see if there's a way to split some numbers such that the resulting array is sorted.

This seems tricky.

Is there a way to model this more simply?

Maybe I can consider the array as a sequence of elements, where each element can be either kept as is or split into its digits, and I need to choose which to do to make the sequence sorted.

Given that, I can try to iterate through the array and decide for each element whether to split it or not, based on the previous decision.

But I need to ensure that the sequence remains sorted at each step.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the maximum value so far and decide whether to split the current number or not.

Let me think about that.

Define a function that, given the current position and the maximum value so far, decides whether to split the current number or not.

But I need to consider that splitting a number into digits can affect the maximum value.

Wait, perhaps I can consider all possible splits and see if any of them lead to a sorted array.

But that still seems exponential.

Is there a better way?

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I can consider the array after all possible splits and see if it can be sorted.

But I need to consider that splitting a number into digits inserts those digits in place, maintaining the order.

So, the array's length can increase, but the relative order of the elements is preserved except for the split positions.

Wait, maybe I can think of the array as a sequence of digits, where some digits are grouped together as numbers >=10.

Then, splitting is just separating those grouped digits.

So, the array can be seen as a sequence of digits, some of which are combined into numbers >=10.

Then, the operation is to split those combined digits back into individual digits.

So, the question is whether, by choosing which combined digits to split, I can make the sequence of digits sorted.

This seems similar to sorting a sequence where some elements can be broken down into smaller parts.

I need to find a way to decide which elements to split to achieve a sorted sequence.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I split all numbers >=10 into their digits. Then, I have an array of single digits.

If I sort this array of digits, it will be sorted in non-descending order.

But the problem is not to sort the array after splitting all numbers, but to see if there's a way to split some numbers such that the resulting array (with the digits inserted in place) is sorted.

Wait, but in the operation, I can choose which numbers to split and which to keep as is.

So, I need to choose for each number >=10 whether to split it or keep it, and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as building a sequence where each position can contribute either its own value (if <10) or its digits (if >=10), and I need to choose which to use to make the sequence sorted.

This sounds like a decision problem.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that, at each position, decides whether to split the number or not, and checks if the sequence remains sorted up to that point.

If I can reach the end of the array while maintaining the sorted order, then it's possible.

Given that n is up to 50, and each element can be either split or not (if >=10), the total number of possibilities could be manageable.

But, to optimize, I need to think about memoization or dynamic programming.

Define a state where I keep track of the current position and the previous value in the sequence.

If the previous value is less than or equal to the current value, I can proceed; otherwise, it's not possible.

But I need to consider that splitting a number can insert multiple digits, which may affect the sequence.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think about the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

This is not sorted because 2 > 3.

But if I split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

This is sorted: 1 <= 2 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 67.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Sample Input 2:

3

12 28 5

Splitting 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

Not sorted.

Splitting 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

Not sorted.

Splitting 5: no effect.

No combination seems to be sorted.

Sample Input 3:

2

0 0

Already sorted.

So, in the first sample, splitting both 12 and 45 leads to a sorted array.

In the second sample, no matter what I do, I can't get a sorted array.

In the third sample, it's already sorted.

So, the operation allows me to break down numbers >=10 into their digits, and I need to see if, by doing so for some numbers, the array becomes sorted.

Now, to implement this, perhaps I can consider all possible splits and check if any of them result in a sorted array.

But, as mentioned earlier, this could be exponential in time.

Is there a smarter way?

Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal possible sequence by always splitting numbers >=10 into their digits and see if that sequence is sorted.

But that might not be sufficient because sometimes not splitting a number could lead to a sorted array.

For example, in the third sample, [0, 0], it's already sorted without splitting.

So, I need to consider both options for each number >=10: split or not split.

Then, check if any of these combinations result in a sorted array.

But again, this seems exponential.

Is there a way to avoid checking all combinations?

Let me think about constraints.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each number can be up to 99, it's crucial to find an efficient solution.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where each position can insert either the number itself (if <10) or its digits (if >=10), and I need to choose which to insert to make the sequence sorted.

Then, I can iterate through the array, keeping track of the previous value, and decide for each position whether to split or not, based on the previous value.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach.

Define a function dp(i, prev), where i is the current position, and prev is the previous value in the sequence.

- If i == n, then the sequence is sorted.

- If a[i] <10, then I must take it as is, and check if a[i] >= prev.

- If a[i] >=10, I have two choices:

  - Split it into digits and insert them one by one, checking if each digit >= prev.

  - Keep it as is, and check if a[i] >= prev.

- Recurse for each choice and see if any leads to a sorted sequence.

But this could still be slow for n=50, as the number of states could be large.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and greedily choose to split numbers when necessary to maintain the sorted order.

But I need to ensure that splitting doesn't disrupt the order elsewhere.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that splitting a number always results in digits that are smaller than or equal to the number itself.

So, splitting a number can only help in making the sequence sorted if the digits are in the correct order.

But I need to consider the relative ordering with respect to previous and next elements.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should consider preprocessing the array by splitting all numbers >=10 into their digits and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.

But in some cases, splitting all numbers might not be necessary or optimal.

Looking back at the first sample input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- Splitting 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

- Then, splitting 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

This is sorted.

So, in this case, splitting both numbers leads to a sorted array.

But perhaps there's a way to not split one of them and still have a sorted array.

In the second sample input: [12, 28, 5]

- Splitting 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

Not sorted.

- Splitting 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

Not sorted.

- Splitting 5: no change.

No combination is sorted.

In the third sample input: [0, 0]

Already sorted.

So, in general, I need to check all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting for each number >=10 and see if any of them result in a sorted array.

Given that n is up to 50, and each number can be either split or not, this could be 2^50 possibilities, which is too large.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the array, and edges represent the possible values that can be inserted at that position, considering whether to split or not.

Then, I can traverse this graph, keeping track of the previous value, and see if there's a path where the values are always non-decreasing.

But implementing this seems complex.

Is there a better way?

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the possible sequences that can be generated by splitting some numbers.

Each number >=10 can be represented as:

- itself, or

- its digits.

So, for each such number, I have a choice: keep it as is or split it into digits.

Then, the sequence is built by inserting either the number itself or its digits in order.

I need to check if there's any such sequence that is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the possible previous values, considering the choices for each position.

This sounds like maintaining a set of possible previous values.

For example, starting with an empty sequence, the previous value is negative infinity.

Then, for each position, depending on whether the number is <10 or >=10, and the choice to split or not, update the possible previous values.

This way, I can keep track of the possible previous values that allow the sequence to remain sorted.

If, at the end, there's at least one possible sequence, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a set containing a single value: -1 (to represent no previous element).

Then, for each element in the array:

- If the element is <10:

- It must be >= all previous values in the set.

- Update the set to include this element.

- If the element is >=10:

- Option 1: keep it as is. In this case, it must be >= all previous values in the set.

  - If so, add it to a new set.

- Option 2: split it into its digits. Each digit must be >= all previous values in the set.

  - If so, add all digits to a new set.

- Update the set to be the union of the new sets from both options.

At each step, if the set is empty, then it's impossible to maintain a sorted sequence.

Otherwise, continue.

At the end, if the set is not empty, then it's possible.

This seems correct.

Let's test it with the first sample input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

Initialize set: {-1}

Process 12 (>=10):

- Option 1: keep 12. 12 >= -1, so add 12 to new set.

- Option 2: split into 1 and 2. 1 >= -1 and 2 >= -1, so add 1 and 2 to new set.

- Update set: {1, 2, 12}

Process 3 (<10):

- Must be >= all in set.

- 3 >=1, 3>=2, 3>=12 is false.

- So, only 3 >=1 and 3>=2, but not 3>=12.

- Therefore, cannot keep 12 from previous set.

- So, set becomes {3}

Process 45 (>=10):

- Option 1: keep 45. 45 >=3, so add 45 to new set.

- Option 2: split into 4 and 5. 4>=3 and 5>=3, so add 4 and 5 to new set.

- Update set: {4,5,45}

Process 67 (>=10):

- Option 1: keep 67. 67 >=4, 67>=5, 67>=45.

  - 67 >=4, 67>=5, 67>=45 are all true.

  - Add 67 to new set.

- Option 2: split into 6 and 7. 6>=4, 6>=5 (false), 6>=45 (false).

  - Since 6 <5 and 6<45, this option is invalid.

- So, only 67 can be added to the new set.

- Update set: {67}

At the end, set is {67}, which is not empty, so it's possible.

This matches the first sample input's expected output of YES.

Let's try the second sample input: [12,28,5]

Initialize set: {-1}

Process 12 (>=10):

- Option 1: keep 12. 12 >= -1, add 12.

- Option 2: split into 1 and 2. 1 >= -1 and 2 >= -1, add 1 and 2.

- Set: {1,2,12}

Process 28 (>=10):

- Option 1: keep 28.

  - 28 >=1, 28>=2, 28>=12.

  - All true, add 28.

- Option 2: split into 2 and 8.

  - 2 >=1, 2>=2, 2>=12 (false).

  - So, cannot add 2 and 8.

- Set: {28}

Process 5 (<10):

- Must be >= all in set.

- 5 >=28 is false.

- So, cannot add 5.

- Set becomes empty.

Since the set is empty after processing all elements, it's impossible to have a sorted sequence.

This matches the second sample input's expected output of NO.

Third sample input: [0,0]

Initialize set: {-1}

Process 0 (<10):

- 0 >= -1, add 0.

- Set: {0}

Process 0 (<10):

- 0 >=0, add 0.

- Set: {0}

At the end, set is {0}, which is not empty, so it's possible.

This matches the third sample input's expected output of YES.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to keep track of the possible previous values.

Given that n is up to 50, and each a_i is up to 99, the sets shouldn't grow too large.

Implementing this in code should be manageable.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given Program:

m = int(input())

b = []

for i in range(m):

    func_1()

for i in range(m):

    if b[i] == 1:

        print('YES')

    else:

        print('NO')

def func_1():

    k = int(input())

    a = input()

    a = list(map(int, a.split()))

    x = 0

    y = 0

    n = 0

    c = []

    for i in range(len(a)):

        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:

            x = int(a[i] % 10)

            y = int(a[i] / 10)

            if y >= c[n - 1]:

                if y <= x:

                    c.append(y)

                    c.append(x)

                    n = n + 2

                else:

                    c.append(a[i])

                    n = n + 1

        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:

            x = int(a[i] % 10)

            y = int(a[i] / 10)

            if y <= x:

                c.append(y)

                c.append(x)

                n = n + 2

            else:

                c.append(a[i])

                n = n + 1

        else:

            c.append(a[i])

            n = n + 1

    d = sorted(c)

    if c == d:

        b.append(1)

    else:

        b.append(0)

So, this program defines a function func_1() that seems to process each test case.

It reads k (which is n, the number of elements in the array), then reads the array a.

Then, it processes the array a element by element.

For each element:

- If it's >10 and i >0:

- It splits the number into its digits x and y.

- If y >= the last element in c, and y <=x, it appends y and x to c.

- Else, it appends the original number a[i].

- If i ==0 and a[i] >10:

- Splits into x and y.

- If y <=x, appends y and x to c.

- Else, appends a[i].

- If the element is <10, appends it to c.

Then, it sorts c and checks if c is equal to the sorted version of c.

If they are equal, it appends 1 to b, else 0.

Finally, after processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in b.

Now, analyzing this logic:

- It seems to be trying to split numbers >10 into their digits under certain conditions.

- However, the conditions seem arbitrary and not aligned with the actual requirements.

- Specifically, it checks if y >= the last element in c before appending y and x.

- Also, it only splits if y <=x, which may not always be the correct condition.

- Finally, it checks if the resulting array c is sorted.

This seems flawed because:

1. The conditions for splitting are not based on maintaining a sorted sequence.

2. It doesn't consider all possible ways to split the numbers.

3. It only splits numbers >10 if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit, which is not relevant to sorting the array.

4. It doesn't maintain a set of possible previous values; it just builds one array c based on some conditions.

Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

A correct approach, as I thought earlier, would be to consider all possible choices for splitting or not splitting numbers >10 and check if any of those choices lead to a sorted array.

To implement this efficiently, I can use a dynamic programming approach where I keep track of the maximum value seen so far and decide for each element whether to split it or not, based on whether the resulting values are >= the maximum value so far.

Here's a sketch of how I would implement the correct solution:

def can_be_sorted(a):

    n = len(a)

    # Initialize a set with -1 to represent no previous element

    prev = {-1}

    for num in a:

        new_prev = set()

        if num < 10:

            # Must be >= all previous values

            for p in prev:

                if num >= p:

                    new_prev.add(num)

        else:

            # Option 1: keep the number as is

            for p in prev:

                if num >= p:

                    new_prev.add(num)

            # Option 2: split the number into digits

            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]

            # Check if all digits are >= the previous value

            valid = True

            current_prev = p

            for digit in digits:

                if digit < current_prev:

                    valid = False

                    break

                current_prev = digit

            if valid:

                for digit in digits:

                    new_prev.add(digit)

        if not new_prev:

            return False

        prev = new_prev

    return True

# Read number of test cases

t = int(input())

# For each test case

for _ in range(t):

    n = int(input())

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if can_be_sorted(a):

        print('YES')

    else:

        print('NO')

This implementation maintains a set of possible previous values and updates it for each element in the array, considering both options: keeping the number as is or splitting it into digits.

This should correctly determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted by performing the allowed operations.

Given that, the provided program is incorrect because it doesn't correctly model the problem and doesn't consider all possible ways to split the numbers to achieve a sorted array.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make a given array sorted in non-descending order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows us to delete any element that is at least 10 and insert its digits in the same position.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We can choose to split numbers >=10 into their individual digits.
   - We need to check if, after any number of splits, the array can be sorted in non-descending order.

2. **Insight**:
   - For each element, we have a choice: keep it as is (if it's <10 or >=10) or split it into its digits (if it's >=10).
   - We need to maintain a set of possible previous values to ensure the array remains sorted at each step.

3. **Dynamic Programming Set**:
   - Use a set to track possible previous values.
   - For each element, consider whether to split it or keep it based on the previous values.
   - Update the set of previous values accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-digit numbers are already in sorted form if they are equal or greater than the previous element.
   - Two-digit numbers need to be split appropriately to maintain or achieve the sorted order.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    n = len(a)
    # Initialize a set with -1 to represent no previous element
    prev = {-1}
    for num in a:
        new_prev = set()
        if num < 10:
            # Must be >= all previous values
            for p in prev:
                if num >= p:
                    new_prev.add(num)
        else:
            # Option 1: keep the number as is
            for p in prev:
                if num >= p:
                    new_prev.add(num)
            # Option 2: split the number into digits
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            # Check if all digits are >= the previous value
            for p in prev:
                current_prev = p
                valid = True
                for digit in digits:
                    if digit < current_prev:
                        valid = False
                        break
                    current_prev = digit
                if valid:
                    # Add the last digit to the new_prev set
                    new_prev.add(digits[-1])
        if not new_prev:
            return False
        prev = new_prev
    return True

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
# For each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We maintain a set `prev` to track possible values of the previous element in the array. Initially, it contains `-1` to handle the first element.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If it is less than 10, it must be greater than or equal to all previous values in `prev`. If so, add it to `new_prev`.
     - If it is greater than or equal to 10:
       - Option 1: Keep the number as is. Add it to `new_prev` if it is >= all previous values.
       - Option 2: Split the number into its digits. Check if the digits can be placed in order without breaking the sorted sequence. If valid, add the last digit to `new_prev`.

3. **Update Previous Set**:
   - Update `prev` with `new_prev` for the next iteration.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If at any point `new_prev` is empty, it means no valid choice can be made, and we return `False`.
   - If we process all elements successfully, return `True`.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible ways to split numbers to achieve a sorted array efficiently.
