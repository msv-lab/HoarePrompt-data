Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in this array is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. There are multiple test cases, up to 1000 of them.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, empty subsequences are considered increasing.

So, for a given array, how do I calculate the number of increasing subsequences? I think about it: for each possible non-empty subset of the array, check if it's strictly increasing. But with X up to 10^18, that's not practical to compute directly.

I need a smarter way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me determine the number of increasing subsequences based on the structure of the array.

Let me think about simple cases. If the array is empty, there's only one subsequence: the empty one. But the problem considers empty subsequences as increasing, but according to the problem, X starts from 2, so an empty array isn't useful here.

For an array of length 1, say [a], the subsequences are empty and [a]. So, two increasing subsequences: empty and the single element itself, which is always increasing. So, for a single element, the number of increasing subsequences is 2.

For two elements, say [a, b], if a < b, then the increasing subsequences are: empty, [a], [b], and [a, b]. So, 4 in total. If a >= b, then only [a] and [b] are increasing, so 3 in total.

Wait, but according to the problem, even if a >= b, [a, b] is not increasing, so only [a], [b], and empty are increasing, so 3 in total.

So, for two elements:

- If a < b: 4 increasing subsequences.

- If a >= b: 3 increasing subsequences.

Hmm.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for X=2, the output is an array of length 1: [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0]. That makes sense.

For X=5, the output is an array of length 3: [0,1,0], which should have 5 increasing subsequences.

Let's verify that:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1 (since it's increasing)

- [0] (the second 0): 1

Total: 5.

Yes, that matches.

So, I need to find an array whose number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number, I need a way to construct such an array efficiently.

I need to find a pattern or a formula that relates the structure of the array to the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me consider arrays with a certain structure. Maybe arrays that are non-decreasing, or have some specific properties.

First, let's try to find a formula for the number of increasing subsequences in an array.

Let's denote the array as a = [a1, a2, ..., an].

For each non-empty subset of indices, I need to check if the corresponding subsequence is increasing.

But this seems too general. Maybe I can think recursively.

Let me consider dp[i], which is the number of increasing subsequences ending with a[i].

Then, dp[i] = sum over j < i and a[j] < a[i] of dp[j], plus 1 (for the subsequence [a[i]] itself).

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i.

This seems manageable, but with n up to 200 and X up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to construct the array.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of binary representations or something similar, given that X can be up to 10^18.

Wait a minute, 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18, so 60 bits should be enough to represent X.

But I need to relate this to the array.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have an array where all elements are distinct and sorted in increasing order. Then, every non-empty subset is an increasing subsequence. So, for an array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty one), but including the empty one, it's 2^n.

But the problem includes the empty subsequence as increasing, so for a sorted array of n distinct elements, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Wait, but in the problem, X starts from 2, which corresponds to n=1 in this case.

For n=1, 2^1 = 2, which matches.

For n=2, 2^2 = 4, which matches the earlier case where a < b.

But if a >= b, it's 3, which is not a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can construct arrays that are sorted and have distinct elements to get powers of 2, and then adjust with some elements that don't affect the increasing subsequences to get other values.

Wait, but if I have elements that are equal, they can still form different subsequences as long as their positions are different.

In the example, [0,1,0], which is not strictly increasing, has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, maybe I can think in terms of building the array to achieve the desired X.

Let me consider how the number of increasing subsequences changes when I add elements to the array.

Suppose I have an array of length n, and I add a new element at the end.

If this new element is larger than all existing elements, then it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, effectively doubling the number of increasing subsequences (including the empty one).

Wait, let's see:

If I have an array a of length n with S increasing subsequences, and I add a new element x that is larger than all elements in a, then the new array will have all the previous subsequences plus all the previous subsequences with x appended to them.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences becomes 2*S.

Similarly, if I add an element that is smaller than or equal to some elements, it might not double the number.

So, adding a large element doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

What if I add an element that is smaller than some elements?

Let me consider adding an element that is smaller than some existing elements.

Suppose I add an element y, where y is smaller than some elements in the array.

Then, the new subsequences that include y are:

- [y] itself.

- Any subsequence that starts with y and then continues with elements greater than y.

But since y is smaller than some existing elements, it can form new subsequences with those elements.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need a better approach.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I build the array step by step, deciding at each step whether to add a new element that is larger than all previous ones or smaller.

If I add a larger element, it doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

If I add a smaller element, it adds some new subsequences but doesn't double the total.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representations.

If I can double the number of increasing subsequences by adding a large element, then it's like multiplying by 2.

If I can add 1 by adding a small element.

Wait, that might be a way to represent X in binary.

For example, if X is 5, which is 101 in binary, maybe I can add elements in a way that corresponds to the binary digits.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I start with an empty array, which has 1 increasing subsequence (the empty one).

Then, if I add an element, say 0, now I have two subsequences: empty and [0].

So, 2.

If I add another element that is larger, say 1, then I can have:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

Total: 4, which is 2 * 2.

If I add another element that is larger, say 2, then:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [2]

- [0,1]

- [0,2]

- [1,2]

- [0,1,2]

Total: 8, which is 2 * 4.

So, each time I add a larger element, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

If I add a smaller element, say -1 after [0,1], then:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

- [-1]

- [0,-1]

- [1,-1]

- [0,1,-1]

But only the subsequences that are strictly increasing are considered.

So, [0,-1] is not increasing.

Similarly, [1,-1] and [0,1,-1] are not increasing.

So, the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

- [-1]

Total: 5, which matches the example.

So, adding a smaller element increased the number of increasing subsequences by 1.

Wait, in this case, from 4 to 5.

Similarly, if I add another smaller element, say -2:

- Empty: 1

- [-2]: 1

- [0]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [-2,0]: 1 (since -2 < 0)

- [-2,1]: 1 (since -2 < 1)

But [0,-2] is not increasing, [1,-2] is not increasing, and [0,1,-2] is not increasing.

So, total increasing subsequences: 1 (empty) + 1 ([0]) + 1 ([1]) + 1 ([0,1]) + 1 ([-2]) + 1 ([-2,0]) + 1 ([-2,1]) = 7.

So, from 5 to 7, an increase of 2.

Hmm, not exactly 1 each time.

Wait, maybe adding a smaller element increases the number of increasing subsequences by the number of elements that are larger than it.

In the previous step, with array [0,1,-1], and adding -2:

- New increasing subsequences: [-2], [-2,0], [-2,1].

So, an increase of 3.

Wait, but previously, from [0,1] to [0,1,-1], it was an increase of 1.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that adding a new smallest element adds as many new increasing subsequences as there are elements larger than it, plus one for the new single element subsequence.

In the case of [0,1,-1]:

- Adding -2, which is smaller than 0 and 1.

- New subsequences: [-2], [-2,0], [-2,1].

- So, an increase of 3.

In the previous step, from [0,1] to [0,1,-1]:

- Adding -1, which is smaller than 0 and 1.

- New subsequences: [-1], [-1,0], [-1,1].

- But [-1,0] and [-1,1] are increasing, so an increase of 3.

Wait, but in the example, it was 4 to 5, which is an increase of 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let's recount for [0,1,-1]:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [-1]: 1

Total: 5.

Wait, where did the [-1,0] and [-1,1] go?

Oh, I see, in the earlier count, I thought they were not increasing, but actually, if -1 < 0 and -1 < 1, then [-1,0] and [-1,1] are increasing.

So, total should be 5 subsequences, not 7.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, from [0,1], which has 4 increasing subsequences, adding -1 gives 5 increasing subsequences, an increase of 1.

Similarly, adding another element, say -2:

- New subsequences: [-2], [-2,0], [-2,1].

So, an increase of 3.

Wait, but in the previous step, it was an increase of 1.

This suggests that adding a smaller element doesn't always increase the number by 1.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I represent X in binary.

Each bit in the binary representation can correspond to adding a larger or smaller element.

Specifically, starting with an empty array:

- Add a small element: increases the number of increasing subsequences by 1.

- Add a large element: doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

By choosing the sequence of adding small or large elements, I can reach any X by its binary representation.

Wait, let's see.

For example, X=5, which is 101 in binary.

Starting with empty array: S=1.

- Add a large element: S=2*1=2.

- Add a small element: S=2 + 1=3.

- Add a large element: S=2*3=6.

But I need 5, not 6.

Hmm, doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the order matters.

Let me try:

- Start with empty array: S=1.

- Add a small element: S=1 + 1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

Yes, that works for X=5.

Similarly, for X=13, which is 1101 in binary.

- Start with empty array: S=1.

- Add a small element: S=1 + 1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

- Add a large element: S=2*5=10.

- Add a small element: S=10 + 1=11.

- Add a large element: S=2*11=22.

Wait, that's not reaching 13.

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, 13 is 1101 in binary, which is 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13.

So, perhaps I should think in terms of building X bit by bit, starting from the least significant bit.

Let me try:

- Start with empty array: S=1.

- If the least significant bit is 1, add a small element: S=S + 1.

- Otherwise, add a large element: S=2*S.

- Repeat for each bit.

For X=5 (101 in binary):

- Binary: 101

- Start with S=1.

- Least significant bit is 1: S=1 + 1=2.

- Next bit is 0: S=2*2=4.

- Next bit is 1: S=4 + 1=5.

Perfect.

For X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Binary: 1101

- Start with S=1.

- Least significant bit is 1: S=1 + 1=2.

- Next bit is 0: S=2*2=4.

- Next bit is 1: S=4 + 1=5.

- Next bit is 1: S=5 + 1=6.

Wait, but 6 is not 13.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps when the bit is 0, I should add a large element (double S), and when the bit is 1, I should add a small element (S = S + 1).

But in the previous example, for X=5 (101), it worked.

For X=13 (1101):

- Start with S=1.

- Least significant bit is 1: S=1 + 1=2.

- Next bit is 0: S=2*2=4.

- Next bit is 1: S=4 + 1=5.

- Next bit is 1: S=5 + 1=6.

But 6 !=13.

Hmm, not working.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the order.

Let me try starting from the most significant bit instead of the least significant bit.

For X=5 (101 in binary):

- Most significant bit is 1: add a large element, S=2*1=2.

- Next bit is 0: add a large element, S=2*2=4.

- Next bit is 1: add a small element, S=4 + 1=5.

Perfect.

For X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Most significant bit is 1: add a large element, S=2*1=2.

- Next bit is 1: add a small element, S=2 + 1=3.

- Next bit is 0: add a large element, S=2*3=6.

- Next bit is 1: add a small element, S=6 + 1=7.

Still, 7 !=13.

Not working.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, for each bit, if it's 1, I add a small element, and if it's 0, I add a large element.

Wait, but in the previous example, that didn't work.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence of elements where some are large (doubling the number of increasing subsequences) and some are small (adding one to the number of increasing subsequences).

I need to arrange them in such a way that the total number becomes X.

This seems similar to building X in binary, where each bit decides whether to add a small element or to double the number by adding a large element.

But clearly, my earlier attempts didn't give the correct X.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the positions where I add small elements carefully.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

Suppose X is represented as the sum of powers of 2.

Each time I add a large element, I double the number of increasing subsequences.

Each time I add a small element, I add 1 to the number of increasing subsequences.

So, if I have X in binary, each '1' bit represents adding a small element at that position.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the binary representation of X.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of subsets that are increasing.

If I can find a way to construct the array such that the number of increasing subsequences matches X, that would be ideal.

But this seems tricky.

Let me look at the example provided.

For X=5, the output is [0,1,0].

As we saw earlier, this has 5 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, for X=13, the output is [2,2,3,4,2].

I need to see how this array corresponds to X=13.

Let's calculate the number of increasing subsequences for [2,2,3,4,2].

Possible increasing subsequences:

- Empty: 1

- [2]: 1

- [2]: (the second 2): 1

- [3]: 1

- [4]: 1

- [2,3]: 1

- [2,4]: 1

- [2,3,4]: 1

- [2,4]: (from the first 2 and the last 2, but [2,2] is not increasing)

- [2,3]: (from the second 2 and 3)

- [2,4]: (from the second 2 and 4)

- [2,3,4]: (from the second 2,3,4)

Wait, but [2,2,3,4] is not increasing, so it's invalid.

So, total increasing subsequences:

- Empty: 1

- Single elements: 4 (each [2], [2], [3], [4])

- Pairs: [2,3], [2,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]

- Triplets: [2,3,4], [2,3,4]

But need to consider uniqueness based on positions.

Wait, in the array [2,2,3,4,2], the positions are different, so even if the values are the same, they are considered different elements.

So, let's list all possible increasing subsequences:

1. Empty

2. [a1=2]

3. [a2=2]

4. [a3=3]

5. [a4=4]

6. [a5=2]

7. [a1=2, a3=3]

8. [a1=2, a4=4]

9. [a2=2, a3=3]

10. [a2=2, a4=4]

11. [a3=3, a4=4]

12. [a1=2, a3=3, a4=4]

13. [a2=2, a3=3, a4=4]

Total: 13.

Yes, that matches.

So, in this construction, by choosing specific values, I can achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need a way to construct such arrays based on the value of X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, and the array can have at most 200 elements, I need an efficient way.

Let me consider building the array by deciding for each bit in X whether to add a small or large element.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation again, but more carefully.

Let me consider that each time I add a large element, it doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Each time I add a small element, it adds 1 to the number of increasing subsequences.

So, if I represent X in binary, each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to adding a small element at that position.

Wait, but earlier attempts didn't give the correct X.

Let me try again with X=13 (1101 in binary).

Start with S=1 (empty array).

- Add a large element (double S): S=2.

- Add a small element (S +=1): S=3.

- Add a large element (double S): S=6.

- Add a small element (S +=1): S=7.

But I need 13.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the order.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the binary representation of X, and decide the sequence of adding elements based on the bits.

Wait, maybe I should consider the binary representation of X and build the array accordingly.

Let me try to think recursively.

If X is 1, the empty array suffices, but X starts from 2, so X=1 is not considered.

For X=2, add one element, say [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=3, perhaps add a small element to the previous array.

Wait, adding a small element to [0] gives [0, small], which should increase the number of increasing subsequences by 1, from 2 to 3.

So, [0, -1], for example.

Let's check:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [-1]: 1

Total: 3.

Yes.

For X=4, I need to double the number of increasing subsequences by adding a large element.

So, add an element larger than 0 and -1, say 1.

So, [0, -1, 1].

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [-1]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [-1,1]: 1

Total: 6, which is more than 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps adding a large element doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, in this case, starting from [0, -1], which has 3 increasing subsequences, adding a large element should double it to 6, which matches what I have.

But I need X=4, which is not 6.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe adding a large element doubles the number of increasing subsequences, and adding a small element adds 1.

But in this case, to get X=4, I need to find a way to have exactly 4 increasing subsequences.

From [0, -1], which has 3, if I add an element equal to -1, say [0, -1, -1], then:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [-1]: 1 (from the first -1)

- [-1]: 1 (from the second -1)

- [0, -1]: 1 (from 0 and first -1)

- [0, -1]: 1 (from 0 and second -1)

Total: 6, which is still more than 4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to add elements in a specific order or choose specific values to control the number of increasing subsequences.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence of elements where some are equal, and some are increasing.

I need to count the number of increasing subsequences, considering that equal elements are considered different based on their positions.

This is similar to the concept of multiset subsets, but with positional uniqueness.

Wait, maybe I can model this problem using binary decisions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all i of the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i].

Where dp[i] is the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i], which is equal to the sum over j < i where a[j] < a[i] of dp[j], plus 1.

But computing this for each step is too time-consuming for large X.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a sequence of distinct elements that are sorted in increasing order, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array.

But in our problem, the array doesn't have to be sorted, and elements can be equal.

Wait, maybe I can build the array by deciding for each bit in X whether to add a large or small element.

Let me try to think in terms of building X in binary.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit, if it's 1, I add a small element, otherwise, I add a large element.

Wait, earlier attempts didn't give the correct result.

Let me try with X=13 (1101 in binary).

Start with empty array, S=1.

- Add a large element (X=1101, considering the most significant bit first):

- S = 2*1 = 2.

- Add a small element (next bit is 1):

- S = 2 + 1 = 3.

- Add a large element (next bit is 0):

- S = 2*3 = 6.

- Add a small element (last bit is 1):

- S = 6 + 1 = 7.

But I need 13.

This doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to add more elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that adding a small element adds more than 1 to S, depending on the existing elements.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the properties of the number of increasing subsequences.

Suppose I have an array where I have a group of equal elements, followed by another group of equal elements greater than the first group, and so on.

For example, [1,1,1,2,2,3].

In this case, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated based on the combinations of choosing elements from each group.

But this seems complicated to generalize.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty subsets that are strictly increasing.

Given that, and given that X can be up to 10^18, I need a way to represent X as such a count.

Wait, maybe I can consider the array as a sequence of elements where some are increasing and some are not, and find a way to combine them to reach X.

This is still too vague.

Let me look back at the examples provided in the problem.

For X=2: [0]

- Subsequences: empty, [0] → 2.

For X=5: [0,1,0]

- Subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1], [-1] → 5.

Wait, in this case, [0,1,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty: 1

- [0]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [0]: (second 0): 1

Total: 5.

Similarly, for X=13: [2,2,3,4,2]

- Subsequences: empty, each single element, pairs, triplets, etc., totaling 13.

Given that, perhaps I can construct the array by starting with a base array that has a certain number of increasing subsequences and then adjust it by adding elements to reach the desired X.

But this seems too vague to implement efficiently.

Let me consider that for any X, I can represent it as a sum of powers of 2, since it's binary representation.

Each power of 2 corresponds to adding a large element (doubling the number of increasing subsequences), and adding a small element corresponds to adding 1.

Wait, but earlier attempts didn't give the correct X.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the order in which I add elements.

Let me try building X=13 step by step.

Start with empty array: S=1.

- Add a small element: S=1 + 1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

- Add a large element: S=5*2=10.

- Add a small element: S=10 + 1=11.

- Add a large element: S=11*2=22.

This is exceeding 13.

Wait, maybe I need to add small elements in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a sequence of operations (add large or add small) that results in X.

This seems similar to building X in binary, where each bit decides whether to add a small element or to double the number by adding a large element.

But in this approach, for X=13 (1101 in binary), starting from the most significant bit:

- Add a large element: S=2*1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

- Add a large element: S=5*2=10.

- Add a small element: S=10 + 1=11.

- Add a large element: S=11*2=22.

Still not reaching 13.

Wait, perhaps I need to stop when S >= X and adjust accordingly.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence of elements where I can control whether they are increasing or not, to control the number of increasing subsequences.

For example, if I have a sequence where some elements are equal, and some are increasing, I can have multiple subsequences that are increasing.

But I need a systematic way to construct the array based on X.

Given the time constraints, I need an O(log X) time solution, since X can be up to 10^18.

This suggests that the length of the array should be proportional to log X, which is reasonable since the maximum length is 200.

Wait, log2(10^18) is about 60, so 200 is more than enough.

So, perhaps I can represent X in binary and build the array accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me consider that:

- Adding a large element (larger than all previous elements) doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

- Adding a small element (smaller than at least one previous element) adds 1 to the number of increasing subsequences.

Then, starting from S=1 (empty array), I can build up to any X by choosing to add large or small elements accordingly.

Wait, but as seen earlier, this doesn't directly correspond to the binary representation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a binary tree, where each addition corresponds to a branch.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Suppose I fix the length of the array to be n, and try to find the minimal and maximal number of increasing subsequences possible.

For n=1: min=2, max=2.

For n=2: min=3 (if a >= b), max=4 (if a < b).

For n=3: min=4 (if all equal), max=8 (if strictly increasing).

Wait, for n=3:

- All equal: empty, [a], [b], [c] → 4.

- Two equal, one different: empty, [a], [b], [c], [a,c] (if a < c) → more than 4.

- Strictly increasing: empty plus all subsets → 8.

So, the range is from 4 to 8 for n=3.

But this doesn't directly help.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of increasing subsequences being equal to the number of bit strings of length up to n, but that seems too vague.

Let me consider that for any array, the number of increasing subsequences is at least n+1 (for n elements, including the empty subsequence and all single-element subsequences), and at most 2^n (if the array is strictly increasing).

Given that, for X between n+1 and 2^n, I need to find an array that achieves exactly X increasing subsequences.

But this still doesn't give me a direct way to construct such an array.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where I can control the number of increasing subsequences by choosing the values appropriately.

For example, if I have a sequence that is partially increasing and partially not, I can have a certain number of increasing subsequences.

But I need a systematic way to achieve any X.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, preferably O(t log X), since t can be up to 1000 and X up to 10^18.

This suggests that for each test case, I need to process it in logarithmic time relative to X.

Given that, perhaps I can represent X in binary and build the array accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding a large element doubles the number of increasing subsequences, and adding a small element adds 1.

Then, starting from S=1 (empty array), I can represent X in binary and decide to add large or small elements accordingly.

For example, for X=5 (101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add a small element: S=1 + 1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

Perfect.

Similarly, for X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add a small element: S=1 + 1=2.

- Add a large element: S=2*2=4.

- Add a small element: S=4 + 1=5.

- Add a large element: S=5*2=10.

- Add a small element: S=10 + 1=11.

- Add a large element: S=11*2=22.

This doesn't reach 13.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence based on the binary representation from the most significant bit.

Let me try starting from the most significant bit.

For X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add a large element: S=2*1=2.

- Add a small element: S=2 + 1=3.

- Add a large element: S=3*2=6.

- Add a small element: S=6 + 1=7.

Still not 13.

Hmm.

Perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that adding a small element adds more than 1 to S, depending on the existing elements.

For example, if I add a small element that is smaller than k existing elements, it adds k+1 new increasing subsequences: the new element itself, and the new subsequences formed by appending it to all increasing subsequences that end with elements larger than it.

Wait, this seems complicated to manage manually.

Let me consider that in the array, each time I add a new element, the number of new increasing subsequences is equal to the number of elements before it that are smaller than it, plus one (the new single element subsequence).

So, if I add an element smaller than m previous elements, the number of new increasing subsequences is m + 1.

Therefore, to increase S by a specific amount, I need to choose an element such that m + 1 equals that amount.

Wait, but m can be at most the number of elements before it, so for an array of length n, m <= n.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is much larger than n=200.

So, this approach seems insufficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where I have k groups of equal elements, each group having a different value, and the groups are sorted in increasing order.

For example, [1,1,2,2,3,3].

In this case, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated based on the combinations of choosing elements from each group.

But I'm not sure how to generalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

But that seems too time-consuming.

Given the time constraints, I need a more direct approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of increasing subsequences for an array of length n is n+1 (empty and single elements), and the maximal is 2^n (strictly increasing array).

Given that, for X between n+1 and 2^n, I need to find an array of length at most 200 that achieves exactly X increasing subsequences.

Given that 2^200 is way larger than 10^18, it's certainly possible for most X.

But I need a systematic way to construct such an array.

Given the earlier attempts, perhaps the approach of representing X in binary and deciding to add large or small elements accordingly can be made to work.

Let me try to formalize this approach.

Let me define:

- Adding a large element: double the number of increasing subsequences.

- Adding a small element: add 1 to the number of increasing subsequences.

Then, starting from S=1 (empty array), I can represent X in binary and for each bit, if it's 1, add a small element and then a large element; if it's 0, just add a large element.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have X, and I want to build the array accordingly.

- If X is even, then I can add a large element, and the number of increasing subsequences will double.

- If X is odd, then I can add a small element, and the number of increasing subsequences will increase by 1.

Then, I can proceed recursively until X becomes 0.

Wait, but X starts from 2 and goes up to 10^18.

Let me try this approach with X=5.

- X=5 (odd): add a small element, S=1 + 1=2.

- X=5 // 2 = 2.

- X=2 (even): add a large element, S=2 * 2=4.

- X=2 // 2 =1.

- X=1 (odd): add a small element, S=4 + 1=5.

- X=1 // 2 =0.

So, total steps: small, large, small.

Which corresponds to adding three elements.

But in the example, for X=5, the array has three elements: [
