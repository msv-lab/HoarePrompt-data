Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any number that is two digits or more, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original number. This can be done any number of times.

So, the question is whether, by splitting some of the numbers into their digits, I can arrange the array so that it's sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about what this means. If I have a number that's larger than the next number, I might need to split it to make it smaller. For example, in [12, 3, 45, 67], 12 is larger than 3, which is next to it, so I might need to split 12 into [1, 2] to make the sequence [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5], 12 is less than 28, which is good, but 28 is greater than 5, which is not good. So, I might need to split 28 into [2, 8], making the array [12, 2, 8, 5]. Now, 12 is greater than 2, which is not good, so maybe I need to split 12 into [1, 2] as well, resulting in [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is still not sorted because 8 is greater than 5. It seems like no matter what I do, I can't make this array sorted.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no operation is needed.

From these examples, it seems like the operation allows me to break down numbers into their constituent digits, which can then be rearranged to form a sorted array.

Now, I need to think about how to approach this problem systematically. I need a way to determine if it's possible to split some of the numbers in such a way that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

One way to think about this is to consider the array as a sequence of digits, rather than integers. For example, in the first example, [12, 3, 45, 67], if I split 12 into [1, 2], and leave the rest as is, I get [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5], if I split 12 into [1, 2], and split 28 into [2, 8], I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted because 8 > 5.

Wait a minute, maybe there's another way to split the numbers. Perhaps I need to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and check if any of those ways result in a sorted array.

But that sounds computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 50, and each a_i can be up to 99, meaning that splitting a number into digits only makes sense if it helps in sorting.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let's consider that splitting a number into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the number itself, which is often the case, but not always. For example, splitting 10 into [1, 0] might not always help, but in some cases, it might be necessary.

I need to find a way to check if the array can be sorted by splitting some numbers into their digits.

One idea is to iterate through the array and ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next element. If not, check if splitting the current element or the next element can make the sequence sorted.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of the digits.

Let me consider that each number in the array can be represented as a sequence of digits, and I can choose to either keep the number as is or split it into its digits.

So, for each number, I have two choices: keep it as is or split it into digits.

Then, I need to arrange these choices in such a way that the resulting sequence is sorted.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I make choices at each step and keep track of whether the sequence up to that point is sorted.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me think about the constraints. n can be up to 50, and a_i can be up to 99, which means that splitting a number into digits will result in either one or two digits.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each operation can increase the length of the array by at most one (since splitting a two-digit number into digits increases the array length by one), the total length after all possible operations can be up to around 100 elements.

This seems manageable.

But I need to find a way to determine if there's a sequence of operations that leads to a sorted array.

Another approach is to consider the array as a whole and see if, by splitting some numbers, I can arrange the digits in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but it's not just about arranging digits; I have to respect the original positions of the numbers and how splitting affects the sequence.

This is getting a bit complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The function func() seems to handle multiple test cases, as it reads t (the number of test cases), and then for each test case, it reads n (the number of elements in the array) and the array itself.

Then, it initializes a variable ans to True, which will be set to False if it's determined that the array cannot be sorted via the operations.

It then loops from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous one.

If it is, it seems to consider splitting the previous element into its digits and checks if those digits, combined with the current element, are sorted.

Specifically, it creates a list nums by converting the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to it.

Then, it checks if nums is equal to its sorted version.

If not, it sets ans to False and breaks out of the loop.

Otherwise, it updates the previous element to be the first digit of the split previous element.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if ans is True, otherwise 'NO'.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand this logic.

It starts from the end of the array and checks if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one.

If not, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and checks if the digits, followed by the current element, are sorted.

If they are, it replaces the previous element with the first digit and continues.

If not, it concludes that it's impossible to sort the array.

This seems like a greedy approach, making local decisions to achieve a global goal.

But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

First test case:

4

12 3 45 67

So, n=4, arr=[12,3,45,67]

It starts from i=3 (arr[3]=67), checks if 67 >= 45? Yes, moves to i=2.

At i=2, arr[2]=45 >= arr[1]=3? 45 >= 3, yes, moves to i=1.

At i=1, arr[1]=3 >= arr[0]=12? 3 >= 12? No.

So, it takes arr[0]=12, splits it into [1,2], and checks if [1,2,3,45,67] is sorted.

Wait, but in the code, it's doing something different.

In the code, it creates nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i-1])] + [arr[i]]

So, arr[i-1]=12, str(12)=['1','2'], so nums=[1,2,3]

Then, it checks if nums == sorted(nums), which is [1,2,3] == [1,2,3], yes.

Then, it sets arr[i-1]=nums[0]=1.

So, the array becomes [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Hence, ans remains True, and it prints 'YES'.

This seems correct for the first test case.

Second test case:

3

12 28 5

n=3, arr=[12,28,5]

Start from i=2, arr[2]=5 >= arr[1]=28? 5 >= 28? No.

So, split arr[1]=28 into [2,8], nums=[2,8,5]

Check if [2,8,5] == sorted([2,8,5]), which is [2,5,8]. No, so ans=False, print 'NO'.

This matches the expected output.

Third test case:

2

0 0

n=2, arr=[0,0]

Check if 0 >= 0, yes. Move to i=1, no more elements, ans=True, print 'YES'.

Good.

Seems like the code is working correctly for the provided examples.

But I need to think if this logic is universally correct.

Let me think of some edge cases.

Edge case 1: All elements are single-digit numbers.

For example:

n=3

arr=[1,2,3]

Already sorted, so ans=True.

If I apply the logic, it will check from the end:

i=2: 3 >= 2, yes.

i=1: 2 >=1, yes.

So, ans=True, correct.

Edge case 2: All elements are two-digit numbers and need to be split to sort.

For example:

n=3

arr=[23,12,34]

Check i=2: 34 >=12? No.

Split 12 into [1,2], nums=[1,2,34], which is sorted.

Set arr[i-1]=1, so arr becomes [23,1,34].

Now, check i=1: 1 >=23? No.

Split 23 into [2,3], nums=[2,3,1], which is not sorted.

So, ans=False, which is correct because you can't sort this array by splitting.

Wait, but maybe there's another way.

If I split 23 into [2,3], and 12 into [1,2], I get [2,3,1,2,34], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if I only split 23, I get [2,3,12,34], which is not sorted.

If I only split 12, I get [23,1,2,34], which is not sorted.

If I split both, [2,3,1,2,34], still not sorted.

So, correctly, ans=False.

Another test case:

n=4

arr=[15,9,23,2]

Check i=3: 2 >=23? No.

Split 23 into [2,3], nums=[2,3,2], which is not sorted. So, ans=False.

But wait, maybe there's another way.

If I split 15 into [1,5], and 23 into [2,3], I get [1,5,9,2,3,2], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, split only 15 into [1,5], and leave 23 as is: [1,5,9,23,2], not sorted.

Split only 23 into [2,3]: [15,9,2,3,2], not sorted.

Split both: [1,5,9,2,3,2], not sorted.

Seems like no way to sort, so ans=False.

Another test case where it should return 'YES':

n=3

arr=[19,20,15]

Check i=2: 15 >=20? No.

Split 20 into [2,0], nums=[2,0,15], which is not sorted.

So, according to the code, ans=False.

But wait, maybe there's another way.

If I split 19 into [1,9], and 20 into [2,0], I get [1,9,2,0,15].

This is not sorted.

Alternatively, split only 19 into [1,9]: [1,9,20,15], not sorted.

Split only 20 into [2,0]: [19,2,0,15], not sorted.

Seems like no way to sort, so ans=False.

But perhaps there's a way I'm missing.

Wait, if I split both, [1,9,2,0,15], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if I split 19 into [1,9] and 15 into [1,5], I get [1,9,20,1,5], which is not sorted.

Seems like it's indeed impossible, so ans=False is correct.

Another test case:

n=2

arr=[10,1]

Check i=1:1 >=10? No.

Split 10 into [1,0], nums=[1,0,1], which is not sorted.

So, ans=False.

But if I split 10 into [1,0] and leave 1 as is, I get [1,0,1], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if I could split 1 into [1], but it's already a single digit.

Seems like no way to sort, so ans=False is correct.

Wait, but maybe if I split 10 into [1,0] and then consider the array [1,0,1], which is not sorted.

There doesn't seem to be a way to make it sorted, so ans=False is correct.

Another test case:

n=3

arr=[22,3,44]

Check i=2:44 >=3? No.

Split 3 into digits? But 3 is a single digit, can't split further.

So, according to the code, ans=False.

But wait, maybe I can split 22 into [2,2], and 44 into [4,4], but that would give [2,2,3,4,4], which is sorted.

But the code doesn't consider splitting the current element (44) or only splitting one of them.

Wait, according to the code, it only considers splitting the previous element (arr[i-1]) and appending arr[i], not splitting arr[i].

So, in this case, arr[i-1]=3, which is a single digit, can't be split.

So, it would set ans=False.

But actually, if I split 22 into [2,2], and leave 3 and 44 as is, I get [2,2,3,44], which is sorted.

So, in this case, the code would incorrectly return 'NO', but the correct answer should be 'YES'.

Wait, no, according to the logic, it starts from the end:

i=2: arr[2]=44 >= arr[1]=3? 44 >=3, yes, move to i=1.

i=1: arr[1]=3 >= arr[0]=22? 3 >=22? No.

Then, split arr[0]=22 into [2,2], nums=[2,2,3], which is sorted.

Set arr[i-1]=nums[0]=2.

So, arr becomes [2,2,3,44], which is sorted.

Hence, ans=True, 'YES'.

Wait, I think I misread the code initially.

Let me trace it again.

Given arr=[22,3,44]

Start from i=2: 44 >=3? No.

Wait, in the code, it loops from i=m-1 to 1, so m=3.

So, i=2: arr[2]=44 >= arr[1]=3? 44 >=3, yes, move to i=1.

i=1: arr[1]=3 >= arr[0]=22? 3 >=22? No.

Then, split arr[0]=22 into [2,2], nums=[2,2,3], which is sorted.

Set arr[i-1]=nums[0]=2.

So, arr becomes [2,2,3,44], which is sorted.

Hence, ans=True, 'YES'.

Got it, so it does consider splitting the previous element and checking if the sequence can be made sorted.

In this case, it correctly returns 'YES'.

Another test case:

n=3

arr=[23,12,34]

From earlier analysis, it should return 'NO', which is correct.

Seems like the code is correctly implementing the logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers as per the operation defined.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]

**Correctness:** **True**
