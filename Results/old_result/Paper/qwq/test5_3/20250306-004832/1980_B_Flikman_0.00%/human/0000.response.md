Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a certain value. Then, he arranges them in non-increasing order, meaning from largest to smallest. If there are ties, the order of those with the same value can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among those removed.

First, I need to understand what "non-increasing order" means. It means that the cubes are sorted such that the largest values come first, and if there are cubes with the same value, their order relative to each other is arbitrary.

So, the favorite cube could end up anywhere in the sorted list, depending on its value and the values of other cubes.

The task is to determine, based on the input values, whether the favorite cube will be removed (i.e., it is among the first k cubes after sorting), not removed (i.e., it is not among the first k cubes after sorting), or it could be either (MAYBE).

Given that the order of cubes with the same value is arbitrary, there might be scenarios where the favorite cube could be in the removed portion or not, depending on how the ties are broken.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to consider the value of the favorite cube and how many cubes have values greater than or equal to it.

Let's denote:

- favorite_value = a[f-1] (since f is 1-based index)

- count_greater = number of cubes with value > favorite_value

- count_equal = number of cubes with value == favorite_value

So, in the sorted list, the cubes with value > favorite_value will be before those with value == favorite_value.

Now, if count_greater >= k, then the first k cubes are all with values > favorite_value, so the favorite cube is not among them. So, it's not removed.

Wait, no. If count_greater >= k, that means there are at least k cubes with values greater than the favorite cube. So, the first k cubes are all these cubes with greater values, and the favorite cube is somewhere after them. So, it's not removed.

Wait, but in non-increasing order, the largest values are first. So, if there are at least k cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, then the favorite cube is not among the first k removed cubes.

Wait, but in the example given:

n=5, f=2, a=[4, 3, 3, 2, 3], k=2

favorite_value = 3

count_greater = 1 (only the first cube with value 4)

count_equal = 3 (three cubes with value 3)

So, count_greater (1) < k (2)

So, the first cube is 4, and the second cube is 3. Since k=2, he removes the first two cubes. The favorite cube, which is one of the 3's, could be in the first two or not, depending on how the equal values are ordered.

In one scenario, the sorted list could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], so the favorite cube is in position 2, which is removed.

In another scenario, it could be [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], so the favorite cube is in position 4, which is not removed.

Hence, it's MAYBE.

So, in general:

- If count_greater >= k: the favorite cube is not among the first k, so "NO"

- If count_greater + count_equal <= k: all cubes with value >= favorite_value are removed, so the favorite cube is removed, "YES"

- Else: it could be either, "MAYBE"

Wait, but in the first case, if count_greater >= k, then the first k cubes are all with values > favorite_value, so the favorite cube is not removed.

In the second case, if count_greater + count_equal <= k, that means the number of cubes with values >= favorite_value is less than or equal to k, so all of them are removed, including the favorite cube.

In the intermediate case, where count_greater < k < count_greater + count_equal, it means that some of the cubes with value == favorite_value are removed, and some are not, depending on their order.

Hence, the answer is "MAYBE" in this case.

Let me verify this logic with the example:

n=5, f=2, a=[4, 3, 3, 2, 3], k=2

favorite_value = 3

count_greater = 1 (only 4)

count_equal = 3 (three 3's)

Since count_greater (1) < k (2) < count_greater + count_equal (4), it's "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[4,2,1,3,5], k=3

favorite_value = 5

count_greater = 0 (no cube has value >5)

count_equal =1 (only one 5)

Since count_greater (0) < k (3) < count_greater + count_equal (1), but wait, 0 < 3 < 1 is not true because 3 is not less than 1. So, actually, count_greater + count_equal =1 <= k=3, so "YES"

Because all cubes with value >=5 (only one, the favorite cube) will be among the first k removed cubes.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[5,2,4,1,3], k=2

favorite_value=3

count_greater=2 (5 and 4)

count_equal=1 (only one 3)

Since count_greater=2 >=k=2, so "NO"

Because the first k=2 cubes are 5 and 4, favorite cube is not removed.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[1,2,5,4,3], k=5

favorite_value=3

count_greater=2 (5 and 4)

count_equal=1 (3)

count_greater + count_equal =3 <=k=5, so "YES"

Because all cubes with value >=3 (5,4,3) are among the first k=5 removed cubes.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[3,1,2,4,5], k=4

favorite_value=5

count_greater=0

count_equal=1

So, count_greater + count_equal =1 <=k=4, so "YES"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[4,3,2,1,5], k=5

favorite_value=5

count_greater=0

count_equal=1

count_greater + count_equal=1 <=k=5, so "YES"

Another example:

n=6, f=5, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], k=3

favorite_value=2

count_greater=2 (two 3's)

count_equal=2 (two 2's)

So, count_greater=2 < k=3 < count_greater + count_equal=4, so "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=10, f=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], k=1

favorite_value=1

count_greater=0

count_equal=10

count_greater + count_equal=10 <=k=1, no, wait:

k=1, count_greater=0, count_equal=10

Since count_greater=0 < k=1 < count_greater + count_equal=10, so "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=1, f=1, a=[42], k=1

favorite_value=42

count_greater=0

count_equal=1

count_greater + count_equal=1 <=k=1, so "YES"

Another example:

n=5, f=2, a=[2,2,1,1,2], k=3

favorite_value=2

count_greater=0

count_equal=4

So, count_greater=0 < k=3 < count_greater + count_equal=4, so "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=2, f=1, a=[2,1], k=1

favorite_value=2

count_greater=0

count_equal=1

So, count_greater=0 < k=1 < count_greater + count_equal=1, but wait, 0 <1 <1 is not true because 1 is not less than 1. So, count_greater + count_equal =1 <=k=1, so "YES"

Another example:

n=5, f=3, a=[3,3,2,3,2], k=1

favorite_value=2

count_greater=3 (three 3's)

count_equal=2 (two 2's)

So, count_greater=3 >=k=1, so "NO"

Because the first k=1 cube is one of the 3's, favorite cube is not removed.

Seems consistent.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read array a of n integers

- favorite_value = a[f-1]

- count_greater = number of a[i] > favorite_value

- count_equal = number of a[i] == favorite_value

- If count_greater >=k: print "NO"

- Elif count_greater + count_equal <=k: print "YES"

- Else: print "MAYBE"

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

favorite_value = a[f - 1]

same_value_count = 0

for value in a:

if value == favorite_value:

same_value_count += 1

greater_count = 0

for value in a:

if value > favorite_value:

greater_count += 1

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, in the code:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

But according to my earlier reasoning:

- If count_greater >= k: "NO"

- Elif count_greater + count_equal <= k: "YES"

- Else: "MAYBE"

So, the code has:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

But according to my reasoning, it should be "NO"

Similarly, in the example where count_greater >=k, it should be "NO", but the code is printing "YES"

That seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I confused myself.

Wait, in my earlier reasoning:

- If count_greater >=k: "NO" (favorite cube is not among the first k)

- Elif count_greater + count_equal <=k: "YES" (all cubes with value >= favorite are among the first k removed)

- Else: "MAYBE"

But in the code:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

So, this is opposite to what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial reasoning.

Let me double-check.

If count_greater >=k, that means there are at least k cubes with values greater than the favorite cube. So, the first k cubes are all these greater cubes, and the favorite cube is somewhere after them, so it's not removed. So, "NO"

If count_greater + count_equal <=k, that means the number of cubes with value >= favorite_value is less than or equal to k, so all of them are removed. So, "YES"

Else, it's "MAYBE"

So, in the code, if greater_count >=k: print('YES'), which according to my earlier reasoning should be "NO"

So, the code seems to have a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the code has a different logic.

Wait, maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.

The problem says: "the cube will be removed in all cases", "not removed in any case", or "may be either removed or left"

In the code:

if greater_count >=k: print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: print('NO')

else: print('MAYBE')

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

if greater_count >=k: print('NO')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: print('YES')

else: print('MAYBE')

So, the code has the first condition wrong.

Let me check with the example:

n=5, f=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], k=2

favorite_value=3

greater_count=1 (only 4)

same_value_count=3 (three 3's)

Since greater_count (1) < k (2), not in the first condition.

Then, greater_count + same_value_count=4 >k=2, so not in the second condition, so "MAYBE"

Which matches the example's output of "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, a=[4,2,1,3,5], k=3

favorite_value=5

greater_count=0

same_value_count=1

greater_count (0) < k (3), not in first condition.

greater_count + same_value_count=1 <=k=3, so "NO"

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "YES"

Wait, maybe I need to see the sample input and output to verify.

Looking back at the sample input and output provided in the problem statement, I see:

Input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

Let's take the first test case:

n=5, f=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], k=2

Output: MAYBE

According to my reasoning and the code, it's correct.

Second test case:

n=5, f=5, a=[4,2,1,3,5], k=3

Output: YES

According to the code, it would print "NO", which contradicts the sample output.

Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

Wait, let's think again.

If count_greater + count_equal <=k, then all cubes with value >= favorite_value are removed, so the favorite cube is removed, hence "YES"

If count_greater >=k, then none of the cubes with value >= favorite_value are removed, hence "NO"

Else, it's "MAYBE"

So, in the second test case:

n=5, f=5, a=[4,2,1,3,5], k=3

favorite_value=5

count_greater=0 (no cube >5)

count_equal=1 (only one 5)

count_greater + count_equal=1 <=k=3, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output of "YES"

Wait, but according to the code:

if greater_count >=k: print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: print('NO')

else: print('MAYBE')

So, in this case, greater_count=0 <k=3, so not in first condition.

greater_count + same_value_count=1 <=k=3, so print 'NO'

But the sample output is "YES", which contradicts the code's output.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correct logic should be:

if count_greater + count_equal <=k: print('YES')

elif count_greater >=k: print('NO')

else: print('MAYBE')

So, the conditions in the code are swapped.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
