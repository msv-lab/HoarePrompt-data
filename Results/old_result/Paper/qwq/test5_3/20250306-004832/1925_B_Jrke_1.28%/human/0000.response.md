Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Jay created a problem of difficulty x and wants to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash is worried that this might make the contest unbalanced, so he decides to break this problem into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of these difficulties should be equal to x.

Now, the coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of all the sub-problems. Yash wants to choose the difficulties of these sub-problems in such a way that this balance is maximized.

Okay, so I need to find the maximum possible GCD given x and n.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if all sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of some number d, then d is a possible GCD. The goal is to make d as large as possible.

Given that the sum of difficulties is x, and there are n sub-problems, each with difficulty at least 1 (since positive integers), I need to distribute x into n parts, each at least 1, such that their GCD is maximized.

Let me think about this.

First, a basic observation: the GCD of the sub-problems cannot be larger than the smallest sub-problem's difficulty. Because the GCD has to divide all the difficulties, including the smallest one.

Also, since the sum is x and there are n parts, the average difficulty per sub-problem is x/n. So, perhaps the optimal GCD is around x/n, but it has to divide x and be achievable with n parts.

Wait, no. The GCD has to divide x, because if all difficulties are multiples of d, then their sum x is also a multiple of d.

So, d must be a divisor of x.

Moreover, since there are n sub-problems, and each has difficulty at least 1, d cannot be larger than x/n. Because if d were larger than x/n, then even if all sub-problems had difficulty d, their sum would be n*d, which would be larger than x, which is not possible since the sum has to be exactly x.

Therefore, the maximum possible d is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to floor(x/n).

So, to maximize d, I should find the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Given that, the approach should be:

1. Compute floor(x/n), let's call it k.

2. Find the largest divisor of x that is <= k.

To implement this, I can:

- Find all divisors of x.

- Filter those divisors to keep only those that are <= k.

- Choose the maximum among these filtered divisors.

Now, finding all divisors of x can be inefficient if x is large, but since x can be up to 10^8, I need an efficient way to find the divisors.

I recall that the divisors of x come in pairs. For each divisor d <= sqrt(x), there is a corresponding divisor x/d >= sqrt(x). So, I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), find d and x/d, and collect all unique divisors.

Then, among these divisors, find the largest one that is <= k.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar, but perhaps not in the most straightforward way.

Let me look at the given code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(x, n) = map(int, input().split())

k = x // n

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

ans = 1

for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

if x % i == 0:

l = [ans]

if i <= k:

l.append(i)

if x // i <= k:

l.append(x // i)

ans = max(l)

print(ans)

So, it handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads x and n, computes k = x // n.

If k == 1, it directly prints 1.

Otherwise, it initializes ans = 1.

Then, it loops i from 1 or 2 (depending on x being even) up to sqrt(x), stepping by 2 each time.

For each i, if x % i == 0, it considers i and x/i as potential divisors, and if they are <= k, it includes them in the list l, and sets ans to the max of l.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, there are a few things here that seem off or unclear to me.

First, why does it special-case when k == 1?

Well, if k == 1, that means floor(x/n) == 1, so the largest possible d is 1, because d cannot be larger than k.

Hence, directly printing 1 makes sense in that case.

Next, in the loop, it starts from 1 plus something based on whether x is even, and steps by 2 each time.

This seems like an attempt to only check odd numbers, perhaps for efficiency.

But, if x is even, it starts from 2, otherwise from 1, and steps by 2.

Wait, no. Let's look closely:

range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2)

So, if x % 2 == 0, then 1 + 1 = 2, else 1 + 0 = 1.

So, it starts from 2 if x is even, and 1 if x is odd, and steps by 2.

The idea might be to skip even numbers when x is odd, since odd numbers don't have even divisors.

But, actually, if x is odd, its divisors are all odd, so starting from 1 and stepping by 2 is fine.

If x is even, its divisors can be even or odd, but starting from 2 and stepping by 2 would miss the divisor 1, which is odd.

Wait, that could be a problem.

Wait, no, because when x is even, starting from 2 and stepping by 2 will miss 1, but 1 is already included since it's a divisor of x, and it's <= k in most cases.

But, perhaps the code handles it correctly because it initializes ans = 1, so even if it misses 1 in the loop, it has ans = 1.

But, I need to verify if this approach correctly finds all divisors.

Wait, actually, when x is even, starting from 2 and stepping by 2 will miss 1, but since ans is initialized to 1, and 1 is always a divisor, it's included.

For x odd, starting from 1 and stepping by 2 is fine, as all divisors are odd.

So, that seems okay.

Now, within the loop, for each i where x % i == 0, it considers i and x/i as potential divisors.

It then checks if i <= k and x/i <= k, and includes them in list l if so.

Then, it sets ans to the max of l.

Wait, l starts with [ans], and appends i and/or x/i if they are <= k.

Then, ans is updated to the max of l.

So, effectively, ans keeps track of the largest divisor <= k found so far.

This seems correct.

But, I need to think about whether this loop covers all possible divisors.

For x even:

- Starts from 2, steps by 2: checks 2,4,6,... up to sqrt(x).

- For each i, checks if i divides x, and if so, considers i and x/i.

- Similarly, for x odd, starts from 1, steps by 2: 1,3,5,... up to sqrt(x).

This should cover all possible divisors, because for each i <= sqrt(x), if i divides x, then x/i is also a divisor.

Hence, all divisors are considered.

Moreover, by initializing ans = 1, and then updating it with larger divisors that are <= k, the final ans should be the largest divisor of x that is <= k.

Hence, this seems correct.

Let me verify with the example given.

Example 1:

x = 10, n = 3

k = x // n = 10 // 3 = 3

Find the largest divisor of 10 that is <= 3.

Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.

Among these, 1 and 2 are <= 3.

So, the largest is 2.

Hence, output should be 2.

As per the example, it's correct.

Example 2:

x = 5, n = 5

k = 5 // 5 = 1

Directly prints 1, which is correct.

Example 3:

x = 420, n = 69

k = 420 // 69 = 6

Find the largest divisor of 420 that is <= 6.

Divisors of 420: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,12,14,15,20,21,28,30,35,42,60,70,84,105,140,210,420.

Among these, divisors <= 6 are: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, the largest is 6.

Hence, output should be 6, which matches the example.

So, in these cases, it works correctly.

Let me think of some edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

x = 1, n = 1

k = 1 // 1 = 1

Divisors of 1: 1

1 <= 1, so ans = 1

Correct.

Edge Case 2:

x = 1, n = 1

Same as above.

Edge Case 3:

x = 1, n = 2

k = 1 // 2 = 0

But n=2, x=1, so k=0

But in the code, k = x // n = 0

But in the code, if k == 1:

print(1)

else:

# loop

But here, k=0, which is not 1, so it goes to the loop.

In the loop, it checks for divisors <=0, which doesn't make sense, since divisors are positive integers.

Hence, in this case, no divisors are <=0, so ans remains 1.

But is this correct?

Wait, is n=2, x=1 possible?

Yes, because n can be up to x, but in this case, n=2, x=1, so we need to split 1 into 2 sub-problems, each with difficulty at least 1.

But 1 + anything >=1 would be >=2, which is more than x=1.

Hence, it's impossible.

But in the problem statement, it says "valid inputs as described in the problem description."

Wait, the constraints are t >=1, x >=1, n >=1, n <=x.

Hence, n <=x, so n=2, x=1 is invalid because n > x.

Wait, no, the constraints say 1 <=n <=x.

Wait, in the problem description, it says "the difficulties of all the sub-problems are positive integers and their sum is equal to x."

Hence, n <=x, because each sub-problem has difficulty at least 1, so n*1 <=x.

Hence, n <=x.

Hence, n=2, x=1 is invalid.

But, assuming valid inputs, n <=x.

Hence, k = x//n >=1.

Wait, no, if x=1, n=1, k=1.

If x=2, n=1, k=2.

If x=2, n=2, k=1.

Hence, k >=1.

Hence, in the code, when k==1, it prints 1.

Otherwise, it proceeds to find the largest divisor <=k.

Hence, in all valid cases, it should work correctly.

Another edge case:

x=2, n=1

k=2//1=2

Divisors of 2: 1,2

Both <=2, so ans=2

Which is correct.

Another case:

x=6, n=3

k=6//3=2

Divisors of 6:1,2,3,6

Among these, 1 and 2 <=2

So, ans=2

Which is correct.

Another case:

x=9, n=2

k=9//2=4

Divisors of 9:1,3,9

Among these,1 and3 <=4

So, ans=3

Which is correct.

Seems like the code handles these cases correctly.

Now, looking back at the code, I see that in the loop, it starts from 1 or 2 based on x being even, and steps by 2.

This seems efficient, as it reduces the number of iterations by half when x is odd.

Moreover, since it's iterating up to sqrt(x), it's efficient enough for x up to 10^8.

Hence, time constraints should be satisfied.

I don't see any flaws in the logic or implementation.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
