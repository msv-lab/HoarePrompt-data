Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the corners of a square in random order, and I need to find the area of that square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligning with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that alignment.

Given four points, I need to determine the area of the square they form. Since it's a square, all sides should be equal, and the angles should be right angles. But because it's guaranteed to be a square with positive area, I don't need to verify these properties; I can assume they hold.

The straightforward way to find the area is to calculate the length of one side and then square it. But since the points are given in random order, I need a way to determine the side length without knowing which points correspond to which corners.

Let me think about the coordinates. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points will have some specific patterns.

If I look at the x-coordinates of all four points, there should be two distinct values: the minimum x and the maximum x. Similarly, for the y-coordinates, there should be two distinct values: the minimum y and the maximum y.

Wait, actually, for a square, there should be two unique x-values and two unique y-values, each appearing twice among the four points. For example, if the square is aligned with the axes, the points would be (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), and (x2, y2).

So, if I collect all the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately, I should find that there are exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

But in the problem, it's mentioned that the square has positive area, so the x-values and y-values are not all the same.

Given that, I can find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, which should be equal to the side length of the square. Similarly, the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values should also be equal to the side length.

Wait a minute, in a square, the side lengths should be equal, so both differences should be the same. But the problem says it's guaranteed to be a square, so I don't need to check if they are equal; I can assume they are.

Therefore, I can calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values (or y-values), and then square that length to get the area.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First testcase:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

The x-values are 1, 4, 1, 4 → unique x-values: 1 and 4 → difference: 3

The y-values are 2, 5, 5, 2 → unique y-values: 2 and 5 → difference: 3

So, side length is 3, area is 9.

Second testcase:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-values: -1, 1, 1, -1 → unique: -1 and 1 → difference: 2

y-values: 1, -1, 1, -1 → unique: -1 and 1 → difference: 2

Area: 4

Third testcase:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-values: 45, 45, 17, 17 → unique: 45 and 17 → difference: 28

y-values: 11, 39, 11, 39 → unique: 11 and 39 → difference: 28

Area: 784

So, in all cases, calculating the difference between max and min x or y gives the side length, and squaring it gives the area.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]

x = [p[0] for p in a]

dx = max(x) - min(x)

print(dx * dx)

So, the program reads the number of test cases, t, and for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers (x and y coordinates). It then extracts the x-coordinates into a list, finds the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, and prints the square of that difference.

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, I thought I need to check both x and y differences, but the program only calculates the difference in x-coordinates and squares that to get the area.

Is this sufficient? Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, and it's guaranteed to be a square, the difference in x-coordinates should be equal to the difference in y-coordinates, so squaring the x-difference should give the correct area.

Let me verify with the sample inputs:

First testcase:

x: [1,4,1,4] → max(x) = 4, min(x) = 1 → dx = 3 → area = 9

y: [2,5,5,2] → max(y) = 5, min(y) = 2 → dy = 3

So, dx = dy = 3, area = 9

Second testcase:

x: [-1,1,1,-1] → dx = 2

y: [1,-1,-1,-1] → dy = 2

area = 4

Third testcase:

x: [45,45,17,17] → dx = 28

y: [11,39,11,39] → dy = 28

area = 784

So, in all cases, dx = dy, as expected for a square with sides parallel to the axes.

Therefore, the program seems correct. It only calculates dx and squares it to get the area, assuming that dx = dy, which is a valid assumption given the problem's constraints.

Alternatively, the program could have calculated dy and squared it, or even calculated dx and dy and then squared dx (or dy), but since dx = dy, it's sufficient to calculate just one and square it.

So, I think the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{9} \]
