Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the corners of a square in random order, and I need to find the area of the square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that property.

Given four points, I need to determine the area of the square they form. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distance between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates should be equal to the distance between the minimum and maximum y-coordinates. That distance will be the side length of the square, and the area will be the side length squared.

Let me think about how to implement this. I need to read the input for multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers: the x and y coordinates of a corner of the square.

So, for each test case, I need to collect the four points, extract their x and y coordinates, find the minimum and maximum x and y values, compute the difference, and then square that difference to get the area.

Wait a minute, but I need to make sure that the points actually form a square. The problem says it's guaranteed, so I don't need to check if they form a square, I can assume they do.

Let me consider an example from the input:

Test case 1:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Looking at these points, I can see that the x-coordinates are 1 and 4, and the y-coordinates are 2 and 5. So, the side length should be the difference between 4 and 1, which is 3, and the area should be 9, which matches the first output.

Another test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Here, x-coordinates are -1 and 1, y-coordinates are -1 and 1. Difference is 2, area is 4, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-coordinates: 45 and 17, difference is 28; y-coordinates: 11 and 39, difference is 28; area is 784, which matches the third output.

So, the approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]

x = [p[0] for p in a]

dx = max(x) - min(x)

print(dx * dx)

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers (x and y coordinates). It collects all x-coordinates into a list called x, finds the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, and then prints the square of that difference.

Wait, but in the problem, the square's side length is determined by the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates, since the sides are parallel to the axes. So, the side length should be the same for both x and y differences.

But in the program, it only calculates the difference in x-coordinates and squares that to get the area. It doesn't check the y-coordinates.

But in the examples, the difference in x-coordinates is equal to the difference in y-coordinates, which should always be the case for a square with sides parallel to the axes.

So, if the difference in x-coordinates is equal to the difference in y-coordinates, then calculating just one difference and squaring it should give the correct area.

Let me verify this with the examples.

First test case:

x-coordinates: 1 and 4, difference = 3

y-coordinates: 2 and 5, difference = 3

Area = 3 * 3 = 9

Second test case:

x-coordinates: -1 and 1, difference = 2

y-coordinates: -1 and 1, difference = 2

Area = 2 * 2 = 4

Third test case:

x-coordinates: 17 and 45, difference = 28

y-coordinates: 11 and 39, difference = 28

Area = 28 * 28 = 784

So, in all cases, the difference in x-coordinates equals the difference in y-coordinates, and squaring that difference gives the correct area.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But is this always the case? Is it possible to have a square with sides parallel to the axes where the difference in x-coordinates is not equal to the difference in y-coordinates?

Well, no, because for a square, all sides are equal in length. Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the difference in x-coordinates (which gives the length of the horizontal sides) must be equal to the difference in y-coordinates (which gives the length of the vertical sides).

Therefore, calculating just the difference in x-coordinates and squaring it is sufficient to find the area.

So, the program is correct.

Wait, but to be thorough, maybe I should check if the difference in x-coordinates equals the difference in y-coordinates, but since the problem guarantees that the points form a valid square with positive area, I don't need to check that.

Moreover, in the program, it only collects the x-coordinates and doesn't look at the y-coordinates at all, but since the side length is the same for both x and y differences, it's okay.

So, I think the program is correct.

**Final Answer**
