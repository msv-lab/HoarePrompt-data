Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is equal to the length of the substring shifted.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the problem, it seems like a cyclic shift of a substring means taking the last character of the chosen substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have the substring "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110".

The goal is to make the entire string sorted in non-descending order, which means all '0's should come before all '1's. So, for example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

I need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this sorted order by performing any number of these cyclic shifts on any substrings of the string, where each shift costs the length of the substring shifted.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For "10", the minimum cost is 2. By shifting the entire string, "10" becomes "01", which is sorted.

- For "0000", it's already sorted, so the cost is 0.

- For "11000", the solution provided is 9, achieved through a series of shifts.

I need to find a general approach that can calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this problem.

First, I need to identify the positions where the string is not in non-descending order. In other words, positions where a '1' appears before a '0'. Each such inversion needs to be corrected by shifting substrings.

But directly manipulating substrings and tracking costs seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this problem.

I recall that in sorting problems, sometimes it's useful to count the number of inversions or to think in terms of bubble sort, where each swap fixes one inversion. Maybe something similar can be applied here.

In this problem, each cyclic shift can be seen as moving a '1' over a '0' in a certain way. I need to find a sequence of such shifts that resolves all inversions with the minimum total cost.

Let me consider the positions of '1's and '0's. Suppose I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, where i < j. This is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

If I perform a cyclic shift on the substring from i to j, moving the '1' at position i towards the '0' at position j, I can potentially fix this inversion.

But this might not be the most efficient way, especially if there are multiple inversions.

Maybe I should think about the overall number of '1's that need to pass over '0's and calculate the cost based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of bubbles in bubble sort, where each '1' needs to swap with each '0' that comes before it in the final sorted position.

In bubble sort, the number of swaps is equal to the number of inversions. But in this problem, each shift affects multiple positions, so it's not directly analogous.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula that can compute the minimum cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's.

Suppose I have a string like "101011". To sort it, I need to move the '1's to the end.

One way to think about it is to count, for each '0' that is after a '1', how many '1's are before it, and sum up these counts multiplied by some factor that represents the cost of moving those '1's past that '0'.

But I need to be careful because moving a '1' past a '0' might affect other '0's as well.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but it seems too vague.

Let me look at the sample input and see if I can derive a pattern.

Take "11000":

- There are two '1's followed by three '0's.

- To sort it, I need to move both '1's to the end, after all '0's.

- Each '1' needs to pass over all three '0's.

- If I shift the substring "110", turning it into "011", that's one shift of cost 3.

- Then, the string becomes "01100".

- Now, I need to move the '0' in position 4 to before the '1's.

- Wait, actually, I think the sample explanation does something different.

According to the sample explanation:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

2. Choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Each shift has a cost of 3, totaling 9.

But is there a way to do it with less cost?

If I shift the entire string "11000" to "01100" in one shift, that's cost 5.

Then, shift "110" to "011", resulting in "00110", cost 3.

Finally, shift "110" to "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, which is higher than the sample's 9, so the sample's approach is better.

Wait, but according to the sample, it's 3 shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

Is there a better way?

Suppose I shift substring [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "01100"

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "00110"

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost is 4 + 4 + 3 = 11, which is again higher.

Alternatively, shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

Total cost 5 + 4 + 3 = 12, worse.

So, the sample's approach seems better.

Is there a way to do it with fewer shifts or lower cost?

What if I shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the sample.

Is there a way to do it with shifts of smaller substrings or fewer shifts?

Suppose I shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

Resulting in "00110"

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

Total cost 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, higher than 9.

Alternatively, shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4

Total cost 4 + 4 = 8, which is less than 9.

But wait, after first shift: "11000" -> "01100"

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "00110", which is sorted.

Total cost 4 + 4 = 8, which is better than the sample's 9.

So, why does the sample say 9?

Wait, perhaps the sample is not necessarily the optimal solution, but just one possible solution.

The problem asks for the minimum total cost, so 8 would be better than 9 if achievable.

But maybe in this specific case, 9 is the answer because of the way the function works.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the provided function and see what it's doing.

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

while t:

s = input()

print(func_1(s))

t = t - 1

def func_1(s):

cost = 0

one = 0

for i in s:

if i == '1':

one += 1

elif i == '0' and one > 0:

cost += one + 1

return cost

So, the function iterates through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered. When a '0' is encountered and there are some '1's before it, it adds "one + 1" to the cost.

Let's see how this works with the sample input "11000".

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- First character '1': one = 1

- Second character '1': one = 2

- Third character '0': since one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, so cost = 3

- Fourth character '0': since one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, so cost = 6

- Fifth character '0': since one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, so cost = 9

Total cost = 9, which matches the sample output.

Now, in my earlier attempt, I found a way to do it with cost 8, but according to the function, it's 9. So, is the function incorrect?

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong, or maybe the function is doing something smarter that I don't see yet.

Let me try another sample input.

Take "10": according to the function:

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- First character '1': one = 1

- Second character '0': one > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

Total cost = 2, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: "0000"

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- All characters are '0', so no '1's are encountered before any '0's.

- Hence, cost = 0, which matches the sample.

Next sample: "101011"

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- '1': one = 1

- '0': one > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- '1': one = 2

- '0': one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost = 5

- '1': one = 3

- '1': one = 4

- No '0's after the last '1', so total cost = 5, which matches the sample output.

Last sample: "01101001"

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 1

- '1': one = 2

- '0': one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- '1': one = 3

- '0': one > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4, total cost = 7

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 4

- Total cost = 7, but the sample output is 11. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, according to the sample output, it should be 11, but according to the function, it's 7. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let's apply the function step by step to "01101001":

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 1

- '1': one = 2

- '0': one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost = 3

- '1': one = 3

- '0': one > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4, total cost = 7

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 4

- Total cost = 7

But the sample output is 11, which doesn't match. So, either the function is wrong or the sample output is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output. Let me check the sample input again.

The fifth test case is "01101001" with output 11.

But according to the function, it's giving 7, but the sample output is 11.

This suggests that the function is incorrect.

Wait, but in the third test case, "11000", the function gives 9, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, "101011", it gives 5, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, "10", it gives 2, which matches.

In the second test case, "0000", it gives 0, which matches.

Only in the fifth test case, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says "the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5", and each test case has |s| >= 2.

Given that, I need to process multiple test cases.

But in the sample input, there are 5 test cases, each with a string, and the corresponding outputs are provided.

In the fifth test case, the output should be 11, but according to the function, it's giving 7.

This suggests that the function is incorrect.

So, perhaps the function needs to be adjusted.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to count the number of '1's that are before '0's and calculate the cost based on how many '1's need to pass over each '0'.

Each '1' that is before a '0' needs to be moved past that '0', and each such movement can be done by shifting a substring that includes both the '1' and the '0'.

But I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach could be to model this as reversing inversions, where each inversion is a pair of '1' and '0' with '1' appearing before '0'. Each shift operation can reduce multiple inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

But figuring out the optimal sequence of shifts to minimize the total cost is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, maybe the function provided is a heuristic that approximates the minimum cost, but in reality, it's not always correct, as seen in the fifth test case.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on the positions of '1's and '0's that can directly compute the minimum cost.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have a string with m '1's and n '0's, and I need to move all '1's to the end.

Each '1' that is before a '0' needs to be moved past that '0'.

If I have k '1's before a '0', then moving that '1' past the '0' would require shifting a substring that includes both, which would cost at least the distance between them.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in problems involving sorting permutations, the number of inversions is related to the number of swaps needed.

Similarly, here, the number of inversions (pairs of '1' and '0' with '1' before '0') needs to be minimized.

Each shift operation can reduce multiple inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

But I need to find the sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.

This seems complex.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the provided function is the intended solution, even if it's not always correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the function is correct, and I made a mistake in calculating the cost for the fifth test case.

Let me recalculate the cost for "01101001" using the function.

- Initialize cost = 0, one = 0

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 1

- '1': one = 2

- '0': one > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost = 3

- '1': one = 3

- '0': one > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4, total cost = 7

- '0': no '1's before

- '1': one = 4

- Total cost = 7

But the sample output is 11, which doesn't match.

This suggests that the function is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
