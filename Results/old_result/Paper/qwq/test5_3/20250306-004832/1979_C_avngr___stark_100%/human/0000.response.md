Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the money I get back is more than the total amount I bet.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For each test case, I'm given n (number of outcomes) and a list of k_i values (the multipliers for each outcome). I need to find n integers x_i (the bets for each outcome) such that:

1. Each x_i is at least 1.

2. The total sum of all x_i is less than k_i * x_i for every i.

In other words, for each outcome i, the amount I get back (k_i * x_i) should be greater than the total sum of all bets.

This seems like a system of inequalities. For each i, sum of all x_j < k_i * x_i.

I need to find such x_i that satisfy all these inequalities simultaneously.

Let me try to rearrange these inequalities to see if I can find a pattern.

For each i:

sum of all x_j < k_i * x_i

Which can be written as:

sum_{j=1 to n} x_j < k_i * x_i

This can be rearranged to:

sum_{j=1 to n} x_j - k_i * x_i < 0

Or:

sum_{j ≠ i} x_j + x_i - k_i * x_i < 0

Simplify:

sum_{j ≠ i} x_j + x_i (1 - k_i) < 0

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me think about the total sum of bets. Let’s denote s = sum of all x_j.

Then, for each i, s < k_i * x_i.

But x_i is part of s, so x_i = s - sum_{j ≠ i} x_j.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Let me consider the ratios. Since s < k_i * x_i for each i, that means x_i > s / k_i.

But x_i must be integers, so x_i >= ceil(s / k_i).

But s is the sum of all x_i, so s >= sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(s / k_i).

This seems recursive and tricky to handle directly.

Maybe I can find a way to express x_i in terms of a common multiple or something.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

One possible solution is x=[27,41,12]

Sum s=27+41+12=80

Check for each i:

3*27=81 > 80

2*41=82 > 80

7*12=84 > 80

Good, it satisfies.

Another test case:

n=2, k=[3,3]

x=[1,1]

Sum s=2

Check:

3*1=3 > 2

3*1=3 > 2

Good.

Another test case:

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

Output is -1, meaning no solution exists.

Wait, but if all k_i are equal, why might there be no solution?

Let me try to find x_i for n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5].

Let’s assume x_i = x for all i.

Then, s = 5x

And for each i, 5x < 5x, which is impossible because 5x is not less than 5x.

So, no solution exists when all k_i are equal and greater than 1, but in this case, k_i=5.

Wait, but in the second test case, k_i=3 and x_i=1 works.

Wait, no, in the second test case, n=2, k=[3,3], x=[1,1], s=2, and 3*1=3 >2, which works.

But in the third test case, n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5], it's impossible because s= sum of x_i, and for each i, 5x_i > s.

If all x_i are equal, say x, then s=5x, and 5x <5x, which is impossible.

If x_i are different, say x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

Then for each i, 5x_i > s.

But s = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5.

So, for i=1: 5x1 > s = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5

Similarly for all other i.

This would require that for each i, 5x_i > sum of all x_j.

This seems very restrictive.

In fact, if we add up all these inequalities, we get:

sum_{i=1 to n} (5x_i) > n * s = n * sum x_j = n * sum x_i

But sum_{i=1 to n} 5x_i = 5 * sum x_i

So, 5 * sum x_i > n * sum x_i

Which implies (5 - n) * sum x_i > 0

If n <5, this could hold, but in this case n=5, so 5 -5 =0, and 0 * sum x_i =0 >0 is false.

Hence, no solution exists when n >=k_i for all i.

Wait, in this case, n=5 and k_i=5 for all i.

So, when n >= k_i for some i, maybe no solution exists.

But in the first test case, n=3, k=[3,2,7], and 3 <7, but 3 >=2, but it has a solution.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look at the program provided.

It reads t test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list k.

Then it computes m = func_2(k), which is the LCM of all k_i.

Then it computes c_i = m // k_i for each i.

Then it checks if sum(c_i) < m.

If yes, it prints c_i.

Else, it prints -1.

Wait, func_2(k) computes the LCM of all k_i using func_1, which computes LCM of two numbers.

So, m is the LCM of all k_i.

Then c_i = m // k_i.

So, c_i is m divided by k_i.

Then, sum(c_i) = sum(m // k_i for all i)

It checks if sum(c_i) < m.

If yes, it prints c_i.

Else, it prints -1.

Let me see if this makes sense.

In the first test case:

k=[3,2,7]

LCM of 3,2,7 is 42.

c = [42//3, 42//2, 42//7] = [14,21,6]

Sum(c) =14+21+6=41 <42, which is true.

So, it prints 14,21,6.

But in the sample output, it's 27,41,12.

Hmm, but it's mentioned that any suitable solution is acceptable, so multiple solutions are possible.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=[3,3]

LCM of 3 and 3 is 3.

c=[3//3, 3//3]=[1,1]

sum(c)=2 <3, which is true.

So, it prints 1,1.

In the third test case:

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

LCM of all 5's is 5.

c=[5//5,5//5,5//5,5//5,5//5]=[1,1,1,1,1]

sum(c)=5 <5 is false.

So, sum(c)=5 is not less than m=5.

Hence, it prints -1.

Which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

LCM of 7,9,3,17,9,13.

First, LCM of 7 and 9 is 63.

Then, LCM of 63 and 3 is 63.

Then, LCM of 63 and 17 is 63*17=1071.

Then, LCM of 1071 and 9 is still 1071.

Then, LCM of 1071 and 13 is 1071*13=13923.

Wait, but 1071 is divisible by 13? No, 1071 /13 is not integer.

Wait, 1071 divided by 13 is 82.384..., not integer.

So, LCM of 1071 and 13 is 1071*13=13923.

Then, c_i = m // k_i.

So, c=[13923//7, 13923//9, 13923//3, 13923//17, 13923//9, 13923//13]

Calculate each:

13923//7 =1989

13923//9=1547

13923//3=4641

13923//17=819

13923//9=1547

13923//13=1071

Sum(c)=1989 +1547 +4641 +819 +1547 +1071.

Let's add them up:

1989 +1547 =3536

3536 +4641=8177

8177 +819=9096

9096 +1547=10643

10643 +1071=11714

Now, m=13923.

Check if sum(c)=11714 <13923, which is true.

Hence, it prints these values.

In the fifth test case:

n=3, k=[6,3,2]

LCM of 6,3,2 is 6.

c=[6//6,6//3,6//2]=[1,2,3]

sum(c)=1+2+3=6 <6 is false.

Hence, prints -1.

In the sixth test case:

n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3]

LCM of 9,4,6,8,3.

First, LCM of 9 and 4 is 36.

LCM of 36 and 6 is 36.

LCM of 36 and 8 is 72.

LCM of 72 and 3 is still 72.

So, m=72.

c=[72//9,72//4,72//6,72//8,72//3]=[8,18,12,9,24]

Sum(c)=8+18+12+9+24=71 <72, which is true.

Hence, it prints 8 18 12 9 24.

Which matches the sample output.

So, the approach in the code seems to work for the sample inputs.

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct in general.

So, the approach is:

- Compute m = LCM of all k_i.

- Set x_i = m // k_i for each i.

- Check if sum(x_i) < m.

- If yes, output x_i.

- Else, output -1.

First, let's see why this might work.

Given that x_i = m / k_i, then k_i * x_i = k_i * (m / k_i) = m.

So, for each i, k_i * x_i = m.

Now, sum(x_i) = sum(m / k_i).

We need sum(x_i) < m.

So, sum(m / k_i) < m.

Divide both sides by m:

sum(1 / k_i) <1.

So, the condition sum(1 / k_i) <1 must hold for a solution to exist.

Is that always true?

Wait, in the third test case, n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5].

sum(1/5 +1/5 +1/5 +1/5 +1/5)=1, which is not less than 1.

Hence, sum(x_i)=5 < m=5 is false, so no solution.

In the first test case, sum(1/3 +1/2 +1/7)= (14 +21 +6)/42=41/42 <1.

In the second test case, sum(1/3 +1/3)=2/3 <1.

In the fourth test case, sum(1/7 +1/9 +1/3 +1/17 +1/9 +1/13) =

Calculate each:

1/7 ≈0.142857

1/9≈0.111111

1/3≈0.333333

1/17≈0.058824

1/9≈0.111111

1/13≈0.076923

Sum≈0.142857 +0.111111 +0.333333 +0.058824 +0.111111 +0.076923 ≈0.83416 <1.

In the fifth test case, sum(1/6 +1/3 +1/2)= (1/6 +2/6 +3/6)=6/6=1, which is not less than 1.

In the sixth test case, sum(1/9 +1/4 +1/6 +1/8 +1/3)= (8 +18 +12 +9 +24)/72=71/72 <1.

So, it seems that the condition sum(1/k_i) <1 is necessary for a solution to exist.

Now, is this condition sufficient?

In other words, if sum(1/k_i) <1, does there exist a solution?

The approach in the code seems to suggest that setting x_i = m / k_i, where m is LCM of k_i, and checking if sum(x_i) <m, which is equivalent to sum(1/k_i) <1, provides a valid solution.

But, do the x_i need to be integers?

Yes, the problem states that x_i should be integers.

In the approach, m is LCM of k_i, and x_i = m / k_i, which is integer since m is multiple of k_i.

So, x_i are integers.

Also, the problem requires that sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for each i.

Given that k_i * x_i = m, and sum(x_i) <m, this condition is satisfied.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

But, is this the minimal solution?

Well, the problem says that if a solution exists, there is always a solution with x_i <=10^9.

And it's okay to output any suitable solution.

So, this approach seems valid.

But, in the first test case, the sample output is 27,41,12, whereas the code would output 14,21,6.

But, 27,41,12 also satisfies:

sum=27+41+12=80 < m=84 (since m=LCM(3,2,7)=42, but in sample output, it's 84.

Wait, in the explanation, it's 3*27=81 >80, 2*41=82>80, 7*12=84>80.

But according to the code, m=42, and c_i=[14,21,6], sum=41<42.

But 3*14=42 >41, 2*21=42 >41, 7*6=42 >41.

So, [14,21,6] is also a valid solution.

But the sample output shows [27,41,12], which sums to 80<84.

So, multiple solutions exist, and any valid one is acceptable.

Hence, the approach in the code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is **True**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
