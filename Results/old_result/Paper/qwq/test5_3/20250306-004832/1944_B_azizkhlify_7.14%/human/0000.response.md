Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array `a` of length `2n`, and it contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice. Then there's an integer `k` (between `1` and `n/2`), and I need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, with specific properties.

First, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem also mentions that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a sequence `x` is a subset of `y` if `x` can be obtained by deleting several elements from `y` and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, `l` is any selection of `2k` elements from the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` is any selection of `2k` elements from the last `n` elements of `a`, with the condition that their XORs are equal.

My goal is to select these subsets in such a way that their XORs match.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in `a`, and `a` is split into two halves, each half contains some combination of these numbers, possibly with duplicates.

I need to select `2k` elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

One way to think about this is to find pairs of elements, one from each half, that have the same XOR, and try to combine them to meet the required length and XOR conditions.

But that might not be the most efficient approach, especially considering the constraints on `n` and `k`.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 1

1 2 2 1

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

4 1

1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

6 2

5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output:

2 1

2 1

6 4

1 3

1 2

1 2

5 1 3 3

6 4 2 4

In the first test case, n=2, k=1. So, I need to select 2 elements from the first half [1,2] and 2 elements from the second half [2,1], and their XORs should be equal. The output is l=[2,1] and r=[2,1], and indeed, 2 XOR 1 = 3 for both.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1. So, select 2 elements from the first half [6,4,2,1,2,3] and 2 from the second half [1,6,3,5,5,4]. The output is l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], and their XORs are both 2.

So, the approach seems to be selecting elements such that their XOR matches.

But how to generalize this?

I need a systematic way to select the subsets.

One idea is to use the properties of XOR. XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order doesn't matter, and A XOR A = 0.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in `a`, split into two halves, I can analyze the frequency of each number in both halves.

Let me denote:

- `l_freq[i]`: number of times `i` appears in the first half.

- `r_freq[i]`: number of times `i` appears in the second half.

Since each number appears exactly twice in `a`, `l_freq[i] + r_freq[i] = 2` for each `i` from 1 to n.

Now, I need to select `2k` elements from `l` and `2k` elements from `r` such that their XORs are equal.

One possible strategy is to select pairs of identical numbers, one from `l` and one from `r`, since their XOR would be zero, and zero XOR zero is zero, which satisfies the condition.

But I need to select `2k` elements from each side, not just `k` pairs.

Wait, selecting `k` pairs would give me `2k` elements in total, but split equally between `l` and `r`.

But the problem requires selecting `2k` elements from `l` and `2k` elements from `r`, so selecting `k` pairs would give me exactly that.

But in the first example, they selected the same elements from both sides, which are [2,1] from both `l` and `r`.

In the second example, they selected [6,4] from `l` and [1,3] from `r`, which are different elements but their XORs match.

So, selecting identical elements is one way, but not the only way.

I need a more general approach.

Another idea is to compute the XOR of all elements in `l` and the XOR of all elements in `r`, and then try to adjust the subsets to make their XORs equal.

But that might be too vague.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have two sets `l` and `r`, and I want `XOR(l) = XOR(r)`, that's equivalent to `XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0`.

So, if I consider the combined set `l + r`, their overall XOR should be zero.

But in this problem, `l` and `r` are subsets of the first and second halves, respectively.

Wait, but `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements, and `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements.

Given that, and that each number appears exactly twice in `a`, once in the first half and once in the second half, or twice in one half.

Wait, no. Since each number appears exactly twice in `a`, which is of length `2n`, it's possible for a number to appear twice in the first half, or twice in the second half, or once in each.

Given that, I need to consider the frequency of each number in both halves.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first half and the XOR of all elements in the second half.

Let `xor_l` be the XOR of the first `n` elements, and `xor_r` be the XOR of the last `n` elements.

Then, `xor_l XOR xor_r` would be the XOR of all elements in `a`, but since each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice, the XOR of all elements in `a` is zero (because A XOR A = 0 for any A).

Therefore, `xor_l XOR xor_r = 0`, which implies `xor_l = xor_r`.

So, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half.

Now, I need to select subsets `l` and `r` of size `2k` each, such that `XOR(l) = XOR(r)`.

Given that `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need to select subsets from `l` and `r` with equal XOR, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR matches the overall XOR.

Wait, but I need to select specific subsets of size `2k`.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that since `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need `XOR(l) = XOR(r)`, perhaps I can select subsets such that `XOR(l) = XOR(r) = xor_l`.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements equals the XOR of the remaining elements in their respective halves.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Let me think differently.

I can iterate through the elements and try to pair them in a way that their XORs match.

But with time constraints, I need an efficient approach.

Looking back at the provided solution code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

l = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

re = ul = ur = 0

res = []

for i in range(n):

l[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n, 2*n):

r[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

k = 2*k - ul

if k:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==1:

print(a[i], end=' ')

re +=1

res.append(a[i])

if re ==k:

break

print()

for i in res:

print(i, end=' ')

if ul != ur:

for i in range(n, 2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ur +=2

if ul == ur:

break

print()

So, the code seems to be trying to select elements that appear twice in the first half and twice in the second half.

Let me try to understand this code.

It reads the input values of `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of size `2n`.

Then, it initializes two frequency arrays `l` and `r`, each of size `n`, to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves, respectively.

Then, it iterates through the first `n` elements to count their frequencies in `l`, and through the next `n` elements to count their frequencies in `r`.

Then, it iterates through the first `n` elements again and checks if a number appears twice in the first half (`l[a[i]-1] == 2`). If so, it prints that number twice and increments `ul` by 2. It stops once `ul` reaches `2k`.

If after this, `ul` is less than `2k`, it sets `k = 2*k - ul` and looks for numbers that appear once in the first half (`l[a[i]-1] ==1`), prints them, adds them to `res`, and increments `re`. Stops when `re` reaches `k`.

Then, it prints a newline and prints the elements in `res`.

Finally, if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it looks for numbers that appear twice in the second half (`r[a[i]-1] ==2`), prints them twice, and increments `ur` by 2. Stops when `ul` equals `ur`.

Wait, but according to the problem, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements.

But in this code, it's selecting elements from the first half for `l`, and from the second half for `r`, which seems correct.

But I need to verify if this approach guarantees that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

Let me consider the first test case:

n=2, k=1

a = [1,2,2,1]

So, first half: [1,2], second half: [2,1]

Frequency counts:

l = [1,1] (1 appears once, 2 appears once)

r = [1,1] (1 appears once, 2 appears once)

Then, it iterates through the first half:

For i=0, a[0]=1, l[0]=1 !=2

For i=1, a[1]=2, l[1]=1 !=2

So, ul=0 < 2, so k=2*1 -0 =2

Then, it looks for elements in the first half that appear once:

a[0]=1, l[0]=1 ==1, print 1, re=1, res=[1]

a[1]=2, l[1]=1 ==1, print 2, re=2, res=[1,2]

Then, print newline, and print res: 1 2

Then, check if ul != ur: ul=0, ur=0, so no need to print anything else.

But according to the sample output, it should be:

2 1

2 1

But according to this code, it's printing:

1 2

1 2

Which might still be correct if 1 XOR 2 = 1 XOR 2 = 3.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 2 1 and 2 1, but according to the code, it's printing 1 2 and 1 2.

But since XOR is commutative, it shouldn't matter.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2, k=1, a=[1,2,2,1]

According to the code:

l = [1,1]

r = [1,1]

No elements appear twice in the first half, so ul=0

Then, k=2*1 -0 =2

Then, select elements that appear once in the first half: 1 and 2

Print them: 1 2

Then, res=[1,2]

Print res: 1 2

So, the output would be:

1 2

1 2

But in the sample output, it's:

2 1

2 1

Which is also fine, since the order doesn't matter as long as the XOR matches.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Let's look at the second test case:

n=6, k=1

a= [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Frequency counts:

l = [2,2,2,1,0,1] (1-based indexing)

r = [1,1,1,2,2,1]

Iterate through first half:

i=0, a[0]=6, l[5]=2 ==2, print 6 6, ul=2

Since ul == 2*1, stop

Then, k=2*1 -2=0, so no need to select more elements

Print:

6 6

But in the sample output, it's:

6 4

1 3

Hmm, so the code is printing 6 6 in the first line, but the sample output is 6 4 and 1 3.

So, perhaps there are multiple solutions, and both are acceptable.

But I need to ensure that the code always finds a valid pair of `l` and `r`.

In this case, 6 XOR 6 =0, and r needs to have XOR=0.

Looking at the second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Possible subsets of size 2:

1 XOR 6 = 7

1 XOR 3 = 2

1 XOR 5 = 4

1 XOR 5 = 4

1 XOR 4 = 5

6 XOR 3 = 5

6 XOR 5 = 3

6 XOR 5 = 3

3 XOR 5 = 6

3 XOR 4 = 7

5 XOR 4 = 1

None of these give XOR=0, but according to the sample output, 1 XOR 3 = 2, and 6 XOR 4 =2, so their XORs match.

So, in this case, the code's output of 6 6 and ... well, it seems that the code doesn't match the sample output, but as long as the XORs match, it should be acceptable.

Wait, but in the code, for the first test case, it's printing 6 6, but in the sample output, it's 6 4 and 1 3.

So, perhaps the code is not following the same logic as the sample solution.

But as long as the XORs match, it should be fine.

Let me see what the code does in this case.

n=6, k=1

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

l = [2,2,2,1,0,1] (indices 0 to 5)

r = [1,1,1,2,2,1]

Iterate through first half:

i=0, a[0]=6, l[5]=2 ==2, print 6 6, ul=2

Since ul == 2*1, stop

Then, k=2*1 -2=0, so no need to select more elements

Print:

6 6

Then, print a newline, and since res is empty, print nothing

Then, check if ul != ur: ul=2, ur=0, so need to make ur=2

Look for elements in the second half that appear twice:

i=9, a[9]=5, r[4]=2 ==2, print 5 5, ur=2

i=10, a[10]=5, r[4]=2-1=1 !=2, skip

i=11, a[11]=4, r[3]=2 ==2, print 4 4, ur=4 > ul=2, but ul == ur is already satisfied at ur=2, so break

So, the actual output would be:

6 6 5 5

5 5

But in the sample output, it's:

6 4

1 3

Which has XOR=2 for both.

So, the code's output is different but still valid, as 6 XOR 6 =0, and 5 XOR 5 =0, so XOR matches.

But the sample output shows a different valid solution.

So, multiple solutions exist, and the code seems to find one, though not necessarily the same as the sample.

Now, let's check if this approach always works.

In the first part, it selects elements that appear twice in the first half, prints them twice, and adds them to `l`, and increases `ul` by 2.

If `ul` reaches `2k`, it stops.

If not, it sets `k = 2k - ul`, and looks for elements that appear once in the first half, prints them, adds to `res`, and increases `re`.

Then, it prints `res` as part of `r`.

Finally, if `ul != ur`, it selects elements that appear twice in the second half, prints them twice, and increases `ur` until `ul == ur`.

But in the second test case, it printed 6 6 and 5 5, which have XOR=0, which matches.

But in the sample output, it's 6 4 and 1 3, which have XOR=2, which also matches.

So, both are correct.

I need to verify if this approach guarantees that the XORs match.

Let me think about the XOR properties again.

If I select elements that appear twice in the first half, their XOR is zero because A XOR A =0.

Similarly, in the second half, selecting elements that appear twice gives XOR=0.

So, if I select `k` pairs from the first half that appear twice, their XOR is zero, and select `k` pairs from the second half that appear twice, their XOR is also zero, which matches.

In the code, it seems to select as many pairs as possible from the first half that appear twice, and then if needed, select single occurrences.

But in the second test case, it selected [6,6] from the first half and [5,5] from the second half, both with XOR=0.

Which is correct.

In the sample output, it selected [6,4] and [1,3], both with XOR=2.

So, both are valid solutions.

Now, what if there are not enough pairs that appear twice in the first half?

In that case, it selects some elements that appear once in the first half, and matches them with corresponding elements in the second half.

But in the code, it seems to select elements that appear once in the first half and include them in `l`, and then select corresponding elements from the second half in `r`.

But I need to ensure that their XORs match.

Wait, in the code, after selecting elements from the first half that appear twice, it adjusts `k` and selects remaining elements that appear once.

Then, it prints these remaining elements in `l`, and prints the same elements in `r`.

But is that sufficient to ensure that their XORs match?

In the second test case, it selected [6,6] from the first half and [5,5] from the second half.

But according to the sample output, [6,4] and [1,3] is another valid solution.

So, the code seems to find a different solution, but still correct.

Let me consider another test case.

Take n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

According to the sample output:

1 2

1 2

So, l=[1,2], r=[1,2], XOR=3 for both.

According to the code:

l = [1,1,1,1] (counts of 1,2,3,4 in first half)

r = [1,1,1,1]

Iterate through first half:

i=0, a[0]=1, l[0]=1 !=2

i=1, a[1]=2, l[1]=1 !=2

ul=0 < 2, so k=2-0=2

Then, select elements that appear once in the first half: 1,2,3,4

Print 1,2, and res=[1,2]

Then, print res: 1 2

Then, check ul != ur: ul=0, ur=0, so no need to print more.

So, output is:

1 2

1 2

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=6, k=2

a=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First half: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Frequency counts:

l = [2,2,2,0,2,0] (1-based: 1 appears twice, 2 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 4 appears zero times, 5 appears twice, 6 appears zero times)

r = [2,2,0,2,0,2]

Iterate through first half:

i=0, a[0]=5, l[4]=2 ==2, print 5 5, ul=2

i=1, a[1]=1, l[0]=2 ==2, print 1 1, ul=4 >= 2*2=4, stop

Then, k=2*2 -4=0, so no need to select more elements

Print:

5 5 1 1

Then, print newline, and since res is empty, print nothing

Then, check if ul != ur: ul=4, ur=0, so need to make ur=4

Look for elements in the second half that appear twice:

i=6, a[6]=2, r[1]=2 ==2, print 2 2, ur=2

i=7, a[7]=6, r[5]=2 ==2, print 6 6, ur=4

Now, ul == ur, so stop

So, output is:

5 5 1 1

2 2 6 6

But in the sample output, it's:

5 1 3 3

6 4 2 4

Which has XOR(5,1,3,3) = 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 4 XOR 1 = 5

And XOR(6,4,2,4) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 0 XOR 2 = 6 XOR 2 = 4

Which is not equal, but in the sample output, it's:

5 1 3 3

6 4 2 4

But according to the sample output, their XORs should be equal.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

XOR(5,1,3,3) = 5 XOR 1 = 4, 4 XOR 3 = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4

XOR(6,4,2,4) = 6 XOR 4 = 2, 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 4 = 4

So, both have XOR=4, which matches.

But according to the code, it's selecting [5,5,1,1] and [2,2,6,6], which have XOR=0 for both.

Which is also correct.

So, again, multiple solutions exist, and the code finds one, while the sample shows another.

Therefore, as long as the XORs match, it's acceptable.

Now, I need to verify if the code always finds a valid pair of `l` and `r` with equal XOR.

Looking at the code's logic:

1. Count frequencies in the first and second halves.

2. Select elements that appear twice in the first half and print them twice, adding them to `l`.

3. If not enough elements are selected, select elements that appear once in the first half and add them to `l` and `res`.

4. Print `res
