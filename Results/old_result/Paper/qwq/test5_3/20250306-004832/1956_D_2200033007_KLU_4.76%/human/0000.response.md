Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on it up to 5*10^5 times. The operation involves choosing a subarray from index l to r, computing the MEX of that subarray, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for "minimum excludant," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given set. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

So, the operation allows me to pick any subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations; I just need to achieve the maximum possible sum.

Given that n can be up to 18, which is relatively small, I might be able to come up with an efficient algorithm, possibly even exponential in time complexity, but since n is small, it should be manageable.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to maximize the sum of the array. That means I want each element in the array to be as large as possible.

One way to increase the value of elements is to set them to higher MEX values. Since MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer, higher MEX values can be achieved by having higher numbers in the subarray.

Wait, but MEX is always going to be a small number because it's the smallest non-negative integer not present. For example, if a subarray contains [0,1,2], its MEX would be 3. If it contains [0,1,3], its MEX is 2. So, MEX values won't be larger than the size of the subarray plus one, which in this case, with n=18, MEX can be up to 19 at most, if the subarray is [0,1,2,...,18].

But wait, the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations, which is a lot, and n is only 18. Maybe I can perform many operations to gradually increase the values in the array.

Let me consider the base case where I don't perform any operations. The sum is just the sum of the initial array. In the first example, with n=2 and a=[0,1], the sum is 1. If I perform one operation on the entire array, computing MEX([0,1]) which is 2, and set both elements to 2, the array becomes [2,2], summing to 4. That's better.

In the second example, n=3 with a=[1,3,9], the sum is already 13. If I perform an operation on the entire array, MEX([1,3,9]) is 0, since 0 is not present. Setting all to 0 would give a sum of 0, which is worse. So, in this case, it's better not to perform any operations.

In the third example, n=4 with a=[1,100,2,1]. Let's see what operations were performed:

First operation: l=3 to r=3, so subarray [2], MEX([2]) is 0, set a[3] to 0. Now array is [1,100,0,1].

Second operation: l=3 to r=4, subarray [0,1], MEX([0,1]) is 2, set a[3] and a[4] to 2. Now array is [1,100,2,2], summing to 105.

Apparently, this sequence of operations leads to a sum of 105, which is higher than the initial sum of 1+100+2+1=104.

In the fourth example, n=1 with a=[0]. If I perform one operation on the single element, MEX([0]) is 1, set it to 1. Sum becomes 1, which is better than the initial 0.

So, the strategy seems to be to use operations to increase the values in the array by setting them to higher MEX values.

But I need a systematic way to determine the optimal sequence of operations.

Let me think about the properties of MEX:

- MEX of a set is always a non-negative integer.

- MEX is the smallest missing integer in the set.

- If a set contains all integers from 0 to k-1, then MEX is k.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to set as many elements as possible to the highest possible MEX values.

However, setting a subarray to a higher MEX value might affect neighboring elements in future operations.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Given that n is small (n <= 18), perhaps I can consider all possible ways to partition the array into segments and compute the optimal MEX for each segment.

Wait, but the operations are not about partitioning the array into segments; they are about choosing any subarray and setting it to its MEX.

But maybe I can think of it in terms of covering the array with multiple subarrays and computing MEX for each.

However, operations can overlap, and the order of operations might matter.

Wait, but in the problem, operations can be performed in any order, and since we're not minimizing the number of operations, maybe the order doesn't matter.

I need to find a way to set each subarray to its MEX, and possibly perform multiple operations to increase the values step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of performing operations in such a way that I maximize the final sum.

Let me consider that each operation can be seen as setting a subarray to a certain value, specifically the MEX of that subarray at the time of the operation.

But computing MEX depends on the current values in the subarray, so operations are dependent on the order and previous operations performed.

This seems too tangled. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the final array should be such that each element is set to the MEX of some subarray it belongs to.

But that's not quite accurate, because operations can be performed multiple times, and each operation can overwrite previous changes.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as each element being set to the MEX of some subarray that includes it, but considering the dependencies between operations.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have the entire array from 1 to n. I can perform an operation on the entire array, set it to MEX of a[1..n], and then perform operations on smaller subarrays to further increase their values.

But this might not be optimal, because setting a larger subarray to a certain MEX might prevent me from achieving higher MEX values in smaller subarrays.

Alternatively, maybe I should start by performing operations on smaller subarrays to get higher MEX values, and then possibly expand those subarrays.

But this seems too vague to implement.

Given that n is small (n=18), maybe I can consider all possible final configurations of the array and choose the one with the maximum sum.

But the number of possible configurations is 19^18, which is about 1.15*10^23, which is way too big to handle.

So that's not feasible.

Another idea: since MEX is about the smallest missing integer, perhaps there is a way to iteratively increase the values in the array by choosing appropriate subarrays.

For example, find a subarray where the MEX is higher than the current values and set them to that MEX.

But again, this seems too vague and may not lead to an optimal solution.

Let me consider the constraints again. n <= 18, and a_i can be up to 10^7.

But since MEX is always a small number (at most n+1, in practice), perhaps the a_i values being up to 10^7 is a red herring.

Wait, no, because even if a_i is large, MEX can still be small if the subarray contains lower numbers.

But in any case, MEX is always a small number, so setting elements to MEX won't make them very large, but in some cases, it can increase them.

Wait, in the first example, setting [0,1] to MEX=2 increases the sum from 1 to 4.

In the third example, operations lead to sum increasing from 104 to 105.

But in the second example, no operations are needed because sum is already high.

So, perhaps the key is to identify subarrays where setting them to MEX increases the sum, and perform such operations.

But how to systematically find such subarrays?

Let me consider that for a subarray a_l to a_r, its MEX is x, and currently, there are elements in the subarray that are less than x.

In that case, setting all elements in the subarray to x would increase the sum.

But if all elements in the subarray are already >= x, then setting them to x would not increase the sum.

So, perhaps I should look for subarrays where at least one element is less than the MEX.

But even then, it might be better to perform operations on smaller subarrays to achieve higher MEX values.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the final array a', where each element a'_i is set to some value.

I need to make sure that for each a'_i, there exists some subarray that includes i and has MEX equal to a'_i.

Because the operations allow setting a subarray to its MEX.

But ensuring that for each a'_i, there is a subarray with MEX a'_i that includes i, seems too broad.

Moreover, computing MEX for all possible subarrays is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that a'_i is the MEX of some subarray that includes i.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that after performing operations, each a'_i is equal to the MEX of some subarray that was operated on.

But since operations can overlap, it's hard to track.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I should consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the final array a' should be such that for any subarray, its MEX is at least the value of each element in that subarray.

Because if there's a subarray where MEX is less than some element, then setting that subarray to MEX would decrease that element, which we don't want since we're trying to maximize the sum.

Wait, but in the operation, we set the subarray to MEX, which could potentially decrease some elements.

But our goal is to maximize the sum, so we only want to perform operations that increase the sum.

So, perhaps I should only perform operations where setting the subarray to MEX increases the sum.

In other words, only perform operations where MEX is greater than the average of the subarray or something like that.

But this still doesn't give me a clear algorithm.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of dependencies between elements.

Suppose I have two overlapping subarrays, and I perform operations on both.

The operation on the second subarray might overwrite some elements set by the first operation.

This suggests that the order of operations matters, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform operations in such a way that larger subarrays are operated on first, and then smaller subarrays can be operated on to increase specific elements.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that MEX is non-decreasing as the subarray grows.

That is, if subarray A is contained in subarray B, then MEX(B) >= MEX(A).

This is because if a smaller subarray has MEX x, and the larger subarray contains all elements of the smaller one plus some more, then its MEX is at least x.

Wait, actually, that's not necessarily true.

For example, subarray A = [0,1], MEX=2; subarray B = [0,1,2], MEX=3.

So MEX can increase when the subarray grows.

But it's not strictly non-decreasing, because adding an element that is already present won't change the MEX.

Wait, actually, adding an element that is already in the subarray won't change the MEX.

So, MEX can stay the same or increase when the subarray grows.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that operating on a larger subarray sets more elements to a higher MEX, which could be beneficial.

But again, it's not clear.

Let me consider a small example.

Suppose n=2, a=[0,1].

If I perform an operation on the entire array, MEX=2, set both elements to 2, sum=4.

If I perform operations on individual elements:

- Operation on a[1]=0: MEX([0])=1, set a[1]=1.

- Then operation on a[2]=1: MEX([1])=0, set a[2]=0.

Sum=1, which is worse than the first approach.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array is better.

Another example: n=3, a=[1,3,9].

If I perform an operation on the entire array, MEX=0 (since 0 is missing), set all to 0, sum=0.

Which is worse than the initial sum of 13.

If I perform operations on individual elements:

- Operation on a[1]=1: MEX([1])=0, set a[1]=0.

- Operation on a[2]=3: MEX([3])=0, set a[2]=0.

- Operation on a[3]=9: MEX([9])=0, set a[3]=0.

Sum=0, again worse.

Alternatively, operation on a[1] and a[2]:

- Operation on a[1..2]=[1,3], MEX=0, set both to 0.

- Then operation on a[3]=9: no change.

Sum=9, still worse than initial 13.

So, in this case, no operations are better.

Another example: n=4, a=[1,100,2,1].

As per the sample input, performing two operations leads to sum=105.

Let me see:

- First operation on a[3]=2: MEX([2])=0, set a[3]=0.

- Then operation on a[3..4]=[0,1], MEX=2, set both to 2.

Resulting array: [1,100,2,2], sum=105.

Alternatively, if I perform operations differently:

- Operation on a[1..2]=[1,100], MEX=0, set both to 0.

- Operation on a[3..4]=[2,1], MEX=0, set both to 0.

Sum=0, which is worse.

So, the choice of operations matters.

This suggests that choosing the right subarrays to operate on is crucial.

But how to systematize this choice?

Let me consider that performing operations on smaller subarrays allows for higher MEX values compared to operating on larger subarrays.

Wait, no, in the first example, operating on the entire array gave a higher sum than operating on individual elements.

In the third example, operating on smaller subarrays led to a higher sum than operating on the entire array.

So, it seems that sometimes operating on the entire array is better, and sometimes operating on smaller subarrays is better.

This inconsistency makes it hard to generalize.

Let me consider that the MEX of a subarray is determined by the elements currently in that subarray, so operations are dependent on previous operations.

This interdependence makes it challenging to plan operations in advance.

Given that n is small (n<=18), perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current configuration of the array, and I consider all possible operations to transition to new states.

But with n=18 and each a_i up to 10^7, the state space is too large.

Wait, but since MEX is small, perhaps I can limit the possible values that each a_i can take.

Given that MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer, and considering that we can perform operations to set subarrays to MEX values, perhaps the final value of each a_i won't exceed a certain bound.

In fact, in the first example, a_i were set to 2, which is higher than any initial a_i.

In the third example, a_i were set up to 2 as well.

But in other cases, higher MEX values might be achievable.

Wait, no, MEX is limited by the elements present in the subarray.

Wait, actually, MEX can be up to n+1 in the worst case, but often it's smaller.

Wait, no, MEX can be larger than n, if the subarray contains all numbers from 0 to k, then MEX is k+1.

But in practice, for n=18, MEX can be up to, say, 20 or so.

But since n is small, maybe I can consider that the final a_i values are limited, and try to maximize the sum accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using the A* search algorithm, where the state is the current array, and the heuristic is the potential sum increase.

But again, with n=18, this seems computationally expensive.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the final array a', and I need to ensure that for every position i, there exists a subarray containing i that has MEX equal to a'_i.

Because each operation sets a subarray to its MEX, so for a'_i to be achievable, there must be a subarray containing i with MEX a'_i.

Given that, I can try to find the maximum possible a'_i for each i such that there exists a subarray containing i with MEX a'_i.

But how do I find such a'_i for each i?

Let me consider that for a given i, the maximum possible a'_i is the minimum MEX over all subarrays containing i.

Wait, no, that would be too restrictive.

Actually, since I can perform multiple operations, I can set different subarrays to their MEX values, potentially increasing the values step by step.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I consider all possible subarrays and their MEX values, and I try to select a set of subarrays such that:

- Each element in the array is covered by at least one subarray.

- The operations are performed in such a way that the final value of each element is the MEX of the subarray it's covered by.

But again, operations can overlap, and the order matters, making this approach complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that this problem requires a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving graph theory or some other advanced concept.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a greedy approach that can be used here.

For example, repeatedly find a subarray where setting it to its MEX increases the sum, and perform the operation on that subarray.

Continue doing this until no such operation exists.

But I need to ensure that this approach leads to the maximum possible sum.

In the first example, starting with [0,1], MEX=2, setting both to 2 increases the sum to 4, and no further operations can increase it further.

In the third example, starting with [1,100,2,1], performing operations on [3..3] and then [3..4] leads to a sum of 105, which seems optimal.

But does the greedy approach always lead to the maximum sum?

Let me consider a counterexample.

Suppose n=3, a=[0,1,2].

If I perform an operation on the entire array, MEX=3, set all to 3, sum=9.

Alternatively, if I perform operations on individual elements:

- Operation on a[1]=0: MEX([0])=1, set a[1]=1.

- Operation on a[2]=1: MEX([1])=0, set a[2]=0.

- Operation on a[3]=2: MEX([2])=0, set a[3]=0.

Sum=1, which is worse.

Another sequence:

- Operation on a[1..2]=[0,1], MEX=2, set a[1]=2, a[2]=2.

- Now array is [2,2,2], MEX of entire array is 0, which is not useful.

Sum=6, which is better than 1, but worse than 9.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array in one step gives a better sum.

Thus, the greedy approach seems to work here.

Another example: n=4, a=[0,1,2,3].

If I operate on the entire array, MEX=4, set all to 4, sum=16.

If I operate on smaller subarrays:

- Operation on a[1..3]=[0,1,2], MEX=3, set to 3. Array becomes [3,3,3,3], sum=12.

- Operation on a[1..2]=[3,3], MEX=0, set to 0. Array becomes [0,0,3,3], sum=6.

- Further operations can't increase the sum beyond this.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array in one step gives a better sum.

Hence, it seems that operating on larger subarrays can lead to higher sums.

But in the third example, operating on smaller subarrays led to a higher sum.

Wait, in the third example, n=4, a=[1,100,2,1].

- Operation on a[3]=2: MEX=0, set to 0. Array becomes [1,100,0,1].

- Operation on a[3..4]=[0,1]: MEX=2, set to 2. Array becomes [1,100,2,2], sum=105.

Alternatively, operating on the entire array:

- a=[1,100,2,1], MEX=0, set all to 0, sum=0.

Which is worse.

So, in this case, operating on smaller subarrays is better.

This suggests that the greedy approach of operating on the largest possible subarray isn't always optimal.

Hence, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that I should operate on subarrays where the MEX is greater than the current values in the subarray.

In the third example, first operating on a[3] where a[3]=2 and MEX([2])=0, which is less than 2, so it decreases the sum if I set it to 0.

Wait, but in the sample solution, they set it to 0 and then to 2, ending up with a higher sum.

So, sometimes setting an element to a lower value temporarily allows for a higher MEX in a larger subarray.

This suggests that the order of operations matters, and possibly, some operations might seem counterintuitive at first.

Given this complexity, perhaps I need to model the problem as finding a sequence of operations that leads to the maximum possible sum.

But with n=18 and a high operation limit, this seems computationally intensive.

Wait, but the problem states that it's sufficient to use no more than 5*10^5 operations, which is a lot, but n is small, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each operation, I can choose any subarray and set it to its MEX, and I can do this up to 5*10^5 times.

But I don't need to minimize the number of operations; I just need to reach the maximum sum.

Given that, perhaps I can perform operations in a way that gradually increases the values in the array.

For example, start with small subarrays and increase their values, then combine them into larger subarrays.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that the MEX of a subarray is determined by the elements present in it.

So, if a subarray contains elements from 0 to k-1, and k is missing, then MEX is k.

If I set this subarray to k, and then include more elements in a larger subarray, the MEX of the larger subarray might be higher than k, depending on the elements added.

So, by performing operations on smaller subarrays first and then expanding to larger subarrays, I might be able to achieve higher sums.

But I need to formalize this idea.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the final array a' should be such that for each position i, a'_i is the MEX of some subarray that includes i.

And among all such possible a', choose the one with the maximum sum.

But finding such an a' seems non-trivial.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can compute the maximum a'_i that can be achieved for that position, considering all possible subarrays that include i.

Then, set a'_i to the maximum possible MEX among all subarrays containing i.

But this might not work because operations can overlap and affect each other.

Wait, perhaps I can compute, for each position i, the maximum a'_i that can be achieved independently, and then take the sum.

But this might not be correct because operations are interdependent.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the final array a', and I need to ensure that for each i, a'_i is equal to the MEX of some subarray that includes i.

Then, I need to find a' that maximizes the sum, subject to this constraint.

This sounds like a constraint optimization problem.

But with n=18, even if I consider that each a'_i can be up to, say, 20, the state space is still too large.

Wait, but in practice, MEX values won't be very high because they depend on the elements in the subarrays.

So, perhaps I can limit a'_i to be up to, say, n+2, which is 20 for n=18.

Then, for each position i, I can compute the maximum possible a'_i that satisfies the condition that there exists a subarray containing i with MEX equal to a'_i.

Then, set a'_i to that value, and sum them up.

But how do I compute the maximum possible a'_i for each i?

Let me consider that for a given i, the maximum a'_i is the maximum MEX over all subarrays that contain i.

But computing this for each i separately might not lead to a consistent a' array because operations can interfere with each other.

Wait, perhaps I can compute, for each position i, the maximum a'_i that can be achieved without considering the other positions, and then take the sum.

But this might overestimate the sum because operations might conflict.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I consider that performing operations can only increase the sum if the MEX of the subarray is greater than the minimum value in the subarray.

Because setting all elements to MEX would increase the sum if MEX is greater than the average value, but specifically, if MEX is greater than the smallest value in the subarray.

Wait, no, it's possible for MEX to be less than some elements but greater than others.

For example, in the third sample, setting a[3] to 0 decreases a[3] from 2 to 0, which seems counterproductive, but then setting a[3..4] to 2 increases them to 2, which is better than the initial 2 and 1.

So, in that case, temporarily setting a[3] to 0 allowed for a higher MEX in a larger subarray.

This suggests that sometimes, performing operations that decrease some elements can ultimately lead to higher sums through subsequent operations.

Hence, the dependency between operations is complex.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that finding the optimal sequence of operations is too difficult, and look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that the maximum possible sum is achieved when each a'_i is as high as possible.

To maximize a'_i, I need to find subarrays containing i with high MEX values.

But again, MEX depends on the elements in the subarray.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the subarrays based on their MEX values and select a combination of subarrays that cover all positions with the highest possible MEX values.

This sounds like a set cover problem, but with weights being the MEX values.

But set cover is NP-hard, and even with n=18, it's too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can compute the maximum MEX of any subarray that contains i.

Then, set a'_i to that maximum MEX.

But this might not work because operations are interdependent.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and greedily set each a_i to the maximum MEX of any subarray containing i.

But this might not be achievable because operations affect each other.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me consider that since n is small, I can model the problem using flow networks or some other graph-based approach.

But I'm not sure how to model this as a graph problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where the state is the current configuration of the array, and transitions are operations performed on subarrays.

But with n=18 and each a_i up to 10^7, this is infeasible.

Wait, but since MEX is small, perhaps I can limit the DP state to the current MEX values or something similar.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as finding a maximum weight matching or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that I can't find an optimal solution and look for a heuristic approach.

But the problem requires finding the maximum sum and providing a sequence of operations that achieves it.

Given that, perhaps I need to find a way to systematically perform operations that increase the sum until no further operations can increase it.

For example, I can iterate through all possible subarrays, compute their MEX, and if setting the subarray to MEX increases the sum, perform that operation.

Repeat this process until no such operation exists.

But this might not lead to the optimal solution, as the order of operations matters.

In the third sample, performing operations in a specific order led to a higher sum.

Hence, this greedy approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can prioritize operations on smaller subarrays, as they might have higher MEX values.

But in the first sample, operating on the entire array gave a higher sum.

So, this approach is flawed.

Let me consider that for each operation, I should choose the subarray with the highest possible MEX that leads to an increase in the sum.

But again, this might not lead to the optimal solution due to operation dependencies.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider performing operations in a specific order, such as starting from the smallest subarrays and moving to larger ones, or vice versa.

But I don't have a clear strategy.

Let me consider that since n is small, I can consider all possible final a' arrays where a'_i is equal to the MEX of some subarray containing i, and choose the one with the maximum sum.

But with n=18, even if a'_i is up to, say, 20, that's still 20^18 possibilities, which is too large.

So, that's not feasible.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that finding the optimal solution is too difficult within the time constraints, and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum sum is achieved when each a'_i is set to the MEX of the entire array.

But in the first sample, setting the entire array to MEX=2 gave a sum of 4, which is better than not performing any operations.

In the second sample, setting the entire array to MEX=0 gives a sum of 0, which is worse than the initial sum of 13, so no operations are performed.

In the third sample, setting the entire array to MEX=0 gives a sum of 0, which is worse, but performing operations on smaller subarrays gives a sum of 105, which is better.

Hence, operating on the entire array isn't always the best approach.

So, perhaps I need to consider a combination of operations on different subarrays.

Given that, maybe I can iterate through the array and perform operations on subarrays where the MEX is higher than the current values.

But how do I choose which subarrays to operate on?

Let me consider that for each subarray, if its MEX is greater than the current values in the subarray, then performing an operation on it would increase the sum.

So, I can collect all such subarrays where MEX is greater than the minimum value in the subarray.

Then, choose a subset of these subarrays to perform operations on, in a way that maximizes the sum.

But choosing which subarrays to operate on is still a complex problem due to overlaps and dependencies.

This seems too difficult.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that I can't find an optimal solution and look for a heuristic approach that performs operations greedily until no further improvements can be made.

Even if it's not optimal, perhaps it's good enough.

But the problem states that it's possible to achieve the maximum sum with no more than 5*10^5 operations, so I need to ensure that my approach can achieve the optimal sum.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider that performing operations on subarrays with higher MEX values leads to higher sums.

Hence, I can sort all possible subarrays based
