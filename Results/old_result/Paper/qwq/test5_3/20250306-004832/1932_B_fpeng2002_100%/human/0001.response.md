Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign appears every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign appears, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But the tribe waits for each sign to occur one after another in sequence. So, for example, if the first sign occurs in year x, they start waiting for the second sign in year x+1, and it has to occur in some multiple of a_2 that is greater than x.

I need to find out in which year the nth sign will occur, given that all previous signs have occurred in the sequence as described.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

36

5

5

2012

So, for the first test case with n=6 and a_i=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the answer is 36.

Let me try to understand how 36 is obtained.

Start with year 0.

Wait for the first sign, which occurs in years that are multiples of 3: 3,6,9,12,...

Let's say the first sign occurs in year 3.

Now, start waiting for the second sign from year 4 onwards. The second sign occurs every 2 years: 2,4,6,8,...

The first occurrence after year 3 is year 4.

So, second sign occurs in year 4.

Now, start waiting for the third sign from year 5 onwards. The third sign occurs every 4 years: 4,8,12,16,...

The first occurrence after year 4 is year 4 itself, but since we need it to occur after year 4, it would be year 8.

Wait, but in the example, it seems to be choosing year 8 for the third sign.

Wait, no, in the explanation provided in the problem, it says:

- First sign in year 3

- Second sign in year 4

- Third sign in year 8

- Fourth sign in year 10

- Fifth sign in year 18

- Sixth sign in year 36

So, it seems like for each sign, it's choosing the smallest possible year that is greater than the previous sign's year and is a multiple of a_i.

So, for the third sign, it's choosing year 8, which is the smallest multiple of 4 greater than 4.

Similarly, for the fourth sign, it's choosing year 10, which is the smallest multiple of 5 greater than 8.

And so on.

So, the process is, for each sign, find the smallest year that is a multiple of a_i and greater than the year the previous sign occurred.

That makes sense.

So, in code, I need to iterate through the signs, and for each sign, calculate the smallest year that is a multiple of a_i and greater than the year the previous sign occurred.

Initialize start_year to 0.

Then, for each a_i in nums:

Find the smallest year y such that y is a multiple of a_i and y > start_year.

Set start_year to y.

Finally, after processing all signs, start_year will be the year when the nth sign occurs.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of a_i's.

It initializes start_year to 0.

Then, for each a_i in nums, it updates start_year to be the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than start_year.

This is done using the expression: (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Let's see how this works.

Suppose start_year is 3 and nums[x] is 2.

3 // 2 = 1

1 + 1 = 2

2 * 2 = 4

So, it correctly computes the next multiple of 2 after 3, which is 4.

Another example: start_year is 4, nums[x] is 4.

4 // 4 = 1

1 + 1 = 2

2 * 4 = 8

So, it skips 4 and goes to 8, which matches the example's third sign.

Similarly, start_year is 8, nums[x] is 5.

8 // 5 = 1

1 + 1 = 2

2 * 5 = 10

Which matches the fourth sign in year 10.

And so on.

So, this seems correct.

It's efficiently calculating the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous sign's year.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{36}\]
