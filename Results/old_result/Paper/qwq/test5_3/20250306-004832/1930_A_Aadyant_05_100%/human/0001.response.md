Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and at the end, I need to have the maximum possible score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n integers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the minimums of each pair is maximized.

Let me think about the example they provided:

In the first test case, n=1, and the list is [2,3]. So, I have to choose two numbers, which are 2 and 3. The minimum is 2, so the score is 2. That seems straightforward.

In the second test case, n=2, and the list is [1,1,2,1]. So, I need to perform two moves. One possible way is to pair (1,1) and get min(1,1)=1, and then pair (2,1) and get min(2,1)=1, for a total score of 2. They mentioned that it's not possible to get more than 2.

In the third test case, n=3, and all numbers are 1. So, pairing them up any way will give min=1 each time, and total score is 3.

From these examples, it seems like to maximize the score, I should pair smaller numbers together so that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. If I pair smaller numbers together, the minimum of each pair would be smaller, but maybe in the context of the whole list, it maximizes the overall sum.

Let me think differently. Suppose I sort the list in ascending order. Then, if I pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on, what happens?

In the second test case, sorted list is [1,1,1,2]. Pairing (1,1) and (1,2), minimums are 1 and 1, total 2.

If I pair (1,2) and (1,1), minimums are 1 and 1, total still 2.

So, in this case, it doesn't matter how I pair them, the total is the same.

But is that always the case?

Let's take another example. Suppose n=2, and the list is [1,2,3,4]. If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), minimums are 1 and 3, total 4. If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), minimums are 1 and 2, total 3. If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), minimums are 1 and 2, total 3. So, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives the maximum total of 4.

So, it seems that pairing the smallest numbers together and the next smallest together, and so on, gives the maximum sum of minimums.

Wait, in this case, pairing the smallest together gave a higher total than pairing them differently.

Wait, no. In the previous test case, pairing smallest together gave the same as other pairings.

Wait, in the second test case, pairing smallest together gave the same total as other pairings, but in the third test case, it also gave the same.

Wait, no, in the third test case, all numbers are the same, so it doesn't matter.

Another example: n=3, list=[1,2,3,4,5,6]. If I pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), minimums are 1,3,5, total 9. If I pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), minimums are 1,2,5, total 8. If I pair (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), minimums are 1,2,3, total 6. So, pairing the smallest together gives the maximum total.

Similarly, in the previous example with n=2, pairing smallest together gave a higher total.

So, it seems that sorting the list in ascending order and pairing the smallest numbers together in顺序 gives the maximum sum of minimums.

Wait, but in the second test case, it gave the same total as other pairings.

Wait, maybe it's not always strictly higher, but in some cases, it is.

Wait, perhaps it's the optimal strategy.

Let me think about why.

If I sort the list in ascending order, and pair the first two, then the next two, and so on, the minimum of each pair is the first element of each pair, since they are sorted.

So, in the sorted list, the minimum of each consecutive pair is the smaller one, which is as large as possible compared to other possible pairings.

Wait, in the second test case, all numbers are 1 except one 2, so pairing them any way gives the same minimums.

But in the example I made with [1,2,3,4,5,6], pairing smallest together gives minimums 1,3,5, which sum to 9, whereas other pairings give lower sums.

So, it seems that sorting and pairing consecutive numbers gives the maximum sum of minimums.

Is there a mathematical proof for this?

Yes, there is. It's based on the greedy algorithm.

If we sort the array in ascending order, and pair the smallest numbers together, we ensure that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, actually, in the sorted list, the minimum of each consecutive pair is the first element, which is smaller, but since the list is sorted, these first elements are the smallest possible, but in terms of sum, it maximizes the sum of these minimums.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a sorted list, the smallest numbers are paired together, and since they are the smallest, their minimum is as small as possible, but since we are summing these minimums, and the list is sorted, this sum is maximized compared to other possible pairings.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total sum.

Wait, let's consider that in a sorted list, the sum of the minimums of consecutive pairs is equal to the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., elements.

Because in pairs (a1,a2), (a3,a4), ..., the minimums are a1, a3, a5, etc.

So, in a sorted list, sum of a1 + a3 + a5 + ... is the sum of the smallest numbers.

But in the example, this sum was larger than other possible pairings.

Wait, in the example with [1,2,3,4,5,6], sum is 1+3+5=9, and other pairings give lower sums.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in sorted order, the sum of every other element starting from the first is the maximum possible sum of minimums.

Wait, but in the example, it seems to be the maximum.

Another way to think about it is that by sorting and pairing consecutive elements, we are minimizing the difference between the pairs, ensuring that the minimums are as large as possible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of maximizing the sum of minimums.

Given that, sorting and pairing consecutive elements seems to be the way to go.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it does.

The function `func` seems to be reading input and processing test cases.

First, it reads `n`, which is the number of test cases.

Then, it initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.

Then, for each test case (num in range(int(n))), it does the following:

- Initializes `s` to 0, which will be the score for this test case.

- Initializes an empty list `list2`.

- Reads `a`, which should be the value of n for this test case, but it's not used in the code.

- Reads `b`, which is the list of 2n integers as a string.

- Splits `b` into a list of strings `list1`.

- Converts `list1` to integers and stores in `list2`.

- Sorts `list2`.

- Then, it iterates through `list2` with a step of 2 and adds the element at index i to `s`.

- Appends `s` to `final`.

After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `final`, which are the scores for each test case.

Looking at this, it seems to be implementing the strategy I thought about: sort the list and sum every other element starting from the first.

But is this correct?

Wait, in the examples, this seems to work.

In the first test case, [2,3], sorted is [2,3], sum of every other element is 2.

In the second test case, [1,1,2,1], sorted is [1,1,1,2], sum of every other element is 1 + 1 = 2.

In the third test case, all 1's, sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Which matches the expected output.

In my earlier example, [1,2,3,4,5,6], sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which seems to be the maximum possible.

But is this always correct?

Wait, let's think about another example.

Suppose n=2, and the list is [1,4,3,2].

If I sort it: [1,2,3,4].

Sum of every other element: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternative pairing: pair (1,2) and (3,4), minimums 1 and 3, sum 4.

Another pairing: pair (1,3) and (2,4), minimums 1 and 2, sum 3.

Another pairing: pair (1,4) and (2,3), minimums 1 and 2, sum 3.

So, the sorted sum gives the maximum.

Another example: n=3, list=[3,1,6,2,5,4].

Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Sum of every other element: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Alternative pairing: pair (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), minimums 1,2,3, sum 6.

Another pairing: pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), minimums 1,3,5, sum 9.

So, sorted sum gives the maximum.

It seems consistent.

Is there a case where this might not work?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose n=2, list=[1,1,2,2].

Sorted: [1,1,2,2].

Sum of every other element: 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternative pairing: pair (1,2) and (1,2), minimums 1 and 1, sum 2.

So, sorted sum gives a higher total.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, it's summing 1 and 2, which is 3.

But pairing (1,2) and (1,2) gives sum 1+1=2.

So, in this case, the algorithm gives a higher sum.

But is it possible to get a higher sum than 3?

Well, pairing (1,1) and (2,2), minimums are 1 and 2, sum 3.

So, same as the algorithm.

Pairing (1,2) and (1,2), sum is 2.

So, indeed, the algorithm gives the maximum.

Another example: n=3, list=[1,1,2,2,3,3].

Sorted: [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Sum of every other element: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Alternative pairing: pair (1,3), (1,3), (2,2), minimums 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Another pairing: pair (1,2), (1,2), (3,3), minimums 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.

So, again, the algorithm gives a higher sum.

It seems that sorting and summing every other element starting from the first gives the maximum sum of minimums.

Is there a mathematical proof for this?

Yes, there is.

By sorting the array in ascending order, and pairing consecutive elements, we ensure that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Because, in the sorted list, the smallest elements are paired together, and the next smallest are paired together, and so on.

Thus, the sum of these minimums is maximized.

Any other pairing would result in at least one pair having a smaller minimum, which would reduce the total sum.

Therefore, this approach is correct.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to implement this approach.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n (although it doesn't use it in the code), reads the list of 2n integers, sorts it, and sums every other element starting from the first.

This should give the correct maximum score.

However, I need to check if there are any potential errors in the code.

Looking at the code:

- It reads `n` as the number of test cases.

- Then, for each test case, it reads `a`, which is n, but doesn't use it.

- Reads `b`, which is the list of 2n integers as a string.

- Splits `b` into `list1`.

- Converts `list1` to integers and stores in `list2`.

- Sorts `list2`.

- Then, sums every other element starting from index 0.

- Appends the sum to `final`.

- After all test cases, prints each element of `final`.

This seems correct.

But, I need to make sure that it handles all edge cases correctly.

Edge cases:

- n=1, list has 2 elements.

- n=50, list has 100 elements.

- All elements are the same.

- Elements are in ascending or descending order.

- Elements are randomly ordered.

From the examples and my own examples, it seems to handle these cases correctly.

Is there any error in the code?

Looking at the code, I see that it reads `a = input()`, which should be n for the test case, but it's not used in the code.

Then, `b = input()`, which is the list of 2n integers.

It splits `b` into `list1`, converts to integers and stores in `list2`, sorts it, and sums every other element starting from 0.

Seems fine.

Potential issues:

- If the list has duplicates, but the sorting should handle that.

- If the list has an even number of elements, which it should, since it's 2n.

- If n=0, but according to the problem, n >=1.

- If the inputs are at the boundary, like n=50, list has 100 elements, but since n<=50, it should be fine.

- If the numbers are large, up to 10^7, but since we're just sorting and summing, it should be fine.

- If the list is already sorted, which should not matter.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
