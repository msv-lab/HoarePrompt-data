Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year after the first one, and so on.

So, for example, if the first sign occurs every 3 years, the second every 2 years, and so on, I need to find out in which year all n signs will have occurred in this sequential manner.

First, I need to parse the input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line is t, the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there's an integer n, the number of signs, followed by n integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

My goal is, for each test case, to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, given that the signs must happen sequentially as described.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Starting with the first sign. It occurs in years that are multiples of a_1. So, the possible years for the first sign are a_1, 2*a_1, 3*a_1, etc.

Once the first sign occurs, say in year x, then we start waiting for the second sign in year x+1, and it should occur in some year that is a multiple of a_2.

Similarly, after the second sign occurs in year y, we start waiting for the third sign in year y+1, which should be a multiple of a_3, and so on.

So, for each sign after the first, we need to find the smallest year greater than the year the previous sign occurred where that sign occurs.

This sounds like, for each sign i from 2 to n, find the smallest year that is greater than the year the (i-1)th sign occurred and is a multiple of a_i.

Mathematically, if the (i-1)th sign occurred in year t, then the ith sign should occur in the smallest year greater than t that is a multiple of a_i.

To find the smallest year greater than t that is a multiple of a_i, I can use the formula:

next_year = t + a_i - (t % a_i)

If t is already a multiple of a_i, then next_year = t + a_i.

Wait, but according to the problem, the signs must occur strictly after the previous one. So, if the previous sign occurred in year t, then the next sign must occur in a year greater than t.

So, if t is already a multiple of a_i, then the next occurrence would be t + a_i.

Otherwise, it would be t + (a_i - (t % a_i)).

Yes, that formula works.

So, starting with the first sign occurring in year a_1, then for each subsequent sign, calculate the next year as described above.

Let me try with the first example in the note:

n=6

a = [3,2,4,5,9,18]

First sign: year 3

Wait for the second sign starting from year 4. Find the smallest year >=4 that is a multiple of 2. Which is 4.

Second sign: year 4

Wait for the third sign starting from year 5. Find the smallest year >=5 that is a multiple of 4. Which is 8.

Third sign: year 8

Wait for the fourth sign starting from year 9. Find the smallest year >=9 that is a multiple of 5. Which is 10.

Fourth sign: year 10

Wait for the fifth sign starting from year 11. Find the smallest year >=11 that is a multiple of 9. Which is 18.

Fifth sign: year 18

Wait for the sixth sign starting from year 19. Find the smallest year >=19 that is a multiple of 18. Which is 18*2=36.

Sixth sign: year 36

So, the answer is 36, which matches the first output in the example.

Another example:

n=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

First sign: year 1

Second sign: smallest year >1 that is multiple of 2 → year 2

Third sign: smallest year >2 that is multiple of 3 → year 3

Fourth sign: smallest year >3 that is multiple of 4 → year 4

Fifth sign: smallest year >4 that is multiple of 5 → year 5

So, the answer is 5, which matches the second output in the example.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

First sign: year 1

Second sign: smallest year >1 that is multiple of 1 → year 1

But according to the problem, signs must occur strictly after the previous one. So, waiting starting from year 2. Smallest year >=2 that is multiple of 1 is 2.

Second sign: year 2

Third sign: smallest year >2 that is multiple of 1 → year 3

Fourth sign: smallest year >3 that is multiple of 1 → year 4

Fifth sign: smallest year >4 that is multiple of 1 → year 5

So, the answer is 5, matching the third output in the example.

Last test case:

n=6

a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

First sign: year 50

Second sign: smallest year >50 that is multiple of 30. 50/30=1.666, so next multiple is 2*30=60.

Second sign: year 60

Third sign: smallest year >60 that is multiple of 711. 711 is greater than 60, so year 711.

Third sign: year 711

Fourth sign: smallest year >711 that is multiple of 200. 711 / 200 = 3.555, so next multiple is 4*200=800.

Fourth sign: year 800

Fifth sign: smallest year >800 that is multiple of 503. 800 / 503 ≈1.59, so next multiple is 2*503=1006.

Fifth sign: year 1006

Sixth sign: smallest year >1006 that is multiple of 1006. Next multiple is 2*1006=2012.

Sixth sign: year 2012

Which matches the fourth output in the example.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_1()

def func_1():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

index = 0

T = int(data[index])

index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(T):

n = int(data[index])

index += 1

a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))

index += n

last_year = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]

last_year = next_year

results.append(str(last_year))

sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

Let's analyze this code.

It reads all input at once using sys.stdin.read, splits it into tokens, and processes them sequentially.

It reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and then n integers representing a_1 to a_n.

It initializes last_year to a[0], which is correct for the first sign.

Then, for each subsequent sign from 1 to n-1, it calculates the next_year using the formula:

next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]

This formula is intended to find the smallest multiple of a[i] that is greater than last_year.

Let's break it down.

(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]

This is equivalent to finding the ceiling of (last_year + 1) divided by a[i], then multiplying by a[i].

In other words, it's finding the smallest multiple of a[i] that is greater than or equal to last_year + 1.

Which is exactly what we need, since we need the next occurrence after last_year.

Yes, this formula seems correct.

For example, if last_year is 3 and a[i] is 2:

(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = (4 + 1) // 2 * 2 = 5 // 2 * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

Which is correct, as the next multiple of 2 after 3 is 4.

Another example: last_year is 4, a[i] is 4.

(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = (5 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8 // 4 * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8

Which is correct, as the next multiple of 4 after 4 is 8.

Another example: last_year is 18, a[i] is 18.

(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = (19 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = (36) // 18 * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36

Which is correct.

So, the formula seems to work as intended.

The code then appends the last_year (which, after the loop, should be the year the nth sign occurs) to the results list, and finally prints all results separated by newlines.

Given that the logic matches the problem requirements and the formula for finding the next multiple is correct, I can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{36, 5, 5, 2012}} \]
