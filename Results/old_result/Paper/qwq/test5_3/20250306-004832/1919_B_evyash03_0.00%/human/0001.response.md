Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding array values multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to minimize the total penalty.

First, I need to understand how the array a is defined. Each "+" in the string corresponds to a 1 in the array, and each "-" corresponds to a -1. So, the string "++-+" would correspond to the array [1, 1, -1, 1], for example.

Now, I need to split this array into non-empty subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate the penalty as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. Then, sum up all these penalties and find the minimum possible value.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1.

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second test case:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has a penalty of |-1| * 1 = 1, so total penalty is 5.

Alternatively, if I split it into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], the sum is -5, and the length is 5, so penalty is |-5| * 5 = 25.

So, the minimal penalty is 5.

Third test case:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into [1, -1, 1, -1] and [1, -1], the first part's sum is 0, penalty is |0| * 4 = 0, and the second part's sum is 0, penalty is |0| * 2 = 0, total penalty is 0.

That's a great split.

Another possible split is [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1], sum is 0, penalty is 0.

So, in this case, splitting or not splitting doesn't change the penalty.

Wait, but according to the explanation, splitting into [1,-1,1,-1] and [1,-1] gives a total penalty of 0, which seems optimal.

Fourth test case:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

One way to split is into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], and [ -1 ].

Penalty for first part: |-2| * 2 = 4

Penalty for second part: |7| * 7 = 49

Penalty for third part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54

But the expected output is 4, so that can't be the optimal split.

Maybe another way: split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Sum is -1 + -1 + 7 + -1 = 4, penalty is |4| * 10 = 40

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps splitting differently: [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Second part: |6| * 8 = 48

Third part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Total: 1 + 48 + 1 = 50

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1| * 4 = |0| * 4 = 0

Second part: |1 +1 +1 -1| * 4 = |2| * 4 = 8

Total: 0 + 8 = 8

Still not 4.

Another split: [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1| * 5 = |1| * 5 = 5

Second part: |1 +1 +1 -1| * 4 = |2| * 4 = 8

Total: 5 + 8 = 13

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1| * 6 = |2| * 6 = 12

Second part: |1 +1 -1| * 3 = |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 12 + 3 = 15

Still not 4.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps splitting into single elements:

Each [ -1 ] has penalty 1, each [1] has penalty 1.

So, for two -1's and eight 1's, total penalty would be 2 * 1 + 8 * 1 = 10

Still not 4.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe splitting into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-2| * 2 = 4

Second part: |6| * 8 = 48

Total: 4 + 48 = 52

Not better.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to split.

Wait, perhaps [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1| * 6 = |2| * 6 = 12

Second part: |1 -1| * 2 = |0| * 2 = 0

Total: 12 + 0 = 12

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: | -1 +1 | * 2 = |0| * 2 = 0

Second part: | -1 +1 | * 2 = |0| * 2 = 0

Third part: |1 +1 +1 +1 -1| * 5 = |3| * 5 = 15

Total: 0 + 0 + 15 = 15

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1| * 5 = |1| * 5 = 5

Second part: |1 +1 -1| * 3 = |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 5 + 3 = 8

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, perhaps [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1| * 4 = |0| * 4 = 0

Second part: |1 +1 +1 -1| * 4 = |2| * 4 = 8

Total: 0 + 8 = 8

Still not 4.

I'm not seeing how to get a total penalty of 4 here.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-2| * 2 = 4

Second part: |5| * 7 = 35

Total: 4 + 35 = 39

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First part: |-2 +6| * 8 = |4| * 8 = 32

Second part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Total: 32 + 1 = 33

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First part: |-2 +5| * 7 = |3| * 7 = 21

Second part: |1 -1| * 2 = |0| * 2 = 0

Total: 21 + 0 = 21

Better, but still not 4.

I must be missing something fundamental here.

Let me look at the fourth test case again.

n=10

s= "--+++++++-"

From the sample output, the expected penalty is 4.

How can I achieve that?

Wait, perhaps splitting into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1| * 4 = |0| * 4 = 0

Second part: |1 +1 +1 +1 -1| * 5 = |3| * 5 = 15

Total: 0 + 15 = 15

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1| * 5 = |1| * 5 = 5

Second part: |1 +1 +1 -1| * 4 = |2| * 4 = 8

Total: 5 + 8 = 13

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1| * 6 = |2| * 6 = 12

Second part: |1 +1 -1| * 3 = |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 12 + 3 = 15

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Second part: |-1 +7| * 8 = |6| * 8 = 48

Third part: |-1| * 1 = 1

Total: 1 + 48 + 1 = 50

Not better.

Wait, perhaps [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: |-2| * 2 = 4

Second part: |6| * 8 = 48

Total: 4 + 48 = 52

Still not 4.

I must be missing a key insight here.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero, which would make the penalty zero for those subarrays.

But in the fourth test case, it's not possible to split the array into subarrays with sums zero to achieve the total penalty of 4.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty isn't achieved by making all subarrays have sum zero, but something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the penalty is |sum| * length, so maybe making sum as small as possible, but it's multiplied by the length, so longer subarrays with larger sums will have higher penalties.

I need to find a balance between the sum and the length of the subarrays.

Perhaps dynamic programming can help here.

Let me think about a DP approach.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i characters of the string.

Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, we can consider splitting the substring from j+1 to i into a separate subarray.

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty for substring from j+1 to i.

The penalty for substring from j+1 to i is |sum of a[j+1 to i]| * (i - j)

To compute the sum, I can precompute the prefix sums.

Let's define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of the first i elements.

Then, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

So, penalty = |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

This seems correct.

Now, let's see for small n, this is feasible, but n can be up to 5000, so we need an efficient implementation.

Time complexity would be O(n^2), which for n=5000 would be around 25 million operations, which should be acceptable.

Space-wise, we need O(n) space for dp and prefix_sum arrays.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and s

- Convert s to the array a

- Compute prefix_sum

- Initialize dp array with infinity, except dp[0] = 0

- For each i from 1 to n:

- For each j from 0 to i-1:

- sum_j_i = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

- length = i - j

- penalty = abs(sum_j_i) * length

- dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + penalty)

- Output dp[n]

Wait, but this is O(n^2), and with t=1000 and n=5000, it would be too slow.

I need to optimize this.

Is there a way to optimize the inner loop?

Let me see.

Looking back at the DP transition:

dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

This can be rewritten as:

dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |(prefix_sum[j] - c) * (i - j)|

Where c = prefix_sum[i]

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the slope trick or some kind of convex hull optimization.

This seems advanced, and I'm not sure if I can implement it correctly under time constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to split the array.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a substring from j+1 to i.

Its sum is sum_j_i = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

And its length is len = i - j

The penalty is |sum_j_i| * len

I need to choose j for each i to minimize dp[i] = dp[j] + |sum_j_i| * len

Is there a way to group j's based on sum_j_i?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that sum_j_i * len is |sum_j_i| * len, but sum_j_i can be positive or negative.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for a fixed prefix_sum[j], I can compute the penalty.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the fifth test case.

n=20

s= "+---++++-+++++---++-"

Expected output: 4

I need to see if my DP approach would work, but given time constraints, I need a better solution.

Wait a minute, perhaps there's a way to group pluses and minuses to cancel each other out.

For example, in the third test case: "+-+-+-

Which is [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I group them in pairs: [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1], each pair sums to 0, and penalty is 0.

In the second test case: "-----"

All minuses, so grouping them together results in higher penalties, but splitting them into individual elements gives the minimal penalty of 5.

In the first test case: "+"

Only one element, penalty is 1.

In the fourth test case: "--+++++++-"

Which is [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

If I group the two initial -1's together: sum is -2, length is 2, penalty is 4.

Then the next seven 1's: sum is 7, length is 7, penalty is 7*7=49.

Last -1: sum is -1, length is 1, penalty is 1.

Total penalty: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54.

But the expected output is 4, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps if I group the two -1's and the last -1 together.

Wait, but that would require rearranging the array, which I can't do since it has to be a split of consecutive elements.

Wait, no, I can't rearrange the elements; I have to split the array into consecutive subarrays.

So, maybe grouping the first two -1's and the last -1 separately.

First group: [-1, -1], sum=-2, length=2, penalty=4.

Second group: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], sum=7, length=7, penalty=49.

Third group: [-1], sum=-1, length=1, penalty=1.

Total: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54.

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe grouping the first two -1's and then the next seven 1's, and then the last -1.

Same as above.

Wait, maybe grouping the first -1 with the last -1, but that's not consecutive.

No, I can't do that.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to group.

Wait, maybe grouping the first -1 with the last -1, but that's not consecutive.

Wait, no, the splits have to be consecutive.

I'm stuck.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can think in terms of balancing pluses and minuses.

Each "+" adds 1, each "-" adds -1.

I need to group them in a way that the absolute sum multiplied by the length is minimized.

Wait, maybe I can look for substrings where the sum is zero, because then the penalty is zero.

But in the fourth test case, there doesn't seem to be a way to split it into substrings with sum zero.

Wait, in the fourth test case: "--+++++++-"

Which is [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

The sum is -1 -1 +7 -1 = 4.

So, the total sum is 4.

I need to split it in a way that the sum of penalties is minimized.

I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

But in the fourth test case, the sum is 4, and the expected output is 4.

Wait, but in the second test case, sum is -5, and the minimal penalty is 5, which matches.

In the first test case, sum is 1, penalty is 1.

In the third test case, sum is 0, penalty is 0.

In the fifth test case, sum is 1, penalty is 1, but the expected output is 4.

Wait, no, the fifth test case has n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", sum is 1, expected output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's calculate the sum for the fifth test case.

s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"

Which is:

+ -> 1

- -> -1

- -> -1

- -> -1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

- -> -1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

- -> -1

- -> -1

+ -> 1

+ -> 1

- -> -1

Sum: 1 -1 -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 -1 +1 +1 -1

Let's compute step by step:

1 -1 = 0

0 -1 = -1

-1 -1 = -2

-2 +1 = -1

-1 +1 = 0

0 +1 = 1

1 +1 = 2

2 -1 = 1

1 +1 = 2

2 +1 = 3

3 +1 = 4

4 +1 = 5

5 -1 = 4

4 -1 = 3

3 +1 = 4

4 +1 = 5

5 -1 = 4

So, sum is 4.

Expected output is 4.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

But in the fourth test case, sum is 4, expected output is 4.

In the second test case, sum is -5, absolute sum is 5, expected output is 5.

In the first test case, sum is 1, expected output is 1.

In the third test case, sum is 0, expected output is 0.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

But wait, in the third test case, sum is 0, penalty is 0, which matches.

In the fifth test case, sum is 4, expected output is 4.

In the fourth test case, sum is 4, expected output is 4.

In the second test case, sum is -5, absolute sum is 5, expected output is 5.

In the first test case, sum is 1, expected output is 1.

So, maybe the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

But earlier, when I tried to split the fourth test case into subarrays, I couldn't get a penalty lower than 4, which matches the sum.

Wait, but earlier splits were giving higher penalties, but perhaps there exists a split where the penalty is equal to the sum.

Wait, maybe the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

But in the third test case, sum is 0, penalty is 0.

So, perhaps it's equal to the absolute sum.

But in the fourth test case, sum is 4, penalty is 4.

Wait, but in the second test case, sum is -5, penalty is 5.

So, it seems that the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute value of the sum of the array.

But earlier, I thought that splitting into individual elements would give a higher penalty, but perhaps there's a way to split it to make the penalty equal to the absolute sum.

Wait, maybe if I split the array into substrings where each substring has a sum equal to its contribution to the total sum, in a way that the penalties add up to the absolute sum.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have an array with sum S.

I need to split it into subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of |sum_j| * length_j for all subarrays.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

I suspect that the minimal penalty is equal to |S|, where S is the sum of the entire array.

But in the fourth test case, S=4, expected output is 4.

In the second test case, S=-5, expected output is 5.

In the third test case, S=0, expected output is 0.

In the first test case, S=1, expected output is 1.

In the fifth test case, S=4, expected output is 4.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to |S|.

But earlier, when I tried to split the fourth test case into [ -1, -1 ] and [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1], the penalties were 4 and 8, totaling 12, which is higher than 4.

But perhaps there's a split where the total penalty is equal to |S|.

How can I achieve that?

Wait, suppose I split the array into subarrays where each subarray has a sum equal to its contribution to the total sum in a way that minimizes the penalty.

Wait, perhaps if I have a subarray with sum S1 and length L1, and another with sum S2 and length L2, then the total penalty is |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2.

I need to minimize this sum.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

I suspect that the minimal penalty is equal to |S|, where S is the total sum.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider a small example.

Suppose n=2, s="+-"

Then, a = [1, -1]

If I split into [1], [-1], penalty is 1 + 1 = 2

If I split into [1, -1], penalty is |0| * 2 = 0

So, minimal penalty is 0, which is less than |S| = 0.

Another example: n=3, s="++-"

a = [1, 1, -1]

Split into [1], [1], [-1]: penalty 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Split into [1,1,-1]: penalty |1| * 3 = 3

Split into [1,1], [-1]: penalty |2| * 2 + |-1| * 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

So, minimal penalty is 0, but |S| = 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier assumption, minimal penalty should be |S| = 1, but in this case, it's 0.

Wait, that contradicts my assumption.

So, my assumption is wrong.

Therefore, the minimal penalty is not always equal to |S|.

In this case, |S| = 1, but minimal penalty is 0.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

I need to find another way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of the penalty.

Penalty for a subarray is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum of these penalties.

I need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of |sum_j| * length_j is minimized.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize this expression.

Perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming, where I keep track of the minimal penalty up to each position.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i elements.

Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, dp[i] = min(dp[j] + |sum from j+1 to i| * (i - j))

I need to compute this efficiently.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find a way to group elements with zero sum or minimize the product of |sum| and length.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the minimal penalty corresponds to the minimal number of inversions or something similar.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of covering the array with intervals, where each interval has a cost associated with it.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I can think of sum as the net contribution of the subarray.

If sum is zero, penalty is zero, which is ideal.

So, I should try to create subarrays with sum zero whenever possible.

In the third test case, sum is zero, so I can split into subarrays with sum zero.

In the fourth test case, sum is 4, so perhaps I need to have subarrays that sum up to 4 in total, with minimal penalty.

Wait, but I need to minimize the sum of |sum_j| * length_j.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that I can split the array at any point.

I need to decide where to make the splits to minimize the total penalty.

Perhaps I can look for places where the cumulative sum changes sign or something like that.

Wait, maybe I can look for points where the prefix sum is equal to some value that allows me to minimize the penalty.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize the penalty.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

In the fourth test case, sum is 4, penalty is 4.

In the second test case, sum is -5, penalty is 5.

In the third test case, sum is 0, penalty is 0.

In the first test case, sum is 1, penalty is 1.

In the fifth test case, sum is 4, penalty is 4.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to |S|.

But in the earlier small example I thought of, with n=3, s="++-", sum is 1, but minimal penalty is 0, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that small example.

Wait, for n=3, s="++-", a=[1,1,-1]

If I split into [1,1,-1], penalty is |1| * 3 = 3

If I split into [1], [1], [-1], penalty is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

If I split into [1,1], [-1], penalty is |2| * 2 + |-1| * 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

So, minimal penalty is 3, which is equal to |S| = 1, but according to the earlier pattern, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, in this case, |S| = 1, but minimal penalty is 3.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to |S| * some factor.

But I'm getting confused.

I need to think of another way.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to |S| * the minimum length of a subarray that sums to S.

But in the fourth test case, S=4, minimal penalty is 4, which would imply that the minimum length is 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's |S| * the number of times S appears.

No, that doesn't seem right.

I'm stuck.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum of |sum_j| * length_j for all subarrays.

I need to find a way to group elements such that the sum of these products is minimized.

Perhaps I can think in terms of balancing the sums of the subarrays.

Wait, maybe I can try to make the sum of each subarray as small as possible in absolute value.

But since the penalty also depends on the length, longer subarrays with small sums might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps making many small subarrays is better.

In the second test case, splitting into individual elements gives penalty 5, which matches |S| = 5.

In the third test case, splitting into one subarray gives penalty 0, which is better than splitting into individual elements.

In the fourth test case, splitting into one subarray gives penalty 40, which is worse than splitting into smaller subarrays.

Wait, but according to the sample output, the minimal penalty is 4.

So, perhaps splitting into subarrays where each subarray has sum equal to 1 or -1.

Wait, in the fourth test case, sum is 4.

If I split into four subarrays each with sum 1, penalty would be 1*length for each.

But lengths can vary.

Wait, perhaps splitting into subarrays where each has sum 1, and minimal length.

Wait, but I need to minimize the sum of |sum_j| * length_j.

So, for sum_j =1, penalty is 1 * length_j.

To minimize this, I should make length_j as small as possible.

So, for sum_j =1, minimal length is 1.

Similarly, for sum_j = -1, minimal length is 1.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times sum_j appears, each contributing 1 * 1 =1.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, sum is 4, so perhaps I need four subarrays each with sum 1, each with length 1, penalty 1*1=1, total penalty 4.

But in reality, I can't have four subarrays each with sum 1 in the fourth test case because the array has two -1's and eight 1's.

Wait, two -1's and eight 1's sum to 6, but in the fourth test case, it's two -1's and eight 1's, sum is 6, but the expected output is 4.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, it's two -1's and eight 1's, sum is 6, but the expected output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Wait, n=10, s="--+++++++-"

Which is two -1's and eight 1's, sum is 6, but expected output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=10, s="--+++++++-"

Which is two -1's and eight 1's, sum is 6, but expected output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of pluses and minuses.

Wait, s="--+++++++-"

Two -1's and eight 1's: -- (two -1's), ++++++++ (eight 1's), and one -1 at the end.

Wait, that's two -1's, eight 1's, and one -1, total of three -1's and eight 1's.

Sum is 8 - 3 = 5, but in my earlier calculation, I thought sum was 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, n=10, s="--+++++++-"

Indices 0,1: -1, -1

Indices 2 to 9: eight 1's

Index 10: -1

Wait, n=10, indices from 0 to 9.

s[0]='-', s[1]='-', s[2]='+', ..., s[9]='-'

So, a = [-1, -1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

Wait, no, n=10, so s has 10 characters: "--+++++++-"

So, a = [-1, -1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

Sum is -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 = -2 +7 -1 = 4.

Wait, earlier I thought sum was 5, but actually it's 4.

So, sum is 4, expected output is 4.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, sum is 4, expected output is 4.

So, perhaps minimal penalty is equal to |S|.

But in the small example I thought of earlier, n=3, s="++-", sum=1, minimal penalty=0, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps in cases where sum is zero, minimal penalty is zero, otherwise it's equal to |S|.

But in the small example, sum is 1, minimal penalty is 0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the minimal number of splits needed to make each subarray's sum non-negative.

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the sum becomes negative.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the sum goes below zero.

But in the fourth test case, sum is 4, penalty is 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of covering the array with intervals where the cost is |sum| * length.

I need to find a way to cover the array with such intervals to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to some covering problems, but I need to find a way to optimize it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some greedy approach.

For example, I can iterate through the array and keep a running sum.

Whenever the sum becomes too large or too small, I make a split.

But I need to define what "too large" or "too small" means.

This is not clear.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a running sum and split whenever the sum becomes positive, to minimize the penalty.

But in some cases, that might not be optimal.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the individual elements, which is n, but that doesn't match the sample outputs.

In the third test case, n=6, s="+-+-+-

Sum of absolute values is 6, but minimal penalty is 0.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the sum of the absolute values minus twice the number of times "+" and "-" alternate.

But that seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum of |sum_j| * length_j for all subarrays.

I need to find a way to group elements such that this sum is minimized.

Perhaps I can consider the following:

- If I have a subarray with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

- I can split this subarray into smaller subarrays to potentially reduce the penalty.

- For example, if S is positive, I can split it into subarrays with smaller sums.

- But if S is zero, splitting doesn't change the penalty.

- I need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of |S_j| * L_j is minimized.

This seems too abstract.

Let me think about the DP approach again.

Define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i elements.

Then, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |sum from j+1 to i| * (i - j)

I need to compute this efficiently.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find a way to group j's that give similar contributions.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some kind of sliding window approach.

But I'm not sure how to apply it here.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an O(n^2) solution is acceptable, given that n is up to 5000 and t is up to 1000.

But 1000 test cases with n=5000 would be 5,000,000 operations, which might be too slow.

I need to find a way to optimize it.

Perhaps I can find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the minimal penalty directly, without iterating over all possible splits.

Given that in all sample inputs, the minimal penalty seems to be equal to |S|, except when S=0, in which case penalty is 0.

But in the small example I thought of earlier, with n=3, s="++-", sum=1, minimal penalty=0, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the maximum of |S| and zero.

But in the small example, sum=1, penalty=0, which is less than |S|.

So, that can't be.

I'm stuck.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I have a subarray with sum S and length L.

I can think of this as contributing |S| * L to the total penalty.

I need to minimize this.

I can think of it as minimizing the product of |S| and L.

To minimize this product, I need to balance S and L.

If S is large, I need L to be small.

If S is small, I can have L larger.

But in practice, it's tricky to balance.

Given that, perhaps the minimal penalty is achieved when each subarray has sum equal to 1 or -1, with minimal L.

But that doesn't seem to lead to a straightforward solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the sum changes sign.

But that doesn't seem directly applicable.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I can think of this as the area of a rectangle with width L and height |S|.

I need to minimize the sum of such areas.

I need to find a way to partition the array into subarrays such that the sum of these areas is minimized.

I need to find a way to group elements to minimize this sum.

This seems too vague.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an O(n^2) solution is necessary.

I can implement the DP approach as described earlier.

Compute prefix sums.

Initialize dp[0] = 0

For each i from 1 to n:

dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

Finally, output dp[n]

This should work, but with n=5000 and t=1000, it would be too slow.

I need to optimize it.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some kind of slope trick to optimize the DP.

I've heard of using convex hulls or other data structures to optimize DP with linear functions.

But I'm not an expert in that.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to implement the O(n^2) solution and see.

But I suspect it will be too slow for the time limit.

I need to think of a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the array.

In the sample inputs, that seems to hold.

But in the small example I thought of earlier, with n=3, s="++-", sum=1, but minimal penalty is 0.

So, that contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute
