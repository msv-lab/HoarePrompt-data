Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and I need to find its area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x and y axes. So, the coordinates should reflect that alignment.

Given that, the coordinates of the square's corners should consist of two unique x-values and two unique y-values. Each corner will have a combination of one x and one y from these pairs.

For example, if the x-values are a and b, and the y-values are c and d, then the corners should be:

- (a, c)

- (a, d)

- (b, c)

- (b, d)

Now, the problem states that the square has a positive area, which means that a ≠ b and c ≠ d.

My task is to compute the area of this square. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, and the area is just the square of the side length.

So, I need to find the side length from the given coordinates and then compute its square.

Let me think about how to find the side length.

Given that the sides are parallel to the axes, the side length should be equal to the difference between the x-values (|a - b|) or the difference between the y-values (|c - d|). Since it's a square, both differences should be equal.

Wait, actually, in a square, the lengths of the sides should be equal, so |a - b| should equal |c - d|.

But the problem says that the square has positive area, so |a - b| > 0 and |c - d| > 0.

Given that, I can calculate the side length as |a - b| or |c - d|, and then the area would be side_length squared.

Now, the challenge is that the coordinates are provided in a random order. So, I need a way to identify the unique x and y values from the four points.

One way to do this is to collect all x-coordinates and all y-coordinates separately, then find the unique values in each.

Since there should be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values, I can sort them or use sets to get these unique values.

Once I have the unique x-values and unique y-values, I can compute the differences between them to find the side lengths.

Then, I can compute the area by squaring the side length.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. The smallest possible square: side length 1.

For example, coordinates like (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).

2. Squares with larger side lengths.

For example, side length 3, with coordinates like (1,2), (4,2), (1,5), (4,5).

3. Squares with negative coordinates.

For example, (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1).

4. Squares where the coordinates are not provided in order.

For example, provided in random order like (4,5), (1,2), (4,2), (1,5).

I need to make sure that my method works regardless of the order of the points.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it correctly implements this logic.

The program is defined in a function called `func()`. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners.

It stores these coordinates in a list called `coord`.

Then, it sorts the list of coordinates.

After sorting, it calculates two values `p1` and `p2`, which seem to be distances squared between specific points.

Then, it computes the area as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

Wait, that seems off.

Let me trace through an example to see what's happening.

Take the first example from the input:

1

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

So, t=1, and the four coordinates are (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2).

The program collects these into the list `coord`.

Then, it sorts `coord`. Sorting a list of tuples in Python sorts based on the first element, then the second.

So, sorted `coord` would be:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

Now, it calculates `p1` as the squared distance between the first and second points: (1,2) and (1,5).

Squared distance: (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Similarly, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points: (4,2) and (4,5).

Squared distance: (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Then, it computes `res` as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

So, res = |sqrt(9) * sqrt(9)| = |3 * 3| = 9

Which matches the first output in the example.

Similarly, for the second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Sorted coordinates: (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1: (-1,1) - (-1,-1) => 0 + 4 = 4

p2: (1,1) - (1,-1) => 0 + 4 = 4

res: |sqrt(4) * sqrt(4)| = |2 * 2| = 4

Which matches the second output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Sorted coordinates: (17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1: (17,39) - (17,11) => 0 + 784 = 784

p2: (45,39) - (45,11) => 0 + 784 = 784

res: |sqrt(784) * sqrt(784)| = |28 * 28| = 784

Which matches the third output.

So, in these cases, it seems to work correctly.

But I need to verify if this logic is generally correct.

Looking back, the program calculates the squared distances between points that are assumed to be vertical or horizontal sides after sorting.

But, in general, for a square with sides parallel to the axes, sorting the coordinates should group the points with the same x or y together.

Wait, in the sorting, points with the same x are grouped together.

Then, p1 and p2 are calculated as the squared distances between these grouped points, which should be the side lengths squared.

Then, taking the square roots gives the side lengths, and multiplying them gives the area.

But wait, in a square, all sides are equal, so multiplying two side lengths should give the area only if it's a rectangle, but since it's a square, it's correct.

But actually, for a square, area is side_length squared.

So, if they're multiplying two side lengths, that's equivalent to side_length squared, so it's correct.

But this assumes that p1 and p2 are both equal to side_length squared.

Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, and after sorting, the points are grouped by their x-coordinates, so the differences calculated are indeed the side lengths.

Hence, this seems correct.

But I need to think about whether this will always hold, regardless of the ordering of the points.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the points are:

(0,0)

(0,3)

(3,0)

(3,3)

Sorted coordinates: (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3)

p1: (0,3) - (0,0) => 0 + 9 = 9

p2: (3,3) - (3,0) => 0 + 9 = 9

res: |3 * 3| = 9

Which is correct, area is 9.

Another example:

(2,3)

(2,7)

(5,3)

(5,7)

Sorted coordinates: (2,3), (2,7), (5,3), (5,7)

p1: (2,7) - (2,3) => 0 + 16 = 16

p2: (5,7) - (5,3) => 0 + 16 = 16

res: |4 * 4| = 16

Correct area is 16.

Now, what if the points are provided in a different order?

Say:

(5,3)

(2,7)

(2,3)

(5,7)

Sorted coordinates: (2,3), (2,7), (5,3), (5,7)

Same as above.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but let's consider a case where the x-values are the same but y-values differ.

Wait, no, in a square with sides parallel to the axes, x-values and y-values should both have two unique values.

Wait, but in the sorting, it's sorting based on x first, then y.

So, points with the same x are grouped together.

Then, p1 is the distance between the first two points, which should be the vertical distance, and p2 is the distance between the last two points, which should also be the vertical distance.

Then, multiplying their square roots gives the area.

But, in a square, this should be equal to side_length squared.

Hence, it seems correct.

But perhaps there's a better way to compute the area.

Alternative approach:

Collect all x and y coordinates separately.

Find the unique x-values and unique y-values.

Compute the differences between the unique x-values and unique y-values.

Since it's a square, these differences should be equal.

Then, area is (max(x) - min(x))^2 or (max(y) - min(y))^2.

This seems more straightforward.

In the given program, it's effectively doing something similar by calculating the distances between specific points.

But, in the provided program, it's assuming that after sorting, the first two points have the same x and differ in y, and the last two points have the same x and differ in y.

Then, p1 and p2 are the squared vertical distances.

Then, multiplying their square roots gives the area.

This works because in a square, the vertical and horizontal side lengths are equal.

Hence, sqrt(p1) and sqrt(p2) should be equal to the side length.

Thus, their product is side_length squared, which is the area.

Hence, this logic is correct.

But perhaps it's a bit convoluted.

A simpler way would be to find the unique x-values and unique y-values, compute the difference between max and min for x and y, and ensure they are equal (since it's a square), then output the area as that difference squared.

But the given program achieves the same result, just in a different way.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{9} \]

\[ \boxed{4} \]

\[ \boxed{784} \]

**Correctness:** **True**
