Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up (U) or facing down (D). Alice and Bob take turns playing the game, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player has to choose a coin that's facing up, remove it, and flip the two coins that are adjacent to it. There are some special cases mentioned: if only two coins are left and one is chosen, the other won't be flipped because it would be flipped twice. If only one coin is left and it's facing up, it gets removed, and if it's facing down, the player loses because there's no facing-up coin to choose.

The task is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally. I need to read multiple test cases, each consisting of a number n and a string s of length n containing "U" and "D".

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. The coins are in a circle, so the first coin is adjacent to the last one. When a facing-up coin is removed, its two adjacent coins are flipped. Flipping a coin means changing "U" to "D" or "D" to "U".

I need to figure out a strategy to determine the winner without simulating the entire game, as n can be up to 100, and t can be up to 100, so efficiency is key.

Let me think about game theory here. This seems like an impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them at any state. Maybe I can use the concept of Nimbers or find some invariant that determines the winner based on the initial position.

Looking at the example provided:

Test case 1:

n = 5

s = U U D U D

Alice's move: removes the first U, flips the second U and the fifth D → s becomes D U D U D → After removal and flips: D D U D

Bob's move: removes the second D (but it's D, so he can't choose it). Wait, no, he has to choose a U. So he chooses the third U, flips the second D and the fourth D → s becomes D D D D → After removal: D D D

Alice's move: chooses the third D (wait, it's D, can't choose it). Oh, she has to choose a U, but there are no U's left. Wait, in the example, it seems like after Bob's move, there are two U's left. Let me check the example again.

Wait, in the example explanation, after Alice's first move, s becomes "DDUU". Wait, that doesn't match the initial string provided in the test case. Maybe it's a different example.

Wait, the example in the problem is:

Input:

3

5

UUDUD

5

UDDUD

2

UU

Output:

YES

NO

NO

And the note explains one possible sequence of moves for the first test case.

But perhaps I can look for a pattern or a mathematical property that determines the winner based on the initial configuration.

Let me consider smaller values of n and see who wins.

Case 1: n=1

If s="U", Alice removes it, no flips needed, Bob has no moves, Alice wins.

If s="D", Alice cannot make a move, she loses.

Case 2: n=2

Subcases:

- UU: Alice removes one U, flips the other U to D. Now s=UD. Bob removes U, flips nothing (since only one coin left), Alice has no move, Bob wins.

- UD: Alice removes U, flips D to U, now s=U. Bob removes U, Alice loses.

- DU: Alice removes nothing, as there's no U, she loses.

- DD: Alice cannot make a move, loses.

Case 3: n=3

Subcases:

- UUU: Alice removes one U, flips the other two to D, s=UDU. Bob removes U, flips the two D's, s=DD. Alice cannot move, Bob wins.

- UUD: Alice removes a U, say the first one, flips the second U and the third D to U, s=DUU. Bob removes a U, say the second one, flips the first D and the third U to D and D, s=DD. Alice cannot move, Bob wins.

- UDU: Similar analysis.

This seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the program provided:

It reads the input, parses the number of test cases, and for each test case, reads n and s.

Then it counts the number of 'U's in s. If the count of 'U' is odd, it prints 'YES', else 'NO'.

So, the logic is: if the number of 'U's is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Is this correct?

Looking back at the cases I considered:

- n=1, s="U": count_u=1 (odd) → Alice wins (YES)

- n=1, s="D": count_u=0 (even) → Bob wins (NO)

- n=2, s="UU": count_u=2 (even) → Bob wins (NO)

- n=2, s="UD": count_u=1 (odd) → Alice wins (YES)

- n=2, s="DU": count_u=1 (odd) → Alice wins (YES)

- n=2, s="DD": count_u=0 (even) → Bob wins (NO)

- n=3, s="UUU": count_u=3 (odd) → Alice wins (YES)

- n=3, s="UUD": count_u=2 (even) → Bob wins (NO)

But in my earlier analysis, for n=3, s="UUU", it seems Bob wins, but according to this program, Alice wins if count_u is odd.

Wait, maybe my earlier analysis is wrong.

Wait, in n=3, s="UUU":

- Alice removes one U, flips the other two to D, s becomes "UDU"

- Bob removes U, flips the two D's to U, s becomes "UU"

- Alice removes one U, flips the other U to D, s becomes "D"

- Bob removes D, cannot flip anything, Alice has no move, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins, but count_u=3 is odd, which according to the program, Alice wins (YES), but actually Bob wins.

This suggests the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for n=5, s="UUDUD", the output is "YES", meaning Alice wins.

According to the program, count_u=3 (odd), so it prints "YES", which matches the example.

But in my earlier analysis for n=3, count_u=3 (odd), but Alice doesn't win.

Wait, maybe my analysis is incorrect.

Let me try to simulate n=5, s="UUDUD" as in the example.

Initial s: U U D U D

Alice removes first U, flips second U and fifth D:

- Remove first U: s becomes U D U D

- Flip second U to D and fifth D to U: s becomes U D D U

Wait, but in the note, it says s becomes "DDUU". Maybe I'm misunderstanding the flipping.

Wait, perhaps removing a coin and flipping the adjacent coins is done in a way that the flips happen before removal.

Wait, the problem says: chooses a facing-up coin, removes it, and flips the two coins that are adjacent to it.

So, choose a U, remove it, then flip its adjacent coins.

So, in n=5, s="U U D U D"

Alice chooses the first U:

- Remove the first U: s becomes U D U D

- Flip the coins adjacent to the first U, which are the second U and the fifth D.

- Flip second U to D: s becomes D D U D

- Flip fifth D to U: s becomes D D U U

So, s becomes "D D U U"

Bob's turn:

- Choose a U, say the third U:

- Remove the third U: s becomes D D U

- Flip the adjacent coins: second D and fourth U.

- Flip second D to U: s becomes D U U

- Flip fourth U to D: s becomes D U D

Alice's turn:

- Choose a U, say the second U:

- Remove the second U: s becomes D D

- Flip the adjacent coins: first D and third D.

- Flip first D to U: s becomes U D

- Flip third D to U: s becomes U U

Bob's turn:

- Choose a U, say the first U:

- Remove the first U: s becomes U

- Flip the adjacent coins: the only remaining U.

- But since it's a single coin, no flips are performed.

Alice's turn:

- Choose the remaining U:

- Remove it, no flips needed.

- No coins left.

Bob cannot make a move, so Bob loses, Alice wins.

This matches the program's output for n=5, s="UUDUD": count_u=3 (odd), so "YES".

But in my earlier n=3, s="UUU" case, count_u=3 (odd), but according to my simulation, Bob wins.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that simulation.

Let's try n=3, s="UUU":

- Alice chooses the first U:

- Remove first U: s becomes U U

- Flip the adjacent coins: second U and third U.

- Flip second U to D: s becomes D U

- Flip third U to D: s becomes D D

- Now s="D D"

- Bob cannot choose any U, so Bob loses.

Wait, in this case, Alice wins, which matches the program's output (count_u=3, odd, "YES").

But earlier I thought Bob wins, but actually Alice wins.

Another test case: n=2, s="UU"

- Alice chooses the first U:

- Remove first U: s becomes U

- Flip the adjacent coins: second U and, in circle, the second U again.

- But since it's only one coin left, no flips are performed.

- Now s="U"

- Bob chooses the U:

- Remove U, no flips needed.

- No coins left.

- Alice cannot make a move, so Alice loses.

So, Bob wins, which matches the program's output (count_u=2, even, "NO").

Another test case: n=2, s="UD"

- Alice chooses the U:

- Remove U, flips the adjacent D to U.

- Now s="U"

- Bob chooses the U:

- Remove U, no flips needed.

- No coins left.

- Alice cannot make a move, so Alice loses.

Which matches the program's output (count_u=1, odd, "YES"), but in this simulation, Bob wins.

Wait, no. According to the program, count_u=1 (odd), so "YES" (Alice wins), but in my simulation, Alice loses.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in this case, n=2, s="UD"

- Alice chooses U:

- Remove U, flips the adjacent D to U.

- Now s="U"

- Bob chooses U:

- Remove U, no flips needed.

- No coins left.

- Alice cannot make a move, so Alice loses.

But according to the program, count_u=1 (odd), so "YES" (Alice wins), which contradicts this simulation.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the flips.

Let's see: n=2, s="UD"

- Alice chooses U (index 1):

- Remove U at index 1:

- Flip adjacent coins: index 2 (D to U) and index 1 (but it's removed).

- So s becomes "U"

- Bob chooses U:

- Remove U, no flips needed.

- No coins left.

- Alice cannot move, so Alice loses.

So, in this case, Bob wins, but the program outputs "YES" (Alice wins), which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, s="UUDUD", the program outputs "YES", which matches the example.

But in n=2, s="UD", the program outputs "NO" (Bob wins), which matches my simulation.

Wait, no, in n=2, s="UD", count_u=1 (odd), program outputs "YES", but in my simulation, Alice loses.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Wait, looking back at the program:

def func_1():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])

index = 1

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index])

s = data[index + 1]

index += 2

count_u = s.count('U')

if count_u % 2 == 1:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it's checking if the number of 'U's is odd, then Alice wins, else Bob wins.

But in my simulation for n=2, s="UD", count_u=1 (odd), Alice loses, but program says "YES" (Alice wins). So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, s="UUDUD", count_u=3 (odd), Alice wins, which matches the program.

But for n=2, s="UD", count_u=1 (odd), Alice loses, which contradicts the program.

Wait, perhaps the program is correct for some cases but not all.

Wait, perhaps the correct rule is different.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the game is equivalent to some known impartial game, like Nim.

I need to find the Grundy number for each position.

But that might be too time-consuming for this analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical pattern based on the number of 'U's and the parity.

In the program, it's checking the parity of the count of 'U's.

From the simulations:

- n=1, s="U": count_u=1 (odd), Alice wins.

- n=1, s="D": count_u=0 (even), Alice loses.

- n=2, s="UU": count_u=2 (even), Alice loses.

- n=2, s="UD": count_u=1 (odd), Alice loses.

Wait, in n=2, s="UD", according to my simulation, Alice chooses U, removes it, flips the adjacent D to U, resulting in s="U". Then Bob chooses U, removes it, and Alice cannot move. So Alice loses.

But according to the program, count_u=1 (odd), so it should print "YES" (Alice wins), which is incorrect.

Similarly, for n=2, s="UU": count_u=2 (even), program prints "NO" (Bob wins), which matches my simulation where Bob wins.

For n=5, s="UUDUD": count_u=3 (odd), Alice wins, which matches the program.

But for n=2, s="UD": count_u=1 (odd), Alice loses, so the program is incorrect in this case.

Perhaps the program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the arrangement of the coins, only the count of 'U's.

But in the case of n=2, s="UD", count_u=1 (odd), Alice loses, which contradicts the program's output of "YES".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
