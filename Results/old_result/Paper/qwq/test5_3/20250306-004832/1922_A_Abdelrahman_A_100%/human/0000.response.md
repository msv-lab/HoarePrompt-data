Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of s must be exactly the same as t's i-th character.

- If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of s must be different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there's at least one position where the condition fails.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a template t such that:

- a matches t based on the rules above.

- b matches t based on the rules above.

- c does not match t based on the rules above.

I need to find if such a t exists.

Let me consider the positions one by one.

For each position i from 1 to n:

- Let's look at a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If t[i] is lowercase, then:

- a[i] must be equal to t[i] (lowercase).

- b[i] must be equal to t[i] (lowercase).

- c[i] must be equal to t[i] (lowercase).

But for c not to match, there must be at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition. So, if I make t[i] lowercase, then for c[i], it must be equal to t[i] to match, so to make c not match, c[i] must be different from t[i].

Wait, that's not quite right.

Wait, if t[i] is lowercase, then for c to not match, c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

But if I set t[i] to be a lowercase character equal to a[i] and b[i], then for c to not match, c[i] must be different from t[i].

So, in this case, if a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then setting t[i] as lowercase with t[i] = a[i] would satisfy the conditions for this position.

But c might match in other positions, so I need to ensure that there's at least one position where c does not match.

Wait, but if a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then setting t[i] as lowercase with t[i] = a[i] would make c not match at this position.

So, in this case, c does not match at position i.

For other positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I would need to set t[i] in such a way that c does not match.

Wait, but if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then setting t[i] as lowercase would make c match, which is not desired.

Wait, but I need c to not match the template, so I need at least one position where c does not match.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], setting t[i] as lowercase with t[i] = a[i] would make c not match at that position.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I need to set t[i] in a way that c does not match.

Wait, if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], and I set t[i] as uppercase, then t[i] would be an uppercase version of a[i], and c[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], which is a[i].

But c[i] is equal to a[i], so c[i] would not be different from a[i], so c would not match at this position.

Wait, no.

If t[i] is uppercase, say 'A', and a[i] == 'a', b[i] == 'a', c[i] == 'a'.

Then, for a and b to match, they must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], which is 'a'.

But a[i] == 'a', which is not different from 'a', so they would not match.

Wait, that's not right.

Wait, the condition is:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

So, if t[i] is 'A', then s[i] must be different from 'a'.

In this case, a[i] == 'a', which is not different from 'a', so a does not match.

Wait, that's a problem.

So, if t[i] is uppercase, then for a and b to match, they must have s[i] different from the lowercase version of t[i].

But a and b are both 'a', and lowercase version of t[i] is 'a', so s[i] must be different from 'a'.

But a[i] == 'a', which is not different from 'a', so a does not match.

But I need a to match the template.

So, in this case, if t[i] is uppercase, a and b do not match, which is not what I want.

So, for a and b to match when t[i] is uppercase, they must have s[i] different from the lowercase version of t[i].

So, in this case, if a[i] == 'a', and t[i] is 'A', then a[i] must be different from 'a', but it's not, so a does not match.

Similarly for b.

So, to make a and b match when t[i] is uppercase, a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

But in this case, a[i] == b[i] == 'a', so t[i] cannot be 'A'.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different uppercase letter for t[i].

If t[i] is 'B', then lowercase version is 'b', so a[i] == 'a' which is different from 'b', so a matches.

Similarly, b[i] == 'a' which is different from 'b', so b matches.

And c[i] == 'a' which is different from 'b', so c also matches.

But I need c to not match.

So, in this case, choosing t[i] as 'B' makes all three match, which is not what I want.

Wait, but the problem is to find a template t where a and b match, but c does not.

So, in this case, with a[i] == b[i] == c[i] == 'a', choosing t[i] as 'B' makes all three match, which is not desired.

Alternatively, if I choose t[i] as lowercase, say 'a', then a and b match (since a[i] == 'a' and b[i] == 'a'), and c does not match if c[i] != 'a'.

But in this case, c[i] == 'a', so c matches, which is not desired.

So, in this specific case, it seems impossible to find such a template t.

Wait, maybe I need to consider multiple positions.

Let's consider the general approach.

For each position i:

- Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- Subcase 1: c[i] == a[i]

- In this subcase, if I set t[i] as lowercase 'a[i]', then a and b match, but c also matches.

- If I set t[i] as uppercase, say 'A', then a and b need to be different from 'a', but they are 'a', which doesn't satisfy, so they don't match.

- So, in this subcase, it's impossible to find a t[i] that makes a and b match but c does not.

- Subcase 2: c[i] != a[i]

- If I set t[i] as lowercase 'a[i]', then a and b match, and c does not match because c[i] != 'a[i]'.

- So, in this subcase, I can set t[i] as lowercase 'a[i]', and it satisfies the conditions.

- Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

- Subcase 1: c[i] == a[i]

- If I set t[i] as uppercase, with t[i] corresponding to a[i], then a matches (since a[i] != lowercase(t[i])), and b matches if b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

- Wait, but a[i] != b[i], so need to ensure that both a and b match.

- This seems complicated; perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of constraints for t[i] based on a, b, and c.

For each position i:

- Constraints for t[i] based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

- I need to find if there's a t[i] that satisfies the conditions for a and b to match, and c to not match.

Let me formalize the conditions:

- For a to match t:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

- Similarly for b.

- For c to not match t:

- There exists at least one i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, I need to choose t[i] for each i such that:

- For a and b:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

- For c:

- There exists at least one i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

This seems complex. Maybe I can think in terms of possible choices for t[i] at each position.

Let's consider that for each position i, t[i] can be:

- Any lowercase letter: in this case, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i].

- Any uppercase letter: in this case, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, but this seems too restrictive.

Wait, let's think about the possibilities.

For t[i], if I choose a lowercase letter, say 'x':

- a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

So, in this case, a[i] == b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'

For t[i], if I choose an uppercase letter, say 'X':

- a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x'

So, in this case, a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'

Now, for each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then a[i] == b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'

Wait, but in the first case, if a[i] == b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x', then I can choose t[i] as 'x' (lowercase).

In the second case, if a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x', then I can choose t[i] as 'X' (uppercase).

But I need to choose t[i] such that for all positions, a and b match t, and there is at least one position where c does not match t.

So, I need to ensure that:

- For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- And there exists at least one position j where:

- If t[j] is lowercase, then c[j] != t[j]

- If t[j] is uppercase, then c[j] == lowercase(t[j])

Now, to find if such a t exists, I need to check for each position what possible choices t[i] can have based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me consider that for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Then, to make a and b match t:

- Option 1: Set t[i] as lowercase a[i] (assuming a[i] == b[i])

- In this case, c[i] must not be equal to a[i] for c to not match at this position.

- Option 2: Set t[i] as uppercase X, where X != a[i]

- But in this case, a[i] != lowercase(X), which requires a[i] != x, but a[i] == b[i], so this would require a[i] != x, which may not be true.

- Wait, this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of constraints for each position.

For each position i:

- Let's define possible choices for t[i] based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

- Then, ensure that for at least one position, c does not match t based on the chosen t[i].

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can look for positions where c differs from a and b, and use that to force c to not match.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], which makes a and b match, and c not match at that position.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I need to set t[i] as uppercase X, where X corresponds to a[i], but this creates issues as seen earlier.

Wait, perhaps in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match, because whatever I choose for t[i], c will match.

Wait, no.

If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], and I set t[i] as uppercase X, where X corresponds to a[i], then:

- For a and b to match, they need to have a[i] != lowercase(X), which is a[i] != a[i], which is false.

- So, a and b do not match.

- For c, c[i] == lowercase(X), so c does not match.

This is not what I want.

Wait, there's confusion here.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase X, then:

- For a to match: a[i] != lowercase(X)

- For b to match: b[i] != lowercase(X)

- For c to not match: c[i] == lowercase(X)

So, in the case where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], setting t[i] as uppercase X, where X corresponds to a[i], then:

- a[i] != lowercase(X) is false, because a[i] == lowercase(X)

- So, a does not match

- Similarly, b does not match

- c matches if c[i] == lowercase(X), which it is.

So, this is not satisfying the conditions.

Alternatively, if I set t[i] as uppercase Y, where Y != a[i], then:

- a[i] != lowercase(Y), which is true if Y != a[i]

- b[i] != lowercase(Y), which is true if Y != b[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(Y), which is true if Y == c[i]

But since a[i] == b[i] == c[i], Y would have to be equal to a[i], but then a[i] != Y is false.

Wait, no, if Y == c[i] == a[i], then a[i] != Y is false, so a does not match.

Similarly, b does not match, and c matches.

Which is not what I want.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to find a t[i] that satisfies the conditions when a[i] == b[i] == c[i].

Therefore, in such positions, it's impossible to have a template t where a and b match, but c does not.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, there might be cases where a and b differ.

Wait, in the example, there are cases where a and b differ.

Wait, in the third test case of the example:

n = 10

a = mathforces

b = luckforces

c = adhoccoder

Here, a and b differ in some positions.

In such cases, perhaps it's possible to find a template t.

Let me think about that.

In positions where a and b differ:

- To make both a and b match t, t[i] must be uppercase X, where X is such that a[i] != lowercase(X) and b[i] != lowercase(X).

- Additionally, for c to not match t, in at least one position, c should not satisfy the condition.

This seems intricate.

Perhaps I need to consider that:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], set t[i] as lowercase a[i].

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], set t[i] as uppercase X, where X is chosen such that a[i] != lowercase(X) and b[i] != lowercase(X).

But in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] is something else, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for a and b to match t, in positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase, and a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

Additionally, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

This seems like a lot to keep track of.

Maybe I should look for positions where c differs from a or b, and try to set t[i] accordingly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to iterate through all possible t templates and check the conditions.

But with n up to 20 and t up to 1000, that would be computationally expensive, as there are 52 possible characters for each position (26 lowercase and 26 uppercase), leading to 52^20 possibilities per test case, which is infeasible.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for each position i, t[i] can be either lowercase or uppercase.

If t[i] is lowercase, then:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

If t[i] is uppercase, then:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for each position i, I can look at the possible choices for t[i] based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me define for each position i:

- Possible t[i] if t[i] is lowercase: only t[i] = a[i] if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Possible t[i] if t[i] is uppercase: t[i] = uppercase of some letter x where a[i] != x, b[i] != x, and c[i] == x

So, for each position i, I can determine if it's possible to choose t[i] as lowercase or uppercase based on the above conditions.

Then, I need to ensure that:

- For all positions, t[i] is chosen such that a and b match t.

- There exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, I need to find if there exists a combination of t[i] choices (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies these conditions.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using constraints and checking for the feasibility of the constraints.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that:

- If there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], then I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], and set other positions appropriately.

- In this case, c does not match at that position, and a and b match at all positions.

- If there are positions where a[i] != b[i], I need to set t[i] as uppercase X, where X is such that a[i] != lowercase(X) and b[i] != lowercase(X).

Wait, but in positions where a[i] != b[i], it's tricky because a and b must both differ from lowercase(X).

So, I need to choose X such that a[i] != lowercase(X) and b[i] != lowercase(X).

Which means that lowercase(X) != a[i] and lowercase(X) != b[i].

So, X cannot be the uppercase version of a[i] or b[i].

Additionally, for c to match or not match based on t[i].

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of whether there's any position where c differs from both a and b, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that:

- If there's any position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], assuming a[i] == b[i].

- But if a[i] != b[i], it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I need to look for positions where c differs from either a or b.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that c differs from a and b in at least one position.

Wait, but that's not exactly the condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to construct t such that:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], set t[i] as lowercase a[i]. This makes a and b match, and c does not match at this position.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match, as seen earlier.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], set t[i] as uppercase X, where X is chosen such that a[i] != lowercase(X) and b[i] != lowercase(X).

But in this case, c[i] must be equal to lowercase(X) for c to not match.

So, c[i] == lowercase(X).

But X cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i], since a[i] != b[i].

So, X must be a letter that is neither a[i] nor b[i].

Therefore, lowercase(X) must be different from a[i] and b[i].

But c[i] == lowercase(X), so c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, so in positions where a[i] != b[i], if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can set t[i] as uppercase with X corresponding to c[i].

In this case:

- a[i] != lowercase(X) (since c[i] != a[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(X) (since c[i] != b[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(X)

So, a and b match, and c does not match.

This seems to work in this subcase.

But if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then I cannot set t[i] as uppercase X where X corresponds to c[i], because then a[i] == lowercase(X), which would make a not match.

Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], it would cause issues.

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], it might be impossible to find such a t[i].

Wait, let's consider:

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can set t[i] as uppercase with X corresponding to c[i], and it should work.

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then I cannot set t[i] as uppercase with X corresponding to c[i], because a[i] == lowercase(X), which would make a not match.

- Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], it would cause b not to match.

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], it's impossible to find such a t[i].

Therefore, in such positions, I cannot make a and b match while making c not match.

Hence, for such positions, I must set t[i] in a way that a and b match, and c does not match.

But from the above, it seems impossible when a[i] != b[i] and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Is that a necessary condition?

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for positions where
