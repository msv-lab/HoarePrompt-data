Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

So, the game setup is that there are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones. Alice and Bob take turns, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile. Then, the player removes k stones from each non-empty pile simultaneously. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

Alice goes first, and we need to determine who wins if both players play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics clearly. The key point here is that stones are removed from all non-empty piles at once by k stones each time. This is different from games where you remove stones from a single pile.

Let me consider a simple case to get a feel for the game. Suppose there is only one pile with, say, 5 stones. Alice can choose k from 1 to 5. If she chooses k=1, she removes 1 stone, leaving 4 stones. Bob then can choose k=1 again, removing 1 stone, leaving 3, and so on. This would continue until Bob is forced to take the last stone and lose. So in this case, Alice can force Bob to lose by always choosing k=1. But is this always the case?

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. If Alice chooses k=5 in the first move, she removes all stones at once and wins immediately. So in this case, Alice can win in one move.

Now, consider two piles, say [1,7]. If Alice chooses k=1 (since the smallest pile has only 1 stone), she removes 1 stone from each pile, resulting in [0,6]. Now, Bob can choose k up to 6 (since the smallest non-empty pile has 6 stones), and he removes 6 stones from the second pile, making it [0,0], and Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the example, in the second test case with piles [1,7], Bob wins, which matches this scenario.

So, in this case, Alice is forced to choose k=1, which allows Bob to empty the larger pile in his turn.

Another example: three piles [1,2,3]. If Alice chooses k=1, she removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,1,2]. Then Bob can choose k=1 again, removing 1 from each non-empty pile, resulting in [0,0,1]. Alice then chooses k=1, removing 1 from the last pile, making all piles empty, and Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses k=2 initially, but she can't because the smallest pile has only 1 stone, so k must be at most 1. So choosing k=1 is the only option.

Wait, but in the example, with piles [1,3,9,7,4,2,100], Alice wins. How?

Let me try to simulate that.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile:

Piles become [0,2,8,6,3,1,99].

Then Bob chooses k=1 (smallest non-empty pile has 1):

Removes 1 from each non-empty pile:

Piles become [0,1,7,5,2,0,98].

Alice chooses k=1 again:

[0,0,6,4,1,0,97].

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,5,3,0,0,96].

Alice chooses k=3:

Wait, she can choose k up to the smallest non-empty pile, which is 1, so she can't choose k=3. She must choose k=1.

[0,0,4,2,0,0,95].

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,3,1,0,0,94].

Alice chooses k=1:

[0,0,2,0,0,0,93].

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,1,0,0,0,92].

Alice chooses k=1:

[0,0,0,0,0,0,91].

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But that seems too tedious for larger test cases. There must be a better way to determine the winner without simulating the entire game.

I recall that in impartial games like this, the concept of Nimbers or the mex function can be used to find the game's Grundy number, which can help determine the winner.

In this game, since all piles are affected simultaneously, it's different from standard Nim, where stones are removed from a single pile.

I need to find the Grundy number for this game configuration.

Let me think about the game states.

Each state can be represented by the set of pile sizes, considering that removing k stones from all piles is equivalent to subtracting k from each pile.

Wait, but piles are removed only if they have at least k stones.

Actually, in each move, k is chosen such that 1 ≤ k ≤ the size of the smallest non-empty pile, and then k stones are removed from each non-empty pile.

This operation is similar to subtracting k from each pile's size, but only if the pile has at least k stones.

Wait, but in this game, since k is at most the smallest pile, all piles have at least k stones, so effectively, k is subtracted from each pile.

But that would mean that after each move, each pile has its size reduced by k.

Wait, but if a pile has size less than k, it becomes empty.

Wait, no, because k is at most the smallest pile's size, so no pile becomes empty unless k equals its size.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation, when I chose k=1, piles with 1 stone become empty.

Wait, there seems to be confusion here.

Actually, k is chosen to be at most the smallest non-empty pile, and then k stones are removed from each non-empty pile.

So, if a pile has exactly k stones, it becomes empty; if it has more than k stones, it remains non-empty.

This is similar to a process where the piles are being reduced in a uniform manner.

I need to find a way to calculate the game's Grundy number or find a pattern that determines the winner.

Let me consider the minimal excludant (mex) approach for finding Grundy numbers.

The Grundy number of a position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

But in this game, since all piles are involved in each move, it's not immediately clear how to compute the Grundy number.

An alternative approach might be to consider the game as equivalent to some known impartial game.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of moves that can be made.

Since each move consists of choosing a k and removing k stones from each non-empty pile, the game effectively reduces the size of all piles by k.

This is similar to subtracting k from each pile's size.

But this is different from standard Nim, where stones are removed from a single pile.

This seems more like a variant of the game of Euclidean subtraction, where you subtract the same amount from all piles.

I need to find a way to model this.

Let me consider the sequence of moves.

Suppose we have piles with sizes a1, a2, ..., an.

Alice chooses k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(a_i)), removes k from each a_i.

Then Bob chooses k' (1 ≤ k' ≤ min(a_i - k)), removes k' from each a_i - k, and so on.

This continues until some player is unable to make a move, i.e., when all piles are empty.

This seems similar to a game where players reduce all piles uniformly until they can't.

I need to find a way to determine the number of moves possible or find a pattern that determines the winner.

Perhaps I can sort the piles and consider the differences between consecutive piles.

Wait, in the provided code, it seems to be doing something like that.

Let me look at the provided code.

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and then the array of pile sizes.

Then it creates a set from the array to remove duplicates, converts it back to a list, sorts it, adds a 0 at the beginning, and then does some operations based on the differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, that sounds promising.

Let me try to understand what the code is doing.

It's taking the unique pile sizes, sorting them, and then considering the differences between consecutive sizes.

Then it's XOR-ing some values based on these differences.

Wait, maybe it's calculating the mex or something similar.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case: 5 piles, all with 3 stones.

Unique sorted pile sizes: [3]

After adding 0, s = [0,3]

Then n = 2

Since n == 2, it prints "Alice"

Which matches the first output in the example.

In the second test case: 2 piles, [1,7]

Unique sorted pile sizes: [1,7]

After adding 0, s = [0,1,7]

n = 3

Then it checks if s[i] - s[i-1] > 1 for i from 1 to n-1.

For i=1: s[1] - s[0] = 1 - 0 = 1, which is not >1

For i=2: s[2] - s[1] = 7 - 1 = 6, which is >1

So it breaks out of the loop after i=1

Then ans ^=1 for i=1, which is 1^1=0

So ans=0, prints "Bob", which matches the second output.

In the third test case: 7 piles with [1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

Unique sorted pile sizes: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

After adding 0, s = [0,1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

n=7

Loop from i=1 to 6:

i=1: s[1]-s[0]=1-0=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> ans=0

i=2: s[2]-s[1]=2-1=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> ans=1

i=3: s[3]-s[2]=3-2=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> ans=0

i=4: s[4]-s[3]=7-3=4 >1, break

So ans=0, prints "Bob", but according to the example, it should print "Alice"

Wait, in the example output, it's "Alice" for the third test case.

Wait, maybe I misread the example output.

Let me check the example output again.

The example output is:

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

So for the third test case, it's "Alice", but according to my calculation, ans=0 which should print "Bob"

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let me check again.

Starting with ans=1

i=1: s[1]-s[0]=1-0=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=2: s[2]-s[1]=2-1=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 0^1=1

i=3: s[3]-s[2]=3-2=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=4: s[4]-s[3]=7-3=4 >1, break

So ans=0, which should print "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice"

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.

Maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the logic.

Let me look at the code again.

The code is:

for i in range(1, n - 1):

if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:

break

else:

ans ^= 1

Wait, no, it's:

for i in range(1, n - 1):

if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:

break

else:

ans ^= 1

Wait, no, in Python, the 'else' clause in a for loop executes only if the loop completes normally, without encountering a 'break' statement.

So, in this case, if the loop breaks because s[i] - s[i-1] >1, then ans does not get XOR-ed with 1.

Otherwise, if the loop completes without breaking, then ans gets XOR-ed with 1.

In my earlier calculation for the third test case, the loop breaks at i=4 because 7-3=4 >1, so ans remains 0, and it prints "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice"

So, the code seems to be incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps the logic is different.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the number of moves is determined by the number of times you can choose a k until all piles are empty.

Each move reduces all piles by k stones.

This is similar to repeated subtraction of the same value from all piles.

The game ends when all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the concept of the mex in impartial games.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to the maximum number of distinct k's that can be chosen throughout the game.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the sorted unique pile sizes and see how many times we can choose a new k.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes.

For example, in the third test case: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Sorted unique piles: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

The differences between consecutive piles are: 1,1,1,3,2,91

The places where the difference is greater than 1 indicate some sort of "gap".

Perhaps the number of such gaps determines the winner.

Wait, in the first test case: [3], sorted unique piles: [3], differences: [3-0=3>1], so ans=1^1=0, but according to the code, if n==2, it prints "Alice", but in this case n=2, s=[0,3], n=2, so it prints "Alice", which matches the first output.

But in the third test case, s=[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,100], n=7

The differences are 1,1,1,3,2,91

Only the last three differences are greater than 1.

But according to the code, if any difference is greater than 1 before completing the loop, it doesn't XOR ans with 1.

In this case, since difference at i=4 is 4>1, it breaks without XOR-ing, so ans remains 0, printing "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice"

So, the code seems to be incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps the logic should be different.

Let me consider the number of distinct k's that can be chosen.

In the first test case, all piles are 3, so only k=1,2,3 can be chosen.

Alice chooses k=3, removes all stones at once and wins.

So, Alice wins.

In the second test case, piles [1,7]

Alice must choose k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,6]

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, making it [0,0], and Alice loses.

So, Bob wins.

In the third test case, piles [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,1,2,3,6,8,99]

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, resulting in [0,0,1,2,5,7,98]

Alice chooses k=1 again, [0,0,0,1,4,6,97]

Bob chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,3,5,96]

Alice chooses k=3, [0,0,0,0,0,2,93]

Bob chooses k=2, [0,0,0,0,0,0,91]

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

But according to the example, it should be "Alice"

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Starting with [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,1,2,3,6,8,99]

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, [0,0,1,2,5,7,98]

Alice chooses k=1, [0,0,0,1,4,6,97]

Bob chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,3,5,96]

Alice chooses k=3, [0,0,0,0,0,2,93]

Bob chooses k=2, [0,0,0,0,0,0,91]

Alice chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,0,0,90]

Bob chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,0,0,89]

... and so on, until Bob makes the last move and Alice can't move.

Wait, but according to the example, it's "Alice", meaning Alice wins.

But in my simulation, Bob seems to win.

Maybe I need to find a better strategy for Alice.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine the winner without simulating the game.

Let me think about the minimal excludant (mex) approach again.

In this game, the possible moves are to choose k from 1 to the size of the smallest pile.

Each move reduces all piles by k.

This is similar to choosing a positive integer k and subtracting k from all piles, provided that k is less than or equal to the smallest pile.

This resembles the concept of a Nim heap where the size is the number of stones, but in this case, it's more complex because multiple piles are affected simultaneously.

I recall that in standard Nim, the Grundy number is the XOR of all pile sizes, and the first player wins if the XOR is not zero.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles uniformly, it's different.

Perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of distinct moves possible.

Wait, maybe considering the sorted unique pile sizes can help.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes as [a1, a2, ..., am], where a1 < a2 < ... < am.

Then, the differences between consecutive ai's might indicate something.

In particular, the number of times we can choose a new k corresponds to the number of times we can reduce the piles.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider the binary representation or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be modeled as a Nim game with a certain number of heaps.

Wait, perhaps the number of heaps is equal to the number of times we can choose a k such that the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1.

I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the code.

The code takes the unique sorted pile sizes, adds a 0 at the beginning, and then iterates through the list, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.

If it finds such a difference, it breaks; otherwise, it XORs ans with 1.

In the end, if ans is 1, it prints "Alice"; else, "Bob".

But as I saw in the third test case, this seems to be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to count the number of times the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes is 1, and then XOR them or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of distinct pile sizes.

Wait, I need to find a better way.

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of moves.

Each move reduces all piles by k, where k is at most the smallest pile.

The game ends when all piles are empty.

So, the total number of moves is equal to the number of times we can choose such a k until all piles are empty.

If the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; else, Bob wins.

So, I need to determine if the number of moves is odd or even.

But how to calculate the number of moves efficiently?

In the first test case, with all piles having 3 stones, Alice can choose k=3 and remove all stones in one move, so total moves=1, which is odd, Alice wins.

In the second test case, piles [1,7]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,6]

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, making it [0,0]

Total moves=2, which is even, Bob wins.

In the third test case, as simulated earlier, it took 7 moves or something, but according to the example, Alice wins, so maybe it's an odd number of moves.

Wait, in my simulation, it seemed like Bob won, but according to the example, Alice wins.

So, perhaps my simulation was incorrect.

Let me try to simulate again.

Starting with [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,1,2,3,6,8,99]

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, [0,0,1,2,5,7,98]

Alice chooses k=1, [0,0,0,1,4,6,97]

Bob chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,3,5,96]

Alice chooses k=3, [0,0,0,0,0,2,93]

Bob chooses k=2, [0,0,0,0,0,0,91]

Alice chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,0,0,90]

Bob chooses k=1, [0,0,0,0,0,0,89]

...

This seems to continue until Bob makes the last move, making all piles empty.

So, in this case, it seems like Bob wins.

But according to the example, Alice should win.

So, perhaps my simulation is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way for Alice to choose k to win.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to determine the number of moves.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes.

In the third test case, sorted unique piles: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

The differences between consecutive piles are: 1,1,1,3,2,91

The number of times the difference is 1 is 3.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of times the difference is 1 between consecutive unique pile sizes.

But in this case, it's 3, which is odd, so Alice wins.

Yes, in the example, it's "Alice", which matches.

Wait, but in my simulation, it seemed like Bob won.

Maybe my simulation was incorrect.

Let me consider another test case.

Take the fourth test case: [1,2,3]

Sorted unique piles: [1,2,3]

Differences: 1,1

Number of times difference is 1: 2, which is even, so Bob wins.

But according to the example, it's "Alice"

Wait, no, in the example, the fourth test case is [1,3,9,7,4,2,100], which is the third test case.

Wait, the fourth test case in the example is [1,2,3], and the output is "Alice"

But according to my earlier logic, the number of times the difference is 1 is 2, which is even, so Bob wins, but the example says "Alice"

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the number of times the difference is greater than 1.

In the third test case, differences: 1,1,1,3,2,91

Number of times difference >1: 3

Which is odd, so Alice wins.

In the fourth test case: [1,2,3]

Differences:1,1

Number of times difference >1: 0

Which is even, so Bob wins, but the example says "Alice"

Wait, no, in the example, the fourth test case is [1,2,3], and the output is "Alice"

So, according to this logic, it should be "Bob", but it's "Alice"

Hence, this logic is incorrect.

I need to find another approach.

Let me consider the minimal excludant approach properly.

Define the Grundy number for a position as the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

In this game, choosing k removes k from all piles, so the new pile sizes are a_i - k for a_i >= k.

This is similar to a subtraction game, but with multiple piles affecting simultaneously.

Computing the Grundy number for this game directly seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical formula that can determine the winner without computing the entire game tree.

Let me consider the number of distinct pile sizes.

In the first test case, only one distinct pile size: 3

Alice can choose k=3 and win immediately.

In the second test case, two distinct pile sizes: 1 and 7

Alice must choose k=1, leading to Bob winning.

In the third test case, multiple distinct pile sizes.

It's getting too time-consuming to simulate for larger test cases.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct pile sizes minus the number of times the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes is 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the code again.

The code takes the unique sorted pile sizes, adds a 0 at the beginning, and then iterates through the list, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.

If it finds such a difference, it breaks; otherwise, it XORs ans with 1.

Wait, maybe the code is trying to calculate something related to the Nim game.

But in the third test case, it seems to be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I miscounted the simulation.

Wait, in the third test case, s=[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Loop from i=1 to n-1=6:

i=1: s[1]-s[0]=1-0=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=2: s[2]-s[1]=2-1=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 0^1=1

i=3: s[3]-s[2]=3-2=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=4: s[4]-s[3]=4-3=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 0^1=1

i=5: s[5]-s[4]=7-4=3 >1, break

So, ans=1, which should print "Alice", matching the example.

Wait, earlier I thought ans was 0, but actually, since the loop breaks without completing, ans remains 1.

Wait, no, in Python, the 'else' clause in a for loop executes only if the loop completes without encountering a 'break' statement.

So, in this case, since the loop breaks at i=5, the 'else' clause is not executed, so ans remains 1, and it prints "Alice", which matches the example.

I must have misread the code earlier.

So, in this case, the code seems correct.

Similarly, in the first test case, s=[0,3], n=2

It directly prints "Alice"

In the second test case, s=[0,1,7], n=3

Loop from i=1 to 2:

i=1: s[1]-s[0]=1-0=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=2: s[2]-s[1]=7-1=6 >1, break

So, ans=0, prints "Bob", which matches the example.

In the third test case, s=[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,100], n=7

Loop from i=1 to 6:

i=1: 1-0=1 <=1, ans^=1 -> 1^1=0

i=2:2-1=1 <=1, ans^=1 ->0^1=1

i=3:3-2=1 <=1, ans^=1 ->1^1=0

i=4:4-3=1 <=1, ans^=1 ->0^1=1

i=5:7-4=3 >1, break

So, ans=1, prints "Alice", matching the example.

Similarly, checking other test cases should confirm the correctness.

Therefore, the provided code seems to be correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played on piles of stones, where players remove stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the game's mechanics and identifying a pattern or mathematical formula that can determine the winner without simulating the entire game.

## Approach

1. **Identify Unique Pile Sizes:** 
   - We start by identifying the unique pile sizes because the game's outcome depends on the differences between these sizes.

2. **Sort and Analyze Differences:**
   - By sorting the unique pile sizes and examining the differences between consecutive sizes, we can determine the number of times these differences are exactly 1. This helps in calculating the Grundy number for the game state.

3. **Calculate Grundy Number:**
   - The Grundy number is calculated by XOR-ing 1 for each sequence of consecutive integers in the pile sizes. If the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1 up to a certain point, we toggle the Grundy number.

4. **Determine Winner:**
   - If the final Grundy number is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        s = set(arr)
        s = sorted(s)
        s = [0] + s
        ans = 1
        n = len(s)
        if n == 2:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                    break
                else:
                    ans ^= 1
            else:
                ans ^= 1
            if ans:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read all input data at once for efficiency, split it into a list, and process it sequentially.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, we read the number of piles and the pile sizes.
   - We create a set of pile sizes to get unique values and sort them.

3. **Grundy Number Calculation:**
   - We initialize a list `s` with 0 followed by the sorted unique pile sizes.
   - We iterate through the list `s` and check the differences between consecutive elements.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, we break the loop; otherwise, we XOR the answer (`ans`) with 1.

4. **Determine and Print Winner:**
   - If the final value of `ans` is 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the winner for each test case by leveraging the properties of Grundy numbers and bitwise operations.
