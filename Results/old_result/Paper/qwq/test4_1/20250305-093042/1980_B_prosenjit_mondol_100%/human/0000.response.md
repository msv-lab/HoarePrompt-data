Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order relative to each other.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

Looking at the example:

n=5, f=2, a=[4, 3, 3, 2, 3], k=2

After sorting, it could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc., depending on how the same values are ordered.

If it's [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], the first two removed are 4 and 3, so the favorite cube at position 2 (0-indexed as 1) which is 3 is removed.

If it's [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], the first two removed are 4 and 3, so the favorite cube at position 2 (which is 3) is not removed.

So, in some cases, it's removed, in others, it's not. Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

I need to generalize this logic.

First, I need to understand the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting.

Given that the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, and that cubes with the same value can be in any order relative to each other.

So, for a given value x = a[f], I need to find out where the favorite cube can be positioned after sorting.

Let's think about the number of cubes that have values greater than x. Let's say there are m such cubes.

Then, after sorting, these m cubes will be before any cube with value x.

So, the positions of cubes with value x will be from m+1 to m + count_x, where count_x is the number of cubes with value x.

Since cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube can be in any of these positions: m+1 to m + count_x.

Now, Dmitry removes the first k cubes. So, if any of these positions (m+1 to m + count_x) is <= k, then in some cases, the favorite cube could be removed.

But, if all these positions are > k, then the favorite cube is not removed.

Wait, but the problem asks for whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not in any case.

Wait, no. Looking back at the output description:

- "YES" if the cube will be removed in all cases

- "NO" if it will not be removed in any case

- "MAYBE" if it may be either removed or left

So, I need to consider all possible arrangements of cubes with the same value.

Given that, for cubes with the same value, their relative order is arbitrary.

So, for the favorite cube to be removed, its position after sorting needs to be <= k.

Given that, and considering the possible positions it can take among the cubes with the same value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let:

- x = a[f]

- Let m = number of cubes with value > x

- Let count_x = number of cubes with value == x

Then, after sorting, the positions of cubes with value x are from m+1 to m + count_x.

Now, the favorite cube can be in any of these positions, since their order is arbitrary.

So, if m+1 <= k, then in some arrangements, the favorite cube could be in position m+1, which is <= k, so it's removed.

Similarly, if m + count_x > k, then in some arrangements, the favorite cube could be in position m + count_x, which is > k, so it's not removed.

Therefore, if m + count_x <= k, then all possible positions of the favorite cube are <= k, so it's always removed.

If m+1 > k, then all possible positions are > k, so it's never removed.

Otherwise, if m+1 <= k < m + count_x, then in some arrangements it's removed, in others not, so the answer is "MAYBE".

Wait, let's think again.

Actually, to generalize:

- If the k-th cube is before all positions of the favorite cube, then it's never removed.

- If the k-th cube is after all positions of the favorite cube, then it's always removed.

- Else, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, I need to be careful.

Let me consider:

- The positions of the favorite cube are from m+1 to m + count_x.

- He removes the first k cubes.

So, if k >= m + count_x, then all positions of the favorite cube are <= k, so always removed.

Wait, no.

Wait, positions are 1-based, and Python uses 0-based indexing.

Let's make sure.

Assuming 1-based positions after sorting.

So, if k >= m + count_x, then positions 1 to k cover all positions of the favorite cube, so always removed.

If k < m+1, then positions 1 to k are before the favorite cube's positions, so never removed.

If m+1 <= k < m + count_x, then some positions of the favorite cube are removed, some are not, so "MAYBE".

Wait, but k is the number of cubes removed, starting from the first (largest).

Wait, in the sorted list, positions 1 to k are removed.

If the favorite cube is in position p, where m+1 <= p <= m + count_x.

- If p <= k, it's removed.

- If p > k, it's not removed.

So, if m + count_x <= k, then p <= k for all p in [m+1, m + count_x], so always removed.

If m+1 > k, then p > k for all p in [m+1, m + count_x], so never removed.

If m+1 <= k < m + count_x, then some p <= k and some p > k, so "MAYBE".

This seems correct.

Now, how to compute m and count_x.

m is the number of cubes with value > x.

count_x is the number of cubes with value == x.

So, in code, I can iterate through the list, count how many are > x and how many are == x.

Then, based on m and count_x, decide "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" accordingly.

Wait, but in the code provided, it sorts the list in non-increasing order and then checks a[k] and x.

Wait, let's look at the provided code.

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

So, it's sorting a in non-increasing order, then checking a[k] with x.

If a[k] > x, then it prints "NO".

If a[k] < x, then it prints "YES".

If a[k] == x, then it checks if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x, then "YES", else "MAYBE".

I need to verify if this logic aligns with what I just deduced.

First, after sorting in non-increasing order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, meaning that the (k+1)-th largest value is greater than x, then all the first k cubes have values >= a[k], which is > x. So, the favorite cube, with value x, is at position m + something, where m is the number of cubes with value > x.

Since a[k] > x, then m >= k+1, because the first k+1 cubes have value > x.

Wait, m is the number of cubes with value > x.

Wait, in the sorted list, the first m cubes have value > x.

Given that a[k] > x, it means that the first k+1 cubes have value > x, so m >= k+1.

But actually, m is exactly the number of cubes with value > x.

Wait, but in the sorted list, the first m cubes have value > x, then the next count_x have value == x, and the rest have value < x.

Given that, if a[k] > x, then k < m, because the first m cubes have value > x.

Wait, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, then the first k+1 cubes have value > x, so m >= k+1.

But m is exactly the number of cubes with value > x.

So, m = number of cubes with a_i > x.

Similarly, count_x = number of cubes with a_i == x.

So, in the sorted list:

- Positions 1 to m: a_i > x

- Positions m+1 to m + count_x: a_i == x

- Positions m + count_x +1 to n: a_i < x

Now, the favorite cube is in positions m+1 to m + count_x.

If k >= m + count_x, then positions 1 to k include all positions of the favorite cube, so always removed.

If k < m, then positions 1 to k are all > x, so the favorite cube is not among them, hence never removed.

If m <= k < m + count_x, then some positions of the favorite cube are removed, some are not, so "MAYBE".

Now, in the code:

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

So, if a[k] > x, which means the (k+1)-th largest value is > x, then it prints "NO".

According to my earlier reasoning, if k < m, which implies a[k] > x (since the first m values are > x), then the favorite cube is never removed.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking a[k] > x, and printing "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, if k < m, which corresponds to a[k] > x, then the favorite cube is never removed, which corresponds to "NO".

Wait, but in the earlier example, when n=5, f=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], k=2.

x = 3

After sorting: [4,3,3,3,2] or [4,3,3,2,3], etc.

a[1] = 3, which is equal to x.

But in the earlier reasoning, since a[1] == x, it's "MAYBE".

But according to the code, if a[k] == x, it checks if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x.

In this case, k=1, n=5, a[2] = 3 == x, so it's "MAYBE".

Which matches the example output of "MAYBE".

Another case:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=5

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[2] = 3 < x, so according to the code, print "YES", meaning always removed.

Because k=3, and a[2]=3 < x=5, so positions 1 to 3 are [5,4,3], which include x=5, so always removed.

Wait, but f=5 points to a[4]=1, but x=5?

Wait, f=5, so f-1=4, a[4]=1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, f=5, a=[4,2,1,3,5], so x=a[4]=5.

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

So, positions 1 to 3 are [5,4,3], which include x=5, so yes, always removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=3

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[1]=4 > x=3, so "NO"

Wait, but x=3 is in position 3, which is > k=2, so not removed.

Hence, "NO".

Seems consistent.

Another case:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[1,2,5,4,3]

x=3

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[4]=1 < x=3, so "YES"

Because k=5, positions 1 to 5 are all removed, including x=3.

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

x=5

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[3]=2 < x=5, so "YES"

Because positions 1 to 4 are [5,4,3,2], which include x=5, so always removed.

Wait, but f=5 points to x=5, which is in position 1 after sorting, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[4,3,2,1,5]

x=5

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[4]=1 < x=5, so "YES"

Again, all positions 1 to 5 are removed, including x=5.

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=3

After sorting: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

a[2]=2 < x=3, so "YES"

Because positions 1 to 3 are [3,3,2], which include x=3, so always removed.

Wait, but f=5 points to a[4]=1, but x=3.

Wait, no, f=5, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], a[4]=2.

Wait, f=5, a[4]=2.

Wait, x=a[4]=2.

After sorting: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

So, x=2.

a[2]=2 == x.

So, according to the code, a[k]=a[2]=2 == x=2.

Then, check if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x.

Here, k=2, n=6, a[3]=2 == x, so "MAYBE".

Hence, "MAYBE".

Another case:

n=10, f=1, k=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

After sorting: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

a[0]=1 == x=1.

Then, check if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x.

k=0, n=10, a[1]=1 == x, so "MAYBE".

Hence, "MAYBE".

Another case:

n=1, f=1, k=1

a=[42]

x=42

After sorting: [42]

a[0]=42 == x=42.

k=0, n=1, a[1]=a[1] is out of range, so likely considered as < x, so "YES".

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=5, f=2, k=3

a=[2,2,1,1,2]

x=2

After sorting: [2,2,2,1,1]

a[2]=2 == x=2.

Then, check if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x.

k=2, n=5, a[3]=1 < x=2, so "YES".

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=2, f=1, k=1

a=[2,1]

x=2

After sorting: [2,1]

a[0]=2 == x=2.

k=0, n=2, a[1]=1 < x=2, so "YES".

Hence, "YES".

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[3,3,2,3,2]

x=2

After sorting: [3,3,3,2,2]

a[0]=3 > x=2, so "NO".

Hence, "NO".

So, the code seems to be aligning with the expected outputs.

Now, let's see how the code implements this logic.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Reads n, f, k, and adjusts f and k to 0-based indexing.

- Reads the list a.

- Sets x = a[f].

- Sorts a in non-increasing order.

- Checks a[k] with x.

- If a[k] > x, prints "NO".

- If a[k] < x, prints "YES".

- If a[k] == x, checks if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x, then prints "YES", else "MAYBE".

Let's see why this works.

After sorting a in non-increasing order:

- a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

- If a[k] > x, then all the first k+1 values are > x, so m >= k+1, meaning the favorite cube is at position m + something > k, so never removed.

- If a[k] < x, then all the first k values are > x, and the favorite cube is among the first k, since x > a[k], but wait, no.

Wait, if a[k] < x, then x is among the first k values, because x is larger than a[k], so it's among the first k, so always removed.

Wait, but in the sorted list, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest, so if a[k] < x, then x is among the first k values.

Wait, no.

If a[k] < x, then x is among the first k values, because x is larger than a[k], so it's among the first k.

Wait, but in the sorted list, a[0] is the largest, a[1] is the next largest, and so on.

So, if a[k] < x, then x is among the first k values, because x is larger than a[k], so its position is before k.

Hence, it's always removed.

If a[k] > x, then x is among the positions after k, so never removed.

If a[k] == x, then x is at position k, but there might be other x's before or after.

In this case, if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x, then all x's are among the first k values, so always removed.

Else, some x's are after k, so "MAYBE".

Wait, in the code, it's "YES" if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x.

Otherwise, "MAYBE".

So, if k == n-1, then the last element is x, and it's being removed, so "YES".

Or if a[k+1] < x, meaning that after the k-th position, the values are less than x, so all x's are within the first k, so always removed, "YES".

Else, "MAYBE".

This seems consistent with my earlier reasoning.

Hence, the code seems correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed when he arranges his cubes in non-increasing order and removes the first k cubes.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the values of n (number of cubes), f (index of the favorite cube), and k (number of cubes to remove).
   - Read the list of values shown on the cubes.

2. **Determine the Value of the Favorite Cube**:
   - Identify the value on the favorite cube using its index.

3. **Sort the Cubes**:
   - Sort the cubes in non-increasing order.

4. **Check Removal Conditions**:
   - If the value at position k in the sorted list is greater than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube is never removed.
   - If the value at position k is less than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube is always removed.
   - If the value at position k is equal to the favorite cube's value, check if it's the last cube or the next cube has a smaller value to decide if it's always removed or may be removed depending on arrangement.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - We read the input values for each test case, adjusting the indices to be zero-based for easier list handling.

2. **Identify Favorite Cube's Value**:
   - We retrieve the value of the favorite cube using its adjusted index.

3. **Sort the Cubes**:
   - We sort the cube values in non-increasing order to simulate the arrangement Dmitry performs.

4. **Determine Removal**:
   - **If a[k] > x**: The favorite cube is never removed because all removed cubes have values greater than x.
   - **If a[k] < x**: The favorite cube is always removed because its value is higher and it appears among the first k cubes.
   - **If a[k] == x**: 
     - If k is the last position or the next cube has a smaller value, the favorite cube is always removed.
     - Otherwise, it may or may not be removed depending on the arrangement of cubes with the same value.

This approach ensures we correctly determine the fate of the favorite cube in all scenarios.
