Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. Let's look at the example provided: in the string "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). But since it's the first character, it only has a right neighbor. So, 'A' equals its only neighbor 'A', which means it should not be special because it equals both neighbors (but in this case, there's only one neighbor). Wait, the problem says "exactly one of its neighbors". For the first and last characters, they only have one neighbor each.

- Position 2: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'B' (right). It equals its left neighbor but not its right, so it's special.

- Position 3: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It equals both neighbors, so not special.

- Position 4: 'B' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It doesn't equal either neighbor, so not special.

- Position 5: 'A' - neighbors are 'B' (left) and 'A' (right). It equals its right neighbor but not the left, so special.

- Position 6: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'C' (right). It equals its left neighbor but not the right, so special.

- Position 7: 'C' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'C' (right). It equals its right neighbor but not the left, so special.

- Position 8: 'C' - neighbors are 'C' (left) and none on the right. It equals its left neighbor, so not special.

Wait, but the example says positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are special, but according to my analysis, only positions 2, 5, 6, and 7 are special. Positions 1 and 3 are not special based on my understanding. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Let me read the problem again: "a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

For the first and last characters, they only have one neighbor. So, for them to be special, they need to be equal to that single neighbor.

In the example:

- Position 1: 'A' equals its neighbor 'A', so it should be special because it equals exactly one of its neighbors (which is the only neighbor it has).

- Position 2: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A' but not its right neighbor 'B', so special.

- Position 3: 'A' equals both neighbors 'A' and 'A', so it does not meet the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor.

- Position 4: 'B' does not equal either neighbor ('A' and 'A'), so not special.

- Position 5: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'A' but not its left neighbor 'B', so special.

- Position 6: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A' but not its right neighbor 'C', so special.

- Position 7: 'C' equals its right neighbor 'C', so it equals exactly one neighbor (since it has two neighbors, 'A' and 'C'), so special.

- Position 8: 'C' equals its left neighbor 'C', so it equals exactly one neighbor (since it only has one neighbor), so special.

Wait, but according to this, positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are special, which matches the example's claim of 6 special characters.

So, my initial confusion was about how to handle the edge characters with only one neighbor. They are considered special if they equal that single neighbor.

Okay, now I need to find a string where exactly n characters are special as defined above.

Let's think about how to construct such a string.

First, consider that for any character in the middle of the string, it has two neighbors. To make it special, it should equal exactly one of its neighbors.

For characters at the ends, they only have one neighbor, so they are special if they equal that neighbor.

One approach is to try to maximize or minimize the number of special characters by choosing patterns that either maximize or minimize equality between neighbors.

Let's consider some simple cases.

Case 1: n = 1

Is it possible to have a string with exactly one special character?

Let's try:

- For a string of length 1: say "A". The single character equals its only neighbor (itself), so it's special. But according to the problem, the string must have at least one character, and for n=1, this seems to work. But wait, in the example, for n=1, the output is 'NO'. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the example, for n=1, the output is 'NO'. So, it's not possible to have exactly one special character. Why is that?

Let's think about it.

- If the string has only one character, it's special by default.

- If the string has two characters, either they are equal or unequal.

- If they are equal, both characters equal their only neighbor, so both are special, totaling 2 special characters.

- If they are unequal, neither character equals their neighbor, so no special characters.

- So, it's not possible to have exactly 1 special character with two characters.

- With three characters: ABC

- If A=B != C, then A and B are special (A equals B, B equals A), C is not special (C != B).

- So, two special characters.

- If A != B = C, then B and C are special.

- If A = C != B, then A and C are special.

- If A = B = C, then no special characters.

- If A != B != C, then no special characters.

- So, with three characters, it's possible to have exactly two special characters, but not exactly one.

- With four characters: ABCD

- If A=B != C != D, then A, B are special.

- If A != B = C != D, then B, C are special.

- If A = B != C = D, then A, B, C, D are special if A != C.

- Wait, let's say A=B and C=D, and A != C.

- Then, A equals B, B equals C if B=C, but in this case, B equals C, so B equals both neighbors if B=C.

- Wait, it's getting complicated.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula to determine for which n it's possible to construct such a string.

Let me look for a pattern.

From the example:

- n=6: possible with "AAABAACC"

- n=1: not possible ('NO')

- n=2: possible with "MM"

Wait, in "MM", both M's equal their neighbor, so both are special, totaling 2 special characters.

So, for n=2: "MM" is a valid string.

For n=1: no string exists with exactly one special character.

Is there a general rule here?

Looking back at the possible n values:

- n=1: 'NO'

- n=2: "MM"

- n=6: "AAABAACC"

Is there a pattern based on even or odd n?

From the example, n=6 (even) is possible, n=1 (odd) is not, n=2 (even) is possible.

Is it that only even n are possible?

Looking back at smaller n:

- n=0: empty string or a string where no character is special.

- For example, "ABC" has no special characters.

- But n=0 is not in the test cases since n >=1.

- n=2: "MM" works.

- n=3: let's see.

- "ABA": A != B != A, so no special characters.

- "AAB": A equals A, B equals A, so A (position 2) equals both neighbors (A and B), so not special. B equals A, which is one neighbor, so special.

- Wait, position 1: A equals A (right neighbor), so special.

- Position 2: A equals A (left) and B (right), so equals both, not special.

- Position 3: B equals A (left), so special.

- So, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2, not 3.

- So, can't get exactly 3 special characters.

- n=4: possible?

- "AABA": A equals A, A equals B and A.

- Wait, position 1: A equals A, special.

- Position 2: A equals A and B, equals both, not special.

- Position 3: A equals B and A, equals both, not special.

- Position 4: A equals A (left), special.

- So, positions 1 and 4 are special, total 2.

- "ABAC": A != B != A != C

- No special characters.

- "AABC": A equals A, A equals B and C.

- Position 1: A equals A, special.

- Position 2: A equals A and B, equals both, not special.

- Position 3: B equals A and C, equals one, special.

- Position 4: C equals B, special.

- So, positions 1,3,4 are special, total 3.

- Still not 4.

- "ABBC": A != B == B != C

- Position 1: A equals B, special.

- Position 2: B equals B and C, equals both, not special.

- Position 3: B equals B and C, equals both, not special.

- Position 4: C equals B, special.

- So, positions 1 and 4 are special, total 2.

- Seems like it's hard to get exactly 4 special characters.

From these trials, it seems that getting an odd number of special characters is challenging, if not impossible.

Wait, in "AAABAACC":

- Positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special: total 6.

- In "MM": positions 1 and 2 are special: total 2.

- In "AABA": positions 1 and 4 are special: total 2.

- In "AABC": positions 1,3,4 are special: total 3.

Wait, in "AABC", positions 1,3,4 are special: that's 3, which is odd, but in the earlier trials, it's possible to have 3 special characters.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, for n=3, it seems possible to have exactly 3 special characters in some cases.

Wait, in "AABC": positions 1,3,4 are special: total 3.

- Position 1: A equals A, special.

- Position 2: A equals A and B, equals both, not special.

- Position 3: B equals A, special.

- Position 4: C equals B, special.

So, total 3 special characters.

But earlier, with "ABA": only 2 special characters.

So, maybe it's possible to have an odd number of special characters under certain conditions.

Wait, but in the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', but for n=3, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps it's possible for n >=2 and n is even, and for n >=3 and n is odd.

But in "AABC", n=3 is possible.

Wait, maybe the pattern is different.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for n=1, but possible for n >=2.

But in the example, for n=1, 'NO', for n=2, 'YES "MM"', for n=6, 'YES "AAABAACC"'.

Wait, but in "MM", n=2 is possible.

In "AABC", n=3 is possible.

Wait, perhaps only n >=2 is possible, and n=1 is not possible.

But in the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', and for n=2 and n=6, it's 'YES'.

But in the problem statement, t can be up to 50, and n up to 50.

I need to find a general rule.

Looking back, perhaps it's impossible for n=1, and possible for all n >=2.

But in the sample input, for n=1, it's 'NO', for n=2 and n=6, it's 'YES'.

But in "AABC", n=3 is possible.

Wait, maybe it's possible for all n >=2, except n=1.

But in "AABC", n=3 is possible, and n=2 is possible, n=6 is possible.

Perhaps it's possible for all n >=2.

But in the sample input, for n=1, it's 'NO', and for n=2 and n=6, it's 'YES'.

Looking back, perhaps it's possible for all even n and for some odd n >=3.

Wait, but in "AABC", n=3 is possible, which is odd.

Wait, perhaps for n >=2, it's possible, and for n=1, it's 'NO'.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps it's possible for all n >=2.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me try to find a general pattern.

Suppose I create a string that alternates between two characters, like "ABABAB...".

In this case, every character equals exactly one neighbor.

Wait, let's see:

- "AB": A != B, so neither is special.

- "ABAB": positions 1: A != B, not special; position 2: B == B (left) and A (right), equals one, special; position 3: A == A (left) and B (right), equals one, special; position 4: B == B (left) and A (right), equals one, special.

Wait, in "ABAB":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), so equals one, special.

- Position 3: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

So, positions 2,3,4 are special, total 3.

Wait, n=3.

So, for "ABAB", n=3.

If I make it longer: "ABABAB":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 3: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 5: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 6: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

So, positions 2,3,4,5,6 are special, total 5.

So, for "ABABAB", n=5.

It seems that with this pattern, the number of special characters is length -1, which is odd for even length and even for odd length.

Wait, for "ABAB", length 4, n=3.

For "ABABAB", length 6, n=5.

So, n = length -1, which is odd when length is even, and even when length is odd.

Wait, but in "ABAB", length 4, n=3.

In "ABABAB", length 6, n=5.

So, n = length -1, which is odd for even length, and even for odd length.

But in "AB", length 2, n=1 (but according to earlier analysis, n=1 is 'NO'), but in "AB", positions:

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B != A, not special.

So, n=0.

Wait, so in "AB", n=0.

In "ABAB", n=3.

In "ABABAB", n=5.

So, it's not directly n = length -1.

Wait, perhaps n = floor(length /2) *2 -1.

Wait, for length 4: floor(4/2)*2 -1 = 2*2 -1 =3, which matches n=3.

For length 6: floor(6/2)*2 -1 =3*2 -1=5, matches n=5.

For length 2: floor(2/2)*2 -1=1*2 -1=1, but in "AB", n=0.

So, doesn't match.

Maybe the formula is n = length -1 for length >=4.

But in "ABAB", length 4, n=3.

In "ABABAB", length 6, n=5.

So, n = length -1 for even length >=4.

But for length 2, n=0.

Wait, perhaps for even length >=4, n = length -1.

For odd length, perhaps different.

Wait, let's try "ABABA", length 5.

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 3: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 5: A != B, not special.

So, positions 2,3,4 are special, total 3.

So, n=3 for length 5.

Which is n = floor(length /2) *2 -1 =2*2 -1=3.

Similarly, for length 4: floor(4/2)*2 -1=3.

For length 6: floor(6/2)*2 -1=5.

For length 2: floor(2/2)*2 -1=1, but in reality n=0.

So, perhaps n = 2*floor((length-1)/2).

Wait, for length 4: 2*floor(3/2)=2*1=2, but actual n=3.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps n = 2*floor(length/2) -1 for even length >=4, and n = 2*floor((length-1)/2) for odd length >=3.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should think differently.

Let me consider that for any character in the string, whether it's special depends on its neighbors.

I need to maximize or minimize the number of special characters based on the pattern.

Perhaps I can think in terms of blocks of characters.

Wait, let's consider that each special character contributes to the count only if it equals exactly one neighbor.

I need to arrange the string such that exactly n characters satisfy this condition.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can look for patterns that produce a certain number of special characters.

For example, repeating patterns like "ABABAB..." seem to produce n = length -1 for even length >=4.

But for length 2, n=0.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize that for even length, n = length -1.

But in "ABAB", length 4, n=3.

In "ABABAB", length 6, n=5.

So, n = length -1 for even length.

For odd length, n = floor(length -1).

Wait, in "ABABA", length 5, n=3, which is length -2.

Wait, no, length -1 for even length, and length -2 for odd length.

Wait, in "ABABA", length 5, n=3, which is length -2.

Wait, perhaps n = length -1 for even length, and length -2 for odd length.

But in "ABAB", length 4, n=3, which is length -1.

In "ABABA", length 5, n=3, which is length -2.

In "ABABAB", length 6, n=5, which is length -1.

So, seems like for even length, n = length -1, and for odd length, n = length -2.

So, n is always odd for this particular pattern.

But in the problem, n can be even or odd.

In the sample input, for n=6 (even), it's possible with "AAABAACC".

Wait, but according to this pattern, for even length, n = length -1, which is odd.

So, there must be other patterns that allow even n.

Looking back at "AAABAACC", length 8, n=6, which is even.

So, there are patterns where n is even.

So, the earlier pattern I considered ("ABABAB...") only gives odd n for even length and odd n for odd length, but there are other patterns that can give even n.

So, perhaps I need to find a different pattern for even n.

Let me consider a pattern where I have blocks of identical characters.

For example, "AAABBBCCC".

Let's see:

- Position 1: A == A, special.

- Position 2: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 3: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 4: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 5: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 6: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 7: C == C, special.

- Position 8: C == C, special.

Wait, according to this:

- Position 1: A == A, special.

- Position 2: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 3: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 4: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 5: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 6: B == B and != C, special.

- Position 7: C == C, special.

- Position 8: C == C, special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all special, n=8.

Wait, but according to the problem, in "AAABAACC", n=6.

Wait, perhaps my earlier analysis was wrong.

Wait, in "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: A == A, special.

- Position 2: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 3: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 4: B == A, special.

- Position 5: A == B and != A, special.

- Position 6: A == A and != C, special.

- Position 7: C == C, special.

- Position 8: C == C, special.

Wait, according to this, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all special, n=8.

But the example says n=6.

I must have miscounted earlier.

Wait, perhaps the example's n=6 is for a different string.

Wait, in the problem statement, for n=6, the output is "YES" with "AAABAACC", and n=6.

But according to my count, it has 8 special characters.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait, perhaps the example's string "AAABAACC" has n=6 special characters, but according to my count, it has 8.

So, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, let's recount:

- Position 1: A == A (right neighbor), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 3: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == A (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 5: A == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 6: A == A (left) and != C (right), special.

- Position 7: C == C (left and right), but since it's equal to both neighbors, it's not special.

- Position 8: C == C (left), special.

Wait, in position 7: C == C (left) and C (right), so it equals both neighbors, so not special.

In position 8: C == C (left), so equals one neighbor, special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: total 7.

But the example says n=6 for "AAABAACC".

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps position 8 is not special because it equals its only neighbor C.

But in the problem, it should be special if it equals its only neighbor.

Wait, in the problem statement, for characters at the ends, they are special if they equal their only neighbor.

So, position 8 should be special.

Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier.

Let's recount:

- Position 1: A == A, special.

- Position 2: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 3: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 4: B == A and != A, special.

- Position 5: A == B and != A, special.

- Position 6: A == A and != C, special.

- Position 7: C == C and != C (only one neighbor), special.

- Position 8: C == C, special.

Wait, now I'm getting n=8.

But the example says n=6.

Perhaps the example string is different, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe in the problem, position 7: C == C (left) and C (right), so equals both neighbors, not special.

Position 8: C == C (left), special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: n=7.

But the example says n=6.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem or in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that for the end positions, they are special if they equal their only neighbor.

So, position 1: equals right neighbor, special.

Position 8: equals left neighbor, special.

Positions 2-7: equal exactly one neighbor.

In "AAABAACC":

- Positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: n=7.

But the example says n=6.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps in position 5: A == B (left) and != A (right), so special.

But maybe in the problem's string, position 5 is not special.

Wait, perhaps the string is different.

Wait, maybe the string is "AAABAACC", but perhaps it's "AAABAACC" with a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that a character is special if it equals exactly one neighbor, and in position 7: C == C (left) and C (right), so equals both, not special.

Position 8: C == C (left), special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: n=7.

But the example says n=6.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the problem's string "AAABAACC", it's "AAABAACC" with n=6.

But according to my count, it's 7.

Maybe the problem has a miscount, or perhaps I'm misreading the string.

Alternatively, perhaps the string is "AAABAACC" with n=6, but my count is 7, so maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that position 8 is not special because it only has one neighbor and equals it, but the rule says it should be special.

I'm confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I should look for a general rule for constructing such strings.

Suppose I want to maximize n.

One way is to alternate single characters with blocks.

For example, "ABABAB..." gives n = length -1 for even length.

But as seen earlier, for even length, n is odd.

But in the sample input, n=6 is even.

So, perhaps there are ways to construct strings with even n.

Looking at "AAABAACC":

- Positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: n=7.

But the problem says n=6 for this string.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects exactly n special characters, but in reality, it's possible to have more.

Wait, no, it's "exactly n special characters".

But in the sample input, for n=6, it's "YES" with "AAABAACC", which according to my count has 7 special characters, but the problem says n=6.

Maybe there's an error in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps in position 5: A == B (left) and != A (right), special.

Position 6: A == A (left) and != C (right), special.

Position 7: C == C (left) and == C (right), not special.

Position 8: C == C (left), special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 are special: n=7.

But the problem says n=6.

I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the string has n=7, but listed as n=6.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a string with exactly n special characters, and in some cases, it's not possible.

But in the sample input, for n=6, it's possible, for n=1, it's 'NO', for n=2, it's 'YES' with "MM".

Wait, in "MM", both M's equal their only neighbor, so both are special: n=2.

So, for n=2, it's possible.

For n=6, presumably, the provided string has n=6, even though my count says n=7.

Maybe the problem expects n=6, but the string actually has n=7.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows strings with at least n special characters, but the description says "exactly n".

I think it's safe to assume that the problem wants exactly n special characters.

Given that, in the sample input, for n=6, it's "YES" with "AAABAACC", which according to my count has n=7.

Perhaps there's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the string to have exactly n special characters.

For example, for n=6, maybe remove one special character.

But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a general rule based on n being even or odd.

From the sample input, n=1 is 'NO', n=2 is 'YES', n=6 is 'YES'.

Perhaps it's possible for all n >=2, except n=1.

But in my earlier trials, for n=3, it's possible with "AABC".

Wait, in "AABC":

- Position 1: A == A, special.

- Position 2: A == A and != B, special.

- Position 3: B == A, special.

- Position 4: C == B, special.

Wait, positions 1,2,3,4 are special: n=4.

Wait, that's not matching my earlier count.

Wait, position 2: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

Position 3: B == A, special.

Position 4: C == B, special.

So, positions 1,3,4 are special: n=3.

Wait, earlier I thought position 2 is not special, but according to the rule, A == A (left) and != B (right), so equals exactly one neighbor, special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4 are special: n=4.

Wait, no, position 2: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

Position 3: B == A (left) and != C (right), special.

Position 4: C == B (left), special.

Position 1: A == A (right), special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4 are special: n=4.

But earlier, I thought n=3 for "AABC". Maybe I miscounted.

So, for "AABC", n=4.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=3.

Wait, perhaps I'm making mistakes in counting.

This is getting too confusing.

Maybe I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider that for any n >=2, it's possible to construct a string with exactly n special characters, except for n=1.

From the sample input, n=1 is 'NO', n=2 and n=6 are 'YES'.

Perhaps it's possible for all n >=2.

But in my earlier trials, for n=3, it's possible with "AABC" (n=4), but I need n=3.

Maybe I need to adjust the string to have exactly n special characters.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible for all n >=2, except for some specific n.

I need to find a general rule.

Looking back, perhaps it's possible for all n >=2, except for n=1.

But in "AABC", n=4.

How can I get n=3?

Maybe by making the string longer and adjusting the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible for all n >=2.

Given that, perhaps in the program, for n >=2, print 'YES' and provide a string, and for n=1, print 'NO'.

But in the sample input, for n=2, it's 'YES' with "MM", and for n=6, 'YES' with "AAABAACC".

So, perhaps the program provided is correct.

Looking at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 1:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

pattern = []

for i in range(n // 2):

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])

print(''.join(pattern))



So, the program checks if n is odd:

- If n is odd, print 'NO'

- If n is even, print 'YES' and construct a pattern.

The pattern is constructed by appending 'A' and 'B' alternately.

For example, for n=2:

- pattern: 'AB'

But in 'AB', positions 1 and 2 are not special.

Wait, in 'AB':

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B != A, not special.

So, n=0, which is not equal to n=2.

So, for n=2, the program outputs "AB", which has n=0 special characters, not n=2.

But in the sample input, for n=2, it's 'YES' with "MM", which has n=2.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, the program constructs 'AB' for n=2, but 'AB' has n=0.

So, it's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to construct a different pattern.

Looking at the pattern construction:

for i in range(n // 2):

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])

So, for n=2:

- i=0

- pattern.append('AB'[0 % 2] = 'A')

- pattern.append('AB'[0 % 2 ^ 1] = 'AB'[0 ^ 1] = 'AB'[1] = 'B')

So, pattern = ['A', 'B'], string = "AB", which has n=0.

But for n=2, we need n=2 special characters.

In "MM", both M's are special because they equal their only neighbor.

So, the program is incorrect for n=2.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to construct a different pattern.

Looking back, perhaps it's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the program.

Wait, for n=6:

- n//2=3

- i=0: append 'A' and 'B'

- i=1: append 'B' and 'A'

- i=2: append 'A' and 'B'

So, pattern = ['A','B','B','A','A','B']

String: "ABBABA"

Let's check the number of special characters:

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 3: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 4: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 5: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 6: A == A (left), special.

Wait, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all special: n=6.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, in "ABBABA", all positions are special.

Wait, position 1: A == A (right), special.

Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

Position 3: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

Position 4: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

Position 5: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

Position 6: A == A (left), special.

So, n=6.

Therefore, for n=6, "ABBABA" is a valid string.

Similarly, for n=2, "MM" is a valid string with n=2 special characters.

But in the program, for n=2, it outputs "AB", which has n=0.

Wait, that's incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect for n=2.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted "ABBABA".

Wait, in "ABBABA":

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 3: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 4: A == A (left) and != B (right), special.

- Position 5: B == B (left) and != A (right), special.

- Position 6: A == A (left), special.

So, n=6.

But for n=2, the program outputs "AB", which has n=0, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is intended to construct a string where n is even, and it works for n=6, but not for n=2.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, I need to output "MM", which has n=2.

But in the program, it outputs "AB", which is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to modify the program to output "MM" for n=2.

But I need a general approach.

Looking back, perhaps the program should check if n is even and greater than or equal to 2, then construct a suitable string.

Wait, perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible to construct a string with exactly n special characters for all even n >=2, and for odd n, it's impossible.

But in my earlier trials, for n=3, which is odd, it's possible with "AABC", which has n=4, which is even.

Wait, perhaps only even n are possible.

But in the sample input, for n=6 (even), it's 'YES', for n=1 (odd), it's 'NO', for n=2 (even), it's 'YES'.

So, perhaps it's possible only for even n >=2.

But in "AABC", n=4, which is even.

In "ABBABA", n=6, even.

In "MM", n=2, even.

For n=1, it's 'NO'.

For n=3, which is odd, perhaps it's not possible.

But in "AABC", n=4, which is even.

Wait, maybe it's only possible for even n.

But in "AABC", n=4, even.

In "ABBABA", n=6, even.

In "MM", n=2, even.

For n=1, 'NO'.

For n=3, perhaps it's 'NO'.

Wait, but earlier I thought "AABC" has n=4.

So, perhaps it's only possible for even n >=2.

Hence, the program's logic of accepting even n and rejecting odd n is correct.

But in the sample input, for n=6 (even), it's 'YES', for n=1 (odd), 'NO', for n=2 (even), 'YES'.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

But earlier, I thought for n=2, "AB" is incorrect because it has n=0, but according to the program, it should output "YES" and a string with n=2 special characters.

So, perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted.

Looking back at the program, for n=2, it outputs "AB", which has n=0, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to output "MM" for n=2.

So, modify the program to output "MM" for n=2.

But for general even n, the current pattern seems to work.

Wait, for n=6, "ABBABA" has n=6, which is correct.

For n=2, "MM" has n=2, which is correct.

So, perhaps for n=2, output "MM", and for n>=4 and even, output the current pattern.

Hence, the program needs to be modified to handle n=2 separately.

But in the given program, for n=2, it outputs "AB", which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is intended to handle n>=4, but for n=2, it's a special case.

But in the sample input, for n=2, it's 'YES' with "MM".

Hence, the program needs to handle n=2 correctly.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Special Characters**:
   - For characters in the middle of the string, they are special if they equal exactly one of their two neighbors.
   - For characters at the ends, they are special if they equal their only neighbor.

2. **Observations**:
   - It's impossible to have exactly one special character (n=1), hence 'NO' for n=1.
   - For n >= 2, it's possible to construct a string with exactly n special characters if n is even.

3. **Strategy**:
   - For n even and greater than or equal to 2, construct a string where pairs of identical characters are placed alternately to achieve the desired number of special characters.
   - For n odd, it's impossible to achieve exactly n special characters, hence 'NO'.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            if n == 2:
                # For n=2, use "MM" which has exactly 2 special characters
                print('MM')
            else:
                # For n >= 4 and even, construct a pattern with 'A' and 'B'
                pattern = []
                for i in range(n // 2):
                    pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                    pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
                print(''.join(pattern))

# To use this function, you would call func() with the input as specified.
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Execution**:
  - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
  - For each test case:
    - Read the integer `n`.
    - If `n` is odd, print 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly n special characters.
    - If `n` is even:
      - Print 'YES'.
      - If `n` is 2, output "MM" which has exactly 2 special characters.
      - For `n` greater than or equal to 4, construct a pattern by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs to achieve exactly n special characters.

- **Key Insight**:
  - By pairing identical characters and arranging them in a specific pattern, we can control the number of special characters to be exactly n when n is even and greater than or equal to 2.
