Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The p_i are all distinct and no one is their own best friend. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party, and a friend comes only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

I need to figure out the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is distinct and p_i != i, it means that the best friend relationship is a permutation of the friends, and no one is their own best friend.

So, for example, if n=5 and p = [3,1,2,5,4], it means:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

From the example in the problem, if Monocarp invites friends [1,2,4,5], then friends [2,4,5] will come. Friend 2 comes because both friend 2 and friend 1 (their best friend) are invited. Friend 4 comes because both friend 4 and friend 5 (their best friend) are invited. Friend 5 comes because both friend 5 and friend 4 are invited. Friend 1 does not come because their best friend 3 is not invited, and friend 3 is not invited.

Another example in the note, for n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1], Monocarp can invite [1,2,3], and friends 1 and 2 will come. Friend 1 comes because both 1 and 2 (their best friend) are invited. Friend 2 comes because both 2 and 3 (their best friend) are invited. Friend 3 does not come because although they are invited, their best friend 4 is not invited. Friend 4 is not invited.

In the third example, n=2 and p=[2,1], Monocarp can invite both friends 1 and 2, and both will come.

From these examples, it seems that to get at least 2 friends to come, sometimes inviting just 2 friends is enough, but sometimes you have to invite more.

I need to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Let me think about the structure of the best friend relationships. Since p_i is a permutation with no fixed points and all p_i are distinct, it means that the best friend relationship forms a collection of cycles.

For example, in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4]:

- Starting from 1: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle of length 3)

- 4 -> 5 -> 4 (cycle of length 2)

So, the permutation consists of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.

In the second example, p = [2,3,4,1]:

- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 (a single 4-cycle)

In the third example, p = [2,1]:

- 1 -> 2 -> 1 (a 2-cycle)

So, the best friend relationships form cycles.

Now, to get a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend need to be invited. In terms of cycles, this means that in a cycle, to get a friend to come, we need to invite two consecutive friends in the cycle.

Let me consider the cycles separately.

For a cycle of length k:

- To get one friend to come, we need to invite two consecutive friends in the cycle.

- But we need at least two friends to come.

Wait, no. We need at least two friends to come, but they could be from different cycles or from the same cycle.

Wait, actually, the friends who come must each have both themselves and their best friend invited. So, if two friends are in different cycles, inviting two pairs, one from each cycle, would make two friends come, but that might not be minimal.

Wait, but in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting just two friends from the 2-cycle (friends 4 and 5) makes two friends come (4 and 5). That seems minimal.

In the second example, with a 4-cycle, inviting three friends seems necessary to get two friends to come.

In the third example, with a 2-cycle, inviting two friends makes both come.

So, perhaps, in cycles of length 2, inviting both friends is necessary to get both to come, and that's minimal.

In cycles of length greater than 2, inviting two consecutive friends makes those two come, but perhaps there are better ways.

Wait, but in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes both of them come, but they are from the same cycle.

In a 4-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes both of them come.

Wait, but in the second example, with a 4-cycle, the minimal number of invitations is 3, but according to this, inviting two consecutive friends should make two come.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think again.

In a cycle of length k:

- If I invite two consecutive friends, say friend A and friend B, where B is A's best friend, then both A and B come, because A has B invited and B has A invited.

Wait, no. Wait, A comes if A and A's best friend are invited. B comes if B and B's best friend are invited.

So, in a cycle, if I invite A and B, where B is A's best friend, then:

- A comes if A and B are invited. So A comes.

- B comes if B and A are invited. So B comes.

- But what about the others in the cycle? They are not invited, so they don't come.

So, in a cycle of length k, inviting two consecutive friends makes two friends come.

Is that minimal?

Wait, maybe in some cycles, inviting two friends who are not consecutive could make more friends come.

Wait, no. If I invite two friends who are not consecutive in the cycle, say A and C, where C is not A's best friend, then:

- A comes only if A's best friend is invited, which is B. But B is not invited, so A does not come.

- C comes only if C's best friend is invited, which is D. If D is not invited, C does not come.

- So, only if I invite A and B, where B is A's best friend, does A come.

Similarly, only if I invite B and C, where C is B's best friend, does B come.

So, to get a friend to come, I need to invite them and their best friend, who are consecutive in the cycle.

Therefore, in a cycle of length k, inviting two consecutive friends makes those two come.

But perhaps inviting more can make more come, but with minimal invitations, I want to invite as few as possible.

So, for each cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes two come.

But in the second example, with a 4-cycle, the minimal number is 3, but according to this, inviting two consecutive friends should make two come.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in some cases, inviting two consecutive friends in one cycle is not enough to get two friends to come.

Wait, no, in the first example, inviting two from the 2-cycle makes two come.

In the second example, with a 4-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends should make two come.

But in the note, it says that inviting three friends is necessary to get two to come.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second example, p = [2,3,4,1], which is a single 4-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites friends [1,2,3], then:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 does not come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited.

- Friend 4 is not invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But if he invites only friends [1,2], then:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 2 does not come.

Wait, does friend 2 need both themselves and their best friend invited to come? Yes.

Friend 2's best friend is 3. So, friend 2 comes only if both 2 and 3 are invited.

So, if Monocarp invites 1 and 2, friend 1 comes (since 1 and 2 are invited), but friend 2 does not come because their best friend 3 is not invited.

Therefore, only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

Therefore, Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends in this case to get at least two friends to come.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, in a 4-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends should make two come.

But in this case, it doesn't hold because friend 2 requires their best friend 3 to be invited as well.

Wait, no, if Monocarp invites 1,2, and 3, then:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited, so friend 3 does not come.

- Friend 4 is not invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the note, Monocarp can send invitations to friends [1,2,3], and friends 1 and 2 will attend.

Wait, but in the note, it says friend 3 won't come because his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation, which is correct.

So, in this case, with a 4-cycle, inviting three friends makes two come.

Is there a way to invite fewer than three?

If Monocarp invites only two friends, say 1 and 2, then only friend 1 comes, as explained earlier.

If he invites 1 and 3, then:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited; 2 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited; 4 is not invited, so no.

- So, no one comes.

If he invites 1 and 4:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited; 2 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 4 comes if both 4 and 1 are invited; 1 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- But only one friend comes, which is not enough.

If he invites 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited; yes.

- Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited; 4 is not invited, so no.

- So, only friend 2 comes, which is not enough.

Therefore, it seems that in this 4-cycle, to get at least two friends to come, Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends.

Wait, but in a 4-cycle, is there a way to invite three friends such that more than two come?

For example, inviting 1,2, and 4:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited; yes.

- Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited; 3 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 4 comes if both 4 and 1 are invited; yes.

- So, friends 1 and 4 come.

That's two friends.

Another way, inviting 1,3, and 4:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited; 2 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited; yes.

- Friend 4 comes if both 4 and 1 are invited; 1 is invited, so yes.

- So, friends 3 and 4 come.

That's two friends.

So, in this 4-cycle, inviting any three friends makes two friends come.

Is there a way to invite fewer than three? No, as shown earlier.

So, for this 4-cycle, the minimal number of invitations is three.

But in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting two friends from the 2-cycle makes two friends come.

In the third example, with a 2-cycle, inviting both makes both come.

So, perhaps in cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come, which is minimal.

In cycles of length greater than 2, inviting three friends is sometimes necessary.

Wait, but in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough.

In the second example, with a 4-cycle, inviting three friends is necessary.

So, perhaps in cycles of length k, the minimal number of invitations to get at least two friends to come is:

- For a 2-cycle: invite both (2 invitations)

- For cycles of length k >= 3: invite three friends

Wait, but in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes two come.

Wait, in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes two come.

But perhaps in a 4-cycle, inviting three friends is necessary to get two to come.

Wait, but in a 4-cycle, inviting two specific friends can make two come.

Wait, let's consider a 4-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3:

- Friends 1 and 2 come.

If he invites friends 2, 3, and 4:

- Friends 2 and 3 come.

If he invites friends 1, 3, and 4:

- Friends 1 and 4 come.

So, in all cases, inviting three makes two come.

But is there a way to invite only two and make two come? Earlier analysis says no.

Wait, but maybe if we invite non-consecutive friends.

Wait, in a 4-cycle, inviting friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1 does not come because friend 2 is not invited.

- Friend 3 does not come because friend 4 is not invited.

- So, no one comes.

Inviting friends 1 and 4:

- Friend 1 does not come because friend 2 is not invited.

- Friend 4 comes because friend 1 is invited.

- So, only friend 4 comes.

Inviting friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 2 comes because friends 2 and 3 are invited; but friend 3 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 4 comes because friends 4 and 1 are invited; friend 1 is not invited, so no.

- So, no one comes.

Therefore, in a 4-cycle, inviting only two friends cannot make at least two friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations for a 4-cycle is three.

Similarly, in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes two come.

Wait, but in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes both come.

For example, in a 3-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because friends 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because friends 2 and 3 are invited; friend 3 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 3 is not invited.

- So, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, that's not what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends does not make both come, because the second friend requires their best friend to be invited.

In the 3-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited; 3 is not invited, so friend 2 does not come.

- Friend 3 is not invited.

- So, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

In the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting friends from the 2-cycle makes two come.

Wait, in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which is two cycles: 1->3->2->1 and 4->5->4.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4 comes because 4 and 5 are invited.

- Friend 5 comes because 5 and 4 are invited.

- So, both come.

If he invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 3 are invited; but 3 is not invited, so no.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 1 are invited; 1 is invited, but friend 1 does not come because their best friend 3 is not invited. Wait, but friend 2's best friend is 1, who is invited, and friend 2 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 is not invited.

- So, only friend 2 comes.

Wait, but according to the example, inviting friends 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come.

Wait, but in the note, inviting friends [1,2,3] makes friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, but in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which is two cycles: 1->3->2->1 and 4->5->4.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4 comes because 4 and 5 are invited.

- Friend 5 comes because 5 and 4 are invited.

- So, two friends come.

That seems minimal.

In the second example, p = [2,3,4,1], a single 4-cycle: 1->2->3->4->1.

As earlier analysis shows, inviting three friends makes two come.

In the third example, p = [2,1], a single 2-cycle: 1->2->1.

Inviting both friends makes both come.

So, in general, for cycles:

- For a 2-cycle, inviting both makes both come.

- For cycles of length >=3, inviting three friends makes two come.

But in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough.

So, perhaps, in general, for a graph consisting of multiple cycles, the minimal number of invitations is the sum of the minimal invitations needed for each cycle.

Wait, but in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough.

So, perhaps, for disjoint cycles, the minimal invitations is the minimal over the cycles.

Wait, but in the first example, inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough, but in the second example, with a single 4-cycle, needing to invite three.

So, perhaps, for each cycle, the minimal invitations needed to get at least two friends to come is:

- For a 2-cycle: 2 invitations

- For cycles of length >=3: 3 invitations

Then, for multiple disjoint cycles, the total minimal invitations is the sum of the minimal invitations for each cycle.

Wait, but in the first example, there is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, and inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough, which is less than the sum of minimal invitations for each cycle.

Wait, in the first example, according to this, the minimal invitations should be 2 (from the 2-cycle), but according to the earlier analysis, inviting two from the 2-cycle is enough to get two friends to come.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal over the minimal invitations required for each cycle.

That is, take the minimal minimal invitations from all cycles.

So, in the first example, the minimal invitations is 2 (from the 2-cycle).

In the second example, it's 3 (from the 4-cycle).

In the third example, it's 2 (from the 2-cycle).

This seems to match the examples.

So, the strategy is:

- Decompose the permutation into disjoint cycles.

- For each cycle, determine the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least two friends to come.

- Then, the overall minimal number of invitations is the minimal among these values.

Wait, but in the first example, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, the minimal invitations is 2, which is the minimal among the two cycles' minimal invitations.

In the second example, only one cycle of length 4, minimal invitations is 3.

In the third example, only one cycle of length 2, minimal invitations is 2.

This seems consistent.

But wait, in the first example, if I have a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, and the minimal invitations is 2, but if I have multiple cycles, do I need to sum the minimal invitations for each cycle?

Wait, no, because the cycles are disjoint, and inviting friends from one cycle doesn't affect the others, except that we need at least two friends from any cycle to come.

Wait, no, we need at least two friends in total to come, not necessarily from the same cycle.

So, if I have multiple cycles, I can choose to invite friends from one cycle to make two friends come, and not invite anyone from other cycles.

Therefore, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal number of invitations needed across all cycles to get at least two friends to come from that cycle.

So, in the first example, the minimal is 2 from the 2-cycle.

In the second example, it's 3 from the 4-cycle.

In the third example, it's 2 from the 2-cycle.

Hence, for cycles of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

For cycles of length >=3, minimal invitations are 3.

So, the overall minimal invitations is the minimal of these values across all cycles.

Hence, in the first example, minimal is 2.

In the second example, minimal is 3.

In the third example, minimal is 2.

Which matches the sample outputs.

Therefore, the strategy is:

- Decompose the permutation into disjoint cycles.

- For each cycle, determine the minimal invitations needed to get at least two friends to come.

- The overall minimal invitations is the minimal of these values.

Now, how do I implement this efficiently, given the constraints?

Given that n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 5000, I need an efficient way to find the cycle lengths and then compute the minimal invitations.

But decomposing the permutation into cycles for each test case might be time-consuming if done naively.

Wait, but n is up to 50, and t is up to 5000, so total operations should be acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I don't need to find all cycles explicitly.

Wait, perhaps I can find the cycle lengths and then compute the minimal invitations based on the minimal cycle length.

Wait, in the first example, there is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, and the minimal invitations are 2.

In the second example, a 4-cycle, minimal invitations are 3.

In the third example, a 2-cycle, minimal invitations are 2.

So, it seems that the minimal invitations are determined by the minimal cycle length.

Specifically:

- For cycles of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

- For cycles of length >=3, minimal invitations are 3.

Hence, the overall minimal invitations is the minimal among these values across all cycles.

Hence, the minimal invitations are:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, then minimal invitations are 2.

- Otherwise, for all cycles of length >=3, minimal invitations are 3.

So, I can find the minimal cycle length in the permutation and then set the minimal invitations accordingly.

Specifically:

- If there is any cycle of length 2, then minimal invitations are 2.

- Else, minimal invitations are 3.

Wait, but in the first example, there is a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle, and minimal invitations are 2.

In the second example, only a 4-cycle, minimal invitations are 3.

In the third example, only a 2-cycle, minimal invitations are 2.

So, yes, if there is at least one cycle of length 2, minimal invitations are 2; else, minimal invitations are 3.

Wait, but what if there are only cycles of length >=3?

Then, minimal invitations are 3.

But in such cycles, as seen in the second example, inviting three friends makes two come.

Wait, but is this always the case?

Wait, in a cycle of length k >=3, inviting any two consecutive friends makes both come, but in the second example, that didn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in a cycle of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least two friends to come is 3.

Wait, but why is that?

In a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes one come, as seen earlier.

Wait, in a 3-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->1.

If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 does not come because 2 and 3 are invited, but 3 is not invited.

- So, only friend 1 comes.

If I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1 does not come because friend 2 is not invited.

- Friend 3 comes because friend 3 and friend 2 are invited; friend 2 is not invited, so no.

- So, no one comes.

If I invite 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 comes because friend 2 and friend 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes because friend 3 and friend 1 are invited; friend 1 is not invited, so no.

- So, only friend 2 comes.

So, in a 3-cycle, inviting two consecutive friends makes only one come.

But inviting three friends:

- Invite 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes because 3 and 1 are invited.

- So, all three come.

But we only need at least two friends to come, so inviting three makes three come.

But is there a way to invite fewer than three?

From above, no.

Hence, for a 3-cycle, minimal invitations are 3.

Similarly, in a 4-cycle, as in the second example, inviting three friends makes two come, and inviting fewer than three doesn't make two come.

Hence, for cycles of length >=3, minimal invitations are 3.

For cycles of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

Hence, overall minimal invitations are:

- If there exists at least one cycle of length 2, then minimal invitations are 2.

- Else, minimal invitations are 3.

Hence, I just need to check if there is any cycle of length 2 in the permutation.

If yes, minimal invitations are 2; else, 3.

Wait, but in the first example, there is a 2-cycle, so minimal is 2.

In the second example, no 2-cycles, so minimal is 3.

In the third example, a 2-cycle, so minimal is 2.

Hence, this seems correct.

So, the program just needs to check if there is any cycle of length 2 in the permutation.

If yes, print 2; else, print 3.

Wait, but in the first example, there is a 2-cycle, so print 2.

In the second example, no 2-cycles, so print 3.

In the third example, a 2-cycle, so print 2.

Hence, the output is 2,3,2, which matches the sample output.

Therefore, the program can be simplified to check for the presence of any 2-cycles in the permutation.

Given that p_i are distinct and p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct, it's a derangement.

Hence, I just need to check if there is any 2-cycle in the permutation.

If yes, minimal invitations are 2; else, 3.

Hence, I can decompose the permutation into cycles and check if any cycle has length 2.

If yes, print 2; else, print 3.

But in the problem statement, it says "Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party."

Given that, and the analysis above, it seems that the minimal number is either 2 or 3, depending on the presence of 2-cycles.

Hence, the program can be simplified to:

- For each test case:

- Read n and p

- Check if there is any i where p[p[i]] == i and p[i] != i (which defines a 2-cycle)

- If yes, print 2; else, print 3.

Wait, but p[i] != i is already given.

Hence, if p[p[i]] == i, then it's a 2-cycle.

Hence, for each i from 1 to n:

- If p[p[i]] == i and p[i] != i, then there is a 2-cycle.

But since p[i] != i and all p_i are distinct, checking p[p[i]] == i is sufficient to identify 2-cycles.

Hence, for each test case, iterate through the friends and check if any friend is in a 2-cycle.

If yes, minimal invitations are 2; else, 3.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Hence, the program can be written accordingly.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

x = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

This seems to implement the above logic.

- Read t (number of test cases)

- For each test case:

- Read n (number of friends)

- Read the list p

- For each friend i from 0 to n-1:

- Check if p[p[i]] == i+1, which indicates a 2-cycle

- If yes, set flag=True and print 2

- If no 2-cycle found after checking all friends, print 3

Hence, this seems correct.

Wait, but in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, l = [3,1,2,5,4]

Check for i=0: l[3-1] = l[2] = 2 != 1

i=1: l[1-1] = l[0] = 3 != 2

i=2: l[2-1] = l[1] = 1 != 3

i=3: l[5-1] = l[4] = 4 == 4, but p[i] != i is guaranteed, so p[4] = 5 !=4, wait, p[4] =5, p[5]=4, so p[p[4]]=4 ==4, but p[i] !=i, so this should be invalid?

Wait, p_i !=i, so p[p[i]] ==i indicates a 2-cycle.

In this case, for i=3: p[4]=5, p[5]=4, so p[p[4]]=4 ==i+1=5, no, wait, indices are 0-based.

Wait, l = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, l[0]=3, l[1]=1, l[2]=2, l[3]=5, l[4]=4

For i=0: l[l[0]-1] = l[3-1] = l[2] =2 != 1

For i=1: l[l[1]-1] = l[1-1] = l[0] =3 !=2

For i=2: l[l[2]-1] = l[2-1] = l[1] =1 !=3

For i=3: l[l[3]-1] = l[5-1] = l[4] =4 ==4 !=5

Wait, l[4] =4, but i=3 corresponds to friend 4, p[4]=5, p[5]=4, so p[p[4]]=4, which is i+1=4, but p[i] !=i, so 4 !=4, which is false.

Wait, p_i !=i, so p[p[i]] ==i indicates a 2-cycle.

Wait, in this case, p[p[4]] = p[5] =4 ==4, which is i+1=4, so it's a 2-cycle.

Wait, but in 0-based indexing, l[3]=5 and l[4]=4, so l[l[3]-1] = l[5-1] = l[4]=4, which is i=3, so l[l[3]-1] ==3+1=4, so it matches.

Hence, it correctly identifies the 2-cycle.

Similarly, in the second example, p=[2,3,4,1], which is a 4-cycle.

So, l = [2,3,4,1]

For i=0: l[l[0]-1] = l[2-1]=l[1]=3 !=1

i=1: l[l[1]-1] = l[3-1]=l[2]=4 !=2

i=2: l[l[2]-1] = l[4-1]=l[3]=1 !=3

i=3: l[l[3]-1] = l[1-1]=l[0]=2 !=4

Hence, no 2-cycle, so print 3.

In the third example, p=[2,1], which is a 2-cycle.

l = [2,1]

i=0: l[l[0]-1] = l[2-1]=l[1]=1 ==1, which is i+1=1, so it's a 2-cycle, print 2.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
