Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Mocha has an array, and she can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swap them. After performing this operation as many times as she wants, she wants to know if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, I need to make sure I understand the operation clearly. So, if I have an array `a = [3,1,4,1,5]`, I can choose a prefix `x = [3,1]` and a suffix `y = [4,1,5]`, and swap them to get `[4,1,5,3,1]`. Alternatively, I can choose `x = [3,1,4,1,5]` and `y = []`, which effectively doesn't change the array. So, it's like rotating the array by splitting at any point and swapping the parts.

Wait, but it's not exactly like a single rotation because in a rotation, you shift elements circularly, but here, you're splitting into two parts and swapping them. So, for example, if you have `a = [1,2,3,4,5]`, and you split into `x=[1,2]` and `y=[3,4,5]`, swapping gives `[3,4,5,1,2]`. Another operation could be to split `x=[3,4]` and `y=[5,1,2]`, swapping to get `[5,1,2,3,4]`, and so on.

But the key point is that after performing this operation any number of times, can the array become sorted in non-decreasing order?

So, I need to find out if, through a series of such swaps, I can rearrange the array to be sorted.

Let me consider the example provided in the problem:

First test case:

n = 6

a = [1,1,4,5,1,4]

The output is "No", meaning it's not possible to sort this array using the given operation.

Second test case:

n = 5

a = [7,9,2,2,3]

Output is "Yes", and there's a demonstration of how to perform the operations to sort it.

Third test case:

n = 3

a = [1,2,3]

It's already sorted, so "Yes".

Okay, so I need to find a way to determine whether such a sequence of operations can sort the array.

Let me think about the properties of this operation. Each operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. So, it's like reversing a substring, but not exactly, because you're swapping two parts.

Wait, no. Reversing a substring is different because that changes the order of elements within the substring, whereas this operation just swaps two parts.

I need to see what permutations of the array can be achieved through this operation.

Let me consider the array as a sequence of elements, and see what rearrangements are possible.

First, note that the operation allows me to split the array at any index i (from 0 to n-1), take the first i elements as prefix x, and the remaining as suffix y, and swap them to get y + x.

So, for example, with n=4 and a=[a,b,c,d]:

- Split at i=0: x=[], y=[a,b,c,d]; swap gives [a,b,c,d] (no change)

- Split at i=1: x=[a], y=[b,c,d]; swap gives [b,c,d,a]

- Split at i=2: x=[a,b], y=[c,d]; swap gives [c,d,a,b]

- Split at i=3: x=[a,b,c], y=[d]; swap gives [d,a,b,c]

- Split at i=4: x=[a,b,c,d], y=[]; swap gives [a,b,c,d] (no change)

So, the possible arrays after one operation are [a,b,c,d], [b,c,d,a], [c,d,a,b], [d,a,b,c].

If I perform the operation multiple times, can I generate more permutations?

Let's see:

Starting with [a,b,c,d]:

- Operation 1: split at i=1, get [b,c,d,a]

- Operation 2: split at i=2, get [c,d,a,b]

- Operation 3: split at i=3, get [d,a,b,c]

- Operation 4: split at i=2, get [a,b,c,d] back

So, it seems like repeatedly applying these operations, I can cycle through these permutations but might not be able to generate all possible permutations of the array.

In fact, it's similar to rotation operations, but with swapping parts.

Wait, maybe it's related to the concept of rotation distance in computer science, which measures the minimum number of rotations needed to transform one tree into another.

But in this case, it's about arrays.

I need to find out if, through such operations, I can sort the array.

An alternative approach: perhaps I can think of the array as being "circularly" rearranged, and see if the sorted version is achievable through such circular rearrangements.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the array as a circular list, and see if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But the operation allows more than just single rotations; it allows swapping any prefix and suffix.

Wait, actually, in the operation, splitting at index i and swapping prefix x and suffix y effectively does a kind of reversal.

Wait, no. Swapping prefix x and suffix y is not the same as reversing any part.

Let me take an example.

Take a = [1,2,3,4]

Possible operations:

- Split at i=0: x=[], y=[1,2,3,4]; swap gives [1,2,3,4]

- Split at i=1: x=[1], y=[2,3,4]; swap gives [2,3,4,1]

- Split at i=2: x=[1,2], y=[3,4]; swap gives [3,4,1,2]

- Split at i=3: x=[1,2,3], y=[4]; swap gives [4,1,2,3]

- Split at i=4: x=[1,2,3,4], y=[]; swap gives [1,2,3,4]

So, after one operation, I can have [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,1], [3,4,1,2], [4,1,2,3].

If I perform the operation again on [2,3,4,1], for example:

- Split at i=1: x=[2], y=[3,4,1]; swap gives [3,4,1,2]

- Split at i=2: x=[2,3], y=[4,1]; swap gives [4,1,2,3]

- Split at i=3: x=[2,3,4], y=[1]; swap gives [1,2,3,4]

So, from [2,3,4,1], I can get [3,4,1,2], [4,1,2,3], or [1,2,3,4].

Similarly, from [3,4,1,2], I can get [4,1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], or [2,3,4,1].

From [4,1,2,3], I can get [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,1], or [3,4,1,2].

So, it seems that with these operations, I can cycle through these four permutations, but I can't get to other permutations, like [4,3,2,1] or something.

Wait, but in this case, if the sorted array is among these permutations, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

But I need a general way to determine this for any array of length up to 50.

Given that n can be up to 50, and t can be up to 1000, I need an efficient way to check this.

Let me think about the properties of these operations.

Each operation is equivalent to a rotation by i positions, where i is the length of the prefix.

Wait, but it's not exactly a rotation; it's swapping the prefix and suffix.

Wait, in the example above, splitting at i=1 and swapping gives a rotation to the right by one position.

Similarly, splitting at i=2 and swapping gives a rotation to the right by two positions.

Wait, no. In the first example, splitting at i=1 (x=[1], y=[2,3,4]), swapping gives [2,3,4,1], which is a rotation to the right by one position.

Similarly, splitting at i=2 (x=[1,2], y=[3,4]), swapping gives [3,4,1,2], which is a rotation to the right by two positions.

And splitting at i=3 gives [4,1,2,3], which is a rotation to the right by three positions.

So, in this case, it seems that any rotation to the right by any number of positions can be achieved by choosing the appropriate i.

Similarly, by performing multiple such operations, I can achieve rotations to the left as well.

Wait, for example, if I rotate right by one position, and then rotate right by one again, I get a rotation right by two positions, and so on.

But to rotate left, I would need to rotate right by n - k positions.

Wait, in the example above, with n=4:

- Rotating right by 1: [2,3,4,1]

- Rotating right by 2: [3,4,1,2]

- Rotating right by 3: [4,1,2,3]

- Rotating right by 4: [1,2,3,4]

So, rotating right by 4 is the same as rotating left by 0.

Similarly, rotating right by 3 is the same as rotating left by 1.

Wait, no. Rotating right by 3 is the same as rotating left by 1 in a cycle.

Because rotating right by 3 is equivalent to rotating left by 1 in a cycle of length 4.

Yes, because 3 ≡ -1 mod 4.

So, effectively, by performing these operations, I can achieve any rotation of the array.

Therefore, the array can be transformed into any rotation of itself.

So, if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Wait, but in the second test case:

n=5

a=[7,9,2,2,3]

sorted a=[2,2,3,7,9]

And it's possible to achieve this through operations.

In the explanation, they perform two operations:

1. Split x=[7], y=[9,2,2,3], swap to get [9,2,2,3,7]

2. Split x=[9], y=[2,2,3,7], swap to get [2,2,3,7,9]

So, in two operations, they achieved the sorted array.

This aligns with my conclusion that any rotation can be achieved through these operations.

Wait, but in this case, [2,2,3,7,9] is a rotation of the original array [7,9,2,2,3].

So, my conclusion seems correct.

Similarly, in the first test case:

n=6

a=[1,1,4,5,1,4]

sorted a=[1,1,4,4,5,1]

But is [1,1,4,4,5,1] a rotation of the original array?

Let's see: original is [1,1,4,5,1,4]

Possible rotations:

- [1,1,4,5,1,4]

- [1,4,5,1,4,1]

- [4,5,1,4,1,1]

- [5,1,4,1,1,4]

- [1,4,1,1,4,5]

- [4,1,1,4,5,1]

None of these match [1,1,4,4,5,1], so it's not a rotation.

Hence, "No", which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

sorted a=[1,2,3]

which is the same as the original, so "Yes".

Hence, my conclusion seems to hold.

So, the problem reduces to checking if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

To check if one array is a rotation of another, a common technique is to concatenate the original array to itself and check if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array.

For example, for original array [7,9,2,2,3], concatenated array is [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3].

Sorted array is [2,2,3,7,9], which appears as a substring in the concatenated array, so "Yes".

In the first test case, concatenated array is [1,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,4,5,1,4], and sorted array is [1,1,4,4,5,1], which does not appear as a substring, so "No".

Hence, this seems to be an efficient way to solve the problem.

Given that n can be up to 50 and t up to 1000, this should be efficient enough.

So, in code, for each test case, I can sort the array, concatenate the original array to itself, and check if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array.

Wait, but in the provided program, it seems to be doing something similar.

Looking at the code:

There's a main function `func_2` that reads input and processes each test case.

Then there's `func_1` that takes the array, sorts it, concatenates the original array to itself, and checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array.

This aligns with my reasoning.

However, I need to make sure that this approach is correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, the sorted array is [1,1,4,4,5,1], and the concatenated array is [1,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,4,5,1,4].

Here, [1,1,4,4,5,1] does not appear as a subarray, hence "No".

In the second test case, sorted array is [2,2,3,7,9], and concatenated array is [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3], which contains [2,2,3,7,9], so "Yes".

In the third test case, sorted array is [1,2,3], and concatenated array is [1,2,3,1,2,3], which contains [1,2,3], so "Yes".

Seems correct.

But wait, is there any edge case where this approach might fail?

Let me think about an array that cannot be sorted through rotations but my approach says it can.

Consider n=4, a=[1,3,2,4].

Sorted a=[1,2,3,4].

Concatenated a: [1,3,2,4,1,3,2,4].

Does [1,2,3,4] appear in it? Let's see:

- [1,3,2,4]

- [3,2,4,1]

- [2,4,1,3]

- [4,1,3,2]

None of these match [1,2,3,4], so "No".

But can we actually sort it through the operations?

Let's try:

Original: [1,3,2,4]

Possible operations:

- Split at i=1: x=[1], y=[3,2,4] -> [3,2,4,1]

- Split at i=2: x=[1,3], y=[2,4] -> [2,4,1,3]

- Split at i=3: x=[1,3,2], y=[4] -> [4,1,3,2]

None of these are sorted.

From [3,2,4,1]:

- Split at i=1: x=[3], y=[2,4,1] -> [2,4,1,3]

- Split at i=2: x=[3,2], y=[4,1] -> [4,1,3,2]

- Split at i=3: x=[3,2,4], y=[1] -> [1,3,2,4] (back to original)

From [2,4,1,3]:

- Split at i=1: x=[2], y=[4,1,3] -> [4,1,3,2]

- Split at i=2: x=[2,4], y=[1,3] -> [1,3,2,4]

- Split at i=3: x=[2,4,1], y=[3] -> [3,2,4,1]

From [4,1,3,2]:

- Split at i=1: x=[4], y=[1,3,2] -> [1,3,2,4]

- Split at i=2: x=[4,1], y=[3,2] -> [3,2,4,1]

- Split at i=3: x=[4,1,3], y=[2] -> [2,4,1,3]

We can see that we are cycling through these permutations but not reaching [1,2,3,4].

Hence, "No".

So, my approach correctly identifies this.

Another test case: n=4, a=[4,3,2,1].

Sorted a=[1,2,3,4].

Concatenated a: [4,3,2,1,4,3,2,1].

Does [1,2,3,4] appear in it? Looking at substrings:

- [4,3,2,1]

- [3,2,1,4]

- [2,1,4,3]

- [1,4,3,2]

None match [1,2,3,4], so "No".

Again, trying operations:

Original: [4,3,2,1]

Possible operations:

- Split at i=1: x=[4], y=[3,2,1] -> [3,2,1,4]

- Split at i=2: x=[4,3], y=[2,1] -> [2,1,4,3]

- Split at i=3: x=[4,3,2], y=[1] -> [1,4,3,2]

None are sorted.

From [3,2,1,4]:

- Split at i=1: x=[3], y=[2,1,4] -> [2,1,4,3]

- Split at i=2: x=[3,2], y=[1,4] -> [1,4,3,2]

- Split at i=3: x=[3,2,1], y=[4] -> [4,3,2,1] (back to original)

From [2,1,4,3]:

- Split at i=1: x=[2], y=[1,4,3] -> [1,4,3,2]

- Split at i=2: x=[2,1], y=[4,3] -> [4,3,2,1]

- Split at i=3: x=[2,1,4], y=[3] -> [3,2,1,4]

From [1,4,3,2]:

- Split at i=1: x=[1], y=[4,3,2] -> [4,3,2,1]

- Split at i=2: x=[1,4], y=[3,2] -> [3,2,1,4]

- Split at i=3: x=[1,4,3], y=[2] -> [2,1,4,3]

Again, can't reach [1,2,3,4].

So, "No".

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, a=[2,2,2,2,2].

Sorted a=[2,2,2,2,2], which is the same as original, so "Yes".

Concatenated a: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which contains [2,2,2,2,2], so "Yes".

Correct.

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,3,2].

Sorted a=[1,2,3].

Concatenated a: [1,3,2,1,3,2].

Does [1,2,3] appear? Looking at substrings:

- [1,3,2]

- [3,2,1]

- [2,1,3]

None match [1,2,3], so "No".

Trying operations:

Original: [1,3,2]

Operations:

- Split at i=1: x=[1], y=[3,2] -> [3,2,1]

- Split at i=2: x=[1,3], y=[2] -> [2,1,3]

None are sorted.

From [3,2,1]:

- Split at i=1: x=[3], y=[2,1] -> [2,1,3]

- Split at i=2: x=[3,2], y=[1] -> [1,3,2]

Back to original.

From [2,1,3]:

- Split at i=1: x=[2], y=[1,3] -> [1,3,2]

- Split at i=2: x=[2,1], y=[3] -> [3,2,1]

Again, can't reach [1,2,3].

Hence, "No".

Correct.

Seems like the approach is solid.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\texttt{Correctness: True}}
