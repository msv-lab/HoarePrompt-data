Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 15 cells in total.

There are two types of applications:

1. Applications with 1x1 icons, which take up only one cell each.

2. Applications with 2x2 icons, which take up a square of four cells.

Given the number of each type of application (x for 1x1 and y for 2x2), I need to figure out the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons, making sure no cell is occupied by more than one icon.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked.

- Each screen has 15 cells.

- 1x1 icons take one cell each.

- 2x2 icons take four cells each.

- I need to minimize the number of screens used.

I should consider how to efficiently place the 2x2 icons first since they occupy more space. Placing them first might leave fewer cells for the 1x1 icons, potentially minimizing the number of screens needed.

Let me think about the grid. A 5x3 grid:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four adjacent cells in a square. For example, cells 2,3,5,6 or cells 4,5,7,8, etc.

I need to figure out how many 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen without overlapping.

Let's see:

In a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 squares can be placed?

Looking at the grid:

- In row 1 and row 2, you can place one 2x2 square (cells 2,3,5,6).

- In row 2 and row 3, another 2x2 square (cells 4,5,7,8).

- In row 3 and row 4, another (cells 7,8,10,11).

- In row 4 and row 5, another (cells 10,11,13,14).

So, in total, you can place up to 3 non-overlapping 2x2 squares per screen.

Wait, let's visualize:

Columns: 1 2 3

Row 1: 1 2 3

Row 2: 4 5 6

Row 3: 7 8 9

Row 4: 10 11 12

Row 5: 13 14 15

If I place a 2x2 square on cells 2,3,5,6, that's one.

Then, I can place another on cells 5,6,8,9, but wait, cells 5 and 6 are already occupied by the first square, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, place one on cells 4,5,7,8, but then cells 5 and 7 are occupied.

Hmm, seems like in a 5x3 grid, you can only place two non-overlapping 2x2 squares.

Let me try:

- Place first 2x2 on cells 2,3,5,6.

- Place second 2x2 on cells 7,8,10,11.

- Now, cells 5 and 7 are overlapping if I try to place a third, but they aren't overlapping in this configuration.

Wait, cells 7 and 8 are part of the second square, so placing a third square would overlap.

So, maximum of two 2x2 squares per screen.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, it seems they have placed only one 2x2 square and some 1x1 icons.

But according to my calculation, I can place up to two 2x2 squares per screen, using 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But perhaps the arrangement is constrained due to the grid structure.

Let me see:

If I place two 2x2 squares:

- First on cells 2,3,5,6.

- Second on cells 7,8,10,11.

- Then, cells 1,4,9,12,13,14,15 are free for 1x1 icons.

That's 7 cells.

Alternatively, if I place only one 2x2 square, say on cells 2,3,5,6, then cells 1,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 are free, which is 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, placing more 2x2 squares reduces the number of cells available for 1x1 icons, but allows for more efficient use of space if there are many 2x2 icons.

Now, the problem is to minimize the number of screens given x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons.

My initial thought is:

1. Calculate how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons.

2. Then, see how many remaining cells are left on those screens after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. If the remaining cells can accommodate all the 1x1 icons, then no additional screens are needed.

4. If not, calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

But I need to make sure that the arrangement of 2x2 icons is optimal.

Wait, from earlier, in one screen, I can place up to two 2x2 icons (using 8 cells) and have 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if I place only one 2x2 icon (using 4 cells), I have 11 cells left for 1x1 icons.

Or, if I don't place any 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, the strategy should be to maximize the use of screens by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible without wasting too much space.

But, since placing two 2x2 icons per screen uses 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons, whereas placing one 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, leaving 11 for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps it's better to place only one 2x2 icon per screen if there are many 1x1 icons.

Wait, no, if I have many 2x2 icons, it's better to place two per screen.

I need to find a balance.

Let me think differently.

Let's calculate the total space required.

Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon requires 1 cell.

So, total cells needed = 4*y + x.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, the minimal number of screens required would be ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But, is it that simple?

Wait, no, because of the constraint that 2x2 icons must be placed in a 2x2 block, not just any 4 cells.

So, it's not just about the total number of cells.

I need to ensure that the 2x2 icons are placed in such blocks.

So, perhaps I need to first allocate space for the 2x2 icons and then see how many screens that requires, and then see how to fit the 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

Let me consider the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen.

From earlier, it's two per screen.

So, the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y/2).

Then, for the 1x1 icons, each screen can hold up to 15 - 4*number_of_2x2_icons_in_that_screen.

Wait, but as per earlier, if I place two 2x2 icons, I have 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

If I place one 2x2 icon, I have 11 cells left.

If I place no 2x2 icons, I have 15 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, first, calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y/2).

Then, calculate the total number of cells available for 1x1 icons across these screens: number_of_screens * (15 - 4*min(2, y_per_screen)).

Wait, it's a bit more complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let s = ceil(y / 2), the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, the total number of cells used by these 2x2 icons is 4*y.

The total number of cells available in s screens is 15*s.

The remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons are 15*s - 4*y.

If x (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to this remaining cells, then s screens are sufficient.

Otherwise, I need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - (15*s - 4*y))/15).

So, the total number of screens is s + ceil((x - (15*s - 4*y))/15).

But I need to make sure that this calculation is correct.

Wait, let's test it with an example.

Take the first test case: x=1, y=1.

So, s = ceil(1/2) = 1 screen for the 2x2 icons.

Remaining cells: 15*1 - 4*1 = 11.

x=1 <=11, so total screens =1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

s=ceil(4/2)=2 screens for 2x2 icons.

Remaining cells: 15*2 -4*4=30-16=14.

x=12 <=14, so total screens=2.

Again matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=9.

s=ceil(9/2)=5 screens for 2x2 icons.

Remaining cells:15*5 -4*9=75-36=39.

x=0 <=39, so total screens=5.

Matches the last sample input.

Seems correct.

But wait, in the calculation, I assumed that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, which uses 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons per screen beyond the first screen.

Wait, but in reality, in one screen, if I place two 2x2 icons, I use 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons.

If I place one 2x2 icon, I use 4 cells, leaving 11 for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the calculation based on whether y is even or odd.

Wait, no, because y could be even or odd, but the number of screens is ceil(y/2), which handles both cases.

And in each screen, if y_per_screen=2, remaining cells=7.

If y_per_screen=1, remaining cells=11.

But in the overall calculation, it's easier to calculate s=ceil(y/2), then remaining cells=15*s -4*y.

Then, if x <= remaining cells, total screens=s.

Else, need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The additional screens needed would be ceil((x - remaining cells)/15).

But need to handle the case where x - remaining cells is negative, which shouldn't happen since remaining cells >=0.

Wait, no, if x - remaining cells >0, then we need additional screens.

Also, need to make sure that we don't have negative number of screens.

Wait, ceil function with positive denominator won't give negative numbers.

So, the formula seems correct.

Hence, in code, I can implement this logic.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

result = []

for _ in range(n):

(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))

space_x = x * 1

space_y = y * 4

total_space = space_y + space_x

if y % 2 == 0:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2

else:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

if space_x <= remaining_cells:

result.append(screen_require_for_y)

else:

extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells

if space_x % 15 == 0:

extra_screen = space_x // 15

else:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1

result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)

print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



This seems to implement the logic I just described.

It calculates s = ceil(y/2) as screen_require_for_y.

Then calculates remaining_cells = 15*s -4*y.

If x <= remaining_cells, then total screens = s.

Else, calculate extra_space = x - remaining_cells.

Then, calculate extra_screen = ceil(extra_space/15).

And total screens = s + extra_screen.

This matches my earlier reasoning.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's test it with some test cases.

Test case 1:

Input:

1

1 1

Expected Output:

1

Calculation:

s = ceil(1/2) =1

remaining_cells =15*1 -4*1=11

x=1 <=11, so total screens=1.

Correct.

Test case 2:

Input:

1

12 4

Expected Output:

2

Calculation:

s=ceil(4/2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -4*4=30-16=14

x=12 <=14, so total screens=2.

Correct.

Test case 3:

Input:

1

0 3

Expected Output:

2

Calculation:

s=ceil(3/2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -4*3=30-12=18

x=0 <=18, so total screens=2.

Correct.

Test case 4:

Input:

1

1 0

Expected Output:

1

Calculation:

s=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=15*0 -4*0=0

x=1 >0, so extra_space=1

extra_screen=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=0+1=1.

Correct.

Test case 5:

Input:

1

0 0

Expected Output:

0

Calculation:

s=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=15*0 -4*0=0

x=0 <=0, so total screens=0.

Correct.

Test case 6:

Input:

1

8 2

Expected Output:

2

Calculation:

s=ceil(2/2)=1

remaining_cells=15*1 -4*2=15-8=7

x=8 >7, so extra_space=8-7=1

extra_screen=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=1+1=2.

But according to the sample input, for x=8, y=2, the output is 1.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=8, y=1, output is 1, and for x=8, y=2, output is 2.

Wait, let's check the sample input again.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=8, y=1, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check.

Wait, in the sample input, the 10th test case is x=8, y=2, output is 2.

But according to my calculation, it should be 2, which matches.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, it should be 2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no, according to the sample input, for x=8, y=2, output is 2.

Yes, that matches.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Another test case:

Input:

1

15 0

Expected Output:

1

Calculation:

s=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=0

x=15 >0, so extra_space=15

extra_screen=ceil(15/15)=1

total screens=0+1=1.

Correct.

Another test case:

Input:

1

0 9

Expected Output:

5

Calculation:

s=ceil(9/2)=5

remaining_cells=15*5 -4*9=75-36=39

x=0 <=39, so total screens=5.

Correct.

Seems like the program is correctly implementing the required logic.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of screens required to fit all the application icons given the constraints of screen size and icon sizes.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Screen Layout:**
   - Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, totaling 15 cells.

2. **Icon Placement Constraints:**
   - 1x1 icons occupy one cell each.
   - 2x2 icons occupy four cells each in a square block.

3. **Efficient Screen Utilization:**
   - Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons (using 8 cells) and leaves 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - Alternatively, one 2x2 icon can be placed, using 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - If no 2x2 icons are placed, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

4. **Calculate Minimum Screens:**
   - Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `screen_require_for_y = ceil(y / 2)`.
   - Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - 4 * y`.
   - Check if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells:
     - If yes, the total screens required are `screen_require_for_y`.
     - If not, calculate additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

# Example Usage
# func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the values of `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons).

2. **Calculate Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Determine the number of screens required for 2x2 icons using `screen_require_for_y = ceil(y / 2)`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cells:**
   - Compute the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons on the screens.

4. **Check for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Output the Results:**
   - For each test case, output the total number of screens required.

This approach ensures efficient utilization of screen space and minimizes the number of screens needed to fit all the icons.
