Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The rules are a bit unusual. He first lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest, then all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest, and so on, multiplying odd numbers by increasing integers until all cards are laid down.

Okay, so for example, if n is 7, the order would be:

1. Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7

2. Twice odd numbers: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

3. Three times odd numbers: nothing, because 3*1=3 already in odds, 3*3=9 >7

4. Four times odd numbers: 4 (which is 4*1)

5. And so on, until all cards are laid down.

So, in this case, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, the task is, given n and k, to find the k-th card in this ordering.

Constraints are:

- t (number of test cases) is up to 5*10^4, which is 50,000.

- n can be up to 10^9, which is a billion.

- k is up to n, so up to 10^9.

So, efficiency is key here because with t=50,000 and n=1e9, a naive approach will not work.

First, I need to understand the pattern in which the cards are being laid down.

Let's think about how to categorize the cards.

Each card is a positive integer from 1 to n.

We can represent each number as x * (2^p), where x is an odd number and p is a non-negative integer.

For example:

- 1 = 1 * 2^0

- 2 = 1 * 2^1

- 3 = 3 * 2^0

- 4 = 1 * 2^2

- 5 = 5 * 2^0

- 6 = 3 * 2^1

- 7 = 7 * 2^0

- 8 = 1 * 2^3

And so on.

So, the process is to first lay down all x where x is odd (p=0), then all x*2 (p=1), then x*4 (p=2), and so on, in increasing order within each p.

Wait, no. According to the problem, it's a bit different.

It's first all odd numbers, then all numbers that are twice an odd number, then all numbers that are three times an odd number, and so on.

Wait, but in the example, it's odd numbers first, then twice odd numbers, then three times odd numbers, etc.

So, for n=7:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice odd numbers: 2 (2*1), 6 (2*3)

- Three times odd numbers: none, since 3*1=3 already in odds, 3*3=9>7

- Four times odd numbers: 4 (4*1)

- Five times odd numbers: 5*1=5 already in odds, 5*3=15>7

- Six times odd numbers: 6*1=6 already, 6*3=18>7

- Seven times odd numbers: 7*1=7 already

So, the order is odd numbers first, then multiples of 2 of odd numbers, then multiples of 3, and so on.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's odd numbers, then twice odd numbers, then four times odd numbers, etc.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Looking back:

- First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

- Next, all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.

- Next, all cards that are three times an odd number from smallest to largest.

- Next, all cards that are four times an odd number from smallest to largest.

- And so on, until all cards are laid down.

So, it's grouped by the multiplier of the odd number.

So, group 1: odd numbers (multiplier 1)

Group 2: twice odd numbers (multiplier 2)

Group 3: three times odd numbers (multiplier 3)

Group 4: four times odd numbers (multiplier 4)

And so on.

Within each group, the numbers are ordered by the odd multiplier.

Wait, but in the example, after odd numbers, it's twice odd numbers, then four times odd numbers, etc.

Wait, no, in the example, it's odd numbers, then twice odd numbers, then three times odd numbers, etc.

But in the explanation, it's odd numbers, then twice odd numbers, then three times odd numbers, etc.

But in the code, it seems to be doing something different.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define for each number x from 1 to n, its group as the highest power of 2 dividing x.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's grouped by the multiplier of the odd number.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coefficient when factoring out the highest power of 2.

Let me see.

For any number x, we can write x = m * 2^p, where m is odd.

Then, the group of x is determined by p+1.

Wait, according to the problem:

- Group 1: odd numbers (p=0)

- Group 2: numbers that are twice an odd number (p=1)

- Group 3: numbers that are three times an odd number (p=??)

Wait, but three times an odd number may not be divisible by 2 at all.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

Wait, maybe the groups are based on the multiplier of the odd number.

So, group 1: numbers where the multiplier is 1 (i.e., odd numbers)

group 2: numbers where the multiplier is 2

group 3: numbers where the multiplier is 3

...

So, for each multiplier i, the numbers in that group are i * (2j+1), where j is such that i*(2j+1) <= n.

And then within each group, the numbers are ordered by the odd multiplier, i.e., by j.

So, for group 1: 1*1=1, 1*3=3, 1*5=5, ..., up to the largest odd number <=n.

Group 2: 2*1=2, 2*3=6, 2*5=10, ..., up to the largest one <=n.

Group 3: 3*1=3, 3*3=9, 3*5=15, ..., up to the largest one <=n.

And so on.

So, in the example with n=7:

Group 1: 1,3,5,7

Group 2: 2,6

Group 3: 3 (but 3 is already in group 1), 9 (but 9>7), so only 3, but 3 is already in group 1, so group 3 is empty.

Group 4: 4,12 (12>7), so only 4.

Group 5:5,15 (15>7), so only 5.

Group 6:6 (but 6 is already in group 2), so group 6 is empty.

Group 7:7.

Wait, but according to the problem's explanation, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, group 1:1,3,5,7

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

Wait, so perhaps groups are ordered by the multiplier i in increasing order.

So, first group 1, then group 2, then group 3, etc.

But in the example, it's group 1, then group 2, then group 4.

Wait, perhaps the groups are ordered by the multiplier i in increasing order, but only considering the multipliers where the group is not empty.

Wait, but in the example, group 3 is empty, group 4 has 4, group 5 has 7, group 6 is empty, group 7 has 7.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's group 1, group 2, then group 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement:

First, lay down all odd-numbered cards (which is group 1).

Next, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number (which is group 2).

Next, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number (group 3).

Next, lay down all cards that are four times an odd number (group 4).

And so on, until all cards are laid down.

But in the example, for n=7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, group 1:1,3,5,7

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

Wait, but where does group 3 come in? Group 3 would be 3,9, but 9>7, so only 3, but 3 is already in group 1.

Wait, so group 3 is effectively empty because 3 is already in group 1.

Similarly, group 6 is empty.

So, in practice, the groups are ordered by their multiplier i, and for each i, we list numbers that are i*(2j+1), but only if that number hasn't been placed in a earlier group.

Wait, but in group 3, 3 is already in group 1, so group 3 is empty.

Group 4 has 4, which is 4*1, and 4 is not in any previous group.

Group 5 has 5, which is 5*1, and 5 is already in group 1.

Wait, no, 5 is in group 1.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that each number is placed in the group corresponding to its minimal i such that x = i*(2j+1), with i minimized.

So, for x=3, i=1, j=1.

For x=6, i=2, j=1.

For x=4, i=4, j=0.

Wait, but j should be such that 2j+1 is odd.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the greatest odd divisor of x.

Wait, for each x, let m be the greatest odd divisor of x.

Then, the group of x is x/m, which is a power of 2.

Wait, but in the problem, the grouping is by the multiplier i, which seems to be the same as m.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the highest power of 2 dividing x.

Let’s define for each x, x = m * 2^p, where m is odd.

Then, the group of x is p+1.

So, group 1: p=0, group 2: p=1, group 3: p=2, etc.

But according to the problem, group 1: odd numbers (p=0), group 2: twice odd numbers (p=1), group 3: three times odd numbers (p=?), but in the example, group 3 is empty because 3*1=3 already in group 1, 3*3=9>7.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that for each i, we consider i*(2j+1), but only if i*(2j+1) <=n and i*(2j+1) is not in any previous group.

But in group 3, 3*1=3 is already in group 1, 3*3=9>7, so group 3 is empty.

Then group 4:4*1=4, which is new, so it's in group 4.

Group 5:5*1=5, but 5 is already in group 1, so group 5 is empty.

Group 6:6*1=6, but 6 is already in group 2, so group 6 is empty.

Group 7:7*1=7, which is already in group 1, so group 7 is empty.

Wait, but in the example, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, group 1:1,3,5,7

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

So, the groups are ordered by their multiplier i in increasing order: i=1,2,3,4,5,..., but only considering non-empty groups.

Wait, but in group 3, there are no new numbers, because 3 is already in group 1, and 9>7.

Similarly, group 5 has 5, but 5 is already in group 1.

Group 6 has 6, but 6 is already in group 2.

Group 7 has 7, but 7 is already in group 1.

So, only group 1,2,4 have new numbers.

Hence, the order is group 1, then group 2, then group 4.

Within each group, the numbers are ordered by the odd multiplier j in increasing order.

So, for group 1: j=0,1,2,3 corresponding to 1,3,5,7

Group 2: j=0,1 corresponding to 2,6

Group 4: j=0 corresponding to 4.

So, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, the task is, given n and k, to find the k-th card in this sequence.

Constraints are large: t=50,000 and n=1e9.

So, we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all n numbers for each test case.

First, we need to understand how to categorize the numbers into their respective groups.

As above, for each i starting from 1, we consider group i, which consists of numbers x=i*(2j+1) for j such that x <=n, and x is not in any previous group.

But checking for each i and j would be too slow for large n and t.

We need a smarter way.

Let’s observe that for each i, the numbers in group i are i*1, i*3, i*5,..., up to the largest odd number such that i*(2j+1)<=n.

But, as noted, some of these numbers may have already been placed in earlier groups if they can be expressed as a smaller i'*m', where m' is odd.

Wait, but according to the problem, each number is placed in the first group that it qualifies for, i.e., the smallest i such that x=i*m, where m is odd.

Wait, but actually, the problem says:

First, all odd-numbered cards (i=1, m=odd)

Next, all cards that are twice an odd number (i=2, m=odd)

Next, all cards that are three times an odd number (i=3, m=odd)

And so on.

So, for each number x, it belongs to the group i where i is the smallest integer such that x is i times an odd number.

In other words, i is the smallest integer such that x/i is an odd integer.

So, to find i for a given x, we need to find the smallest i that divides x and x/i is odd.

This i is actually the largest power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, for x=6, i=2, because 6/2=3, which is odd.

For x=4, i=4, because 4/4=1, which is odd.

For x=3, i=1, because 3/1=3, which is odd.

Wait, so i is the largest power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, but for x=6, i=2, which is the largest power of 2 that divides 6, which is indeed 2.

Similarly, for x=4, i=4, which is the largest power of 2 that divides 4.

For x=3, i=1, which is correct.

So, i is the largest power of 2 that divides x.

Hence, for each x, i = x / (largest odd divisor of x)

Or equivalently, i is the largest power of 2 dividing x.

So, to assign x to its group i, i is the highest power of 2 that divides x.

Then, the groups are ordered by i in increasing order: i=1,2,4,8,....

Within each group i, the numbers are ordered by their odd multiplier j, i.e., x = i*(2j+1), sorted by j in increasing order.

So, the sequence is:

- Group 1: all x where x is odd, i.e., x=1*(2j+1)

- Group 2: all x where x=2*(2j+1), and x not in group 1

- Group 4: all x where x=4*(2j+1), and x not in previous groups

- Group 8: all x where x=8*(2j+1), and x not in previous groups

- And so on.

Wait, but in the example, group 1:1,3,5,7

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

Which matches this pattern.

So, the groups are ordered by i=1,2,4,8,..., where i is a power of 2.

And within each group, x=i*(2j+1), sorted by j.

So, to find the k-th card, we need to iterate through the groups in order of increasing i (i=1,2,4,8,...), and within each group, iterate through x=i*(2j+1) in increasing order, and keep a count until we reach the k-th card.

Given that n and k can be up to 1e9 and t=5e4, we need an efficient way to compute this.

First, observe that i takes on values that are powers of 2: 1,2,4,8,16,..., up to the largest power of 2 that is <=n.

For each i, the numbers in group i are x=i*(2j+1), where j is such that x <=n.

But we need to ensure that x has not been placed in a previous group.

But since i is increasing in powers of 2, and x is uniquely assigned to its group based on the largest power of 2 dividing x, we don't have to worry about overlaps.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, for x=3, i=1; for x=6, i=2; for x=4, i=4; for x=5, i=1; for x=7, i=1.

So, in group 1:1,3,5,7

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

Which matches the sequence 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, in general, for each i=1,2,4,8,..., we can list the x=i*(2j+1) <=n, sorted by j.

Then, we can iterate through these groups in order, and within each group, iterate through x in increasing order, and keep a count until we reach the k-th card.

But with n and k up to 1e9 and t=5e4, we need a way to compute this efficiently, without iterating through all numbers.

Let’s think about how to compute the number of elements in each group.

For group i, the numbers are x=i*(2j+1) <=n, which implies that j <= (n/i -1)/2.

So, the number of elements in group i is floor((n/i +1)/2).

Wait, let's verify this.

For i=1, j can be 0,1,2,3 for n=7: j=0 -> x=1, j=1 ->3, j=2 ->5, j=3 ->7. So, j from 0 to floor((n/i -1)/2)=floor((7-1)/2)=3, which is correct.

For i=2, j=0 ->2, j=1 ->6. So, j from 0 to floor((n/i -1)/2)=floor((7/2 -1)/2)=floor((3.5 -1)/2)=floor(2.5/2)=floor(1.25)=1, which is correct.

For i=4, j=0 ->4. floor((7/4 -1)/2)=floor(1.75 -1)/2)=floor(0.75/2)=floor(0.375)=0, which is correct.

So, the number of elements in group i is floor((n/i +1)/2).

Wait, more precisely, it's floor((n/i +1)/2).

Wait, in general, for group i, the numbers are x=i*(2j+1) <=n, which implies 2j+1 <=n/i, so j <= floor((n/i -1)/2).

Hence, the number of elements in group i is floor((n/i)/2)+1 if n/i is odd, else floor(n/i /2).

Wait, more accurately, it's floor(n/i /2)+1 if n/i is odd, else floor(n/i /2).

But it's easier to compute it as (n/i +1)//2.

So, count_i = (n//i +1)//2

Then, the total number of elements in group i is count_i.

Then, to find the k-th card, we can iterate through the groups in order of increasing i (i=1,2,4,8,...), and for each group, compute count_i, and see if k is within the first count_i elements of this group.

If yes, then we can find which j corresponds to the (k - accumulated so far)-th element in this group.

Given that, we can compute x=i*(2j +1), where j is the (k - accumulated so far) -1.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let’s initialize accumulated so far =0

Then, for each i in 1,2,4,8,... as long as i <=n:

Compute count_i = (n//i +1)//2

If k <= accumulated + count_i, then:

position = k - accumulated

j = position -1

x = i*(2j +1)

output x

break

else:

accumulated += count_i

continue to next i

This seems correct.

Now, implement this logic efficiently.

Given that t=5e4 and n=1e9, we need this to be fast.

Each test case should run in constant time or logarithmic time.

But iterating through the groups i=1,2,4,8,... up to n takes log n time, which is acceptable since log(1e9) is about 30 operations.

So, total time should be acceptable.

Now, implement this logic.

But looking back at the provided code, it seems different.

Let’s look at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

L = []

while n:

m = (n + 1) // 2

n -= m

tot = 0

pow = 1

for a in L:

if tot < k and k <= tot + a:

print(pow * (2 * k - 1))

break

tot += a

k -= tot

pow *= 2

Wait, this code seems incomplete or incorrect.

First, it reads t, then for each test case, reads n and k.

Then, it initializes an empty list L.

Then, there's a while loop that runs while n is not zero:

m = (n +1)//2

n -= m

So, this loop is computing m=(n+1)//2, then subtracting m from n, and repeating until n is zero.

What does this do?

Let’s take n=7.

m=(7+1)//2=4, n=7-4=3

m=(3+1)//2=2, n=3-2=1

m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0

So, L becomes [4,2,1]

Similarly, for n=6:

m=(6+1)//2=3, n=6-3=3

m=(3+1)//2=2, n=3-2=1

m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0

L=[3,2,1]

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, for n=7, groups are i=1 (count=4), i=2 (count=2), i=4 (count=1)

So, L seems to be collecting counts of elements in each group.

Wait, in the code, L is populated with m=(n+1)//2, and n is updated by n -= m.

So, for n=7:

- m=4, n=3

- m=2, n=1

- m=1, n=0

So, L=[4,2,1], which matches the counts for i=1 (4 elements), i=2 (2 elements), i=4 (1 element)

Similarly, for n=6:

- m=3, n=3

- m=2, n=1

- m=1, n=0

L=[3,2,1], which would correspond to i=1 (3 elements:1,3,5), i=2 (2 elements:2,6), i=4 (1 element:4)

Wait, but for n=6, group 1:1,3,5

group 2:2,6

group 4:4

So, counts are correct.

So, L contains the counts of elements in each group, in order of increasing i.

Then, tot=0

pow=1

Then, for each a in L:

if tot <k and k <= tot +a:

print(pow * (2*(k - tot) -1))

break

tot +=a

k -=tot

pow *=2

Wait, this seems to be iterating through the groups, keeping track of the cumulative total tot, and checking if k falls within the current group's range.

If yes, it computes j as (k - tot), and then x = pow * (2*j +1)

Where pow is the current i, which starts at 1 and doubles each time.

Wait, but in the code, it's pow*(2*(k - tot)-1)

Wait, k - tot is the position within the current group.

So, j = (k - tot) -1

But in the code, it's 2*(k - tot)-1, which seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, for group i, the x is i*(2j +1), where j starts from 0.

So, for position p in the group (starting from 1), j = p -1

So, x = i*(2*(p-1) +1) = i*(2p -1)

But in the code, it's pow*(2*k -1), which seems incorrect.

Wait, no, in the code, it's pow*(2*(k - tot)-1)

Wait, k - tot is the position within the group.

So, p = k - tot

Then, j = p -1

x = pow*(2j +1) = pow*(2*(p -1) +1) = pow*(2p -1)

So, yes, it's correct.

Wait, so x = pow*(2*(k - tot) -1)

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, the code seems to be implementing the logic correctly.

So, the answer should be correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav based on a specific ordering process. The process involves grouping cards based on their relationship to odd numbers and their multiples.

### Approach

1. **Grouping the Cards:**
   - **Group 1:** All odd-numbered cards.
   - **Group 2:** All cards that are twice an odd number.
   - **Group 3:** All cards that are three times an odd number.
   - And so on, until all cards are laid down.

2. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - We need to efficiently determine in which group the k-th card falls and its position within that group.
   - We achieve this by iteratively calculating the size of each group and determining the k-th card's position.

### Solution Code

```python
def find_kth_card():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        L = []
        temp_n = n
        while temp_n:
            m = (temp_n + 1) // 2
            L.append(m)
            temp_n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k <= tot + a:
                p = k - tot
                x = pow * (2 * p - 1)
                print(x)
                break
            tot += a
            k -= a
            pow *= 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_kth_card()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **Group Calculation:**
   - Calculate the size of each group using the while loop:
     - `m = (temp_n + 1) // 2`
     - Append `m` to list `L`
     - Update `temp_n -= m`
   - This loop effectively divides the cards into groups based on their multiples of odd numbers.

3. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - Initialize `tot` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards in previous groups.
   - Initialize `pow` to represent the multiplier (starting from 1, then 2, 4, etc.).
   - Iterate through each group size in `L`:
     - If `k` falls within the current group (`tot < k <= tot + a`), calculate the card value:
       - `p = k - tot` (position within the group)
       - `x = pow * (2 * p - 1)` (calculate the card value based on the group's multiplier)
       - Print `x` and break the loop.
     - Update `tot` and `k` for the next group.
     - Double `pow` for the next group's multiplier.

This approach ensures efficient calculation even for large values of `n` and `k`, adhering to the problem's constraints.
