Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario is impossible.

First, I need to understand the scoring system. Each game can result in either a win or a draw. In a win, the total points awarded are 2 (winner gets 2, loser gets 0). In a draw, the total points awarded are 2 (both get 1). So, regardless of the outcome, each game contributes 2 points to the total sum of points.

Given that, the total sum of p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, because each game adds 2 points. If the sum is odd, it's impossible, and I should return -1. That makes sense.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, I need to have as many games end in a draw as possible. But I also need to make sure that the individual scores are achieved.

Let me think about the constraints. Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the smallest score is p1, and the largest is p3.

In the example where p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, no games were played, so no draws, which is correct.

In the second example, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1. The total sum is 2, which is even. If one game was played and it was a draw, both players get 1 point each. So, two players have 1 point, and one has 0. That matches the scores. So, the number of draws is 1.

In the third example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1. The total sum is 3, which is odd. That's impossible because each game adds 2 points. So, return -1.

In the fourth example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. The total sum is 4, which is even. Now, how can this happen? Let's see:

- If there are two games:

  - Case 1: Both games are draws. Then each player involved gets 1 point per draw.

  - But since there are three players, and each draw involves two players, it's possible that two draws occur between different pairs.

  - For example, player 1 and 2 draw, then player 1 and 3 draw.

  - So, player 1 has 2 draws, getting 2 points, and players 2 and 3 each have 1 draw, getting 1 point.

  - That would make p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, but since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, it should be sorted, so it's p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches.

  - So, number of draws is 2.

- Another possibility: One draw and one win.

  - For example, one draw between player 1 and 2, giving them each 1 point.

  - Then, a win for player 3 against player 1, giving player 3 2 points and player 1 remains with 1 point.

  - So, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which is the same.

  - But in this case, only one draw.

- But we need to maximize the number of draws, so the first scenario with two draws is better.

In the fifth example, p1=3, p2=3, p3=3. Total sum is 9, which is odd. Impossible, so return -1.

In the sixth example, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5. Total sum is 12, which is even.

How can this happen?

Let's think about the maximum number of draws.

If all games are draws, then each player would have points equal to the number of games they played.

But with three players, each pair can play multiple games.

Let me denote the number of draws between each pair.

Let’s denote:

- d12: number of draws between player 1 and 2.

- d13: number of draws between player 1 and 3.

- d23: number of draws between player 2 and 3.

Similarly, let’s denote:

- w12: number of wins by player 1 against player 2.

- w13: number of wins by player 1 against player 3.

- w23: number of wins by player 2 against player 3.

Then, the total points for each player can be calculated as:

- p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*(w12 + w13)

- p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*(w23 + w21)

- p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*(w31 + w32)

Wait, actually, in the win scenarios, only one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

So, for example, if player 1 wins against player 2, player 1 gets 2 points, player 2 gets 0.

Similarly for other wins.

So, the points can be expressed as:

- p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*(w12 + w13)

- p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*(w23 + w21)

- p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*(w31 + w32)

Where w21 is the number of times player 2 wins against player 1, and so on.

But this seems a bit messy to handle directly.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider the total number of games played.

Each game contributes 2 points to the total sum, whether it's a draw or a win.

So, the total number of games is (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Since we know p1 + p2 + p3 is even, this is an integer.

Let’s denote total games as g = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Now, in these g games, some are draws and some are wins.

Let’s denote the number of draws as d, and the number of wins as w.

Then, d + w = g.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum (1 point to each player involved), and each win also contributes 2 points (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

So, the total points are 2*d + 2*w = 2*g, which matches p1 + p2 + p3.

But we need to maximize d, the number of draws.

To maximize d, we need to minimize w.

What's the minimum number of wins required to achieve the given scores.

Wait, but in terms of individual scores, we need to make sure that the points are distributed correctly.

Let’s think about it differently.

Let’s consider that in draws, both players involved get 1 point each, and in wins, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0.

Given that, we can set up equations for the points.

But with three players, it's a bit complicated.

Maybe I can look for some inequalities.

First, the minimal number of wins.

If all games were draws, then each game would contribute 2 points to the total sum, which is fine, but we need to see if the individual scores can be achieved.

Wait, but in all draws, each draw affects two specific players.

So, if I have d12 draws between player 1 and 2, d13 between 1 and 3, and d23 between 2 and 3, then:

p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*w2

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*w3

Where w1 is the number of wins for player 1, w2 for player 2, and w3 for player 3.

But w1 = w12 + w13

Similarly, w2 = w21 + w23

w3 = w31 + w32

This seems too complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let’s consider that the total number of draws is d = d12 + d13 + d23

And the total number of wins is w = w12 + w13 + w23 + w21 + w31 + w32

But this is still messy.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the scores.

Because each win allows one player to gain 2 points, while draws give 1 point to each participant.

To minimize wins, I need to maximize draws, which is what I want.

Wait, but I need to maximize draws, so maybe I need to minimize wins.

Wait, no, I need to maximize draws.

Wait, actually, to maximize draws, I need to have as many draws as possible.

But I need to ensure that the individual scores are met.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is 2*g, where g is the total number of games.

And d + w = g.

Since each draw contributes 2 points and each win contributes 2 points, the total points are the same.

But in terms of individual scores, draws affect two players, while wins affect only one.

So, to maximize draws, I need to see how many draws can be arranged without violating the individual score constraints.

This is tricky.

Let me look at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

First sample:

0 0 0: No games, so no draws. Correct.

Second sample:

0 1 1: Total sum 2, which is even. If one draw between players 2 and 3, they both get 1 point, and player 1 has 0. That's possible with one draw. So, draws=1.

Third sample:

1 1 1: Total sum 3, which is odd. Impossible, so -1.

Fourth sample:

1 1 2: Total sum 4, which is even.

Possible with two draws: Draw between 1 and 2, and draw between 1 and 3.

Then, player 1 has 2 draws, so 2 points, player 2 has 1 draw, 1 point, player 3 has 1 draw, 1 point. But in the input, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which is the reverse. Wait, but it's sorted as p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, so it should be p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, in this arrangement, it's p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, but since they are sorted, it's given as p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the labels of the players can be permuted, but the scores are given in sorted order.

Wait, no, the problem says their scores were p1, p2, p3 with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, so the players are already sorted by their scores.

So, in this case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Is two draws possible?

If players 1 and 2 draw once, both have 1 point.

Then players 1 and 3 draw once, player 1 now has 2 points, player 3 has 1 point.

So, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, but sorted it's p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches.

So, draws=2.

Another way: If players 2 and 3 draw once, both have 1 point.

Then players 1 and 3 play and player 3 wins.

Player 3 now has 2 points, player 1 has 0.

But then p1=0, p2=1, p3=2, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps another combination.

If players 1 and 2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then players 1 and 3 draw once: p1=2, p3=1.

Now it matches p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which sorted is p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So, draws=2.

Alternatively, if players 1 and 3 draw once: p1=1, p3=1.

Then players 2 and 3 draw once: p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, but p3 would have 2 points, p2=1, p1=1.

Which again is p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So, draws=2.

Seems like 2 is possible.

Fifth sample:

3 3 3: Total sum 9, which is odd. Impossible, so -1.

Sixth sample:

3 4 5: Total sum 12, which is even.

How to achieve this with maximum draws.

Let me try.

Total games g = 12/2 = 6.

To maximize draws, let's assume all 6 games are draws.

Each draw involves 2 players, so each draw gives 1 point to each player involved.

If all 6 games are draws, and there are three players, then each player is involved in some draws.

But need to see if we can arrange the draws such that the points add up to p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Wait, but if all games are draws, the points would be distributed based on the number of draws each player is involved in.

Let’s say:

- Player 1 is involved in d1 draws.

- Player 2 is involved in d2 draws.

- Player 3 is involved in d3 draws.

Then, p1 = d1, p2 = d2, p3 = d3.

But since each draw involves two players, d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*d, where d is the total number of draws.

But in this case, p1 + p2 + p3 = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which should equal 2*d, so d=6.

But p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

But in this setup, p1 + p2 + p3 = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which equals 2*d, where d=6.

But is it possible to have player 1 involved in 3 draws, player 2 in 4 draws, and player 3 in 5 draws, with only 6 draws in total?

Wait, but 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which should be equal to 2*d = 12, so d=6.

Is this possible?

Wait, but with three players, the sum should be 2*d, which it is.

But we need to see if such a distribution is possible without violating the pair constraints.

For example, the number of draws between player 1 and 2 plus player 1 and 3 plus player 2 and 3 should equal d.

But in this case, it's possible to have:

- d12 + d13 + d23 = d = 6.

And p1 = d12 + d13 = 3.

p2 = d12 + d23 = 4.

p3 = d13 + d23 = 5.

So, we have:

d12 + d13 = 3.

d12 + d23 = 4.

d13 + d23 = 5.

We can solve these equations.

Let’s add the first two equations:

(d12 + d13) + (d12 + d23) = 3 + 4 => 2*d12 + d13 + d23 = 7.

But from the third equation, d13 + d23 = 5, so:

2*d12 + 5 = 7 => 2*d12 = 2 => d12 = 1.

Then, from d12 + d13 = 3 => 1 + d13 = 3 => d13 = 2.

From d12 + d23 = 4 => 1 + d23 = 4 => d23 = 3.

And d13 + d23 = 2 + 3 = 5, which matches.

So, d12=1, d13=2, d23=3.

This satisfies all the equations.

Therefore, it's possible to have 6 draws: 1 between 1 and 2, 2 between 1 and 3, and 3 between 2 and 3.

Thus, p1=1 + 2 = 3, p2=1 + 3 = 4, p3=2 + 3 = 5, which matches the input.

So, the maximum number of draws is 6.

Seventh sample:

1 1 10: Total sum 12, which is even.

Is it possible to have p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Let’s see.

Total games g=6.

To maximize draws, let's see.

If all 6 games are draws, then p1 + p2 + p3 = 12.

But in this case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Is this possible?

If player 1 is involved in d1 draws, player 2 in d2 draws, player 3 in d3 draws, then d1 + d2 + d3 = 12.

Given p1=d1=1, p2=d2=1, p3=d3=10.

But d1 + d2 + d3 = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, which matches 2*d=12, so d=6.

But, in terms of pair draws:

d12 + d13 + d23 = d = 6.

And p1 = d12 + d13 =1.

p2 = d12 + d23 =1.

p3 = d13 + d23 =10.

From p1 = d12 + d13 =1.

From p2 = d12 + d23 =1.

From p3 = d13 + d23 =10.

Adding the first two equations: d12 + d13 + d12 + d23 =1 +1 => 2*d12 + d13 + d23 =2.

But from p3: d13 + d23 =10.

So, 2*d12 + 10 =2 => 2*d12 = -8 => d12 = -4.

Negative number of draws is impossible.

Therefore, it's impossible to have p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

But wait, the output for this sample is 2, not -1.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there is a way to have some wins involved.

Let’s consider that not all games are draws.

Let’s denote d as the number of draws, and w as the number of wins, with d + w =6.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum (1 to each player involved), and each win contributes 2 points to the total sum (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

But in terms of individual scores, draws add 1 to both players involved, and wins add 2 to the winner.

So, to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, with total games=6.

Let’s try to maximize d.

Let’s assume d=2.

Then, w=4.

Total points from draws: 2*2=4.

Total points from wins: 4*2=8.

Total points:4+8=12, which matches.

Now, how to distribute these draws and wins to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Let’s say there are 2 draws:

- Draw between player 1 and 2: p1=1, p2=1.

- Draw between player 3 and someone else.

Wait, but player 3 needs 10 points.

If player 3 is involved in one draw, that gives him 1 point.

But he needs 10 points in total.

So, he needs additional 9 points.

Each win that player 3 wins gives him 2 points.

So, if he wins 4 games, that would give him 8 points, plus 1 from the draw, totaling 9 points, which is still short of 10.

Wait, but he needs 10 points.

Wait, 4 wins give 8 points, plus 1 from draw =9, which is less than 10.

Wait, but 4 wins would require 4 games, and with 2 draws, total games=6, which matches.

But p3=9, which is less than 10.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe player 3 wins 5 games: 5*2=10 points, plus 0 from draws, but if he's involved in 5 wins, and 1 draw, but total games=6.

Wait, but he can't win a game and draw the same game.

Wait, no, wins and draws are exclusive for a game.

So, if player 3 wins 5 games and draws 1 game, that would be 5 wins and 1 draw, total games=6.

But in the draw, he would get 1 point, plus 10 from wins, totaling 11, which is more than 10.

Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe he wins 4 games and draws 1 game: 4*2 +1*1=9, which is less than 10.

Or wins 4.5 games, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is 2, and in that case, the points can be achieved.

Let’s assume d=2.

Then, w=4.

Now, assign the draws:

- Draw between player 1 and 2: p1=1, p2=1.

- Draw between player 3 and someone else.

But if player 3 draws with player 1: p1=2, p3=1.

But p1 should be 1, so that's not good.

If player 3 draws with player 2: p2=2, p3=1.

But p2 should be 1.

So, perhaps draws can't be between player 3 and others.

Wait, but in the earlier case, if player 3 draws with player 1, p1=2, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1.

Similarly, drawing with player 2 would make p2=2, which is also not desired.

So, perhaps player 3 shouldn't be involved in any draws.

But then, d=2 would have to be between player 1 and 2.

So, two draws between player 1 and 2: p1=2, p2=2.

But p1 and p2 should be 1 and 1, so that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe only one draw between player 1 and 2: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, no draws involving player 3.

So, d=1.

But the sample output says 2, which contradicts my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let’s consider that player 3 wins all his games except one draw.

But from above, it seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is 2, but it's not actually achievable, but the sample output says 2.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the code to understand.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())

if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

print(-1)

continue

if p3 >= p1 + p2:

print(p1 + p2)

else:

x = 0

y = p3

while y >= x:

if p1 - x <= p2 - y:

print(p1 - x + p3)

break

else:

x += 1

y -= 1

else:

print(p3)

So, in the seventh sample, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3=10 >= p1 + p2=2, so it prints p1 + p2=2.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it's impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10 with d=2.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a way to achieve it.

Let’s try to see if d=2 is possible.

Total games g=6.

d=2, w=4.

Total points from draws: 2*2=4.

Total points from wins: 4*2=8.

Total points:12, which matches.

Now, assign the draws:

- Draw between player 1 and 2: p1=1, p2=1.

- Draw between player 3 and someone else.

But as before, if player 3 draws with player 1, p1=2, p3=1, which doesn't match.

If player 3 draws with player 2, p2=2, p3=1, which also doesn't match.

So, perhaps the only way is to have both draws between player 1 and 2, but then p1=2, p2=2, and player 3 needs to get 10 points from wins.

But player 3 can only play against player 1 and player 2.

If player 3 plays 4 wins against player 1 and/or player 2.

But player 1 already has p1=2 from draws, and needs p1=1, which is less than that.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Let me check the sample input and output again.

Sample input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Sample output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

So, for the seventh case, it's 2.

But according to my reasoning, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe there is a way.

Let’s consider that player 1 and player 2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, player 3 wins all other games against player 1 and player 2.

So, player 3 plays 5 games: 4 wins and 1 draw.

Wait, but total games are 6, but player 3 can only play against player 1 and player 2.

If player 3 plays against player 1 twice: once draw and one win.

But in that case, p1=1 (from draw) + 0 from loss =1.

Player 3=1 (from draw) + 2*2=5.

So, p3=5.

But we need p3=10.

Wait, that's not enough.

Wait, perhaps player 3 plays more games.

Wait, total games are 6.

If player 3 plays 4 games against player 1 and 2 games against player 2.

Wait, but in 6 games, involving three players, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Maybe the code is correct, and I'm missing something in my reasoning.

Let’s look at the code again.

In the case where p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

In the seventh sample, p3=10 >= p1=1 + p2=1=2, so it prints 2.

But is this possible?

From my earlier reasoning, it seems impossible.

Perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum number of draws is 2, even if the scores can't be achieved, but the code still prints 2.

But according to the problem statement, if it's impossible to achieve the scores, print -1.

In this case, it's impossible, so the code should print -1, but it prints 2.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2.

Maybe the sample output is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to maximize draws under the constraints, but not necessarily ensuring that the scores are achievable.

But according to the problem, it should print the maximum number of draws if the scores are achievable, else -1.

In this case, the scores are not achievable with any number of draws, so it should print -1.

But the code prints p1 + p2=2.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Let me check another sample.

Fifth sample: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3.

Sum=9, which is odd, so print -1, which matches the sample output.

Sixth sample: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Sum=12, which is even.

p3=5 >= p1 + p2=7 is false, so p3 < p1 + p2.

So, it goes to the else clause.

x=0, y=5.

Check if p1 - x <= p2 - y => 3 -0 <=4 -5 =>3 <= -1, which is false.

So, x +=1, y -=1. Now x=1, y=4.

Check 3-1 <=4-4 =>2 <=0, false.

x+=1, y-=1. Now x=2, y=3.

Check 3-2 <=4-3 =>1 <=1, true.

So, print p1 - x + p3 =3-2 +5=6.

Which matches the sample output of 6.

Seems correct in this case.

Seventh sample: p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Sum=12, even.

p3=10 >= p1 + p2=2, so print p1 + p2=2.

But as per my earlier reasoning, it's impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, we should return -1.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the sum of the scores is odd, it's impossible because each game contributes 2 points.
   - If the sum is even, proceed to calculate the maximum draws.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum draws are the sum of the two lower scores.
   - Otherwise, iteratively adjust the scores to find the maximum possible draws.

### Solution Code

```python

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Check if the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is even. If not, return -1 because each game adds 2 points.
- **Step 2**: If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, the maximum draws are p1 + p2.
- **Step 3**: Otherwise, iteratively decrease p1 and increase p2 while ensuring p1 - x <= p2 - y to find the maximum draws.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of draws while respecting the constraints imposed by the players' scores.
