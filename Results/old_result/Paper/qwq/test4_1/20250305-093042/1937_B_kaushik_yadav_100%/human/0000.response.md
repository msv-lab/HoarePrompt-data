Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. The goal is to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N), and along the way, collect the numbers in the cells to form a binary string, which should be the lexicographically smallest possible. Also, I need to find out how many paths produce this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string when comparing them as if they were words in a dictionary. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means that when comparing two strings, the one that has a '0' at the first position where they differ is smaller.

Given that the grasshopper can only move right or down, the path it takes will determine the sequence of cells it visits, and thus the binary string formed by the numbers in those cells. The challenge is to find the path that gives the smallest possible string and count how many such paths exist.

Looking at the grid, it's a 2-row grid with N columns. So, the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (2,N). Each move can either be right (same row, next column) or down (next row, same column).

I need to think about how to construct the smallest possible string. Since it's lexicographical order, I need to minimize the early characters in the string as much as possible.

Let me consider the possible paths. From (1,1), the grasshopper can go right to (1,2) or down to (2,1). Then, from (1,2), it can go right to (1,3) or down to (2,2), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

I need to decide at each step whether to go right or down in a way that minimizes the string.

One approach could be to greedily choose the smallest available number at each step. But I need to be careful because choosing '0' now might force me into a path that has '1's later, which could make the overall string larger.

Wait, actually, since it's lexicographical order, minimizing the early characters is more important than the later ones. So, perhaps a greedy approach would work.

Let me think about the first step. At the start, at (1,1), I can choose to go right to (1,2) or down to (2,1). I should choose the direction that leads to the smallest possible character next.

If a_{12} < b_{11}, then go right to (1,2). Otherwise, go down to (2,1).

Wait, no. At position (1,1), the first character is always a_{11}, regardless of the direction. Then, the second character would be a_{12} if I go right, or b_{11} if I go down.

So, to minimize the string, I should choose the smaller of a_{12} and b_{11} as the second character.

Similarly, at each step, I need to choose the direction that leads to the smallest possible next character.

But this seems a bit too simplistic. Maybe I need to look ahead a bit further to ensure that choosing a smaller immediate character doesn't lead to worse choices later on.

Let me consider the first test case:

n=2

a = 00

b = 00

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string = a_{11} a_{12} b_{22} = 0 0 0

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string = a_{11} b_{21} b_{22} = 0 0 0

Both paths give the same string '000', so the smallest string is '000' and there are 2 paths that produce it.

In the second test case:

n=4

a = 1101

b = 1100

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 0 0 0

2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

3. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

The first path gives '11000', and the other two give '11100'. So, '11000' is lexicographically smaller than '11100', and only one path produces '11000'.

In the third test case:

n=8

a = 00100111

b = 11101101

Possible paths need to be considered to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it.

From the examples, it seems that the greedy approach might work, but I need to formalize it.

I need to construct the smallest string by choosing at each step the smallest possible character, considering the future steps.

Wait, but in the second test case, if I start at (1,1)=1, then I can go to (1,2)=1 or (2,1)=1. Both are equal, so I can choose either.

If I choose to go right to (1,2)=1, then I can go to (1,3)=0 or (2,2)=1.

Choosing (1,3)=0 is better because '0' is smaller than '1'.

Then, from (1,3)=0, I can go to (1,4)=1 or (2,3)=0.

Choosing (2,3)=0 is better.

Then, from (2,3)=0, go to (2,4)=0.

So, the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), giving '11000'.

If I choose to go down to (2,1)=1, then to (2,2)=1, then to (2,3)=0, then to (2,4)=0, giving '11100', which is larger.

So, in this case, the greedy choice led to the smallest string.

Similarly, in the first test case, both choices lead to the same string.

So, perhaps a greedy approach where at each step, I choose the direction that leads to the smallest possible next character, considering the future steps, would work.

But how do I implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints (n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5)?

I need an efficient way to construct the smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it.

Let me try to formalize the approach.

I'll iterate through the columns from left to right, deciding at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, choosing the smallest possible character at each step.

I need to keep track of the current position (which row and column) and build the string accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dynamic programming, where I keep track of the current row and column, and maintain the smallest string and the count of paths that produce it.

But dynamic programming might be too slow for the given constraints, as n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the grid has only two rows, so it's a 2xN grid.

I can model the paths as sequences of moves: right (R) or down (D).

But since the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and must end at (2,N), the number of down moves must be exactly one (from row 1 to row 2), and the rest are right moves.

Wait, no. Actually, the grasshopper can make multiple down moves, but in this grid, there are only two rows, so effectively, there is only one down move in the path.

Wait, no, that's not correct. From row 1, the grasshopper can make a down move to row 2 at any column, and then continue moving right.

But since there are only two rows, once the grasshopper moves down to row 2, it can't move back to row 1.

So, effectively, the path is: some number of right moves in row 1, then a down move to row 2, and then some number of right moves in row 2.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The grasshopper can make a down move at any point, but since there are only two rows, once it moves down to row 2, it can't move back up.

So, the path consists of a sequence of right moves in row 1, followed by a down move to row 2, and then right moves in row 2.

Therefore, the path can be characterized by the column where the down move occurs.

So, the down move can happen at any column from 1 to N (inclusive).

Wait, but if the down move happens at column k, then the path is:

- From (1,1) to (1,k), moving right (k-1 times)

- Then down to (2,k)

- Then from (2,k) to (2,N), moving right (N - k times)

So, the string formed would be:

a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, b_{2k}, b_{2(k+1)}, ..., b_{2N}

Wait, no. Wait, the grid is indexed as a_{i,j}, where i is the row and j is the column.

So, the path would be:

- Starting at (1,1)

- Moving right in row 1 to (1,k)

- Then down to (2,k)

- Then moving right in row 2 to (2,N)

So, the string would be:

a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, b_{2k}, b_{2(k+1)}, ..., b_{2N}

I need to find the value of k that minimizes this string.

So, for each possible k from 1 to N, I can construct the string for that k and find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

But this would be O(N^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to find the smallest string among all possible k.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different k values efficiently.

Let's consider two consecutive k values: k and k+1.

The string for k is: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k} b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

The string for k+1 is: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1(k+1)} b_{2(k+1)} b_{2(k+2)} ... b_{2N}

So, the common prefix is a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k}

Then, the next character for k is b_{2k}, and for k+1 it's a_{1(k+1)}

So, to decide which one is smaller, I need to compare b_{2k} and a_{1(k+1)}

- If b_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, then the string for k is smaller.

- If b_{2k} > a_{1(k+1)}, then the string for k+1 is smaller.

- If b_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, then I need to look at the next characters.

But this seems similar to merging two sorted arrays, where I choose the smallest available element at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as merging the sequences:

- Sequence A: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N}

- Sequence B: b_{21} b_{22} ... b_{2N}

But with the constraint that in the merged sequence, I can switch from A to B only once, and after that, I can only take elements from B.

Wait, that might not be accurate because in the path, I collect elements from A up to some k, then switch to B at position k, and then collect elements from B onwards.

So, it's like choosing a point to switch from A to B.

So, to find the optimal switch point, I need to choose k such that the string a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k} b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N} is minimized.

To find the smallest such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the smallest string found.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to find the smallest string in O(N) time.

Let me think about the strings for different k values and see if there is a way to find the minimal one efficiently.

Let's consider that for k=1: a_{11} b_{21} b_{22} ... b_{2N}

For k=2: a_{11} a_{12} b_{22} b_{23} ... b_{2N}

For k=3: a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} b_{23} b_{24} ... b_{2N}

...

For k=N: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} b_{2N}

Now, to find the lexicographically smallest among these, I need to find the k where the transition from a's to b's results in the smallest possible string.

I need to find the k where b_{2k} is as small as possible compared to a_{1(k+1)}.

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest k such that b_{2k} <= a_{1(k+1)}

But I need to consider the entire string, not just that single character.

Wait, maybe I can find the point where switching from A to B gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k} b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

I can think of it as the concatenation of a_{11} to a_{1k} and then b_{2k} to b_{2N}.

So, to minimize this string, I need to choose k such that this concatenation is smallest.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the smallest string seen so far.

But I need to do this in linear time.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through k and keep track of the point where switching to B is beneficial.

Let me consider that initially, I'm in A, and I can stay in A as long as a_{1(k+1)} <= b_{2k}.

Because if a_{1(k+1)} < b_{2k}, then staying in A gives a smaller string.

Only when b_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)} should I switch to B.

This seems similar to merging two sorted arrays.

So, here's an idea:

- Initialize k=1

- While a_{1(k+1)} <= b_{2k}, stay in A: include a_{1(k+1)} and increment k.

- When b_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, switch to B: include b_{2k} and then the rest of B.

This would give me the smallest string.

Also, the number of paths that produce this string would be the number of ways to reach the switch point.

Wait, no. In this grid, once I decide to switch to B at some k, the path is determined: right moves in A up to k, then down to B at k, then right moves in B to N.

So, for each possible k, there's exactly one path that corresponds to that k.

But according to the first test case, there are two paths that produce the same smallest string.

Wait, in the first test case, both k=1 and k=2 produce '000'.

So, in that case, the number of paths is 2.

So, my previous assumption that each k corresponds to exactly one path is incorrect.

Wait, no, actually, each k corresponds to exactly one path.

But in the first test case, both k=1 and k=2 produce the same string '000', so the total number of paths is 2.

So, to find the number of paths that produce the smallest string, I need to find all k that produce this string and sum their path counts.

But in this grid, for each k, there's only one path corresponding to it.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=1 and k=2 both produce '000', and there are two paths.

So, yes, each k corresponds to one path.

Hence, the number of paths that produce the smallest string is equal to the number of k values that produce the smallest string.

But in the second test case, only k=3 produces '11000', while k=1 and k=2 produce '11100', which is larger.

Hence, only one path produces the smallest string.

So, in general, I need to find all k that produce the smallest string and count them.

But this still requires me to iterate through all k, which is O(N), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, so total time should be O(2*10^5), which is acceptable.

So, here's a plan:

- For each test case, iterate through k from 1 to N, construct the string for that k, keep track of the smallest string seen so far, and count the number of k that produce this smallest string.

But constructing the string for each k would be O(N), and for sum of n up to 2*10^5, it would be O(N^2) in total, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way to find the smallest string without constructing each one fully.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different k values efficiently.

Let's consider that for k from 1 to N, the strings are:

k=1: a1 b1 b2 ... bN

k=2: a1 a2 b2 b3 ... bN

k=3: a1 a2 a3 b3 b4 ... bN

...

k=N: a1 a2 ... aN bN

Now, to find the lexicographically smallest among these, I can iterate through the positions and find the first position where they differ.

But that still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints imposed by the grid.

Let me try to build the smallest string step by step.

Start at position 1: must take a1.

Position 2: choose the smaller of a2 and b1.

Position 3: depending on the previous choices.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the process.

Let me initialize:

- Current position: (1,1)

- Current string: empty

- At each step, choose the smallest available next character.

But I need to be careful about the future steps.

Wait, maybe I can use a pointer approach.

Let me try to implement a greedy algorithm:

- Start at (1,1)

- Current string: a1

- At position 2, choose the smaller of a2 and b1.

- At position 3, choose the smaller of a3 and b2, given the previous choice.

Wait, but choosing a3 or b2 depends on the previous moves.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the current row I'm in.

- If I'm in row 1, I can choose to stay in row 1 (right to a1, a2, etc.) or move down to row 2.

- If I'm in row 2, I can only move right in row 2.

So, I need to decide at each step whether to stay in the current row or move down, choosing the smallest possible character.

But since in row 2, I can only move right, once I move down, I'm committed to take all remaining characters from row 2.

Wait, but in the grid, from row 1, I can choose to move right or down.

If I move right, I stay in row 1.

If I move down, I go to row 2 and have to move right until the end.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, deciding at each column whether to switch to row 2 or stay in row 1.

Once I decide to switch to row 2, I can't go back to row 1.

So, I need to find the optimal column to switch to row 2.

Wait, but I can choose to switch at any column, and I need to find the switch column that gives the smallest string.

As I thought earlier, I can consider all possible switch columns and find the one that gives the smallest string.

But to do this efficiently, I need a way to find the minimal string without comparing each one individually.

Let me consider that the string for switch at column k is:

a1 a2 ... ak bkbk+1 ... bN

I need to find the minimal among these.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string.

But as mentioned before, this is too slow if done naively.

I need a way to find the minimal string in linear time.

Let me consider that the strings for different k values share some prefixes.

For example, for k=1: a1 b1 b2 ... bN

For k=2: a1 a2 b2 ... bN

If a2 == b1, then the strings are equal up to a1 a2/b1, and I need to compare further.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- Current string: a1

- Current row: 1

- Current column: 1

At each step, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

If I stay in row 1:

- Append a_{1(next_column)}

- Continue in row 1

If I switch to row 2:

- Append b_{2(current_column)} and then all b_{2(current_column+1)} to b_{2N}

I need to choose the option that gives the smallest possible string.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to row 2 is beneficial.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize:

- Start at (1,1), current string = a1

- Compare a2 and b1:

- If a2 <= b1, stay in row 1: append a2

- Else, switch to row 2 at column 1: append b1 b2 ... bN

Wait, but in reality, switching at column k means appending b_k and then b_{k+1} to b_N.

So, I need to find the k where switching at k gives the smallest string.

Let me try to iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

Initialize:

- current_string = a1

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

While current_column < N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1(current_column+1)}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append b_{2(current_column)} and then b_{2(current_column+1)} to b_{2N}

- Choose the option that gives the smallest extension.

- Else (current_row == 2):

- Only option: stay in row 2, append b_{2(current_column+1)}

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To compare the extensions efficiently, I need a way to compare the strings without constructing them fully.

Wait, perhaps I can use suffix comparisons.

Let me precompute for each position in row 2 the suffix starting from that position.

Similarly for row 1.

Wait, but row 1 ends at column N with a_{1N}, and row 2 starts at column 1 with b_{21}.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffixes for row 1 and row 2.

Let me try to precompute the suffixes for row 1 and row 2.

Define suffix1[k] = a_{1k} a_{1(k+1)} ... a_{1N}

Define suffix2[k] = b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

Then, for each k from 1 to N, the string for switching at k is:

a1 a2 ... a_{1k} b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

Which is prefix_a1_to_ak + suffix2[k]

Similarly, for k=1, it's a1 + suffix2[1]

For k=2, it's a1 a2 + suffix2[2]

And so on.

So, to find the minimal string among these, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, compute prefix_a1_to_ak + suffix2[k], and find the minimal one.

But again, this is O(N^2) in total.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that suffix2[k] is already a suffix starting from k in row 2.

So, I can precompute suffix2[k] for all k.

Similarly, prefix_a1_to_ak is a1 a2 ... a_{1k}.

So, the string for switching at k is prefix_a1_to_ak + suffix2[k].

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, compute prefix_a1_to_ak + suffix2[k], and keep track of the minimal one.

But this is still O(N^2) in total.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation of prefix_a1_to_ak and suffix2[k] in O(N) time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me iterate through the columns, keeping track of the current choice (stay in row 1 or switch to row 2), and choose the option that gives the smallest string at each step.

Initialize:

- current_string = a1

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

While current_column < N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1(current_column+1)}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append b_{2(current_column)} and then suffix2[current_column+1]

- Choose the option that gives the smallest extension.

- Else (current_row == 2):

- Only option: stay in row 2, append b_{2(current_column+1)}

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To compare Option 1 and Option 2, I need to compare:

Option 1: current_string + a_{1(current_column+1)} + suffix1[current_column+2]

Option 2: current_string + b_{2(current_column)} + suffix2[current_column+1]

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the suffixes in row 2.

Let me precompute suffix2[k] = b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

Similarly, prefix_a[k] = a1 a2 ... a_{1k}

Then, for each k, the string is prefix_a[k] + suffix2[k]

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and find the minimal concatenation of prefix_a[k] and suffix2[k].

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where prefix_a[k] + suffix2[k] is minimal.

To optimize this, I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

Let me try to iterate through k from 1 to N:

For each k, compute prefix_a[k] + suffix2[k], and keep track of the minimal one.

But again, this is O(N^2).

I need a way to compare prefix_a[k] + suffix2[k] efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and find the point where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me try to iterate through the columns, building the string step by step.

Initialize:

- current_string = a1

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

- possible_switch_column = 1

While current_column < N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1(current_column+1)}

- Option 2: switch to row 2 at current_column, append b_{2(current_column)} and then suffix2[current_column+1]

- Compare Option 1 and Option 2:

- Compare a_{1(current_column+1)} with b_{2(current_column)}

- If a_{1(current_column+1)} < b_{2(current_column)}, stay in row 1

- If b_{2(current_column)} < a_{1(current_column+1)}, switch to row 2

- If equal, look further

But looking further would require looking at the next characters, which could be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that once I switch to row 2, I have to take all remaining b's.

So, I can iterate through the columns, and at each column, decide whether to switch to row 2 or stay in row 1.

I need to choose the switch column that minimizes the string.

Let me try to find the minimal switch column.

Initialize:

- minimal_string = None

- minimal_k = None

Iterate k from 1 to N:

- Compute string_k = a1 a2 ... a_{1k} + b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

- If minimal_string is None or string_k < minimal_string:

- Set minimal_string = string_k

- Set minimal_k = k

After iterating through all k, minimal_string is the smallest string, and the number of paths is the number of k that produce this string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in total.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for k from 1 to N, the strings are:

k=1: a1 b1 b2 ... bN

k=2: a1 a2 b2 ... bN

k=3: a1 a2 a3 b3 ... bN

...

k=N: a1 a2 ... aN bN

I can see that for k=2, the string is a1 a2 b2 ... bN, which shares a prefix with k=1's string.

So, to compare k=1 and k=2:

- Compare a1 b1 b2 ... with a1 a2 b2 ...

- Since a1 is the same, compare b1 with a2.

- If b1 < a2, then k=1 is better.

- If a2 < b1, then k=2 is better.

- If b1 == a2, then compare b2 with b2, which are equal, so continue to the next characters.

Similarly, for k=3: a1 a2 a3 b3 ... compared to k=2: a1 a2 b2 ...

- Compare up to a1 a2, which are the same in both.

- Then, a3 vs b2.

- So, if a3 < b2, k=3 is better; if b2 < a3, k=2 is better; if equal, continue.

This seems similar to merging multiple sorted arrays.

Perhaps I can use a priority queue to keep track of the current options.

Let me try to implement a priority queue approach.

Initialize a priority queue that stores the current k, the current string so far, and the current position.

At each step, choose the option with the smallest string so far, and proceed.

But this might still be too slow for the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal switch column by iterating through the columns and keeping track of the minimal extension.

Let me try to iterate through the columns and decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at each step.

Initialize:

- current_string = a1

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

- minimal_string = None

- switch_column = None

While current_column < N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1(current_column+1)}

- Option 2: switch to row 2 at current_column, append b_{2(current_column)} and suffix2[current_column+1]

- Compare Option 1 and Option 2:

- Compare a_{1(current_column+1)} with b_{2(current_column)}

- If a_{1(current_column+1)} < b_{2(current_column)}, choose Option 1

- If b_{2(current_column)} < a_{1(current_column+1)}, choose Option 2

- If equal, look further

- Else (current_row == 2):

- Only option: stay in row 2, append b_{2(current_column+1)}

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To optimize, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me try to find the minimal switch column k.

Initialize:

- minimal_string = None

- minimal_k = None

Iterate k from 1 to N:

- Construct string_k = a1 a2 ... a_{1k} + b_{2k} b_{2(k+1)} ... b_{2N}

- If minimal_string is None or string_k < minimal_string:

- Set minimal_string = string_k

- Set minimal_k = k

After iterating through all k, minimal_string is the smallest string, and the number of paths is the number of k that produce this string.

But again, constructing string_k for each k is too slow.

I need a way to compare the strings efficiently without constructing them fully.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal choice.

Let me try to iterate through the columns step by step, building the string position by position.

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

- result_string = ''

While current_column <= N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, take a_{1(current_column)}

- Option 2: switch to row 2 at current_column, take b_{2(current_column)}

- Choose the smaller of a_{1(current_column)} and b_{2(current_column)}

- If a_{1(current_column)} < b_{2(current_column)}, choose Option 1, append a_{1(current_column)}, move to next column

- If b_{2(current_column)} < a_{1(current_column)}, choose Option 2, append b_{2(current_column)}, set current_row = 2, move to next column

- If equal, need to look ahead

- Else (current_row == 2):

- Only option: take b_{2(current_column)}, append b_{2(current_column)}, move to next column

This seems correct and efficient.

To handle the look-ahead when a_{1(current_column)} == b_{2(current_column)}, I need to check the next characters.

Let me modify the approach:

While current_column <= N:

- If current_row == 1:

- If a_{1(current_column)} < b_{2(current_column)}:

- Append a_{1(current_column)}, move to next column in row 1

- Elif b_{2(current_column)} < a_{1(current_column)}:

- Append b_{2(current_column)}, set current_row = 2, move to next column

- Else (a_{1(current_column)} == b_{2(current_column)}):

- Look ahead:

- If a_{1(current_column+1)} < b_{2(current_column)}:

- Append a_{1(current_column)}, move to next column in row 1

- Else:

- Append b_{2(current_column)}, set current_row = 2, move to next column

- Else (current_row == 2):

- Append b_{2(current_column)}, move to next column

This way, when the current characters are equal, I look ahead to decide which path to take.

This should give me the minimal string.

Now, for counting the number of paths that produce this minimal string, I need to find all switch columns k that produce this string.

Given that each switch column k corresponds to a unique path, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, construct the string for each k, and count how many of them match the minimal string.

But again, constructing the string for each k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the range of k that produce the minimal string.

Given that the strings for different k are comparable lexicographically, perhaps the k values that produce the minimal string are consecutive.

If that's the case, I can find the minimal k and maximal k that produce the minimal string, and then the count is maximal_k - minimal_k + 1.

But I need to verify if the k values that produce the minimal string are indeed consecutive.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=2

a=00

b=00

For k=1: 0 + 0 0 = 000

For k=2: 0 0 + 0 = 000

Both produce '000', so the count is 2.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=1101

b=1100

For k=1: 1 + 1 1 0 0 = 11100

For k=2: 1 1 + 0 0 = 11000

For k=3: 1 1 0 + 0 = 11000

For k=4: 1 1 0 1 + 0 = 11010

The minimal string is '11000', which is produced by k=2 and k=3.

Wait, in the second test case, in the problem description, it says only one path produces '11000', but according to this, k=2 and k=3 both produce '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Looking back, in the second test case, the output is '11000' with count 1.

But according to my calculation, k=2 and k=3 both produce '11000'.

Wait, let's check:

For k=1: a1 b1 b2 b3 b4 = 1 1 1 0 0 = '11100'

For k=2: a1 a2 b2 b3 b4 = 1 1 1 0 0 = '11100'

Wait, no.

Wait, a=1101, b=1100

For k=1: a1 + b1 b2 b3 b4 = 1 + 1 1 0 0 = '11100'

For k=2: a1 a2 + b2 b3 b4 = 1 1 + 1 0 0 = '11100'

For k=3: a1 a2 a3 + b3 b4 = 1 1 0 + 0 0 = '11000'

For k=4: a1 a2 a3 a4 + b4 = 1 1 0 1 + 0 = '11010'

So, only k=3 produces '11000', which is smaller than '11100' and '11010'.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, k=3 and k=4 produce different strings.

Wait, in the problem description, for the second test case, it says only one path produces '11000', which matches k=3.

But according to my earlier logic, k=3 produces '11000', and k=4 produces '11010', which is different.

So, why does the problem say only one path produces '11000'?

Because only k=3 produces '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.

Let me double-check:

For k=2: a1 a2 + b2 b3 b4 = 1 1 + 1 0 0 = '11100'

For k=3: a1 a2 a3 + b3 b4 = 1 1 0 + 0 0 = '11000'

For k=4: a1 a2 a3 a4 + b4 = 1 1 0 1 + 0 = '11010'

So, only k=3 produces '11000', which is the smallest.

Hence, the count is 1.

So, my earlier assumption that k=2 and k=3 both produce '11000' was incorrect; only k=3 does.

Wait, no, according to my calculation above, k=2 produces '11100', which is larger than '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, in the problem description, for the second test case, it says:

4

1101

1100

And the output is:

11000

1

Implying that only one path produces '11000'.

But according to my calculation, only k=3 produces '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach for counting the number of paths.

Let me think again.

Given that for each k, there is exactly one path that corresponds to it.

Hence, the number of paths that produce the minimal string is equal to the number of k that produce this string.

In the first test case, k=1 and k=2 both produce '000', so count=2.

In the second test case, only k=3 produces '11000', so count=1.

Hence, to find the count, I need to find all k that produce the minimal string.

But iterating through all k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string using the greedy approach, and then find the range of k that produce this string.

Let me try to implement the greedy approach to find the minimal string.

Implement the algorithm I described earlier:

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- current_column = 1

- result_string = ''

While current_column <= N:

- If current_row == 1:

- If a_{1(current_column)} < b_{2(current_column)}:

- Append a_{1(current_column)}, move to next column in row 1

- Elif b_{2(current_column)} < a_{1(current_column)}:

- Append b_{2(current_column)}, set current_row = 2, move to next column

- Else (a_{1(current_column)} == b_{2(current_column)}):

- Look ahead:

- If a_{1(current_column+1)} < b_{2(current_column)}:

- Append a_{1(current_column)}, move to next column in row 1

- Else:

- Append b_{2(current_column)}, set current_row = 2, move to next column

- Else (current
