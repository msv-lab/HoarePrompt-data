Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings that I need to form, and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. For example, if k is 3, I'd be using 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The task is to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n from these k alphabets appear as a subsequence in s. A subsequence means that I can pick characters from s in order, skipping some if needed, to form the desired string.

The goal is to make s as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities with the same length, I can choose any of them.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. For example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence because you can remove 'b' and 'd' to get 'ace'. Similarly, "ab" is a subsequence of "aebd" because you can remove 'e' and 'd' to get 'ab'.

So, for n=1 and k=2, the possible strings are "a" and "b". The sample output is "ab", and indeed, both "a" and "b" are subsequences of "ab".

For n=2 and k=1, with only "a" to use, the only possible string is "aa", and the sample output is "aa".

For n=2 and k=2, the possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The sample output is "baab", which contains all these as subsequences.

For n=2 and k=3, the possible strings are all combinations of "a", "b", and "c" of length 2, totaling 9 strings. The sample output is "abcbac", which contains all of them as subsequences.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct s for any given n and k, with the constraints provided.

Let's think about how to minimize the length of s while ensuring that all possible strings of length n from the first k alphabets are present as subsequences.

One approach that comes to mind is to construct s in such a way that it contains all possible combinations of the k letters in a sequence that allows for the minimal overlap.

I recall that in computer science and combinatorics, de Bruijn sequences are used to minimize the length of a sequence that contains all possible subsequences of a certain length. However, de Bruijn sequences are typically for substrings, not subsequences.

Wait, this problem is about subsequences, not substrings. So, de Bruijn sequences might not directly apply here.

Let me think differently. For n=1, regardless of k, s just needs to contain all k letters at least once, in any order, since any single letter is a subsequence.

For n=2, I need to have all possible pairs of letters from the k letters. For example, with k=2 and n=2, I need "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The sample output is "baab".

Let's see how "baab" contains all these:

- "aa": positions 2 and 4 (b[a]a[b])

- "ab": positions 2 and 3 (b[a][b])

- "ba": positions 1 and 2 ([b][a]a[b])

- "bb": positions 1 and 4 ([b]a[a][b])

So, it works.

Another way to look at it is that for n=2, s needs to have all possible pairs of letters from the k letters appearing in order, possibly with other letters in between.

Generalizing, for n, s needs to have all possible strings of length n as subsequences.

I need a way to construct s such that it includes all possible combinations of length n from k letters, with minimal redundancy.

I recall that in the context of strings and subsequences, the shortest string containing all possible subsequences of length n from a k-letter alphabet is related to the concept of supersequence.

In particular, the minimal length of s that contains all possible strings of length n from k letters as subsequences is known and can be calculated.

I think there's a formula for the minimal length. Let me try to recall it.

I believe the minimal length is k^n + n - 1. Wait, no, that might not be right.

Wait, for n=1, minimal length is k (just contain all letters once).

For n=2, with k=2, minimal length is 3 ("aba" contains "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb":

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (a[b]a)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 (a[b]a)

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 ([b]a)

- "bb": positions 2 and 2 ([b][b]), but wait, subsequences can repeat indices only if the characters are the same.

Wait, in "aba", "bb" is not a subsequence because there's only one 'b'.

So "aba" doesn't contain "bb" as a subsequence. Hence, "aba" is not sufficient for n=2 and k=2.

Wait, the sample output for n=2 and k=2 is "baab", which does contain "bb" as positions 1 and 4.

So, perhaps my initial thought is incorrect.

Let me look up the minimal length for such a string.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think recursively.

Suppose I have a string that contains all sequences of length n-1, and I need to extend it to include sequences of length n.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using graph theory.

Each possible string of length n-1 can be a node, and edges represent the addition of a character to extend the sequence.

But again, this seems like it's heading towards de Bruijn sequences, which are for substrings, not subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently for subsequences.

In the case of subsequences, perhaps inclusion of all possible combinations can be achieved by arranging the letters in a way that maximizes the number of possible subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal length is the sum of the lengths of the individual sequences minus overlaps, but I need a more concrete approach.

Given the constraints, t can be up to 676, and n and k are up to 26, it's important that the solution is efficient.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For n=1, k=2: "ab" (length 2)

- For n=2, k=1: "aa" (length 2)

- For n=2, k=2: "baab" (length 4)

- For n=2, k=3: "abcbac" (length 6)

Let's see if there's a pattern here.

For n=1, length is k.

For n=2, length seems to be k*k + something.

Wait, for n=2 and k=2, length is 4, which is 2^2.

For n=2 and k=3, length is 6, which is 3*2.

Wait, 3*2? Or 3^2 is 9, but the output is length 6.

Wait, 3*2 is 6, which matches.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, the minimal length is k*(n), which is k*2.

But for k=2, n=2, it's 4, which matches.

For k=3, n=2, it's 6, which matches.

For k=1, n=2, it's 2, which is 1*2.

So, perhaps for n=2, the minimal length is k*2.

Generalizing, perhaps for any n, the minimal length is k*n.

But wait, for n=1, it's k, which fits.

For n=2, it's k*2.

But is this always the minimal?

Wait, for n=2 and k=2, "baab" has length 4, which is k*2.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" has length 6, which is k*2.

But is this the minimal?

Looking back, for n=2 and k=2, is there a string shorter than length 4 that contains all possible 2-letter combinations from 'a' and 'b' as subsequences?

Let's try "aabb":

- "aa": positions 1 and 2 (a[a]b[b])

- "ab": positions 1 and 3 (a[a][b])

- "ba": positions 2 and 4 ([a][a]b[b])

- "bb": positions 3 and 4 ([a][a][b][b])

Wait, but "ba" in "aabb" would require picking the second 'a' and the fourth 'b', which is valid.

So, "aabb" also works and has length 4.

Is there a string of length 3 that works?

Let's try "aab":

- "aa": positions 1 and 2 ([a][a]b)

- "ab": positions 1 and 3 ([a][a][b])

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 ([a][a][b])

Wait, "ba" requires picking the second 'a' and the third 'b', which is valid.

- "bb": positions 3 and 3 ([b][b]), but there's only one 'b', so "bb" is not a subsequence.

So, "aab" doesn't contain "bb".

Hence, length 3 is insufficient for n=2 and k=2.

Therefore, length 4 is indeed minimal, which matches k*2.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, length 6 is achieved, which is k*2.

Wait, but for n=1, it's k*1.

So, perhaps the minimal length is k*n.

But let's check for n=3.

Suppose n=3 and k=2.

The number of possible strings is 2^3=8: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".

Is there a string of length 6 that contains all these as subsequences?

Let's try "aaabbb":

- "aaa": positions 1,2,3 ([a][a][a]bbb)

- "aab": positions 1,2,4 ([a][a][b]bb)

- "aba": positions 1,3,4 ([a][a][b]bb)

- "abb": positions 1,4,5 ([a][b][b]b)

- "baa": positions 2,3,4 ([a][a][b]bb)

- "bab": positions 2,3,5 ([a][a][b][b]b)

- "bba": positions 3,4,5 ([a][a][b][b][b])

- "bbb": positions 4,5,6 ([b][b][b]b)

Wait, but "bba" would require positions 3,4,5 ([b][b][a]), but in "aaabbb", positions 3,4,5 are 'a','b','b', so "bba" is not a subsequence.

Hence, "aaabbb" doesn't contain "bba".

Another attempt: "ababab"

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5 ([a][a][a]bab)

- "aab": positions 1,3,4 ([a][a][b]ab)

- "aba": positions 1,2,4 ([a][b][a]b)

- "abb": positions 1,2,5 ([a][b][b]ab)

- "baa": positions 2,4,5 ([a][b][a][b][a])

- "bab": positions 2,4,6 ([a][b][a][b][a][b])

- "bba": positions 3,4,6 ([a][b][a][b][a][b])

- "bbb": positions 2,4,6 ([b][b][b])

Wait, but "baa" would require positions 2,4,5 ([b][a][a]), but in "ababab", positions 2,4,5 are 'b','a','b', which doesn't form "baa".

Hence, "ababab" doesn't contain "baa".

Another attempt: "abbaab"

- "aaa": positions 1,2,4 ([a][a][b]aab)

- "aab": positions 1,2,5 ([a][a][b]aab)

- "aba": positions 1,3,5 ([a][b][a]aab)

- "abb": positions 1,3,4 ([a][b][b]aab)

- "baa": positions 2,4,5 ([b][a][a]b)

- "bab": positions 2,4,6 ([b][a][a][b])

- "bba": positions 3,4,5 ([b][b][a]a[b])

- "bbb": positions 3,4,6 ([b][b][a][a][b])

Wait, "bba" is positions 3,4,5 ([b][b][a]), which matches "bba".

"bbb" would require three 'b's in order, which are positions 3,4,6 ([b][b][a][a][b]).

So, "abbaab" seems to contain all 8 sequences.

Hence, a string of length 6 contains all possible subsequences for n=3 and k=2.

But according to the earlier pattern, k*n=2*3=6, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal length is indeed k*n.

But let's check for n=3 and k=1.

n=3, k=1: only possible string is "aaa".

So, s="aaa" has length 3, which is k*n=1*3=3.

Yes, it matches.

Another check: n=1, k=2, length=2 which is k*n=2*1=2.

n=2, k=2, length=4 which is k*n=2*2=4.

n=3, k=2, length=6 which is k*n=2*3=6.

n=2, k=3, length=6 which is k*n=3*2=6.

So, it seems that the minimal length is k*n.

Therefore, to minimize the length of s, I should construct s with length k*n.

Now, how to construct such a string?

One straightforward way is to repeat the sequence of k letters n times.

For example, for k=2, n=2: "abab", which has length 4.

But in the sample input, for n=2 and k=2, the output is "baab", which also has length 4.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, the output is "abcbac", which has length 6.

But is there a specific order that is better?

I notice that in the sample input for n=2 and k=2, "baab" is used instead of "abab".

Is there a reason for this?

Wait, perhaps the order doesn't matter as long as each letter appears n times in order.

But in the case of n=2 and k=2, both "abab" and "baab" have length 4 and contain all required subsequences.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" has length 6.

So, perhaps any arrangement where each letter appears at least n times in order works.

But to minimize the length, k*n is sufficient.

Hence, perhaps the simplest way is to concatenate the sequence of k letters n times.

For example:

- For k=2, n=1: "ab"

- For k=1, n=2: "aa"

- For k=2, n=2: "abab"

- For k=3, n=2: "abcabc"

But in the sample input, for k=2, n=2, "baab" is used instead of "abab".

Similarly, for k=3, n=2, "abcbac" is used instead of "abcabc".

Is there a specific reason for this?

Perhaps to optimize for something else, but according to the problem, any minimal length string is acceptable.

Hence, "abab" should be acceptable for k=2, n=2.

Similarly, "abcabc" for k=3, n=2.

But the sample output is "baab" and "abcbac", which are different but have the same length.

Hence, it seems that multiple solutions are possible as long as the length is minimal.

Therefore, in my implementation, I can choose to repeat the sequence of first k letters n times.

For example:

- s = 'abc'[:k] * n

Wait, in the code provided, it's s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n

So, for k=2, n=2: s = 'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

For k=3, n=2: s = 'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

But according to the sample input, for k=2, n=2: "baab" is acceptable, and for k=3, n=2: "abcbac"

Hence, my approach seems valid.

Now, I need to confirm if this indeed contains all possible subsequences.

Let me verify for n=2 and k=2: s='abab'

Possible subsequences of length 2:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (a[b][a]b)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 ([a][b]ab), positions 1 and 4 (a[b][a][b]), positions 3 and 4 ([a][b][a][b])

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 ([a][b][a]b)

- "bb": positions 2 and 4 ([a][b][a][b])

So, all four are present.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3: s='abcabc'

Possible subsequences of length 2:

- "aa": positions 1 and 4 ([a][b][c][a]b[c])

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 ([a][b]cabc), positions 1 and 5 ([a][b][c][a][b][c]), positions 4 and 5 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

- "ac": positions 1 and 6 ([a][b][c][a][b][c]), positions 3 and 6 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

- "ba": positions 2 and 4 ([a][b][c][a]b[c])

- "bb": positions 2 and 5 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

- "bc": positions 2 and 3 ([a][b][c]abc), positions 2 and 6 ([a][b][c][a][b][c]), positions 5 and 6 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

- "ca": positions 3 and 4 ([a][b][c][a]b[c])

- "cb": positions 3 and 5 ([a][b][c][a][b][c]), positions 6 and 5 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

- "cc": positions 3 and 6 ([a][b][c][a][b][c])

So, all nine are present.

Hence, repeating the sequence of k letters n times seems to work.

Is there a way to make it shorter? According to my earlier analysis, k*n is the minimal length, so no.

Hence, this approach should be correct.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

return s[:k] * n

This seems to match my approach.

It takes the first k letters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', repeats them n times, and returns the result.

Given that, and the earlier verification, this should be correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{abab}} for n=2 and k=2, or more generally, s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n for any n and k within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
