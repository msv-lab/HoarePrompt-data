Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n x n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. Nene can perform two types of operations on this matrix. Each operation allows her to choose a row or a column and assign it a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its values to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its values to any permutation of 1 to n. Since I can perform up to 2n operations, I need to figure out the best way to use these operations to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Let me think about what the sum of the matrix would be if I fill it optimally. Each cell in the matrix can hold a value from 1 to n, but depending on how I assign these values through row and column operations, some cells might get overwritten.

Wait a minute, every time I perform a type 1 operation on a row, I set all its elements to a permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation on a column sets all its elements to a permutation of 1 to n. So, if I perform both operations on a particular row and column, the cell at their intersection will be set twice, meaning the last operation will determine its value.

Hmm, that complicates things. I need to ensure that I'm not unnecessarily overwriting cells and reducing the total sum.

Let me consider a small value of n to get some intuition. Let's take n=1. In this case, the matrix has only one cell. I can perform either a type 1 operation on row 1 or a type 2 operation on column 1, and set the cell to 1. So, the maximum sum is 1, and I can do it in one operation.

For n=2, let's see. If I perform type 1 operations on both rows, setting them to [2,1] and [1,2], the matrix would look like:

2 1

1 2

The sum is 6.

Alternatively, if I perform type 2 operations on both columns, setting them to [2,1] and [1,2], the matrix would look like:

2 1

1 2

Same as above.

If I perform one type 1 and one type 2, for example, set row 1 to [2,1] and column 1 to [1,2], the matrix becomes:

1 1

2 2

Sum is 6 again.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, for n=2, the maximum sum is 7, not 6. So, I must be missing something.

Let me look back at the example provided in the problem. In the second test case, n=2, and the output is:

7 3

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

So, they perform three operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's see what the matrix looks like after these operations.

Initially, matrix is:

0 0

0 0

After operation 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

1 2

0 0

After operation 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

1 2

1 2

After operation 3: set column 1 to [1,2]

So, column 1 is set to [1,2], which means:

1 2

2 2

So, the final matrix is:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2 = 7.

Ah, I see. So, by performing operations in this order, they manage to have a higher sum because the last operation on the column overrides some cells set by the row operations.

So, the key is to perform operations in such a way that the higher values are placed in positions where they won't be overwritten by subsequent operations.

Let me think about a general strategy for any n.

I need to maximize the sum of the matrix, which means placing the highest possible values in as many cells as possible.

Given that each operation sets an entire row or column, I need to find a way to maximize the sum considering that some cells might be set multiple times.

One idea is to perform operations in a way that minimizes overwriting higher values with lower ones.

Another way to look at it is to consider that each operation sets a entire row or column, so the final value of a cell depends on the last operation that set its row or column.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning each row and each column a permutation, and the cell value is the maximum of the assigned values from its row and column.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because the operations are performed in sequence, and the last operation on the row or column determines the cell's value.

Actually, for a cell (i,j), its final value will be the last operation that set either row i or column j.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that higher values are set in cells where they won't be overwritten by lower values from later operations.

One possible strategy is to perform operations in decreasing order of the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign higher values to rows and columns that influence more cells.

Wait, but since each operation sets an entire row or column, and I have up to 2n operations, I need to cover as much of the matrix as possible with these operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as covering the matrix with rows and columns, and assigning the highest possible values to the covering rows and columns.

Wait, maybe it's similar to the problem of maximizing the sum by selecting a subset of rows and columns with certain constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the maximum sum based on some formula involving n.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula for small values of n.

For n=1:

Maximum sum is 1, using 1 operation.

For n=2:

Maximum sum is 7, using 3 operations.

For n=3:

Let me try to see.

If I perform type 1 operations on all three rows with permutations [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], the matrix would be:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 9+6 = 15.

Alternatively, if I perform type 1 operations on rows 1 and 2, and type 2 operations on columns 2 and 3:

Operation 1: type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

The matrix would be:

3 3 3

3 2 2

? ? ?

Wait, but I've only performed operations on rows 1 and 2, and columns 2 and 3. I need to see what the final matrix looks like.

Wait, with operations:

1. Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

2. Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

3. Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

4. Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

So, after operation 1:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

After operation 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

After operation 3:

3 3 1

3 2 1

0 2 0

After operation 4:

3 3 3

3 2 2

0 2 2

So, sum is 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 0+2+2 = 8 + 7 + 4 = 19.

Wait, that's higher than 15. So, seems better.

Is there a better way?

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 6 operations, which is within 2n=6 operations.

Let me try to maximize the sum.

I need to assign permutations to rows and columns, and the cell value will be set by the last operation that targets its row or column.

So, perhaps I can prioritize assigning higher values to rows and columns that influence more cells.

Wait, but each row or column operation affects n cells.

Wait, maybe I need to maximize the number of times higher values are assigned.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to calculate the maximum sum based on the number of operations performed on rows and columns.

Let me consider that I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Each row operation sets n cells, and each column operation sets n cells, but there is overlap where row and column operations intersect.

Specifically, for a cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are operated on, the last operation performed will determine its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to ensure that as many cells as possible are set to the highest possible values.

One approach could be to perform operations in a way that maximizes the number of cells set by operations assigning higher values.

Wait, perhaps it's optimal to perform operations that assign higher values to rows and columns that haven't been set yet.

Wait, maybe it's better to perform operations that assign higher values to rows and columns that influence the most unset cells.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern in the sum based on n.

Looking back at the example for n=2, the maximum sum is 7.

For n=1, it's 1.

For n=2, it's 7.

Let me try to find a formula.

Wait, for n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: ?

n=4: ?

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, 1 for n=1, 7 for n=2.

7 is 1 + 2 + 4.

Wait, 1 for n=1, 1+2+4 for n=2, maybe 1+2+4+7 for n=3, and so on.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^2 + something.

Wait, for n=2: n^2 = 4, sum is 7, which is 4 + 3.

For n=1: 1 + 0 = 1.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the first n natural numbers plus something.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of operations.

Each operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, so the maximum sum per operation is sum from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

If I perform m operations, the maximum sum would be m * n(n+1)/2, but this overcounts because operations can overlap and overwrite each other.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to cover the matrix such that most cells are set by exactly one operation, and some cells are set by two operations.

In that case, the sum would be the sum of all operations minus the sum of the cells that are set by both a row and a column operation.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as:

Sum = (number of row operations * n * (n+1)/2) + (number of column operations * n * (n+1)/2) - (number of cells set by both row and column operations * average value)

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider performing operations in a specific order.

Suppose I perform all row operations first, setting each row to a permutation of 1 to n.

Then, perform some column operations, setting specific columns to permutations.

In this case, the cells in the columns that are operated on will be overwritten by the column operations.

So, the final value of a cell depends on whether its row was operated on last or its column was operated on last.

Wait, actually, the last operation that sets either the row or the column determines the cell's value.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can fix the operations in a certain way to maximize the sum.

Let me consider performing operations in a way that prioritizes setting higher values in cells that are less likely to be overwritten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform operations that set higher values in cells that are not going to be affected by later operations.

Wait, maybe I can perform operations on rows and columns in a specific sequence to maximize the sum.

Looking back at the example for n=2, they performed:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum: 7

But if they had performed:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]

Matrix would be:

2 1

1 1

Sum: 5, which is worse.

So, the choice of permutations matters.

In the first approach, they chose permutations that place higher values in positions that aren't overwritten by later operations.

Wait, in the first operation, setting row 1 to [1,2], then setting row 2 to [1,2], then setting column 1 to [1,2], the cell (1,1) is set to 1 in the first operation and then to 1 again in the third operation, so it remains 1. Cell (2,1) is set to 1 in the second operation and then to 2 in the third operation, so it becomes 2. Cells (1,2) and (2,2) are only set once, so they remain 2 and 2 respectively.

So, the sum is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.

If they had chosen [2,1] for the permutations, the matrix would be:

2 1

1 1

Sum: 5, which is worse.

So, choosing permutations that place higher values in positions that are less likely to be overwritten is better.

In this case, placing the higher value in the second column, which is not being overwritten by the column operation.

Wait, because the column operation sets column 1, which was not set in the second row operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize setting higher values in positions that are not going to be overwritten by later operations.

So, perhaps I should perform operations in a way that the cells that are going to be set by column operations are set to lower values in the row operations.

Wait, in the example, they set row 1 to [1,2], so cell (1,2) is set to 2, and since column 1 is set later, cell (1,1) is set to 1 again, but it was already set to 1, so it remains 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each cell's value is determined by the last operation that sets its row or column.

So, for cell (i,j), if the last operation is a row operation on row i, its value is the value assigned in that row operation. If the last operation is a column operation on column j, its value is the value assigned in that column operation.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that cells are set by operations assigning higher values.

One way to do this is to perform operations in a sequence where earlier operations set lower values, and later operations set higher values, so that if a cell is overwritten, it's overwritten with a higher value.

Wait, but operations are permutations of 1 to n, so they contain all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

So, in a permutation, there are both low and high values.

Wait, maybe I need to arrange the operations so that cells are set by operations that assign higher values, and avoid overwriting them with lower values.

Wait, perhaps I should perform operations that assign higher values to cells that are less likely to be overwritten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform operations in a way that maximizes the number of cells set to n, then to n-1, and so on.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform operations in such a way that I cover the matrix with rows and columns, maximizing the sum based on the operations performed.

Each operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n(n+1)/2 to the sum, but with overlaps.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

If I perform k operations, the sum would be k * n(n+1)/2 minus the overlaps.

But calculating the overlaps seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are rows and columns, and edges represent the cells, and find a maximum matching or something.

This seems too involved for the time constraints.

Maybe I need a simpler approach.

Looking back at the example for n=2, they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations.

Let me see what is the theoretical maximum.

If I could set all cells to n, the sum would be n^3, but that's not possible with permutations.

Given that each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, the highest possible sum would be achieved if each cell is set by an operation that assigns it the highest possible value, without being overwritten by a lower value from a later operation.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the sum based on the number of operations performed on rows and columns.

Suppose I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Then, for each cell, its value is determined by the last operation that set its row or column.

So, the sum would be the sum over all cells of the maximum value assigned to its row or column in the last operation.

This seems too vague to compute directly.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the permutations for the row and column operations, and the order in which they are performed.

Then, for each cell, its value is determined by the last operation that set its row or column.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize the value for each cell individually.

For each cell (i,j), its value will be the value assigned to it in the last operation that set row i or column j.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize each of these values.

To do this, I need to choose operations that assign higher values to cells that are less likely to be overwritten.

This seems tricky to manage manually for larger n.

Perhaps there's a pattern in the sum based on n.

Looking back at the example for n=2, sum is 7.

Let me try to compute the sum for n=3.

If I perform operations in a certain way, what's the maximum sum I can achieve?

Let me try performing operations on all rows and two columns.

For example:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

So, 5 operations, which is within 2n=6 operations.

Let's see the matrix after these operations.

After operation 1:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

After operation 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

After operation 3:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

After operation 4:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

(with column 1 set to [3,2,1], so:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

After operation 5:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum: 3+3+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 7 + 5 + 4 = 16.

So, sum is 16 with 5 operations.

Is there a better way?

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 6 operations.

For example:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

After operation 1:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

After operation 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

After operation 3:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

After operation 4:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

(with column 1 set to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

After operation 5:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

After operation 6:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 2

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+2 = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20.

So, sum is 20 with 6 operations.

Is this the maximum?

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Let me see.

If I perform operations in a different order or with different permutations, can I get a higher sum?

For example, perform column operations first.

Operation 1: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

After operation 1:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

After operation 2:

0 3 0

0 2 0

0 1 0

After operation 3:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

After operation 4:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

(with row 1 set to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 1 1

After operation 5:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 1 1

After operation 6:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.

So, sum is 18, which is less than 20.

So, the earlier approach gives a higher sum.

Is there a way to get higher than 20?

Let me see.

If I perform operations in a different sequence or with different permutations.

Wait, perhaps there's a general formula for the maximum sum.

Looking back, for n=1, sum=1.

n=2, sum=7.

n=3, sum=20.

Wait, 1 for n=1, 7 for n=2, 20 for n=3.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me see:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7 = 1 + 3*2

n=3: 20 = 1 + 3*2 + 5*3

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, n=1: 1

n=2: 7 = 1 + 6

n=3: 20 = 1 + 6 + 13

Wait, still not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the first n squares.

n=1: 1^3 = 1

n=2: 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9, which is not 7.

Wait, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the first n natural numbers plus something.

Wait, n=1: 1

n=2: 7 = 3 + 4

n=3: 20 = 7 + 8 + 5

Still not clear.

Let me think differently.

Each operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n(n+1)/2 to the sum.

If I perform m operations, the sum would be m * n(n+1)/2 minus the overlaps.

In the case of n=2, m=3 operations, sum=3 * (2*3)/2 = 9, but with overlaps of 2 cells, each contributing n(n+1)/2 / n = (n+1)/2.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is n^3 - n^2 + n.

For n=1: 1 -1 +1 =1

n=2: 8 -4 +2=6, but in the example, it's 7, so no.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n + something.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n(n+1)/2.

For n=1: 1 -1 +1=1

n=2: 8 -4 +3=7

n=3: 27 -9 +6=24, but earlier I got 20, so not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n.

For n=1:1-1+1=1

n=2:8-4+2=6, not matching example.

n=3:27-9+3=21, not matching my earlier sum of 20.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n + something else.

This isn't working.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can set n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, so the sum added by each operation is n(n+1)/2.

If I perform 2n operations, the maximum sum would be 2n * n(n+1)/2 = n^2(n+1).

But this overcounts because operations can overlap.

In reality, the sum is less due to overlaps.

Wait, but in the n=2 example, 2n=4 operations could be performed, but they used only 3 operations to achieve sum=7.

If I calculate 2n * n(n+1)/2 for n=2, it's 4 * 2*3/2 = 12, but the actual sum is 7, which is less due to overlaps.

So, perhaps there's a way to calculate the sum based on the number of operations and the overlaps.

This seems too complicated.

Let me look for another way.

Suppose I perform operations in such a way that I maximize the sum by prioritizing operations that set higher values in cells that are less likely to be overwritten.

One way to do this is to perform operations that set higher values in cells that are not going to be affected by later operations.

Wait, perhaps I can perform operations on rows and columns in a specific sequence to maximize the sum.

Let me consider performing operations on rows first, setting the highest possible values in the rows, and then performing operations on columns to set higher values in the remaining cells.

Wait, but in the earlier example, performing operations on rows first and then on columns gave a sum of 20 for n=3, which was higher than performing column operations first.

So, perhaps performing row operations first and then column operations is better.

Let me generalize this.

Suppose I perform all row operations first, setting each row to a permutation that places higher values in positions that are not going to be overwritten by column operations.

Then, perform column operations to set higher values in the columns, overwriting cells in rows that have lower values.

Wait, but in the earlier example, performing row operations first and then column operations gave a sum of 20.

Is there a better way?

Wait, perhaps I can perform row operations with higher values in positions that are not going to be overwritten by column operations.

For example, if I perform row operations first with higher values in positions that are not going to be operated on by column operations.

Wait, but I have to perform operations on columns as well.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the permutations for the row and column operations.

Then, for each cell, its value is determined by the last operation that set its row or column.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the value for each cell based on the last operation that affects it.

This seems too involved to manage manually for larger n.

Perhaps I need to accept that finding the exact formula for the maximum sum is too time-consuming and instead look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking back at the n=2 example, sum=7.

For n=3, sum=20.

For n=4, let's see.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 8 operations for n=4, which is within 2n=8 operations.

If I perform operations on all rows with permutation [4,3,2,1], and all columns with permutation [4,3,2,1], the matrix would have cells set to the last operation that set their row or column.

So, for example:

After row operations:

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

After column operations:

4 3 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 1 1

Sum: 4+3+2+1 + 3+3+2+1 + 2+2+2+1 +1+1+1+1 = 10 + 9 + 7 + 4 = 30.

Is this the maximum? Maybe not.

If I perform operations in a different sequence, perhaps I can get a higher sum.

But for now, let's assume it's 30.

So, for n=1:1

n=2:7

n=3:20

n=4:30

Is there a formula that fits these sums?

Let me see:

n=1:1

n=2:7

n=3:20

n=4:30

Looking at differences:

7-1=6

20-7=13

30-20=10

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to n^3 - n^2 + something.

Wait, n=1:1

n=2:7

n=3:20

n=4:30

Looking at n=1:1=1^3

n=2:7=2^3 + 3

n=3:20=3^3 + 11

n=4:30=4^3 + ?

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n.

n=1:1-1+1=1

n=2:8-4+2=6, but example is 7.

n=3:27-9+3=21, but earlier sum is 20.

n=4:64-16+4=52, but earlier sum is 30.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n + something else.

This isn't working.

Maybe I need to accept that finding a general formula is too time-consuming and instead look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can set n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n(n+1)/2 to the sum.

If I perform m operations, the sum would be m * n(n+1)/2 minus the sum of overlaps.

But calculating the overlaps is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each cell is set.

Each cell can be set multiple times, depending on the operations performed on its row and column.

If a cell is set by k operations, its value would be the value assigned by the last operation.

Wait, but operations are permutations, so the values are from 1 to n.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the maximum sum is achieved when as many cells as possible are set to n, the next highest number are set to n-1, and so on.

But given that operations are permutations, it's not straightforward to arrange that.

Perhaps I need to accept that finding an exact formula is difficult and instead look for a pattern based on the example.

In the n=2 example, sum=7.

Looking at how it's achieved:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum=7.

Wait, but if I perform operations in a different sequence, I can get a higher sum.

For example:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 2 with [1,2]

Matrix:

1 1

1 2

Sum=5, which is worse.

So, the sequence matters.

Wait, perhaps in the provided example, they chose to set column 1 last to maximize the sum.

Wait, but in their operations, they set row 1, row 2, then column 1.

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum=7.

If they had set column 2 instead of column 1 last, they would get sum=5, which is worse.

So, perhaps setting column 1 with higher values in row operations first, and then overwriting column 1 with higher values.

Wait, but in this case, column 1 is set to
