Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this magical girl named Nene who has an n by n matrix filled with zeros. She can perform two types of operations on this matrix:

1. Type 1: Choose a row i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, then set the elements of that row to the permutation p.

2. Type 2: Choose a column i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, then set the elements of that column to the permutation p.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing some operations, and we need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. In Type 1, I can choose any row and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, in Type 2, I can choose any column and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n.

Since the matrix is initially all zeros, every operation I perform will set the chosen row or column to some permutation of 1 to n, effectively overriding any previous values in that row or column.

I need to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix. To do that, I should aim to have as high numbers as possible in as many positions as possible.

Let me think about how these operations interact with each other. If I perform a Type 1 operation on a row, it sets all elements in that row to the chosen permutation. If later I perform a Type 2 operation on a column that intersects with that row, the Type 2 operation will override the value in that intersection.

So, the order in which I perform operations matters because later operations can override earlier ones.

I need to find a sequence of operations that maximizes the sum without using more than 2n operations.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum if I could set every element to n. That would be n * n * n = n^3. But I need to see if that's achievable with the given operations.

Wait, but each operation sets a whole row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, meaning that in any row or column, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, it's not possible to have all elements as n; in fact, in any row or column, the sum would be the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

But since operations can override each other, I need to think carefully about the sequence of operations.

Let me try to find a pattern or a strategy that allows me to maximize the sum.

One idea is to perform Type 1 operations on all rows, setting each row to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. Then, perform Type 2 operations on all columns, again setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But I need to see what that would achieve.

Let's consider a small n, say n=2.

Initially, matrix is:

0 0

0 0

Perform Type 1 on row 1: set it to [2,1]

Matrix becomes:

2 1

0 0

Then Type 1 on row 2: set it to [2,1]

Matrix becomes:

2 1

2 1

Then Type 2 on column 1: set it to [2,1]

Matrix becomes:

2 1

2 1

Wait, but Type 2 sets the column to [2,1], so:

In column 1, a[1,1]=2 and a[2,1]=1

So matrix is:

2 1

1 1

Then Type 2 on column 2: set it to [2,1]

So a[1,2]=2 and a[2,2]=1

Matrix becomes:

2 2

1 1

So the sum is 2+2+1+1=6

But in the example given in the problem for n=2, they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations. So my approach is not optimal.

Wait, in the example, they did:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's see what that does.

Initially:

0 0

0 0

After Operation 1: row 1 set to [1,2]

1 2

0 0

After Operation 2: row 2 set to [1,2]

1 2

1 2

After Operation 3: column 1 set to [1,2]

So a[1,1]=1 and a[2,1]=2

Matrix becomes:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7

So, with 3 operations, they achieved a sum of 7.

But in my earlier approach with 4 operations, I only got 6.

So, clearly, there's a better way.

I need to find a strategy that achieves a higher sum.

Let me try to generalize this for any n.

I need to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what is the maximum possible sum achievable.

Each operation sets a row or a column to a permutation of 1 to n.

Since operations can override each other, I need to be careful about the order.

Let me consider that each operation affects either a whole row or a whole column, and later operations can override previous ones.

I need to maximize the sum, so I should aim to set as many high values as possible, preferably the highest values in as many positions as possible.

One idea is to first set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then set all columns to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But in the n=2 case, that gave me a sum of 6, while the sample achieves 7 with fewer operations.

So, maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Perform Type 1 operations on all rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

- Then, perform Type 2 operations on the first n-1 columns, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Wait, let's see for n=2:

First, set row 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Then set row 2 to [2,1]:

2 1

2 1

Then set column 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 2+1+1+1=5

Hmm, worse than before.

Alternatively, set row 1 to [2,1], row 2 to [2,1], then set column 1 to [2,1], and column 2 to [2,1]:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 5, which is worse than the sample's 7.

Wait, in the sample, they did:

Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]: 1 2

Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]: 1 2

Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]: 1 2

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum: 7

So, in this case, they achieved a higher sum by choosing permutations that allow higher values in more positions.

I need to generalize this.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I perform Type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, perform Type 2 operations on selected columns to override some values.

But maybe there's a better way.

I recall that in the sample, they used Type 1 operations on rows and then a Type 2 operation on a column to adjust certain values.

Perhaps I can maximize the sum by ensuring that the highest possible values are placed in positions that are least overridden.

Wait, maybe I need to prioritize setting the main diagonal or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula to calculate the maximum sum based on n.

Let me look for a pattern.

For n=1:

Only one operation, set a[1,1]=1. Sum=1.

For n=2:

From the sample, sum=7.

For n=3:

Let's see what sum we can achieve.

If I follow the sample's approach:

Perform Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2,3]

Then Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2,3]

Then Type 1 on row 3 with [1,2,3]

Then Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2,3]

Matrix becomes:

1 2 3

2 2 3

3 2 3

Sum=1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+2+3= 1+2+3=6; 2+2+3=7; 3+2+3=8; total=21

Wait, but if I perform only 6 operations (3 Type 1 and 3 Type 2), but I need to do it in at most 6 operations.

But maybe I can do it in fewer operations.

Wait, the problem says to use at most 2n operations, so for n=3, at most 6 operations.

But perhaps I can achieve a higher sum with 6 operations.

Wait, in the n=2 case, the sample used 3 operations to achieve sum=7.

Let me calculate the sum for n=2 with 4 operations:

Type 1 on row 1: [2,1]

Type 1 on row 2: [2,1]

Type 2 on column 1: [2,1]

Type 2 on column 2: [2,1]

Matrix becomes:

2 1

1 1

Sum=5, which is less than the sample's 7 with 3 operations.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, in the sample, they did:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2] -> matrix: [1,2]; [0,0]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2] -> matrix: [1,2]; [1,2]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2] -> matrix: [1,2]; [2,2]

Sum=1+2+2+2=7

So, with 3 operations, sum=7.

If I do 4 operations:

Type 1 on row 1: [2,1] -> [2,1]; [0,0]

Type 1 on row 2: [2,1] -> [2,1]; [2,1]

Type 2 on column 1: [2,1] -> [2,1]; [1,1]

Type 2 on column 2: [2,1] -> [2,2]; [1,1]

Sum=2+2+1+1=6, which is less than 7.

So, doing more operations doesn't necessarily lead to a higher sum, and in fact, in this case, it's worse.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations leads to the maximal sum.

Wait, but the problem says that it's always possible to achieve the maximum sum in no more than 2n operations, so I need to find that.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum using at most 2n operations.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula for the sum.

Looking at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: let's see.

If I follow the sample's approach:

Perform Type 1 operations on all rows with [1,2,3]

Matrix:

1 2 3

1 2 3

1 2 3

Then perform Type 2 operations on columns with [1,2,3]

Starting with column 1: set to [1,2,3]

Matrix:

1 2 3

2 2 3

3 2 3

Sum: 1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+2+3= 6 + 7 + 8 = 21

Wait, but with 6 operations (3 Type 1 and 3 Type 2), I get sum=21.

Is that the maximum?

Is there a way to get a higher sum with at most 6 operations?

Let me see.

If I perform Type 1 operations on all rows with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then Type 2 operations on all columns with [3,2,1]

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]: a[1,1]=3, a[2,1]=2, a[3,1]=1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Then set column 2 to [3,2,1]: a[1,2]=3, a[2,2]=2, a[3,2]=1

Matrix:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 1 1

Then set column 3 to [3,2,1]: a[1,3]=3, a[2,3]=2, a[3,3]=1

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1= 9 + 6 + 3 = 18

Which is less than the previous sum of 21.

So, using [1,2,3] gives a higher sum than [3,2,1].

Wait, why is that?

In the first case, sum was 21, in the second, 18.

So, arranging lower numbers in rows and then overriding columns with higher numbers leads to a higher sum.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive, but in this specific approach, it results in a higher sum.

Let me see for n=4.

If I perform Type 1 operations on all 4 rows with [1,2,3,4]

Matrix:

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4

Then perform Type 2 operations on all 4 columns with [1,2,3,4]

Set column 1 to [1,2,3,4]: a[1,1]=1, a[2,1]=2, a[3,1]=3, a[4,1]=4

Matrix:

1 2 3 4

2 2 3 4

3 2 3 4

4 2 3 4

Set column 2 to [1,2,3,4]: a[1,2]=1, a[2,2]=2, a[3,2]=3, a[4,2]=4

Matrix:

1 1 3 4

2 2 3 4

3 3 3 4

4 4 3 4

Set column 3 to [1,2,3,4]: a[1,3]=1, a[2,3]=2, a[3,3]=3, a[4,3]=4

Matrix:

1 1 1 4

2 2 2 4

3 3 3 4

4 4 4 4

Set column 4 to [1,2,3,4]: a[1,4]=1, a[2,4]=2, a[3,4]=3, a[4,4]=4

Matrix:

1 1 1 1

2 2 2 2

3 3 3 3

4 4 4 4

Sum: 1+1+1+1 + 2+2+2+2 + 3+3+3+3 + 4+4+4+4 = 1*4 + 2*4 + 3*4 + 4*4 = 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 40

But is this the maximum?

Alternatively, if I set rows to [4,3,2,1] and columns to [4,3,2,1], what sum do I get?

First, set rows to [4,3,2,1]:

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

Then set columns to [4,3,2,1]:

Set column 1 to [4,3,2,1]: a[1,1]=4, a[2,1]=3, a[3,1]=2, a[4,1]=1

Matrix:

4 3 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 3 2 1

1 3 2 1

Set column 2 to [4,3,2,1]: a[1,2]=4, a[2,2]=3, a[3,2]=2, a[4,2]=1

Matrix:

4 4 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 2 1

Set column 3 to [4,3,2,1]: a[1,3]=4, a[2,3]=3, a[3,3]=2, a[4,3]=1

Matrix:

4 4 4 1

3 3 3 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 1 1

Set column 4 to [4,3,2,1]: a[1,4]=4, a[2,4]=3, a[3,4]=2, a[4,4]=1

Matrix:

4 4 4 4

3 3 3 3

2 2 2 2

1 1 1 1

Sum: 4+4+4+4 + 3+3+3+3 + 2+2+2+2 + 1+1+1+1 = 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40

Same sum as before.

So, in this case, both approaches give the same sum.

Wait, but for n=3, earlier, setting rows to [1,2,3] and columns to [1,2,3] gave sum=21, while setting rows to [3,2,1] and columns to [3,2,1] gave sum=18.

But for n=4, both approaches give sum=40.

Hmm, interesting.

So, perhaps for odd n, there's a difference, but for even n, it's the same.

Wait, n=2: sum=7 with sample approach, but with my approach of setting rows and columns to [1,2], I get sum=7.

Wait, in n=2, with rows [1,2] and columns [1,2], sum=7.

In n=3, with rows [1,2,3] and columns [1,2,3], sum=21, and with rows [3,2,1] and columns [3,2,1], sum=18.

So, there is a difference.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when rows and columns are set to increasing sequences rather than decreasing ones.

Let me see for n=3.

Set rows to [1,2,3]:

1 2 3

1 2 3

1 2 3

Then set columns to [1,2,3]:

Set column 1 to [1,2,3]: a[1,1]=1, a[2,1]=2, a[3,1]=3

Matrix:

1 2 3

2 2 3

3 2 3

Set column 2 to [1,2,3]: a[1,2]=1, a[2,2]=2, a[3,2]=3

Matrix:

1 1 3

2 2 3

3 3 3

Set column 3 to [1,2,3]: a[1,3]=1, a[2,3]=2, a[3,3]=3

Matrix:

1 1 1

2 2 2

3 3 3

Sum: 1+1+1 + 2+2+2 + 3+3+3 = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18

Wait, earlier I thought it was 21, but now it's 18.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no, in my earlier calculation for n=3 with rows [1,2,3] and columns [1,2,3], I mistakenly thought the sum was 21, but now it's 18.

Wait, but in n=4, it was 40 in both approaches.

So, perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sum depends on the specific sequence of operations and the interactions between row and column operations.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a general formula for the sum.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=18

n=4: sum=40

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

For n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: 18

n=4: 40

Let me compute the differences:

7 - 1 = 6

18 - 7 = 11

40 - 18 = 22

Now, differences are 6, 11, 22

Looking at second differences:

11 - 6 = 5

22 - 11 = 11

Not a constant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cubic function or something.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula based on n.

Looking at the sample output for n=2: sum=7

For n=2, sum=7

Similarly, for n=1: sum=1

For n=3: sum=18

For n=4: sum=40

Let me see if I can find a general formula.

Looking at the sequence: 1, 7, 18, 40

Let me see if it matches n^3 - n^2 + something.

Wait, n=2: 8 - 4 = 4, but sum=7, doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the sum of the first n numbers.

Wait, sum of first n numbers is n(n+1)/2.

But for n=2: 3, sum=7, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n*(n+1)*(something).

Wait, in the code provided, it's n*(n+1)*(4n-1)/6

Let me compute that for n=2: 2*3*7/6=42/6=7, matches.

For n=3: 3*4*11/6=132/6=22, but earlier I thought sum=18, but according to this, it's 22.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, in my earlier calculation for n=3, setting rows to [1,2,3] and columns to [1,2,3], I got sum=18, but according to the formula, it's 22.

So, perhaps there's a better way to achieve sum=22 for n=3.

Let me try to find a sequence of operations that achieves sum=22 for n=3.

Let's try:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

0 0 0

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=9+6+3=18

Same as before.

Wait, how to achieve sum=22?

Maybe I need to choose different permutations.

Let me try setting rows to [1,2,3] and columns to [3,2,1]

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2,3]

Matrix:

1 2 3

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=9+6+3=18

Still 18.

Wait, maybe I need to perform operations in a different order or choose different permutations.

Let me try setting rows to [3,2,1] and columns to [1,2,3]

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Sum: 1+1+1 + 2+2+2 + 3+3+3=3+6+9=18

Still the same sum.

Is there a way to get sum=22?

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I perform Type 1 operations on the first n-1 rows with [n,n-1,...,1], and Type 2 operations on all columns with [n,n-1,...,1].

For n=3:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=9+6+3=18

Same as before.

Wait, maybe I need to skip setting some rows and rely more on column operations.

Let me try performing Type 1 operations on only the first row with [3,2,1], and Type 2 operations on all columns with [3,2,1].

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=9+6+3=18

Still the same.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Looking back at the formula in the code: n*(n+1)*(4n-1)/6

For n=3: 3*4*11/6=132/6=22

But I can't see how to achieve sum=22 with at most 6 operations.

Wait, maybe I need to perform operations in a different sequence.

Let me try performing Type 2 operations first.

Operation 1: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Sum: 3+2+1 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=6 + 6 + 3=15

Worse than before.

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1=9 + 7 + 6=22

Ah, there we go. Sum=22.

So, with a better sequence of operations, I can achieve the sum predicted by the formula.

Let me generalize this approach.

For n=3:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix after all operations:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum=22

So, the pattern is:

- For each row from 1 to n, perform Type 1 operation with [n,n-1,...,1]

- For each column from 1 to n, perform Type 2 operation with [n,n-1,...,1]

But interleaved in a specific order.

Wait, in this sequence, for each row i, do Type 1 on row i, then Type 2 on column i.

So, for row 1: Type 1 on row 1, then Type 2 on column 1

For row 2: Type 1 on row 2, then Type 2 on column 2

And so on.

This way, each row is set first, then the corresponding column is set, affecting only one element in the matrix.

In the n=3 example, this leads to:

After Type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1]; [0,0,0]; [0,0,0]

After Type 2 on column 1: [3,_,_]; [2,_,_]; [1,_,_]

After Type 1 on row 2: [3,2,1]; [3,2,1]; [1,_,_]

After Type 2 on column 2: [3,3,_]; [3,2,_]; [1,2,_]

After Type 1 on row 3: [3,3,_]; [3,2,_]; [3,2,1]

After Type 2 on column 3: [3,3,3]; [3,2,2]; [3,2,1]

Sum=22

Yes, that works.

So, generalizing this, for any n, perform Type 1 operations on rows 1 to n, each with [n,n-1,...,1], and then perform Type 2 operations on columns 1 to n, each with [n,n-1,...,1], in an interleaved manner.

This would use 2n operations, which is within the limit.

Now, let's see what the provided code does.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

So, it prints the sum as n*(n+1)*(4n-1)/6 and the number of operations as 2n.

Then, for each row i from 1 to n:

- Perform Type 1 operation on row i with permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]

- Perform Type 2 operation on column i with permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]

Wait, but in my earlier example for n=3, I performed Type 1 on row 1, then Type 2 on column 1, then Type 1 on row 2, then Type 2 on column 2, and so on.

But in the code, it's doing Type 1 on row i with [n,n-1,...,1], then Type 2 on column i with [n,n-1,...,1], for each i from 1 to n.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation for n=3, I did:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

And achieved sum=22.

According to the formula: 3*4*11/6=22

So, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's performing Type 1 on row i with [n,n-1,...,1], then Type 2 on column i with [n,n-1,...,1], for each i from 1 to n.

But in my manual calculation, I did Type 1 on row 1, then Type 2 on column 1, then Type 1 on row 2, then Type 2 on column 2, and so on.

And it worked.

So, the code seems correct.

But in the earlier confusion for n=3, when I set all rows first and then all columns, I got sum=18, but with the interleaved approach, I got sum=22.

So, the order of operations matters.

Hence, the code's approach of alternating Type 1 and Type 2 operations for each row and column seems to be working.

Therefore, the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
