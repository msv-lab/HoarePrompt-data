Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower using a specific set of moves. Each move, he can either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. We need to figure out if, after a certain number of moves, the tower can have exactly m cubes.

First, let's understand the initial state. The tower starts with no cubes. So, we have zero cubes initially.

Now, each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube. Importantly, removing a cube can only be done if there is at least one cube on the tower. So, we can't remove a cube if the tower is empty.

The problem gives us two numbers for each test case: n, which is the number of moves, and m, which is the desired number of cubes in the tower at the end of these moves.

Our task is to determine whether it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower after exactly n moves.

Let's think about this step by step.

First, consider that each move either increases the number of cubes by one or decreases it by one. So, the total number of cubes in the tower after n moves will be the initial number (which is zero) plus the net effect of all the moves.

If we let x be the number of times we add a cube, and y be the number of times we remove a cube, then we have:

x + y = n (total moves)

and

x - y = m (since each add increases the count by one and each remove decreases it by one)

We can solve these two equations to find x and y.

From the first equation: x = n - y

Plugging into the second equation:

(n - y) - y = m

n - 2y = m

Then:

2y = n - m

y = (n - m)/2

Similarly, x = n - y = n - (n - m)/2 = (2n - n + m)/2 = (n + m)/2

So, for x and y to be integers (since we can't have fractional moves), both (n - m) must be even, and both x and y must be non-negative.

Wait, but y also can't be greater than the number of cubes available at any point. Because you can't remove a cube that doesn't exist.

So, we need to ensure that at no point does the number of removes exceed the number of adds up to that point.

This sounds like it could be modeled as a walk where we can go up or down by one unit at each step, starting from zero, and we want to end at m after n steps.

This is similar to the concept of Dyck paths or balanced parentheses, but I think for this problem, we can simplify it by just considering the parity and the constraints on x and y.

Given that, let's look at the conditions:

1. x and y must be integers.

2. x >= y (because you can't remove more cubes than you have added).

Wait, actually, x - y = m, and x + y = n.

From y = (n - m)/2, and x = (n + m)/2.

So, for y to be an integer, (n - m) must be even.

Similarly, for x to be an integer, (n + m) must be even.

Also, x and y must be non-negative integers.

So, the conditions are:

- (n - m) is even

- (n + m) is even

- x = (n + m)/2 >= 0

- y = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Wait, but m can be positive or negative, but according to the problem, m is at least 1, as per the input constraints: 1 <= n, m <= 100.

Wait, m is the number of cubes in the tower, which is a non-negative integer, but in the problem statement, it's given as 1 <= m <= 100.

Similarly, n is the number of moves, 1 <= n <= 100.

So, m is at least 1, meaning the tower should have at least 1 cube at the end.

Given that, let's see.

From y = (n - m)/2, for y to be an integer, (n - m) must be even.

Similarly, x = (n + m)/2 must be an integer.

Also, since x and y represent the number of adds and removes, they must be non-negative integers.

So, the conditions are:

- (n - m) is even

- (n + m) is even

- (n + m)/2 >= 0

- (n - m)/2 >= 0

Given that m >= 1 and n >=1, let's see what this implies.

Wait, (n + m) is always even if both n and m are both even or both odd.

Similarly, (n - m) is even if both n and m are both even or both odd.

Wait, no. (n - m) is even if n and m are both even or both odd.

Similarly, (n + m) is even if n and m are both even or both odd.

So, the condition that (n - m) is even is equivalent to n and m having the same parity (both even or both odd).

Similarly, (n + m) is even only if both are even or both are odd.

So, the condition reduces to n and m having the same parity.

Additionally, we need to ensure that x and y are non-negative.

Given that x = (n + m)/2 >= 0, which should always be true since n and m are positive.

Similarly, y = (n - m)/2 >= 0, which implies that n >= m.

So, another condition is that n >= m.

Wait, but in the problem, m can be less than n.

Wait, but if n < m, then y would be negative, which is not allowed.

So, n must be at least m.

But in the sample input, there's a case where n=3, m=3, which satisfies n >= m and n and m have the same parity.

Another case is n=2, m=4, which would require y = (2-4)/2 = -1, which is invalid, so "No".

And n=5, m=3, which has n > m and both odd, so y = (5-3)/2 = 1, x = (5+3)/2 = 4, which is valid, so "Yes".

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "Yes", "No", "Yes", corresponding to the three test cases.

Wait, but according to my reasoning, for n=3, m=3: n==m and both odd, so y=0, x=3, which is valid.

n=2, m=4: n=2, m=4, both even, but n < m, so y negative, invalid.

n=5, m=3: n > m, both odd, y=1, x=4, valid.

So, my conditions seem to match the sample outputs.

Therefore, the general condition is:

- n >= m

- n and m have the same parity (both even or both odd)

If these two conditions are satisfied, then it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif b % 2 == c % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, it reads the number of test cases, a.

Then, for each test case, it reads b (n) and c (m).

Then, it checks:

- if b == c: print 'YES'

- elif b < c: print 'NO'

- elif b % 2 == c % 2: print 'Yes'

- else: print 'No'

Comparing this to our conditions:

- If b == c: it prints 'YES'

- If b < c: it prints 'NO'

- If b > c and b and c have the same parity: print 'Yes'

- Else: print 'No'

This aligns with our earlier reasoning.

However, in the sample input and output, the outputs are "Yes", "No", "Yes".

But in the code, for b == c, it prints 'YES', which matches the first test case.

For b < c, it prints 'NO', which matches the second test case.

For b > c and b and c have the same parity, it prints 'Yes', which matches the third test case.

So, it seems correct.

But, I need to be thorough.

Let's consider some edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n=1, m=1

Here, n == m and both are odd.

So, y = (1-1)/2 = 0, x = (1+1)/2 = 1.

Valid. So, "Yes".

Edge Case 2: n=1, m=2

n < m, so "No".

Edge Case 3: n=2, m=0

But m is at least 1, according to the problem.

Wait, m is from 1 to 100, as per the problem.

Edge Case 4: n=4, m=2

n > m, both even, so y = (4-2)/2 = 1, x=3.

Valid.

Edge Case 5: n=3, m=2

n=3, m=2, both odd and even respectively, so different parity.

According to the code, since b > c and b % 2 != c % 2, it should print 'No'.

Which is correct, because to have m=2 with n=3 moves is impossible.

Another Edge Case: n=4, m=4

n == m, both even, y=0, x=4.

Valid.

Another Edge Case: n=5, m=1

n > m, both odd, y=2, x=3.

Valid.

Another Edge Case: n=6, m=2

n > m, both even, y=2, x=4.

Valid.

Another Edge Case: n=3, m=1

n > m, both odd, y=1, x=2.

Valid.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the code, for b == c, it prints 'YES', while in other cases, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'.

But according to the problem, "Yes" and "No" can be in any case.

So, it's acceptable.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after performing exactly `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding one cube to the top of the tower or removing one cube from the top.

## Approach

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with zero cubes.
2. **Moves**:
   - Adding a cube increases the tower's height by one.
   - Removing a cube decreases the tower's height by one, but cannot be done if the tower is empty.
3. **Conditions for Feasibility**:
   - The total number of cubes `m` must be achievable within `n` moves.
   - The operations must maintain a non-negative number of cubes at all times.

4. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Let `x` be the number of addition moves.
   - Let `y` be the number of removal moves.
   - We have two equations:
     - `x + y = n` (total moves)
     - `x - y = m` (net addition)
   - Solving these equations:
     - `x = (n + m)/2`
     - `y = (n - m)/2`
   - For `x` and `y` to be integers and non-negative, the following must hold:
     - `(n + m)` is even.
     - `(n - m)` is even.
     - `n >= m`
     - `n - m` is non-negative.

5. **Simplified Conditions**:
   - `n` and `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).
   - `n >= m`

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# To run the function, uncomment the following line
# func()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
- **Conditions**:
  - If `n` equals `m`, it's always possible by only adding cubes.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n` is greater than `m`, check if `n` and `m` have the same parity:
    - If they do, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes with a combination of addition and removal moves.
    - If they don't, it's impossible.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it's possible to achieve the desired tower height with the given constraints.
