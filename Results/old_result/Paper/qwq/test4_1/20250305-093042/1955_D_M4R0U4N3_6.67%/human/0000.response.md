Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But wait, it says "match the elements of array b," which might imply that the values are the same, not necessarily their positions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding. In the first test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 2

a = [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4]

We need to consider all subsegments of a of length 4:

- [4,1,2,3]: After rearranging, we can have [1,2,3,4], which matches b entirely, so it's good.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above, it's good.

- [2,3,4,5]: Rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has three elements matching b (2,3,4), which is more than k=2, so it's good.

- [3,4,5,6]: Rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has two elements matching b (3,4), which is equal to k=2, so it's good.

- [4,5,6]: But wait, m=4 and n=7, so only subsegments of length 4 are considered. So, there are only four subsegments: positions 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, and 4-7.

All four are good, so the output is 4, which matches the first output in the example.

In the second test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 3

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Now, we need at least 3 matches in each subsegment of length 4.

- [4,1,2,3]: Rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which has 4 matches, which is more than k=3, so it's good.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above, 4 matches, good.

- [2,3,4,5]: Has 3 matches (2,3,4), which is equal to k=3, so it's good.

- [3,4,5,6]: Has 2 matches (3,4), which is less than k=3, so it's not good.

So, only 3 subsegments are good, which matches the second output in the example.

Third test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 4

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Now, we need all 4 elements in the subsegment to match b after rearrangement.

- [4,1,2,3]: Rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b entirely, so it's good.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above, good.

- [2,3,4,5]: Rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has only 3 matches (2,3,4), less than k=4, so not good.

- [3,4,5,6]: Has 2 matches, less than k=4, not good.

So, only 2 good subsegments, matching the third output.

Fourth test case:

n = 11, m = 5, k = 3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

We need at least 3 matches in each subsegment of length 5.

Let's list the subsegments:

- [9,9,2,2,10]: Matches 9,9,10 (assuming duplicates are considered separately), so 3 matches (9,9,10). But b has only one 9, so maybe we need to consider the frequency of elements in b. Wait, the problem says elements of b are not necessarily unique, so we need to consider the frequency.

This complicates things. If b has multiple instances of a number, do we need to match those frequencies in the subsegment?

Looking back at the problem, it says "at least k of them match the elements of array b." It doesn't specify whether the matches need to respect the frequency of elements in b. It seems like it's just about having at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their counts, as long as they exist in b.

In that case, for the fourth test case:

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

Unique elements in b: 6,7,8,9,10

So, any subsegment of a that contains at least 3 of these elements counts as good.

Let's check the subsegments:

- [9,9,2,2,10]: Contains 9,9,10. So, 9 and 10 are in b, and 2 is not. So, at least 2 matches. But wait, there are two 9's, but b has only one 9. Does that mean we can only count one 9? If matches don't need to respect the frequency, then we have at least two matches (9 and 10), which is less than k=3. But according to the output, it's considered good. Hmm.

Wait, maybe matches are considered without frequency constraints, meaning if an element is in b, even if it appears more times in the subsegment, it's still considered as matching once.

So, in [9,9,2,10], 9 is in b, 10 is in b, 2 is not. So, only two matches, which is less than k=3. But the output says there are 4 good subsegments, so maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps matches are considered with frequency. That is, if b has one 9, then only one 9 in the subsegment matches, and the extra 9 doesn't count towards the matches.

In that case:

- [9,9,2,2,10]: one 9 matches, one 10 matches, total two matches, which is less than k=3.

But the output is 4, which means it's considered good, so maybe matches do consider frequency.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

I think "match" here means that at least k elements from c, after rearrangement, are equal to k elements from b.

Given that b can have duplicates, we need to consider the frequency of elements in b.

Wait, perhaps it's about having at least k elements in c that are also in b, considering the frequency in b.

But in the first test case, b is [1,2,3,4], all unique, so it's straightforward.

In the fourth test case, b is [6,9,7,8,10], all unique, so matches should be simply the number of elements in c that are in b.

But according to the output, it's 4, which suggests that some subsegments are considered good even if they have only two matches.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the subsegments.

Let's list all subsegments of length 5:

1. [9,9,2,2,10]

2. [9,2,2,10,9]

3. [2,2,10,9,7]

4. [2,10,9,7,6]

5. [10,9,7,6,3]

6. [9,7,6,3,6]

7. [7,6,3,6,3]

Now, let's check how many elements in each subsegment are present in b:

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

- Subsegment 1: [9,9,2,2,10] → 9,9,10 → at least two matches. Output says 4 good subsegments, so maybe it's considered good, which suggests that it's counting frequency.

- Subsegment 2: [9,2,2,10,9] → 9,9,10 → two matches.

- Subsegment 3: [2,2,10,9,7] → 10,9,7 → three matches, which is >= k=3, good.

- Subsegment 4: [2,10,9,7,6] → 10,9,7,6 → four matches, good.

- Subsegment 5: [10,9,7,6,3] → 10,9,7,6 → four matches, good.

- Subsegment 6: [9,7,6,3,6] → 9,7,6,6 → three matches, good.

- Subsegment 7: [7,6,3,6,3] → 7,6,6 → two matches, which is less than k=3, not good.

So, subsegments 3,4,5,6 are good, total 4, which matches the output.

Wait, but in subsegment 1 and 2, they have two matches, which is less than k=3, so they should not be considered good. But according to the earlier reasoning, the output is 4, which corresponds to subsegments 3,4,5,6.

So, perhaps there was a mistake in assuming subsegments 1 and 2 are considered good. Actually, they should not be, given k=3.

Hence, the output is correct, and my initial confusion was due to miscounting.

Moving on to the fifth test case:

n = 4, m = 1, k = 1

a = [4,1,5,6]

b = [6]

We need subsegments of length 1 from a that match at least one element in b.

Possible subsegments:

- [4]: 4 is not in b, so not good.

- [1]: 1 is not in b, so not good.

- [5]: 5 is not in b, so not good.

- [6]: 6 is in b, so good.

So, only one good subsegment, which matches the last output.

Alright, now I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4 (number of test cases)

- 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2*10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

- Sum of m over all test cases <= 2*10^5

Given these constraints, I need an efficient way to process each test case quickly, preferably in O(n) or O(m) time per test case.

My initial thought is to use a sliding window approach over array a with window size m, and for each window, check if it has at least k elements that are present in b.

But since n and m can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need to make sure that the overall time complexity is acceptable.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is <= 2*10^5, same for m, so overall time should be O(2*10^5), which is acceptable.

Now, to implement the sliding window, I need a way to efficiently count how many elements in the current window are present in b.

One way is to precompute a frequency map for b, and then as I slide the window, keep a frequency map for the current window, and count how many elements in the window are in b.

But since elements can be duplicated in both a and b, I need to handle frequencies carefully.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that duplicates in a beyond what's in b don't count extra towards k.

In other words, if b has one instance of a number, and a has multiple, only one match is counted.

Wait, but in the first test case, b is [1,2,3,4], all unique, and in a, there are duplicates like two 4's, but matches are considered without frequency constraints.

Wait, in the second test case, b is [1,2,3,4], and in a, there are duplicates, but matches are still considered without frequency constraints.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, b is [6,9,7,8,10], all unique, and in a, there are duplicates like two 9's, but matches are considered without frequency constraints.

So, it seems that matches are frequency-independent, meaning that an element in a matches an element in b if their values are equal, and the number of matches is up to the frequency in b.

In other words, the number of matches is the minimum of the frequency in a and the frequency in b for each element.

But in the problem statement, it says "at least k of them match the elements of array b."

Given that b can have duplicates, I need to consider the frequency in b.

Wait, perhaps it's about having at least k elements in c that are also in b, considering the frequency in b.

In that case, I need to calculate, for each window in a, how many elements are in b with frequency at least as required by b.

Wait, but b can have duplicates, so I need to consider the frequency in b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of multisets.

Treat b as a multiset, and for each window in a, treat it as a multiset, and find the intersection size.

Then, check if this intersection size is at least k.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each window in a, compute the intersection size with b (considering frequencies), and if it's >= k, then it's a good window.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I can precompute the frequency maps.

First, compute the frequency map for b.

Then, as I slide the window over a, maintain a frequency map for the current window, and compute the intersection size.

But maintaining frequency maps for each window would be O(m) per window, which is too slow for the given constraints.

I need a faster way.

Alternative approach: Since we're dealing with sliding windows, I can use a counter for the frequency of elements in the current window.

I can initialize a counter for the first window, then as I slide the window, I can subtract the frequency of the element that's leaving the window and add the frequency of the new element entering the window.

At each step, I can update the number of matches accordingly.

To handle the frequency matching, I need to ensure that for each element in the window, the number of matches is up to the frequency in b.

So, for each element in the window that is also in b, I can add to the match count, but capped by the frequency in b.

To optimize this, I can precompute the frequency map for b, and then for each window, keep track of how many matches I have based on the frequencies.

Wait, here's an idea:

- Let freq_b be the frequency map for b.

- For the first window, count the frequency of each element in the window that is also in b, but not exceeding freq_b.

- Then, as I slide the window, when I remove an element, if it was matching b, decrease the match count accordingly.

- When I add a new element, if it matches b and the frequency in the window is less than or equal to freq_b, increase the match count.

This way, I can maintain the match count efficiently as I slide the window.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- freq_b: frequency map for b.

- Initialize a frequency map for the first window in a.

- For each element in the first window that is in b, and whose frequency in the window is less than or equal to freq_b, add to the match count.

- If match count >= k, increment the answer.

Then, for each new window:

- Remove the element that's leaving the window:

- If it was matching b, decrease the match count accordingly.

- Add the new element entering the window:

- If it matches b, increase the match count accordingly.

- If match count >= k, increment the answer.

But I need to handle the frequencies carefully.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first test case:

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

k = 2

m = 4

n = 7

freq_b: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1

First window: [4,1,2,3]

freq_window: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1

Matches: min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) for x in freq_window and x in freq_b

So, matches = 1+1+1+1 = 4, which is >=2, so good.

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

freq_window: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1

Matches = 4 >=2, good.

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

freq_window: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1

Matches = 1+1+1 = 3 >=2, good.

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

freq_window: 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1

Matches = 1+1 = 2 >=2, good.

Total: 4, which matches the first output.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b=[1,2,3,4]

freq_b: 1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1

First window: [4,1,2,3] => matches=4 >=3, good.

Second window: [1,2,3,4] => matches=4 >=3, good.

Third window: [2,3,4,5] => matches=3 >=3, good.

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6] => matches=2 <3, not good.

Total: 3, matches the second output.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b=[1,2,3,4]

freq_b:1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1

Windows:

[4,1,2,3]: matches=4 >=4, good.

[1,2,3,4]: matches=4 >=4, good.

[2,3,4,5]: matches=3 <4, not good.

[3,4,5,6]: matches=2 <4, not good.

Total: 2, matches the third output.

Fourth test case:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a=[9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b=[6,9,7,8,10]

freq_b:6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1

Windows:

[9,9,2,2,10]: matches=2 (9 and 10), <3, not good.

[9,2,2,10,9]: matches=2 (9 and 10), <3, not good.

[2,2,10,9,7]: matches=3 (10,9,7), >=3, good.

[2,10,9,7,6]: matches=4 (10,9,7,6), >=3, good.

[10,9,7,6,3]: matches=4 (10,9,7,6), >=3, good.

[9,7,6,3,6]: matches=3 (9,7,6), >=3, good.

[7,6,3,6,3]: matches=2 (7,6), <3, not good.

Total: 4, matches the fourth output.

Fifth test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a=[4,1,5,6]

b=[6]

freq_b:6:1

Windows:

[4]: matches=0 <1, not good.

[1]: matches=0 <1, not good.

[5]: matches=0 <1, not good.

[6]: matches=1 >=1, good.

Total:1, matches the fifth output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Precompute freq_b.

- Initialize a frequency map for the first window.

- Compute the initial match count.

- Then, for each new window:

- Remove the element that's leaving the window:

- If it was matching b, decrease the match count.

- Add the new element entering the window:

- If it matches b, increase the match count.

- If match count >=k, increment the answer.

I need to handle the frequency constraints correctly.

Specifically, when adding a new element, if its frequency in the window is less than or equal to freq_b, then it matches.

When removing an element, if its frequency in the window after removal is still less than or equal to freq_b, then the match count remains the same; otherwise, it decreases.

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep track of the match count based on the minimum of freq_window and freq_b for each element.

Let me think about it.

Define match_count = sum( min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) ) for all x in freq_window.

Initially, compute match_count for the first window.

Then, when sliding the window:

- Remove the element a[l-1]:

- If a[l-1] is in b:

- If freq_window[a[l-1]] > freq_b[a[l-1]], then match_count remains the same.

- Else, match_count decreases by 1.

- Add the element a[l+m-1]:

- If a[l+m-1] is in b:

- If freq_window[a[l+m-1]] < freq_b[a[l+m-1]], then match_count increases by 1.

- Else, match_count remains the same.

Wait, this might work.

Let me try with an example.

Take the fourth test case:

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

freq_b:6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1

First window: [9,9,2,2,10]

freq_window:9:2,2:2,10:1

matches:

- 9: min(2,1) =1

- 10: min(1,1)=1

- Total matches=2

Which is less than k=3, not good.

Then, slide to [9,2,2,10,9]

freq_window:9:2,2:2,10:1

matches:

- 9: min(2,1)=1

- 10: min(1,1)=1

- Total matches=2 <3, not good.

Next, [2,2,10,9,7]

freq_window:2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1

matches:

- 9:1

- 10:1

- 7:1

- Total matches=3 >=3, good.

And so on.

Now, implementing the sliding window:

Initialize freq_window for the first window.

Compute match_count.

Then, for each new window:

- Remove a[l-1]:

- If a[l-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l-1]] > freq_b[a[l-1]], then match_count -=1

- freq_window[a[l-1]] -=1

- Add a[l+m-1]:

- If a[l+m-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l+m-1]] < freq_b[a[l+m-1]], then match_count +=1

- freq_window[a[l+m-1]] +=1

- If match_count >=k, ans +=1

Wait, but in the first window, for a[l-1]=9, freq_window[9]=2, freq_b[9]=1, so match_count -=1, match_count=2-1=1

Then add a[l+m-1]=7, freq_window[7]=0 < freq_b[7]=1, so match_count +=1, match_count=1+1=2

Which should be 3, but according to previous calculation, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Wait, perhaps when adding a new element, if freq_window[a[new]] < freq_b[a[new]], then match_count +=1

And when removing an element, if freq_window[a[old]] <= freq_b[a[old]], then match_count -=1

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the change in the minimum.

Let me think differently.

Define match_count = sum for each x in freq_b of min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x])

When removing an element a[l-1]:

- If a[l-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l-1]] > freq_b[a[l-1]], then match_count remains the same.

- Else, match_count -=1

When adding an element a[l+m-1]:

- If a[l+m-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l+m-1]] < freq_b[a[l+m-1]], then match_count +=1

- Else, match_count remains the same.

This seems correct.

Let's try with the fourth test case.

First window: [9,9,2,2,10]

freq_window:9:2,2:2,10:1

matches: min(2,1)+min(1,1)=1+1=2

Second window: [9,2,2,10,9]

Remove 9: freq_window[9]=2 > freq_b[9]=1, so match_count remains 2

Add 9: freq_window[9]=2 > freq_b[9]=1, so match_count remains 2

Wait, but according to earlier calculation, match_count should still be 2, but in reality, it's still 2.

Wait, but in the earlier manual count, it was 2 matches for this window, which is less than k=3.

Wait, but according to the earlier manual count, the third window should have 3 matches.

Wait, perhaps my manual count was wrong.

Wait, no, in the third window [2,2,10,9,7], matches are 10,9,7, which is 3.

But according to this logic:

Starting from second window: match_count=2

Remove 9: freq_window[9]=2 > freq_b[9]=1, so match_count remains 2

Add 7: freq_window[7]=0 < freq_b[7]=1, so match_count +=1, now match_count=3 >=3, good.

Which matches the manual count.

So, it's correct.

Hence, this approach should work.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read array a of size n

- Read array b of size m

- Compute freq_b as a Counter of b

- Initialize freq_window as a Counter of the first window a[0:m]

- Compute initial match_count as sum of min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) for all x in freq_window.

- If match_count >=k, ans +=1

- Then, for each new window from l=1 to l<=n-m:

- Remove a[l-1]:

- If a[l-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l-1]] > freq_b[a[l-1]], then match_count -=1

- freq_window[a[l-1]] -=1

- Add a[l+m-1]:

- If a[l+m-1] in b:

- If freq_window[a[l+m-1]] < freq_b[a[l+m-1]], then match_count +=1

- freq_window[a[l+m-1]] +=1

- If match_count >=k, ans +=1

- Finally, print ans

I need to make sure that I handle the frequencies correctly.

Also, since m <= n and sum of n over all test cases <=2*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

Now, looking at the given code:

from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

todo = set(map(int, input().split()))

done = set()

extra = set()

for j in range(m):

if a[j] in todo:

todo.remove(a[j])

done.add(a[j])

else:

extra.add(a[j])

ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0

for r in range(m, n):

old = a[r - m]

if old in extra:

extra.remove(old)

elif old in done:

done.remove(old)

todo.add(old)

if a[r] in todo:

todo.remove(a[r])

done.add(a[r])

else:

extra.add(a[r])

if len(done) >= k:

ans += 1

print(ans)



This code uses sets to track which elements are "done" and "extra."

In the initial window, it classifies elements as "done" if they are in b, and "extra" otherwise.

Then, for each new window, it removes the outgoing element:

- If it was in extra, just remove it.

- If it was in done, remove it from done and add it back to todo.

Then, adds the incoming element:

- If it's in todo, move it from todo to done.

- Else, add it to extra.

Finally, checks if the number of done elements is >=k.

However, this approach might not correctly handle the frequencies.

In particular, using sets doesn't account for the frequency of elements.

For example, in the fourth test case, b has only one 9, but a has multiple 9's.

If I use sets, I might overcount the matches.

Wait, in the code, "todo" is a set of elements from b that still need to be matched.

"done" is a set of elements from a that have been matched to elements in b.

"extra" is a set of elements from a that are not in b.

When sliding the window, it removes the outgoing element:

- If it's in extra, just remove it.

- If it's in done, remove it from done and add it back to todo, because it was matching an element in b, and now it's removed.

Then, adds the incoming element:

- If it's in todo, meaning it's in b and needed to be matched, move it from todo to done.

- Else, add it to extra.

Finally, checks if the number of done elements is >=k.

This seems similar to the earlier approach of tracking which elements are matched.

But since it uses sets, it doesn't consider frequencies, which might be acceptable if matches are frequency-independent.

However, in the problem, matches are frequency-dependent because b can have duplicates.

But in the given code, "todo" is a set, which doesn't preserve frequencies.

Hence, this code might not handle cases where b has multiple instances of the same element correctly.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "elements of array b are not necessarily unique," but in the code, "todo" is a set, which doesn't preserve duplicates.

This might be a problem.

Looking back at the example where b has duplicates, but in the test cases provided, b doesn't have duplicates.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "elements of array b are not necessarily unique," but in the examples, b has unique elements.

In the fourth test case, b = [6,9,7,8,10], all unique.

So, perhaps in the problem, b doesn't have duplicates, or the duplicates don't matter because matches are frequency-independent.

But according to the problem statement, b can have duplicates, so the code might be incorrect in handling duplicates in b.

However, in the given code, "todo" is a set, which doesn't handle frequencies.

Hence, the code might be incorrect if b has duplicates.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, it's mentioned that elements of b are not necessarily unique, so b can have duplicates.

Hence, the given code is incorrect because it uses a set for b, which doesn't preserve frequencies.

To handle b with duplicates correctly, I need to use a frequency map for b, and track frequencies in the sliding window.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many subarrays of length `m` in array `a` can be rearranged such that at least `k` of their elements match those in array `b`. This requires handling frequencies of elements correctly, especially since both `a` and `b` can contain duplicate elements.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Mapping**: Use frequency maps to track the occurrences of elements in `b` and the current window of `a`.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Maintain a sliding window of size `m` over `a`, and efficiently update the count of matching elements as the window moves.
3. **Match Counting**: For each window, calculate the number of matching elements by considering the minimum frequency of each element in both the window and `b`.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def count_good_subarrays():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        freq_b = Counter(b)
        freq_window = Counter(a[:m])
        
        match_count = sum(min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) for x in freq_window)
        
        ans = 1 if match_count >= k else 0
        
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            new = a[r]
            
            if old in freq_b:
                if freq_window[old] <= freq_b[old]:
                    match_count -= 1
                freq_window[old] -= 1
            
            if new in freq_b:
                freq_window[new] += 1
                if freq_window[new] <= freq_b[new]:
                    match_count += 1
            
            ans += 1 if match_count >= k else 0
        
        print(ans)

count_good_subarrays()
```

### Explanation
1. **Frequency Mapping**:
   - `freq_b` is a frequency map of array `b`.
   - `freq_window` is a frequency map of the current window of size `m` in array `a`.

2. **Initial Match Count**:
   - For the first window, calculate the match count by summing the minimum frequencies of common elements between the window and `b`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - As the window slides, update the frequency map by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element.
   - Adjust the match count based on the changes in frequencies:
     - When removing an element, if its frequency in the window was equal to or less than its frequency in `b`, decrease the match count.
     - When adding a new element, if its frequency in the window is now less than or equal to its frequency in `b`, increase the match count.

4. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - For each window, if the match count is at least `k`, increment the answer counter.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the frequency constraints and correctly count the number of good subarrays.
