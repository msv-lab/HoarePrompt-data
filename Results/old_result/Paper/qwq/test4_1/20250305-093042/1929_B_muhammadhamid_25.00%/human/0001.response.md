Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a grid of size n, there are a total of 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Wait, hold on. Actually, that seems off. Let's think carefully. For a grid of size n x n, the number of diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of diagonals going from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals is indeed 4n - 2.

Now, the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals (out of these 4n - 2) have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to minimize the number of cells colored while ensuring that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Let me consider small values of n to get an intuition.

Take n = 2.

For n = 2, the grid has 2 rows and 2 columns.

The main diagonals are:

- Cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Cells (1,2)

- Cells (2,1)

The anti-diagonals are:

- Cells (1,2) and (2,1)

- Cells (1,1)

- Cells (2,2)

Wait, actually, for n=2:

- Main diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2) and (2,2)

- Diagonal with cells (2,1)

- Anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,1) and (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,2)

So, total diagonals: 6, which matches 4*2 - 2 = 6.

Now, suppose k=3. I need to color cells such that at least 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell, and I want to do this with the fewest cells possible.

Let's see:

If I color cell (1,1), which is on two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

Similarly, cell (2,2) is on two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

Cell (1,2) is on one main and one anti-diagonal.

Cell (2,1) is on one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I color cell (1,1), I cover two diagonals.

If I color cell (2,2), I cover two different diagonals.

So, with two cells, I can cover up to four diagonals.

But wait, in n=2, there are only six diagonals.

So, for k=3, I can probably do it with two cells.

Wait, but let's check.

If I color cell (1,1) and cell (2,2), I cover four diagonals.

But k=3, so that's more than enough.

But maybe there's a way to cover three diagonals with fewer cells.

If I color only one cell, say (1,1), I cover two diagonals.

That's less than k=3.

So, I need to color at least two cells to cover three diagonals.

Similarly, if k=4, I would need two cells.

If k=5, I might need three cells.

Wait, but in n=2, total diagonals are 6.

So, for k=6, I need to cover all diagonals.

If I color two cells, say (1,1) and (2,2), I cover four diagonals.

To cover the remaining two diagonals, I need to color another cell.

For example, color cell (1,2), which covers two more diagonals.

So, total three cells cover all six diagonals.

But is there a way to cover all six diagonals with fewer cells? Let's see.

If I color cell (1,1), it covers two diagonals.

Cell (2,2), two more diagonals.

Cell (1,2), two more diagonals.

So, seems like three cells are needed to cover all six diagonals.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.

If I color cell (1,1), it covers diagonals: (1,1) and (1,1)-(2,2).

If I color cell (2,1), it covers diagonals: (2,1) and (1,1)-(2,1).

Now, which diagonals are covered?

- Diagonal (1,1): covered by (1,1)

- Diagonal (1,2)-(2,2): not covered

- Diagonal (2,1): covered by (2,1)

- Diagonal (1,2): covered by (1,1)

- Diagonal (2,2): not covered

- Diagonal (1,1)-(2,1): covered by (2,1)

So, diagonals not covered are (1,2)-(2,2) and (2,2).

So, I need to color cell (2,2) to cover (1,2)-(2,2), and possibly another cell to cover (2,2).

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe for n=2, it's better to stick with the initial approach.

Now, looking back, perhaps there's a general pattern here.

Let me consider the problem more abstractly.

Each cell lies on exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, coloring a cell covers two diagonals.

I need to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest cells.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is generally NP-hard, but perhaps there's a greedy approach or some mathematical insight that can simplify it for this specific case.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two diagonals that are not covered by any other cell.

So, in that case, the minimum number of cells needed would be ceil(k/2).

But is this always achievable?

Well, not necessarily, because there might be overlaps where some diagonals share cells.

So, perhaps in some cases, I need more cells than ceil(k/2).

But in the problem's solution, it seems that for k <= 2n, the answer is ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n, it's ceil(k/2) - floor((k - 2n)/2).

Wait, looking back at the reference solution:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

if k <= 2 * n:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

So, for k <= 2n, it's ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n, it's floor(k/2) + 1.

Wait, actually, k//2 + 1 is equivalent to ceil(k/2), but in Python, k//2 is floor division.

Wait, no, in Python, for positive integers, math.ceil(k / 2) is equivalent to (k + 1) // 2, and k // 2 is floor division.

So, in the code, for k <= 2n, it's using math.ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n, it's using k // 2 + 1, which is also ceil(k / 2).

So, effectively, it's using ceil(k / 2) in both cases.

But according to the code, for k <= 2n, it's ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n, it's ceil(k / 2).

So, why the distinction?

Wait, looking back at the code:

if k <= 2 * n:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

But as I just noted, k // 2 + 1 is equal to ceil(k / 2).

So, perhaps it's just a different way of computing ceil(k / 2) for integer k.

In Python, math.ceil(k / 2) is the same as (k + 1) // 2 for integer k.

So, perhaps the code is written this way for efficiency.

But according to this, the answer is always ceil(k / 2), regardless of n.

But that can't be right, because in the example provided, for n=3 and k=4, the answer is 2, which is ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For n=3 and k=3, the answer is 2, which is greater than ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

For n=3 and k=10, which is 4*3 - 2 = 10, the answer is 6, which is ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but according to the code, it's k // 2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6, which matches k // 2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

But for n=3 and k=9, the output is 5, which is k // 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

For n=4 and k=7, the output is 4, which is ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

For n=7 and k=11, the output is 6, which is ceil(11 / 2) = 6.

For n=2 and k=3, the output is 2, which is ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

So, it seems that the code is using ceil(k / 2) for k <= 2n, and floor(k / 2) + 1 for k > 2n.

Wait, but in Python, k // 2 + 1 is floor(k / 2) + 1.

So, for k <= 2n, it's ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, which is k > 2n (since 10 > 6), the answer is 6, which is floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9, it's floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

For n=4 and k=7, which is k <= 2n (7 <= 8), it's ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

Wait, but ceil(7 / 2) is 4?

Wait, ceil(7 / 2) is 4, yes, because 7 / 2 = 3.5, ceil(3.5) = 4.

For n=7 and k=11, which is k <= 2n (11 <= 14), ceil(11 / 2) = 6.

For n=2 and k=3, which is k <= 4, ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

So, in all these cases, the code seems to be working correctly.

But why the distinction between k <= 2n and k > 2n?

I think it has to do with the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered without overlapping in some way.

Wait, perhaps for k <= 2n, the minimum number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

But in the code, for k <= 2n, it's ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, but ceil(k / 2) is equal to floor(k / 2) + 1 for odd k, and equal to floor(k / 2) for even k.

But in the code, for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a different reasoning for k > 2n.

Let me think about the problem differently.

In the grid, there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals.

Some of these diagonals share cells.

Specifically, the main diagonals can be indexed from 1 to 2n - 1, and similarly for anti-diagonals.

But perhaps there's a way to select cells such that each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I select a cell, I cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, in total, I cover two diagonals per cell.

But I need to cover at least k diagonals.

So, intuitively, the minimum number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But in the code, for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a dependency on n.

Wait, maybe for k > 2n, some diagonals overlap in such a way that additional cells are needed.

Wait, perhaps for k > 2n, there are overlapping diagonals that force me to color more cells.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider n=3.

Total diagonals: 4*3 - 2 = 10.

If k=10, which is greater than 2*3=6, the answer is 6.

According to the code, for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1 = floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

Similarly, for k=9, it's floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

But is this the minimal number?

Looking back at the example, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6.

Is that indeed the minimal number?

Let me try to see.

In n=3, there are 10 diagonals.

If I color 6 cells, can I cover all 10 diagonals?

Well, each cell covers 2 diagonals.

So, 6 cells can cover up to 12 diagonal-cell incidences.

But there are 10 diagonals, each needing at least one colored cell.

So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two different diagonals.

So, to cover 10 diagonals, I need at least ceil(10 / 2) = 5 cells.

But in the example, it's saying 6 cells are needed.

So, perhaps there is some overlap or dependency that requires more cells.

Wait, maybe some diagonals share cells, so covering one cell might cover multiple diagonals, but in some cases, diagonals are independent.

Wait, perhaps for k > 2n, some diagonals cannot be covered simultaneously with minimal overlapping.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals.

Each cell can cover at most two diagonals.

So, the minimal number of cells needed is at least ceil(k / 2).

But in some cases, due to overlapping diagonals, I might need more cells.

Wait, but in the code, for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1, which is equal to ceil(k / 2) when k is odd, and equal to floor(k / 2) + 1 when k is even.

Wait, no, for even k, floor(k / 2) + 1 is equal to ceil(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, floor(k / 2) + 1 is equal to ceil(k / 2) when k is odd, and ceil(k / 2) when k is even.

Wait, let's take k=4.

floor(4 / 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, but ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

So, they are different.

Similarly, for k=5.

floor(5 / 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, ceil(5 / 2) = 3.

So, for even k, floor(k / 2) + 1 = ceil(k / 2) + 1, and for odd k, floor(k / 2) + 1 = ceil(k / 2).

So, in the code, for k > 2n, it's using floor(k / 2) + 1, which is equal to ceil(k / 2) when k is odd, and ceil(k / 2) + 1 when k is even.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, which is even, it's using floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6, which matches the output.

For k=9, which is odd, floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, which is equal to ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

So, in this case, it's using ceil(k / 2) when k is odd, and ceil(k / 2) + 1 when k is even for k > 2n.

But why the distinction based on k > 2n?

I think it has to do with the structure of the grid.

For k <= 2n, it's possible to cover the diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells.

For k > 2n, it requires more cells due to the overlapping structure of the diagonals in the grid.

But to confirm, let's consider n=3 and k=7.

Total diagonals are 10.

According to the code, since k=7 <= 2*3=6 is False, so it's k > 2n, so it's floor(7 / 2) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

But wait, in the example, for n=3 and k=10, it's 6, for k=9 it's 5.

Wait, but for k=7, which is less than 2n=6? Wait, n=3, 2n=6, but 7 > 6.

Wait, n=3, 2n=6.

For k=7, which is greater than 2n=6, the code outputs floor(7 / 2) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

Is that correct?

I need to think about how to cover 7 diagonals in a 3x3 grid with the fewest cells.

In a 3x3 grid, there are 2n - 1 = 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals, totaling 10 diagonals.

If I color one cell, it covers two diagonals.

Two cells can cover up to four diagonals.

Three cells can cover up to six diagonals.

Four cells can cover up to eight diagonals.

But there are only ten diagonals.

So, for k=7, which is less than or equal to ten, how many cells do I need?

If I color three cells, I can cover up to six diagonals.

But I need to cover seven diagonals.

So, I need at least four cells.

Wait, but with four cells, I can cover up to eight diagonals.

But perhaps in practice, I can cover seven diagonals with four cells.

So, the code suggests four cells for k=7, which seems plausible.

Similarly, for k=10, it's six cells.

But earlier, I thought that five cells could cover ten diagonals.

Wait, no, in n=3, with five cells, each covering two diagonals, that's ten diagonal covers.

But some diagonals might be covered multiple times, so perhaps to cover all ten unique diagonals, I need more cells.

Wait, suppose I have five cells, each covering two diagonals.

But some diagonals might be covered by multiple cells.

So, to cover ten unique diagonals, I need to ensure that each diagonal is covered at least once.

If each cell covers two unique diagonals, then five cells can cover up to ten unique diagonals.

But in reality, some diagonals share cells, so it might not be possible to have all cell-diagonal assignments be unique.

Hence, I might need more cells to cover all diagonals.

So, for k=10, it's possible that six cells are needed.

Similarly, for k=9, five cells are needed.

So, the code seems to be correct in these cases.

But I still don't fully understand why for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1, while for k <= 2n, it's ceil(k / 2).

Wait, but in Python, math.ceil(k / 2) is equivalent to (k + 1) // 2 for integer k.

And k // 2 + 1 is equal to floor(k / 2) + 1.

So, perhaps there's a mathematical justification for this distinction based on k and n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and it should always be ceil(k / 2), but in the code, it's implemented differently.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6, which is floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

If it were ceil(10 / 2), it would be 5, which is not enough.

But according to the example, it's 6.

Wait, ceil(10 / 2) is 5, but the output is 6.

Wait, no, ceil(10 / 2) is 5, but the output is 6.

So, in this case, ceil(k / 2) is not sufficient.

Hence, for k > 2n, it's floor(k / 2) + 1.

So, perhaps the correct formula is:

- If k <= 2n, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, floor(k / 2) + 1

But in the code, it's implemented as:

if k <= 2 * n:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

Which matches the above.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, it's floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9, it's floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5.

For n=4 and k=7, which is k <= 2n (7 <= 8), it's ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

For n=7 and k=11, which is k <= 14, it's ceil(11 / 2) = 6.

For n=2 and k=3, which is k <= 4, ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

So, in all these cases, the code seems to be working correctly.

Hence, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
