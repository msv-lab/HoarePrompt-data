Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They play a game where they throw a ball to each other. The ball starts with player x, and there are m throws. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction c_i, which can be '0' (clockwise), '1' (counterclockwise), or '?' (unknown direction).

I need to figure out which players could have the ball after m throws, based on the given distances and directions.

First, I need to understand the circle setup. Since they are in a circle, the concept of distance wraps around. For example, if n=6 and a player throws the ball clockwise by 2, player 1 would pass to player 3, player 2 to player 4, and so on. Similarly, counterclockwise, player 1 would pass to player 5.

The problem mentions that the circle is numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. So, moving clockwise from player i would be i + 1, and counterclockwise would be i - 1. But since it's a circle, moving clockwise from n would go back to 1, and counterclockwise from 1 would go to n.

Now, the transitions are defined as moving the ball to a neighbor, but in the problem, they can move any distance r_i, which can be from 1 to n-1.

Wait, but in the example, n=6, m=3, x=2, and r_i=2 for all throws with c_i='?'. The possible final positions are 2,4,6.

Let me think about how to model this.

I think the key is to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw.

Initially, the ball is with player x.

For each throw, depending on the direction, the ball moves r_i steps clockwise or counterclockwise.

If the direction is '?', then it could be either.

So, for each throw, I need to consider both possibilities if c_i='?', or only one if it's '0' or '1'.

I need to maintain a set of possible current positions after each throw.

Let's think about how to implement this.

I can start with a set containing only x.

Then, for each throw, I create a new set for the next positions.

For each current position, if c_i='0', I move r_i steps clockwise.

If c_i='1', I move r_i steps counterclockwise.

If c_i='?', I do both.

After all throws, the set will contain all possible positions where the ball could be.

Finally, I need to output the number of possible positions and the positions in increasing order.

I need to handle the modulo correctly because it's a circle.

Let's think about the modulo operation.

If I have n players, and I'm at position q, and I move r steps clockwise, the new position is (q + r) % n.

But wait, if n=6, and q=6, and r=2, then (6+2)%6=8%6=2, which would be player 2.

But in a circle, moving 2 steps clockwise from 6 should go to 1 and then to 2, so player 2.

Similarly, moving counterclockwise would be (q - r) % n.

For example, from 2, moving 2 counterclockwise: (2-2)%6=0, but player 0 doesn't exist; it should be player 6.

Ah, so I need to handle the modulo correctly.

In Python, 0 modulo n is 0, but in this context, player 0 should be player n.

So, after computing (q - r) % n, if it's 0, it should be n.

Similarly, (q + r) % n should be handled accordingly.

Let me confirm with an example.

Take n=6, x=2, m=3, r_i=2, c_i='?' for all throws.

Initial position: {2}

After first throw:

From 2, clockwise: (2+2)%6=4

From 2, counterclockwise: (2-2)%6=0, which is player 6

So possible positions: {4,6}

After second throw:

From 4, clockwise: (4+2)%6=0 -> 6

From 4, counterclockwise: (4-2)%6=2 -> 2

From 6, clockwise: (6+2)%6=2 -> 2

From 6, counterclockwise: (6-2)%6=4 -> 4

So possible positions: {2,4}

After third throw:

From 2, clockwise: 4, counterclockwise: 6

From 4, clockwise: 0->6, counterclockwise: 2

So possible positions: {2,4,6}

Which matches the sample output.

Great, so my approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and n*m up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

In each test case, I can iterate through m throws, and for each throw, update the possible positions.

Using sets in Python should be fine, as the total n*m is manageable.

I need to make sure that I handle the modulo correctly, mapping 0 to n.

Also, at the end, sort the possible positions in increasing order.

Let me look at the provided program to see if it matches my reasoning.

The program reads t, then for each test case, reads n, m, x, then m lines of r and c.

It maintains a set 'ans' starting with x.

For each throw, it creates a temporary set 'temp', and for each current position q in ans:

- If c is '0' or '?', add (q + r) % n to temp

- If c is '1' or '?', add (q - r) % n to temp

Then, ans becomes temp.

After all throws, if 0 is in ans, replace it with n, since player 0 doesn't exist.

Then, print the number of players in ans, and the sorted list of players.

This matches my reasoning.

I need to verify if this is correct.

Looking back at the sample input and output, it seems to match.

Another thing to consider is that n can be up to 1000, and m up to 1000, but since t is up to 10^4 and n*m is limited to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

I need to make sure that the program handles the modulo correctly.

In Python, (q - r) % n can be 0, which should correspond to player n.

So, after all throws, if 0 is in ans, it discards 0 and adds n.

That seems correct.

Also, need to ensure that the final positions are unique, which is handled by using a set.

Finally, sort the positions and print them in increasing order.

I think this should work.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='0'

Clockwise from 1 by 1: (1+1)%2=0, which is player 2

Counterclockwise from 1 by 1: (1-1)%2=0, which is player 2

So, ans={2}

Edge Case 2: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='1'

Only counterclockwise: (1-1)%2=0, which is player 2

So, ans={2}

Edge Case 3: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='?'

Both directions: {2}

Edge Case 4: n=3, m=2, x=1, throws: (1,'0'), (1,'0')

First throw: (1+1)%3=2

Second throw: (2+1)%3=0 -> 3

So, ans={3}

Edge Case 5: n=3, m=2, x=1, throws: (1,'?'), (1,'?')

First throw: (1+1)%3=2 and (1-1)%3=0->3

Second throw:

From 2: (2+1)%3=0->3, (2-1)%3=1

From 3: (3+1)%3=1, (3-1)%3=2

So, ans={1,2,3}

Seems correct.

Another thing to consider is that if r_i is such that r_i is a multiple of n, then moving r_i steps clockwise or counterclockwise brings back to the same player.

But since r_i is from 1 to n-1, r_i being a multiple of n doesn't occur.

Wait, n is at least 2, r_i is from 1 to n-1, so r_i is less than n, so r_i cannot be a multiple of n.

Hence, no need to worry about that.

Also, need to make sure that the program reads inputs correctly.

The program uses func_1() to read a line, func_2() to read an integer, and func_3() to read a list of integers.

It reads t, then for each test case, reads n, m, x, then m lines of r and c.

It processes each throw and updates the set of possible positions.

Finally, it handles the case where 0 is in the set, replaces it with n, and prints the sorted list.

I think this should work correctly for all test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
