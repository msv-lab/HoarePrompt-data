Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the i-th character of t.

2. If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of t.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there should be at least one position where the condition fails.

My task is to determine, for each test case, whether such a template t exists.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. I need to find a template t such that:

- For a and b, at every position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then s[i] must be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- For c, there must be at least one position where the above condition fails.

I need to output "YES" if such a template exists, otherwise "NO".

Let me look at the example provided to understand better.

Example Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Example Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's analyze the first test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

The problem mentions that using template "C" works. So, template t = "C"

For a:

- t[0] = 'C' (uppercase), so a[0] must be different from 'c'. a[0] = 'a' ≠ 'c', so it matches.

For b:

- t[0] = 'C', b[0] = 'b' ≠ 'c', so it matches.

For c:

- t[0] = 'C', c[0] = 'c' == 'c', which fails the condition, so c does not match.

Hence, "YES".

Second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Is there a template t such that a and b match t, but c does not?

Let's try to find such a template.

If I choose t = "Aa", then:

For a:

- t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), so a[0] != 'a' ? But a[0] = 'a' == 'a', which fails. So a does not match.

This is not good.

Alternatively, t = "Bb":

For a:

- t[0] = 'B', a[0] = 'a' != 'b', so matches.

- t[1] = 'b', a[1] = 'a' != 'b', which should match since t[1] is lowercase, but wait:

If t[1] is lowercase, then a[1] must be equal to t[1], but a[1] = 'a' != 'b'. So fails.

Hence, a does not match.

For b:

- t[0] = 'B', b[0] = 'b' != 'b', which is 'b' != 'b'? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, 'b' != 'b' is false, but t[0] is 'B', so it should be b[0] != 'b', which is false, so it fails to match.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify:

- If t[i] is uppercase, s[i] must be different from the lowercase of t[i].

So, t[0] = 'B', which is uppercase, so s[0] must be different from 'b'.

For b[0] = 'b', which is equal to 'b', so it doesn't match.

Hence, b does not match t = "Bb".

For c:

- Same as above, c = "aa"

- t[0] = 'B', c[0] = 'a' != 'b', so matches.

- t[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a' != 'b', which should match since t[1] is lowercase and s[1] must be equal to t[1], but a != b, so fails.

But wait, t[1] is 'b' lowercase, so c[1] must be 'b', but c[1] = 'a' != 'b', so fails.

But since c must not match, and it fails at t[1], so c does not match.

But both a and b fail to match t = "Bb", while c also fails to match.

But the condition is that a and b must match t, and c must not.

So, this t doesn't work.

Another attempt:

t = "Aa"

For a:

- t[0] = 'A' uppercase, a[0] = 'a' != 'a'? No, 'a' == 'a', so fails.

For b:

- t[0] = 'A', b[0] = 'b' != 'a', which is correct.

- t[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b' != 'a', but t[1] is lowercase, so b[1] must be equal to 'a', which it's not. So fails.

For c:

- t[0] = 'A', c[0] = 'a' != 'a'? No, same as a.

- t[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a' == 'a', so matches.

So, a fails, b fails, c matches.

Not what we want.

Another attempt: t = "Bb"

For a:

- t[0] = 'B', a[0] = 'a' != 'b', which is correct.

- t[1] = 'b', a[1] = 'a' != 'b', but t[1] is lowercase, so a[1] must be equal to 'b', which it's not. So fails.

For b:

- t[0] = 'B', b[0] = 'b' != 'b', which is false, so fails.

For c:

- t[0] = 'B', c[0] = 'a' != 'b', correct.

- t[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a' != 'b', but t[1] is lowercase, so c[1] must be equal to 'b', which it's not. So fails.

So, a fails, b fails, c fails.

Not what we need.

Seems like no template satisfies the condition for this test case, so "NO".

Third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

The solution is "YES", and the note suggests using template "CODEforces".

Let's verify:

For a = "mathforces"

- t = "CODEforces"

- For positions where t is lowercase ('odeforces'), a must match exactly.

- For positions where t is uppercase ('CODE'), a must be different from the lowercase version.

Similarly for b and c.

Let's check position by position.

Assuming t = "CODEforces"

t:  C O D E f o r c e s

a:  m a t h f o r c e s

b:  l u c k f o r c e s

c:  a d h o c c o d e r

Check for a:

- t[0] = 'C' uppercase, a[0] = 'm' != 'c', correct.

- t[1] = 'O' uppercase, a[1] = 'a' != 'o', correct.

- t[2] = 'D' uppercase, a[2] = 't' != 'd', correct.

- t[3] = 'E' uppercase, a[3] = 'h' != 'e', correct.

- t[4] = 'f' lowercase, a[4] = 'f' == 'f', correct.

- t[5] = 'o' lowercase, a[5] = 'o' == 'o', correct.

- t[6] = 'r' lowercase, a[6] = 'r' == 'r', correct.

- t[7] = 'c' lowercase, a[7] = 'c' == 'c', correct.

- t[8] = 'e' lowercase, a[8] = 'e' == 'e', correct.

- t[9] = 's' lowercase, a[9] = 's' == 's', correct.

So, a matches t.

Similarly for b:

- t[0] = 'C', b[0] = 'l' != 'c', correct.

- t[1] = 'O', b[1] = 'u' != 'o', correct.

- t[2] = 'D', b[2] = 'c' != 'd', correct.

- t[3] = 'E', b[3] = 'k' != 'e', correct.

- t[4] = 'f', b[4] = 'f' == 'f', correct.

- t[5] = 'o', b[5] = 'o' == 'o', correct.

- t[6] = 'r', b[6] = 'r' == 'r', correct.

- t[7] = 'c', b[7] = 'c' == 'c', correct.

- t[8] = 'e', b[8] = 'e' == 'e', correct.

- t[9] = 's', b[9] = 's' == 's', correct.

So, b matches t.

For c:

- t[0] = 'C', c[0] = 'a' != 'c', correct.

- t[1] = 'O', c[1] = 'd' != 'o', correct.

- t[2] = 'D', c[2] = 'h' != 'd', correct.

- t[3] = 'E', c[3] = 'h' != 'e', correct.

- t[4] = 'f', c[4] = 'o' != 'f', so fails here.

Since it fails at position 4, c does not match t.

Hence, "YES".

Fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

The output is "NO", meaning no such template t exists.

I need to see why.

Let me try to find a template t.

Option 1: t = "Acc"

For a:

- t[0] = 'A', a[0] = 'a' != 'a', which is false, so fails.

Not good.

Option 2: t = "Abc"

For a:

- t[0] = 'A', a[0] = 'a' != 'a', fails.

No good.

Option 3: t = "ABC"

For a:

- t[0] = 'A', a[0] = 'a' != 'a', fails.

Option 4: t = "AbC"

For a:

- t[0] = 'A', a[0] = 'a' != 'a', fails.

Seems like no matter what I do, a always fails because of the first character.

Wait, but maybe there's a way where c fails more easily.

Let me think differently.

I need to find t such that:

- For a and b, at every position:

- If t[i] is lowercase, s[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, s[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- For c, there exists at least one position where the above fails.

Let me consider position by position.

For position 0:

a[0] = 'a'

b[0] = 'a'

c[0] = 'a'

What can t[0] be?

If t[0] is lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[0] == 'x'

- b[0] == 'x'

- c[0] == 'x'

For a and b to match, 'x' must be 'a'.

But then c[0] == 'a', which matches, but we need c to not match.

So, if t[0] is lowercase 'a', then a and b match, but c also matches.

Not good.

If t[0] is uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[0] != 'x'

- b[0] != 'x'

- c[0] != 'x'

Given a[0] = 'a', b[0] = 'a', c[0] = 'a'

So, for t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), a[0] != 'a' ? 'a' != 'a' is false, so fails.

Hence, a does not match.

Similarly, b does not match.

c also does not match.

But we need a and b to match, and c to not match.

So, this is not working.

It seems that for position 0, it's impossible to have t[0] such that a and b match, but c does not.

Because:

- If t[0] is lowercase 'a', then a and b match, but c also matches.

- If t[0] is uppercase 'A', then a and b do not match, and c does not match.

In both cases, it's not possible to have a and b match while c does not.

Hence, "NO".

From these examples, it seems that the key is to find positions where a and b are the same or different, and c is different from a and b.

But I need a general approach.

Let me think about each position independently.

For each position i from 1 to n:

Consider the characters a[i], b[i], c[i].

I need to choose t[i], which can be either lowercase or uppercase, and its character.

If t[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

So, for this choice:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

Hence, a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i]

If this is the case, then choosing t[i] as lowercase a[i] satisfies the condition for this position.

Alternatively, if t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x' (since c does not match, it must fail at this position)

So, for this choice:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Hence, a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position i, there are two possibilities:

1. t[i] is lowercase 'x', where x is a[i] (assuming a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i])

2. t[i] is uppercase 'X', where x is c[i], and a[i] != x and b[i] != x

But in the second case, a[i] != x and b[i] != x, which means that x cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i].

So, for the second option to be valid, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

Wait, let's summarize:

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i]

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- Choose t[i] as uppercase, with the lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], but c[i] must be equal to that lowercase version.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through each position and see if we can choose t[i] appropriately.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can choose t[i] independently, as long as the overall template makes a and b match, and c does not match.

So, for a and b to match t, at every position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

And for c to not match t, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, to find such a template t, I need to ensure that for all positions:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in the uppercase case, for t[i] being uppercase 'X', lowercase(t[i]) is 'x', so:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Hence, for each position i, there are constraints based on the choices for t[i].

Now, for the template t to satisfy the conditions, for all positions i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for each position i, we have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for each position:

1. a[i] == b[i] == c[i]:

- Cannot choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], because c[i] == a[i], so c would match.

- Cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, because then t[i] would be some uppercase letter, say 'X', and c[i] == lowercase('X') = 'x', but a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x' must hold, which contradicts a[i] == b[i] == c[i].

- Hence, no valid choice for t[i]. So, no such template exists.

2. a[i] == b[i] != c[i]:

- Can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i]. Then a and b match, and c does not match.

- Alternatively, choosing t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], but since c[i] != a[i], this would not satisfy c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- So, the only valid choice is t[i] as lowercase a[i].

3. a[i] != b[i]:

- Need to choose t[i] as uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- So, c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i], and t[i] is uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i].

- Hence, c[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

- Additionally, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], no valid template exists.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], then:

- Must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i].

Hence, for the template to exist, in positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Otherwise, if there exists any position where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then no valid template exists for that position, hence for the entire string.

Also, in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], no valid template exists.

So, the general condition is:

- For all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then no valid template exists.

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

If these conditions hold for all positions, then a valid template exists.

Hence, the algorithm is:

For each test case:

- Read n, a, b, c.

- For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], output "NO".

- If a[i] != b[i], then check if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If not, output "NO".

- If all positions pass these checks, then output "YES".

Wait, but in the third test case:

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's check position by position:

Position 0: a[0]='m', b[0]='l', c[0]='a'

a[0] != b[0], and c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0], so okay.

Position 1: a[1]='a', b[1]='u', c[1]='d'

a[1] != b[1], and c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], okay.

...

Position 3: a[3]='h', b[3]='k', c[3]='o'

a[3] != b[3], c[3] != a[3] and c[3] != b[3], okay.

...

Position 9: a[9]='s', b[9]='s', c[9]='r'

a[9] == b[9], c[9] != a[9], so okay.

Hence, "YES".

In the second test case:

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 0: a[0]='a', b[0]='b', c[0]='a'

a[0] != b[0], but c[0] == a[0], which is not allowed. So, "NO".

In the fourth test case:

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Position 0: a[0]='a', b[0]='a', c[0]='a'

a[0] == b[0] == c[0], so "NO".

In the first test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

Position 0: a[0]='a', b[0]='b', c[0]='c'

a[0] != b[0], and c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0], so "YES".

This matches the example outputs.

Hence, the algorithm is:

For each test case:

- For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], output "NO"

- Else if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], output "NO"

- If none of the positions fail the above checks, output "YES"

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

for x in c:

if x not in a and x not in b:

print('YES')

no = False

break

if no:

print('NO')

This seems incorrect.

First, it checks if c == a or c == b, and if so, prints "NO". This makes sense because if c is exactly equal to a or b, then any template that makes a and b match would also make c match, which is not desired.

Then, if c is not equal to a or b, it iterates through each character in c and checks if that character is not in a and not in b. If it finds such a character, it prints "YES".

This seems flawed.

Consider the third test case:

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Here, c is not equal to a or b.

Now, iterating through c:

c[0] = 'a' -> 'a' is in a and b.

c[1] = 'd' -> 'd' is in a and b.

c[2] = 'h' -> 'h' is in a and b.

...

c[9] = 'r' -> 'r' is in a and b.

So, no character in c is not in both a and b. According to this program, it would print "NO", but the correct output is "YES". Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Let's look again.

After checking if c == a or c == b, if not, it iterates through each character in c and checks if x not in a and x not in b. If it finds such an x, it prints "YES".

But in the third test case, no such x exists, so it should print "NO", but the correct answer is "YES". Hence, this program is incorrect.

Moreover, the program does not consider positions independently, which is crucial according to my earlier analysis.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
