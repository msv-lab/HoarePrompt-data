Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game where Bodya and Sasha have a permutation and an array. They start at certain positions in the permutation and make moves for k turns. Each turn, they can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. Their score increases by the value in the array at their current position each turn. The goal is to determine who wins based on who has the higher score after k turns.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get n (the length of the permutation and array), k (the number of turns), and the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha (P_B and P_S). Then, there's the permutation array p and the score array a.

I need to simulate the game for both players over k turns and see who ends up with a higher score. If their scores are equal, it's a draw.

But simulating each turn for each player individually could be inefficient, especially since n and k can be up to 2*10^5 and 10^9 respectively. So, I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum possible score for each player without simulating each turn step by step.

Let me think about how the game progresses. Each player can choose to stay or move to p[x] at each turn. They aim to maximize their score.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where the state is the current position and the number of turns left. But with k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach won't work due to time constraints.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum score efficiently. Maybe I can analyze the structure of the permutation, since permutations consist of cycles.

If I can identify the cycles in the permutation, I can model the movement of each player as traversing these cycles. Then, for each player, I can compute the maximum score based on how they traverse their respective cycles.

Let me recall that in a permutation, every element is part of exactly one cycle. So, for each player, their movement over multiple turns can be modeled based on the cycle they are in.

For example, if a player is in a cycle of length m, then every m turns, they return to their starting position. So, their movement is periodic with period m.

Given that, I can precompute the maximum score a player can achieve based on the cycle they are in and the number of turns k.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let's look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, the code reads the inputs and iterates up to n steps, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha and accumulating their scores. It seems like it's trying to simulate the game step by step, but I need to verify if this is efficient and correct.

Wait, the problem states that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5. So, an O(n) solution per test case should be acceptable.

But k can be up to 10^9, which suggests that we need a way to handle large k efficiently.

Looking at the reference solution, it seems to iterate up to n steps, which is acceptable since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but overall, since the sum of n across all test cases is limited to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

Let me try to understand the reference solution step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a.

It adjusts the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha to 0-based indexing.

Then, it initializes sp (Sasha's score) and bp (Bodya's score) with their starting position values.

It also initializes bm (Bodya's maximum possible score) with a[b] * k and sm (Sasha's maximum possible score) with a[s] * k.

Wait, a[b] * k and a[s] * k suggest that initially, it's assuming that the player stays at their starting position for all k turns, accumulating a[b] or a[s] each turn.

Then, it enters a loop that runs up to n times:

- It decreases k by 1.

- If k becomes 0, it breaks out of the loop.

- It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving to p[b]-1 and p[s]-1.

- It updates bm and sm by adding the maximum of either staying at the current position or moving to the next position.

- It accumulates sp and bp with a[s] and a[b] respectively.

This seems a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase it.

Essentially, for each turn, the player can choose to stay or move. If they stay, they get a[x] again. If they move, they go to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn.

The goal is to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

In the reference solution, it seems to be considering some form of dynamic programming where it keeps track of the maximum score achievable up to the current turn.

But I'm not entirely sure about the correctness of this approach.

Let me think differently.

Each player has their own path defined by the permutation. Since the permutation is a cycle, the player will循环遍历这个cycle。

So, for each player, their positions over k turns can be determined based on the cycle they are in.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m. Then, their positions over k turns will repeat every m turns.

So, the total score can be calculated by summing a[x] for the positions they visit in one cycle, and then multiplying by the number of complete cycles within k turns, and adding the sum for the remaining turns.

But this approach assumes that the player always moves to p[x] each turn, which may not be optimal, because they can choose to stay.

Wait, the problem allows the player to choose to stay or move each turn, aiming to maximize their score.

So, it's more complex than just following the cycle.

I need to find a way to model the player's choices over k turns to maximize their score.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current position and the number of turns left.

But with k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to compute the maximum score.

Perhaps I can model the game as a graph where each node is a position, and there are edges for staying or moving.

Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum sum path in this graph over k steps.

But again, with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I recall that for such problems, especially when the number of steps is large, we can use matrix exponentiation or find repeating patterns in the movement.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that the permutation consists of disjoint cycles.

Each player is in one of these cycles.

I can analyze the cycle that each player is in and compute the maximum score based on that.

For a cycle of length m, the positions repeat every m turns.

So, for a player in a cycle of length m, over k turns, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

The goal is to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can precompute, for each position in the cycle, the maximum score achievable starting from that position for a certain number of turns.

But again, with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that in each turn, the player has two choices: stay or move.

If they stay, they get a[x] again.

If they move, they go to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn.

So, for each position, the maximum score is the maximum between:

- Staying: a[x] + maximum score of staying or moving from x in the remaining k-1 turns.

- Moving: a[p[x]] + maximum score of staying or moving from p[x] in the remaining k-1 turns.

This is a recursive definition, but again, with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this without recursion.

I think this can be modeled using dynamic programming where dp[x][k] is the maximum score at position x with k turns left.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can observe that for each cycle, the maximum score can be computed independently.

Within a cycle, the players will keep moving in the cycle or choose to stay at some positions.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum score for each player based on their cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle for as many turns as possible.

But that might not always be the case, especially if there are positions with high a[x] that are only reachable by moving through positions with lower a[x].

Wait, actually, if a player can choose to stay or move each turn, the optimal strategy would be to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle for all k turns.

Because staying allows them to accumulate a[x] each turn, and moving would only allow them to get a[p[x]] in the next turn, which might be lower.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle for all k turns.

But I need to verify this.

Suppose a cycle is x -> y -> z -> x, and a[x] = 1, a[y] = 2, a[z] = 3.

The best strategy would be to stay at z for all k turns, accumulating 3 each turn.

But to reach z, the player might need to move through x and y.

Wait, but the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, the player can choose to move to z in one turn, and then stay at z for the remaining k-1 turns.

But in this case, they would have to spend one turn moving to z, which would cost them a[y] if they move through y.

Wait, no. Each turn, they choose to stay or move.

If they choose to move, they go to p[x], and their score increases by a[p[x]].

If they choose to stay, they stay at x and their score increases by a[x].

So, in this example, if the player starts at x, they can choose to stay at x and get a[x] each turn, or move to y and get a[y], then choose to stay at y and get a[y] each turn, or move to z and get a[z], and so on.

So, the optimal strategy would be to move to the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle and then stay there for the remaining turns.

But to do that, they might need to spend some turns moving to that position.

In the above example, starting at x, to reach z, the player needs to move from x to y, then from y to z, spending two turns to reach z.

Once at z, they can stay there for the remaining k-2 turns.

So, their total score would be a[y] + a[z] + (k-2)*a[z].

But, if they choose to stay at y for all k turns, their score would be k*a[y].

Comparing the two:

- Staying at y: k*a[y]

- Moving to z and staying: a[y] + a[z] + (k-2)*a[z]

Which is better?

Let's compute:

Option 1: k*a[y]

Option 2: a[y] + a[z] + (k-2)*a[z] = a[y] + a[z] + k*a[z] - 2*a[z] = a[y] + (k-1)*a[z]

So, Option 2 is better if a[y] + (k-1)*a[z] > k*a[y], which simplifies to a[y] + k*a[z] - a[z] > k*a[y], or k*(a[z] - a[y]) + a[y] - a[z] > 0.

If a[z] > a[y], then for sufficiently large k, Option 2 is better.

Similarly, if a[z] <= a[y], Option 1 is better.

So, in general, the optimal strategy is to find the position in the cycle with the maximum a[x], and move to it in the minimal number of moves, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

But to implement this efficiently, I need to find, for each player, the minimal number of moves required to reach the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle.

Then, their total score would be the sum of a[x] along the path to that position, plus (k - number of moves) * a[max].

But I need to handle the case where there are multiple positions with the same maximum a[x].

Also, I need to make sure that the path to the maximum position is as short as possible.

Wait, actually, since the permutation is a cycle, the distance to any position in the cycle is minimal in one direction or the other.

So, for each player, I can find the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x], and the minimal distance to reach it, and then compute the score accordingly.

This seems manageable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, P_B, P_S, permutation p, and array a.

b. Convert P_B and P_S to 0-based indexing.

c. Find the cycle that each player is in.

d. For each player, find the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x].

e. Determine the minimal number of moves required to reach that position.

f. Compute the maximum score for each player: sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum position, plus (k - number of moves) * a[max].

g. Compare the scores and decide who wins.

But I need to handle multiple cycles efficiently.

Wait, actually, since the permutation is a single cycle or a union of disjoint cycles, and each player is in their own cycle, I can treat each player's cycle independently.

But in reality, the permutation is a single cycle or a union of disjoint cycles, and players might be in different cycles.

But since they move independently, their cycles don't interfere with each other.

So, for each player, I can find their cycle and find the best strategy within that cycle.

But to optimize, I need to find, for each player, the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x], and the minimal distance to reach it.

Then, compute the score as follows:

- Move to the maximum position in d moves, accumulating a[x] along the path.

- Stay at the maximum position for the remaining k - d turns, accumulating a[max] each turn.

So, total score = sum of a[x] along the path + (k - d) * a[max]

I need to minimize d, the number of moves to reach the maximum position.

So, for each player, I need to find the position with the maximum a[x], and the minimal distance from their starting position to that position.

Since the cycle is a loop, I need to consider the minimal distance in both directions.

Let me formalize this.

For a cycle, let's represent it as a list of positions.

For example, a cycle might be [x, y, z], where p[x]=y, p[y]=z, p[z]=x.

Then, the distance from x to z is 2 (x -> y -> z), or -1 if moving in the opposite direction (x -> z).

Wait, in a cycle, the distance between two positions can be measured in both directions.

So, the minimal distance is the minimum of the forward and backward distances.

Given that, for each player, I can find the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then find the minimal distance from their starting position to that position.

Then, compute the score as sum of a[x] along the path plus (k - d) * a[max].

But I need to make sure that the path I choose to reach the maximum position has the minimal possible sum.

Wait, actually, since I'm only moving to reach the maximum position as quickly as possible, I can choose the path with the minimal distance, and sum the a[x] along that path.

But I need to be careful because moving to the maximum position might involve passing through positions with lower a[x].

Wait, no, because the player accumulates a[x] at the current position before moving.

Wait, let's clarify.

Each turn consists of:

1. The player is at position x.

2. Their score increases by a[x].

3. Then, they choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, effectively, the player can choose to stay and accumulate a[x], or move to p[x] and accumulate a[p[x]] in the next turn.

So, in terms of movement, moving to p[x] costs a[p[x]], while staying costs a[x].

But in terms of maximizing the score, the player wants to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay or move each turn.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where dp[x][k] is the maximum score at position x with k turns left.

The recurrence would be:

dp[x][k] = max(a[x] + dp[x][k-1], a[p[x]] + dp[p[x]][k-1])

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I recall that in such problems, especially when dealing with permutations and cycles, we can analyze the cycle structure and compute the maximum score based on the cycle's properties.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and compute the minimal number of steps required to reach that position.

Then, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a[x] in as few steps as possible and stay there for the remaining turns.

This seems reasonable.

So, for each player, I need to:

1. Find the cycle that their starting position is in.

2. Find the position(s) in that cycle with the maximum a[x].

3. Find the minimal distance from their starting position to any of those positions.

4. Compute the total score as:

- Sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum position.

- Plus (k - d) * a[max], where d is the distance to the maximum position.

But I need to handle multiple positions with the same maximum a[x].

Also, I need to make sure that I choose the path with the minimal sum of a[x] along the way.

Wait, but since I have to pass through certain positions to reach the maximum position, I have to accumulate a[x] at each step.

But actually, in this problem, the player chooses to stay or move each turn, and the score increases by a[x] at the current position before choosing to stay or move.

So, the accumulation is at the current position, not at the next position.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement.

"Each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then, the player either stays at his current position x or moves to p_x."

So, the score increases at the current position before deciding to stay or move.

Given that, the player can choose to stay and accumulate a[x] repeatedly, or move to p[x] and accumulate a[p[x]] in the next turn, and so on.

So, the problem reduces to, for each player, finding the maximum possible sum of a[x] over k turns, where at each turn, the player can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation.

Given that the permutation is a cycle, the player can traverse the cycle in one direction.

But to maximize the sum, the player should aim to spend as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[x].

To do that, the player should reach that position in the minimal number of moves and then stay there for the remaining turns.

So, for each player, I need to:

1. Identify the cycle that their starting position is in.

2. Find the position(s) in that cycle with the maximum a[x].

3. Find the minimal distance from their starting position to any of those positions.

4. Compute the total score as:

- Sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum position.

- Plus (k - d) * a[max], where d is the distance to the maximum position.

But I need to make sure that the sum along the path is correctly calculated.

Wait, actually, in each turn, the player chooses to stay or move.

If they choose to move, they go to p[x], and their score increases by a[x] before moving.

Wait, no, according to the problem statement:

"Each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves to p_x."

So, the score increases by a[x] at the current position, and then the player chooses to stay or move.

So, in terms of movement, if the player chooses to stay, they remain at x and accumulate a[x] again next turn.

If they choose to move, they go to p[x], and in the next turn, they accumulate a[p[x]].

So, the movement happens after accumulating the score.

Given that, the player can choose to stay and accumulate a[x] or move to p[x] and accumulate a[p[x]] in the next turn.

So, the optimal strategy is to move to the position with the highest a[x] as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Hence, for each player, I need to find the position in their cycle with the highest a[x], and the minimal distance to reach it.

Then, the total score is:

- Sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum position.

- Plus (k - d) * a[max], where d is the distance to the maximum position.

But I need to calculate the sum along the path correctly.

Wait, actually, in each turn, the player accumulates a[x] before choosing to stay or move.

So, if the player chooses to move in turn 1 from x to p[x], their score increases by a[x], and then they move to p[x].

In turn 2, they are at p[x], accumulate a[p[x]], and then choose to stay or move again.

So, the total score for moving directly to the maximum position and staying there would be:

- a[x] (turn 1) + a[p[x]] (turn 2) + (k - 2) * a[max]

But wait, in turn 2, after moving to p[x], they can choose to stay at p[x] and accumulate a[p[x]] each turn, or move to p[p[x]].

But to reach the maximum position as quickly as possible, they should choose the path with the minimal distance.

So, for each player, I need to find the shortest path to the maximum a[x] in their cycle.

Then, compute the sum of a[x] along that path, and add (k - d) * a[max], where d is the distance to the maximum position.

But I need to handle the case where there are multiple positions with the same maximum a[x].

In that case, the player can choose any of those positions, and should choose the one with the minimal distance.

Also, I need to make sure that I'm calculating the sum along the path correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each player the minimal distance to any of the maximum positions in their cycle.

Then, the total score would be sum of a[x] along the minimal path plus (k - d) * a[max].

But I need to make sure that the sum along the path is correctly calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can observe that the optimal strategy is to reach the maximum a[x] in as few moves as possible and then stay there.

Given that, I can compute for each player:

- The maximum a[x] in their cycle.

- The minimal distance to reach that maximum a[x].

- Then, the total score is sum of a[x] along the path plus (k - d) * a[max].

But calculating the sum along the path accurately is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can model this differently.

Let me consider that for each player, their possible positions over k turns form a tree where each node is a position, and edges represent the choice to stay or move.

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph and use matrix exponentiation to compute the maximum score.

But that might be too complex.

Let me think about the cycle structure.

Since the permutation is a cycle, I can represent it as a circular linked list.

Then, for each player, their movement is deterministic once the choices are made.

But given that they can choose to stay or move each turn, it's not purely deterministic.

Wait, maybe I can model it as a linear sequence where the cycle is unfolded.

But that might not help directly.

Perhaps I can consider that in the cycle, there is one or more positions with the maximum a[x].

The player can choose to reach any of these positions with minimal distance and then stay there.

So, for each player, I can:

1. Find all positions in their cycle with a[x] equal to the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

2. Find the minimal distance from their starting position to any of these positions.

3. Compute the sum along this minimal path.

4. Then, compute the total score as sum along the path plus (k - d) * a[max].

But I need to make sure that the sum along the path is correctly calculated.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each player the sum of a[x] along the minimal path to the maximum position.

To do that, I can traverse the cycle starting from the starting position, keeping track of the sum and the distance to the maximum position.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to do this.

Wait, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so an O(n) solution per test case is acceptable.

Let me try to formalize the algorithm.

For each test case:

1. Read n, k, P_B, P_S, permutation p, and array a.

2. Convert P_B and P_S to 0-based indexing.

3. For Bodya and Sasha separately:

a. Find the cycle that their starting position is in.

b. Find the maximum a[x] in that cycle.

c. Find the minimal distance from their starting position to any position with a[x] == a_max.

d. Compute the sum along this minimal path.

e. Compute the total score as sum along the path + (k - d) * a_max.

4. Compare the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and decide who wins or if it's a draw.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to find an efficient way to find the cycle, find the maximum a[x], and find the minimal distance to it.

But since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I can process each test case independently in O(n) time.

Wait, but in reality, n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, meaning that on average, n per test case is small.

So, an O(n) per test case should be acceptable.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Find the cycle that a player is in.

- Find the positions with a[x] == a_max in that cycle.

- Find the minimal distance from the starting position to any of those positions.

- Compute the sum along the minimal path.

But actually, since the cycle is a circular structure, I can represent it as a list and work with indices.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for a given starting position, I can follow the permutation to find the cycle.

But since n is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

So, for each player, I can:

- Start from their starting position.

- Follow p[x] until I return to the starting position, collecting positions in the cycle.

- Find the maximum a[x] in this cycle.

- Find all positions in the cycle with a[x] == a_max.

- For each such position, compute the distance from the starting position in both directions.

- Choose the minimal distance d.

- Compute the sum along the path with minimal d.

- Then, compute the total score as sum along the path + (k - d) * a_max.

But I need to handle the sum along the path correctly.

Wait, actually, since the player accumulates a[x] at the current position before choosing to stay or move, the sum along the path would be the sum of a[x] at each position they choose to stay or move through.

But in the optimal strategy, they should move directly to the maximum position and stay there.

So, for each move, they accumulate a[x] and then move to p[x].

Hence, the sum along the path would be a[x] (starting position) + a[p[x]] + ... + a[pos_before_max] + (k - d) * a[max]

Wait, no.

Actually, for each turn:

1. Accumulate a[x].

2. Choose to stay or move.

So, if the player chooses to move, they accumulate a[x] and then move to p[x].

If they choose to stay, they accumulate a[x] and remain at x.

Hence, to reach the maximum position in d moves, they would accumulate a[x] in turn 1, move to p[x], accumulate a[p[x]] in turn 2, and so on, until they reach the maximum position and then stay there.

Hence, the sum along the path would be a[x] + a[p[x]] + ... + a[pos_before_max] + (k - d) * a[max]

So, I need to compute the sum of a[x] along the path from the starting position to the maximum position, and then add (k - d) * a[max].

To minimize d, the number of moves to reach the maximum position, I need to find the minimal distance from the starting position to any position with a[x] == a_max.

Then, sum the a[x] along that path and compute the total score.

But I need to handle the cycle structure properly.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the cycle as a list of positions, and then find the minimal distance to any maximum position in both directions.

Then, compute the sum along that path.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3] (1-based, so 0-based is [3,0,1,2])

a = [7,2,5,6] (0-based)

So, Bodya starts at position 2 (0-based), a[2]=5

Sasha starts at position 1 (0-based), a[1]=2

The permutation cycle is 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0.

So, the cycle is 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0.

The maximum a[x] in the cycle is 7 at position 0.

For Bodya, starting at position 2, the minimal distance to position 0 is 1 (2 -> 1 -> 0 is 2 moves, but in the cycle, it's shorter in the other direction: 2 -> 3 -> 0 is 2 moves.

Wait, but in the cycle 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, the distance from 2 to 0 is 2 moves: 2 -> 1 -> 0.

Alternatively, in the other direction: 2 -> 3 -> 0, which is also 2 moves.

So, minimal distance d=2.

Then, sum along the path: a[2] + a[1] = 5 + 2 = 7

Then, since k=2 and d=2, total score = 5 (first turn) + 2 (second turn) + (k - d) * a_max = 5 + 2 + (0) * 7 = 7

Wait, but according to the example explanation, Bodya stays at position 2 for both turns, accumulating 5 + 5 = 10.

Sasha moves to position 1 in the first turn, accumulating 2 + 7 = 9.

So, Bodya has 10, Sasha has 9, Bodya wins.

But according to my earlier strategy, Bodya would have a total score of 7, which doesn't match the example.

So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Looking back, perhaps the optimal strategy is not always to move to the maximum position as quickly as possible.

In this example, Bodya can choose to stay at position 2 and accumulate 5 each turn, ending with 10.

If he moves to position 1 and then to position 0, his score would be a[2] + a[1] + (k - d) * a[max] = 5 + 2 + 0 * 7 = 7, which is worse than staying at position 2.

Hence, in this case, staying at position 2 is better than moving to the maximum position.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is not necessarily to move to the position with the maximum a[x] and stay there.

Instead, it's to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle if it's higher than moving to other positions.

In this example, position 2 has a[2]=5, and position 0 has a[0]=7.

But moving to position 0 would require moving through position 1, accumulating a[2] + a[1] = 5 + 2 = 7, and then staying at position 0 for the remaining turns.

But in this case, k=2, so after moving to position 0, there are no remaining turns to stay there.

Hence, total score would be a[2] + a[1] = 7.

Which is less than staying at position 2 and accumulating a[2] + a[2] = 10.

Hence, Bodya should stay at position 2.

So, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the local maximum a[x].

In other words, if a player is at a position where a[x] is greater than or equal to a[p[x]], it's better to stay there and accumulate a[x] each turn.

Otherwise, it's better to move to p[x] and try to find a position with a higher a[x].

Hence, for each player, the optimal strategy is:

- If a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x and accumulate a[x] for all k turns.

- Else, move to p[x], and repeat the decision there.

In the example above, for Bodya starting at position 2, a[2]=5 and a[p[2]]=a[1]=2.

Since a[2] >= a[1], it's better to stay at position 2 and accumulate 5 each turn, totaling 10 for k=2.

For Sasha starting at position 1, a[1]=2 and a[p[1]]=a[0]=7.

Since a[1] < a[p[1]], it's better to move to position 0 and then stay there for the remaining turns.

So, in the first turn, accumulate a[1]=2 and move to position 0.

In the second turn, accumulate a[0]=7 and stay there.

Total score: 2 + 7 = 9.

Hence, Bodya wins with 10 vs Sasha's 9.

This matches the example.

So, the optimal strategy is:

- At each turn, if a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x and accumulate a[x].

- Else, move to p[x] and accumulate a[x].

Wait, but in the second turn for Sasha, at position 0, a[0]=7 and p[0]=3, a[3]=6.

Since a[0]=7 >= a[p[0]]=6, Sasha should stay at position 0 and accumulate a[0]=7.

Hence, total score: a[1]=2 (first turn, moving to 0) + a[0]=7 (second turn, staying at 0) = 9.

Which matches the example.

So, the general strategy is:

- At each turn, if a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x and accumulate a[x].

- Else, move to p[x] and accumulate a[x].

Hence, for each player, their total score can be computed by following this strategy for k turns.

But simulating this for k up to 10^9 is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to compute the score.

Let me think about it.

If a player is at a position where a[x] >= a[p[x]], they will stay there for all remaining turns.

Otherwise, they will move to p[x] and repeat the decision there.

Hence, their path will eventually lead them to a position where a[x] >= a[p[x]], and they will stay there for the remaining turns.

So, for each player, I need to find:

- The position where they eventually stay forever.

- The number of moves d required to reach that position.

- Then, their total score is the sum of a[x] along the path to that position plus (k - d) * a[stay].

So, for each player, I need to find:

- The final position where a[x] >= a[p[x]].

- The minimal number of moves d to reach that position.

- The sum of a[x] along that path.

Then, the total score is sum along the path + (k - d) * a[stay].

Hence, I can preprocess for each player the path they take until they reach a position where they stay, and compute the sum along that path and the distance d.

Then, compute the total score as sum + (k - d) * a[stay], if k >= d.

If k < d, they don't reach the staying position, so their score would be the sum of a[x] for the first k turns.

But in practice, since d is at most n, which is up to 2*10^5, and k can be up to 10^9, which is much larger, so k >= d.

Hence, I can assume k >= d and compute sum + (k - d) * a[stay].

Now, to implement this efficiently, I can, for each player, traverse their path until they reach a position where a[x] >= a[p[x]], keeping track of the sum and the distance.

Then, compute the total score as sum + (k - d) * a[stay].

This should be efficient enough since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

Hence, an O(n) per test case should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

For each test case:

- Read n, k, P_B, P_S, p, a.

- Convert P_B and P_S to 0-based indexing.

- For Bodya and Sasha:

- Initialize current position x = starting position.

- Initialize sum = 0.

- Initialize d = 0.

- While a[x] < a[p[x]] and d < k:

- sum += a[x]

- x = p[x] - 1

- d += 1

- If d == k:

- The player couldn't reach the staying position within k turns, so their score is sum.

- Else:

- sum += a[x]

- d += 1

- Then, add (k - d) * a[x] to the sum.

- Finally, compare the sums of Bodya and Sasha to decide who wins.

Wait, but in the example, Bodya stays at position 2, accumulating 5 each turn, totaling 10 for k=2.

In this approach:

- Bodya starts at position 2, a[2]=5, p[2]=1, a[1]=2.

- Since a[2]=5 >= a[1]=2, Bodya stays at position 2.

- sum = 5

- d = 1

- Then, add (k - d) * a[2] = (2 - 1) * 5 = 5

- Total sum = 5 + 5 = 10

- Which matches the example.

For Sasha:

- Starts at position 1, a[1]=2, p[1]=0, a[0]=7.

- Since a[1]=2 < a[0]=7, move to position 0.

- sum = 2

- d = 1

- Now at position 0, a[0]=7, p[0]=3, a[3]=6.

- Since a[0]=7 >= a[3]=6, stay at position 0.

- sum += 7 => sum = 2 + 7 = 9

- d = 2

- k - d = 0, so no additional addition.

- Total sum = 9

Which matches the example.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

So, in code, for each player, I can implement this logic:

Initialize sum = 0

Initialize d = 0

While a[x] < a[p[x]] and d < k:

sum += a[x]

x = p[x] - 1  # since p is 1-based

d += 1

if d == k:

# couldn't reach staying position within k turns

score = sum

else:

sum += a[x]

d += 1

score = sum + (k - d) * a[x]

Then, compare the scores of Bodya and Sasha.

This seems efficient and correct.

Now, looking back at the reference solution, it seems to be attempting something similar, but it's not clear.

In the reference solution:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -= 1

s -= 1

sp = a[s]

bp = a[b]

bm = a[b] * k

sm = a[s] * k

for i in range(n):

k -= 1

if k == 0:

break

b = p[b] - 1

s = p[s] - 1

bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)

sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

sp += a[s]

bp += a[b]

if bm > sm:

print('Bodya')

elif bm < sm:

print('Sasha')

else:

print('Draw')

It initializes bm and sm to a[b] * k and a[s] * k, which assumes that both players stay at their starting positions for
