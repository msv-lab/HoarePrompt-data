Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

We are given two positive integers, n and m, and we need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m

2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

First, I need to understand what this condition means: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). Let's denote gcd(a, b) as g. So, the condition becomes a + b is a multiple of b * g.

I know that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, so g divides a and g divides b. That means a = g * a' and b = g * b', where a' and b' are coprime integers (gcd(a', b') = 1).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = g * a' + g * b' = g(a' + b')

And b * g = g * b'

So, the condition is that g(a' + b') is a multiple of g * b'. Simplifying, this means a' + b' is a multiple of b'.

So, a' + b' ≡ 0 mod b'

Which implies a' ≡ -b' mod b'

But since a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides a' + b', this seems like a specific relationship.

Wait, a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides a' + b'. Since b' divides a' + b' and b' divides b', then b' divides a'. But a' and b' are coprime, so b' can only divide a' if b' = 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

So, b = g * b' = g * 1 = g.

And a = g * a', where a' is coprime with b' = 1, so a' can be any positive integer.

Wait, but a' and b' are coprime, and b' = 1, so a' can be any positive integer.

But a = g * a', and a ≤ n.

Similarly, b = g * 1 = g, and b ≤ m.

So, for each possible g (which is b), a can be any multiple of g up to n.

Wait, a = g * a', where a' is any positive integer such that a ≤ n.

So, a can be g, 2g, 3g, ..., up to floor(n/g) * g.

And b is g, and g ≤ m.

So, for each g from 1 to m, and for each a that is a multiple of g and a ≤ n, we have a valid pair (a, g).

Therefore, the number of pairs is equal to the sum over g from 1 to m of floor(n/g).

Because for each g, there are floor(n/g) multiples of g that are ≤ n.

Wait, but in the original condition, b can be from 1 to m, and for each b, a can be multiples of b up to n, provided that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

But from the earlier reasoning, it seems that this condition simplifies to b = gcd(a, b), which implies that b divides a.

Wait, but in the earlier steps, I concluded that b = g, and g = gcd(a, b).

So, b = gcd(a, b), which implies that b divides a.

Therefore, the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) simplifies to b divides a.

So, the condition is equivalent to b divides a.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify.

Given that b = gcd(a, b), and we need a + b to be a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b².

So, a + b ≡ 0 mod b².

But since b divides a, let a = k * b, then a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

We need (k + 1) * b to be a multiple of b², which means (k + 1) * b ≡ 0 mod b².

This implies that (k + 1) is a multiple of b.

So, k + 1 ≡ 0 mod b.

Therefore, k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, k = m * b - 1 for some integer m ≥ 1.

Thus, a = k * b = (m * b - 1) * b = m * b² - b.

So, a = m * b² - b.

But a must be ≥ 1, so m * b² - b ≥ 1 ⇒ m ≥ (b + 1)/b².

For b ≥ 1, m ≥ 1/b² + 1/b.

But for b = 1, m ≥ 2.

For b = 2, m ≥ 3/4 + 1/2 = 5/4, so m ≥ 2.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

Let’s consider the condition again: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let’s denote d = gcd(a, b).

Then, a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * a' + d * b' = d(a' + b') is a multiple of d * b' * d = d² * b'.

So, d(a' + b') ≡ 0 mod d² * b'.

Simplifying, a' + b' ≡ 0 mod d * b'.

But since a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides a' + b', then b' divides a'.

But a' and b' are coprime, so b' must be 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

So, b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a', where a' is any positive integer coprime with 1, which means a' can be any positive integer.

But a = d * a' ≤ n.

So, for each d from 1 to m (since b = d ≤ m), the number of a's is floor(n/d).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum over d from 1 to m of floor(n/d).

Wait, but in the earlier steps, I thought that b = d, and for each d, a can be any multiple of d up to n.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the total number of pairs is sum_{d=1}^{m} floor(n/d).

This seems to be a standard problem of counting the number of pairs where one number divides the other, within given limits.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see what it's doing.

Looking at func_15():

def func_15():

n, m = func_7()

i = 1

ans = 0

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans - 1

Wait, this seems different from what I expected.

I thought the answer should be sum_{d=1}^{m} floor(n/d).

But in the code, it's doing:

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans - 1

This doesn't seem to match sum_{d=1}^{m} floor(n/d).

Let me compute for the sample input:

First test case: n=1, m=1

sum_{d=1}^{1} floor(1/1) = 1

Which matches the first output.

Second test case: n=2, m=3

sum_{d=1}^{3} floor(2/d) = floor(2/1) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/3) = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

Which matches the second output.

Third test case: n=3, m=5

sum_{d=1}^{5} floor(3/d) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5

But the output in the sample is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the note, for n=10, m=8, the output is 14, which matches sum_{d=1}^{8} floor(10/d) = 10/1=10 + 10/2=5 + 10/3=3 + 10/4=2 + 10/5=2 + 10/6=1 + 10/7=1 + 10/8=1 = 10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1=25, which doesn't match the sample output of 14.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the condition.

Let me double-check.

The condition is a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Given that b divides a, as per earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Let me consider the sample input where n=10, m=8, and output is 14.

But sum_{d=1}^{8} floor(10/d) = 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25, which is not matching the sample output of 14.

So, clearly, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps the condition is not simply b divides a.

Let me revisit the condition.

Given a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Let’s denote d = gcd(a,b).

Then a = d * a', b = d * b', with gcd(a', b') = 1.

Then a + b = d(a' + b').

And b * d = d * b' * d = d² * b'.

So, d(a' + b') must be a multiple of d² * b'.

Simplify: a' + b' must be a multiple of d * b'.

But a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides a' + b', so b' divides a'.

Since a' and b' are coprime, b' must be 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

So, b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a', where a' is any positive integer.

Given that a ≤ n and b ≤ m, i.e., d ≤ m and d * a' ≤ n.

So, for each d from 1 to m, the number of a's is floor(n/d).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum_{d=1}^{m} floor(n/d).

But in the sample input, n=10, m=8, sum_{d=1}^{8} floor(10/d) = 25, but the sample output is 14.

So, either the sample is incorrect, or my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I missed some constraints.

Wait, in the sample explanation for n=10, m=8, it lists specific pairs: (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2), which is 14 pairs.

But according to my earlier sum, there should be 25 pairs, but clearly, many of them don't satisfy the original condition.

So, where did I go wrong?

Ah, I see. In my earlier reasoning, I concluded that b = d, and for each d, a can be any multiple of d up to n.

But in reality, for each d from 1 to m, and for each a that is a multiple of d up to n, the pair (a, d) is valid only if the condition holds.

But in the sample, not all such pairs are valid.

Wait, perhaps the condition is not simply b divides a, but something more specific.

Let me take specific examples from the sample.

For n=10, m=8.

Take d=1, a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But in the sample, only (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2),(6,2),(6,3),(2,2) are valid.

Wait, according to my earlier sum, for d=1, there are 10 pairs, but in the sample, only 10 pairs are listed for d=1, but the total is 14, which matches.

Wait, but in my sum, sum_{d=1}^{8} floor(10/d) = 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25, but in reality, only 14 pairs satisfy the condition.

So, my initial assumption that sum_{d=1}^{m} floor(n/d) is incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.

Let me carefully re-examine the condition.

Given a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Expressed differently: b * gcd(a,b) divides a + b.

Let’s denote d = gcd(a,b).

Then a = d * a', b = d * b', with gcd(a', b') = 1.

Then a + b = d(a' + b').

And b * d = d * b' * d = d² * b'.

So, d(a' + b') must be divisible by d² * b'.

Simplify: a' + b' must be divisible by d * b'.

But b' divides a' + b', and since gcd(a', b') = 1, b' divides a', which implies b' = 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

So, b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a', where a' is any positive integer such that a ≤ n.

So, for each d from 1 to m, and for each a that is a multiple of d and a ≤ n, we have a pair (a, d).

But in the sample, not all such pairs are valid.

Wait, perhaps there is an additional constraint.

Looking back at the condition: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Given that b = d and gcd(a,b) = d, so b * gcd(a,b) = d * d = d².

So, a + b must be a multiple of d².

But a = d * a', so a + b = d * a' + d = d(a' + 1).

This must be divisible by d², which implies that a' + 1 must be divisible by d.

So, a' ≡ -1 mod d.

Therefore, a' = k * d - 1 for some integer k ≥ 1.

Thus, a = d * a' = d(k * d - 1) = k * d² - d.

So, a must be of the form k * d² - d, for k ≥ 1, and a ≤ n.

Therefore, for each d from 1 to m, we need to count the number of k such that k * d² - d ≤ n and k * d² - d ≥ 1.

Let’s solve for k:

k * d² - d ≤ n ⇒ k ≤ (n + d)/d²

And k ≥ 1.

So, for each d from 1 to m, the number of k is floor((n + d)/d²).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum_{d=1}^{m} floor((n + d)/d²).

Now, looking back at the code:

def func_15():

n, m = func_7()

i = 1

ans = 0

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans - 1

Wait, this seems close but not exactly matching.

It's summing floor((n + i)/(i²)) for i from 1 to m, where i² ≤ n + i.

But according to my derivation, it should be sum_{d=1}^{m} floor((n + d)/d²).

However, in the code, there's a while loop condition: while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

This seems to be summing only up to i where i² <= n + i.

But in my derivation, d can go up to m, regardless of d² <= n + d.

Wait, perhaps there's an optimization or a mathematical equivalence here.

Let me check for the sample input n=10, m=8.

Compute sum_{d=1}^{8} floor((10 + d)/d²):

d=1: (10 + 1)/1 = 11 → floor(11) = 11

d=2: (10 + 2)/4 = 12/4 = 3 → floor(3) = 3

d=3: (10 + 3)/9 = 13/9 ≈ 1.44 → floor(1.44) = 1

d=4: (10 + 4)/16 = 14/16 = 0.875 → floor(0.875) = 0

d=5: (10 + 5)/25 = 15/25 = 0.6 → floor(0.6) = 0

d=6: (10 + 6)/36 = 16/36 ≈ 0.444 → floor(0.444) = 0

d=7: (10 + 7)/49 = 17/49 ≈ 0.347 → floor(0.347) = 0

d=8: (10 + 8)/64 = 18/64 ≈ 0.281 → floor(0.281) = 0

Sum = 11 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 15

But according to the sample, for n=10, m=8, the output is 14.

Moreover, in the sample explanation, there are 14 pairs listed.

So, my calculation gives 15, but the sample output is 14.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back at the sample explanation for n=10, m=8, the listed pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

That's 14 pairs.

But according to my sum, it's 15.

Wait, perhaps d=1 contributes 10 pairs, but in the sample, it's only listing 9 pairs for d=1: (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1)

Wait, that's 10 pairs.

Then d=2: floor((10 + 2)/4) = 3, but in the sample, for d=2, only (2,2),(6,2) are listed, which is 2 pairs.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the condition is not just a = k * d² - d, but something else.

Let me take a different approach.

Let’s consider that for each b from 1 to m, and for each a from 1 to n, check if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

But this would be too slow for large n and m, as it's O(n*m), which is not feasible for n and m up to 2*10^6.

So, I need a smarter way.

Looking back at the earlier reasoning, perhaps the condition can be expressed in terms of divisors.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the number of times b divides a within the range.

Wait, I need to find a way to compute sum over b=1 to m of floor(n / lb), where lb is the LCM of b and gcd(a,b).

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix b and try to find for how many a in 1 to n, a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Given that, let's denote d = gcd(a,b).

Then a = d * a', b = d * b', with gcd(a', b') = 1.

Then a + b = d(a' + b').

And b * d = d * b' * d = d² * b'.

So, d(a' + b') must be divisible by d² * b', which simplifies to a' + b' divisible by d * b'.

But since b' = 1, as established earlier, then a' + 1 must be divisible by d.

Wait, d = b, since b = d.

So, a' + 1 must be divisible by b.

Wait, a' = a / d = a / b.

So, a' + 1 = a/b + 1 = (a + b)/b.

But we already have that a + b is divisible by b * d = b * b = b².

So, (a + b)/b² must be an integer.

But (a + b)/b = a/b + 1.

So, (a/b + 1) must be divisible by b.

Thus, a/b + 1 ≡ 0 mod b.

Which implies a/b ≡ -1 mod b.

So, a ≡ -b mod b².

Therefore, a = k * b² - b for some integer k ≥ 1, and a ≤ n.

So, for each b from 1 to m, we need to find the number of k such that a = k * b² - b ≤ n and a ≥ 1.

So, k * b² - b ≤ n ⇒ k ≤ (n + b)/b².

And k ≥ 1.

So, for each b from 1 to m, the number of k is floor((n + b)/b²).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²).

This matches my earlier derivation.

Now, in the code, it's implementing:

i = 1

ans = 0

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans - 1

Wait, this is summing floor((n + i)/i²) for i from 1 to m, where i² <= n + i.

But according to the earlier derivation, it should be sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²).

So, why is the code only summing up to i where i² <= n + i?

Wait, perhaps for i > sqrt(n + i), floor((n + i)/i²) becomes 0.

Let’s see:

For i > sqrt(n + i), i² > n + i ⇒ (n + i)/i² < 1 ⇒ floor((n + i)/i²) = 0.

Therefore, the sum can be safely truncated to i where i² <= n + i.

So, the code is optimizing by only iterating up to i where i² <= n + i.

But in the derivation, b can go up to m, even if b > sqrt(n + b), but in that case, floor((n + b)/b²) would be 0.

But in the code, it's using i <= m and i * i <= n + i, which seems correct.

However, in the sample input where n=10, m=8, sum_{b=1}^{8} floor((10 + b)/b²) = 11 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 15, but the sample output is 14.

So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps for b=1, floor((10 + 1)/1) = 11, but in reality, there are only 10 possible a's: 1 through 10.

But according to the formula, it's 11.

Wait, (11 - 1) * 1² - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9, which is less than or equal to n=10.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, for b=1, k * 1² - 1 <= n ⇒ k - 1 <= 10 ⇒ k <= 11.

So, k can be from 1 to 11.

But a = k * 1 - 1 = k - 1, which for k=1 to 11 gives a=0 to 10.

But a must be >=1, so k starts from 2 to 11, giving a=1 to 10.

So, for b=1, there are 10 valid a's, but according to floor((n + b)/b²) = floor(11/1) = 11, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is an off-by-one error here.

Wait, let's recast the formula.

a = k * b² - b <= n ⇒ k <= (n + b)/b².

For b=1, k <= (10 + 1)/1 = 11.

But k must be at least 1.

But for k=1, a = 1*1 - 1 = 0, which is invalid since a >=1.

So, k must be at least 2 for b=1 to have a=1.

So, actually, for b=1, the number of valid k is floor((n + b)/b²) - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10, which matches the number of valid a's.

Similarly, for b=2, floor((10 + 2)/4) = 12/4 = 3.

k=1: a=4 - 2 = 2

k=2: a=8 - 2 = 6

k=3: a=12 - 2 = 10

So, a=2,6,10, which are 3 values.

So, in this case, floor((n + b)/b²) = 3, which matches.

Similarly, for b=3, floor((10 + 3)/9) = 13/9 = 1.

k=1: a=9 - 3 = 6 <=10

So, one valid a.

For b=4, floor((10 + 4)/16) = 14/16 = 0.

No valid a's.

Similarly for higher b's.

So, total is 10 + 3 + 1 + 0 + ... = 14, which matches the sample.

Therefore, the correct sum is sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²) - 1 for b=1.

Wait, but in the code, it's returning ans - 1, which would be 15 - 1 = 14, matching the sample.

So, it seems that for b=1, we need to subtract 1 from the floor((n + b)/b²).

But in the earlier calculation, for b=1, floor((n + b)/b²) is 11, but we have only 10 valid a's.

So, subtracting 1 gives 10, which is correct.

Similarly, for b=2, floor((n + b)/b²) is 3, which matches the number of a's.

For b=3, floor((n + b)/b²) is 1, which matches.

For b=1, floor((n + b)/b²) is 11, but we have only 10 a's, so subtracting 1 makes it correct.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²) - [b == 1 ? 1 : 0]

But in the code, it's simply ans - 1.

Which would subtract 1 only once, assuming b=1 is included in the sum.

But in the sample, it's 15 - 1 = 14, which matches.

Wait, but for b=1, floor((n + b)/b²) is n + 1.

But a starts from 1, not 0, so we need to adjust for k starting from 2, not 1.

Hence, for b=1, the number of valid a's is floor((n + b)/b²) - 1.

For b >=2, it's floor((n + b)/b²).

So, the total sum is sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²) - [b == 1 ? 1 : 0]

Or equivalently, sum_{b=1}^{m} floor((n + b)/b²) - 1.

Hence, subtracting 1 at the end achieves this.

Therefore, the code is correctly implementing this adjustment.

So, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
