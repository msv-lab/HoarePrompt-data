Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any number. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I perform this operation, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

But it's not just about reducing the total number of cards; I have to consider that the operation can only be performed on k cards with the same number. So, the frequency of each number in my hand plays a crucial role.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to minimize the number of cards in the end. To do that, I should perform the operation as many times as possible because each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, the key is to maximize the number of operations I can perform. Each operation requires k cards with the same number. Therefore, the number of operations I can perform for a particular number is equal to the frequency of that number divided by k (integer division).

Wait, not exactly. Because after each operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, which might have the same or different numbers. If I choose to make the new cards have the same number as some existing cards, I might be able to perform more operations in the future.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the hand. For each number that appears freq times, I can perform floor(freq / k) operations on it, each time reducing the total number of cards by 1 and potentially creating new cards.

But I need to consider that the new cards I create can be used in future operations. So, it's not just about the initial frequencies.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think recursively or iteratively, simulating the process.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical way to approach this.

Let me think in terms of how many operations I can perform in total.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1 (since I replace k cards with k-1 cards). So, if I can perform o operations, the final number of cards will be n - o.

Therefore, minimizing the number of cards is equivalent to maximizing the number of operations o.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Now, each operation requires k cards with the same number. So, the total number of operations I can perform is limited by the frequencies of the numbers in my hand.

But I need to consider that after performing some operations, I might create new cards that can be used in future operations.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the frequencies of the numbers. Suppose I have a number that appears freq times.

If freq < k, I can't perform any operation on it.

If freq >= k, I can perform floor(freq / k) operations on it, each time reducing the frequency by k and adding k-1 new cards.

Wait, but the new cards can have any number I choose. So, I could choose to make them have a number that I have plenty of, or a new number.

This flexibility seems important.

Maybe I should think in terms of grouping the cards into sets of k with the same number, and each such set can be replaced by k-1 cards of any number.

But this still seems a bit vague.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 5, k = 3

nums = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]

So, frequencies:

4: 3

1: 2

I can perform one operation on the three 4's, replacing them with two cards of any number. Let's say I choose to make them two 1's.

Now, my hand is: [1, 1, 1]

Now, I have three 1's. I can perform another operation, replacing three 1's with two cards of any number. Let's say two 1's again.

Now, my hand is: [1, 1]

So, the final number of cards is 2.

Is this the minimum possible? Yes, according to the problem.

Another example:

n = 1, k = 10

nums = [7]

Here, k > n, so I can't perform any operations. So, the final number of cards is 1.

Another example:

n = 7, k = 2

nums = [4, 2, 1, 100, 5, 2, 3]

Frequencies:

2: 2

1:1

100:1

5:1

4:1

3:1

I can perform one operation on the two 2's, replacing them with one card of any number. Let's say I choose to make it a 1.

Now, my hand is: [1,1,100,5,100,5,3]

Now, I have three 1's. I can perform one operation on these three 1's, replacing them with two cards of any number. But wait, k=2, so I need to choose two cards with the same number.

Wait, k=2, so I need to choose two cards with the same number to perform an operation.

After the first operation, I have [1,100,5,100,5,3] plus two new cards of any number. Let's say I choose to make them two 1's.

Now, my hand is: [1,100,5,100,5,3,1,1]

Now, I have three 1's again. I can perform another operation on two of them, replacing them with one card of any number.

And so on.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me consider the general case.

I need to maximize the number of operations o, such that o is the sum over all numbers of floor(freq[i] / k).

But, each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, and creates k-1 new cards.

Wait, but the new cards can have any number, so I can potentially create more frequencies to perform more operations.

This seems like a recursive process, where the new cards can be used in future operations.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a formula that directly gives me the minimum number of cards.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a number that appears freq times.

If freq < k, I can't do anything with it.

If freq >= k, I can perform floor(freq / k) operations on it, each time reducing the frequency by k and adding k-1 new cards.

So, after performing floor(freq / k) operations on it, the remaining frequency is freq % k.

But the k-1 new cards added each time can be considered as part of the total cards, and potentially used in future operations if they have the same number.

This still seems recursive.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a process where I repeatedly perform operations on the frequencies until no more operations can be performed.

But simulating this process for each test case might be too slow if n and k are large, but in this problem, n <= 100 and k <= 100, so it's manageable.

But I'm looking for a smarter way.

Let me try to find a mathematical expression for the minimum number of cards.

I found that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, if I can perform o operations, the final number of cards is n - o.

Therefore, I need to maximize o.

But o is limited by the frequencies of the numbers.

Wait, perhaps o is the maximum number of times I can perform the operation, which is the sum over all frequencies freq of floor(freq / k).

But I think this might not be entirely accurate because the new cards created in each operation can be used in future operations.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have a frequency freq for a number.

I can perform floor(freq / k) operations on it, each time reducing freq by k and adding k-1 new cards.

So, after performing floor(freq / k) operations, the remaining frequency is freq % k.

But the k-1 new cards added each time can be considered as part of the total cards, but their numbers are chosen by me.

If I choose their numbers wisely, I can potentially create new frequencies that allow me to perform more operations.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the new cards can be used to create new sets of k cards, provided that I choose their numbers to match existing frequencies.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of k.

Each set of k cards can be reduced to k-1 cards, and so on.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum number of cards that can be grouped into sets of k, and then calculate the remaining cards.

But again, it's not straightforward.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k, and then a list of n integers.

Then, it checks if k > n:

- If yes, it prints n (since no operations can be performed).

- If k == n:

- It prints k - 1.

- Else:

- It calls a function func_1 to get the frequency table of the numbers.

- If k is in the frequency values, it prints k - 1.

- Else, it prints n.

Wait, this seems suspicious.

First, if k > n, no operations can be performed because you can't choose k cards from fewer than k cards. So, printing n makes sense.

If k == n, you can perform one operation, reducing the number of cards from n to n - 1. So, printing k - 1 also makes sense.

But in the else case, it gets the frequency table and checks if k is in the frequency values. If it is, it prints k - 1; else, it prints n.

This seems too simplistic.

In the first example, n=5, k=3, frequencies are {4:3, 1:2}. Since 3 is in the frequency values, it would print 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the first example.

In the second example, n=1, k=10. Since k > n, it would print 1, which matches the second example.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, frequencies are {4:1,1:2,2:2,100:1,5:1,3:1}. Since 2 is in the frequency values, it would print 2 - 1 = 1, which matches the third example.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, frequencies are {1:10}. Since 4 is in the frequency values (10 >= 4), it would print 4 - 1 = 3, which matches the fourth example.

In the fifth example, n=5, k=2, frequencies are {3:1,8:1,1:1,48:1,7:1}. Since 2 is not in the frequency values (all frequencies are 1), it would print 5.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should be 5, which matches.

In the sixth example, n=6, k=2, frequencies are {10:2,20:2,30:1,40:1}. Since 2 is in the frequency values, it would print 2 - 1 = 1, matching the sample output.

In the seventh example, n=6, k=3, frequencies are {10:2,20:2,30:1,40:1}. Since 3 is not in the frequency values (no number appears 3 times), it would print 6, matching the sample output.

So, in all the sample cases, this program seems to be giving the correct output.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me think about another case.

Suppose n=6, k=3, frequencies: {1:3,2:3}.

According to the program, k=3 is in the frequency values, so it would print 3 - 1 = 2.

But let's see what the actual minimum number of cards is.

First operation: choose three 1's, replace them with two cards of any number, say two 2's.

Now, frequencies: {2:5}.

Second operation: choose three 2's, replace them with two 2's.

Now, frequencies: {2:4}.

Third operation: choose three 2's, replace them with two 2's.

Now, frequencies: {2:3}.

Fourth operation: choose three 2's, replace them with two 2's.

Now, frequencies: {2:2}.

No more operations can be performed.

So, final number of cards is 2, but according to the program, it would print 3 - 1 = 2, which is correct.

Another case: n=7, k=3, frequencies: {1:3,2:3,3:1}.

According to the program, k=3 is in the frequency values, so it would print 3 - 1 = 2.

Let's see:

First operation: choose three 1's, replace with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: {1:2, 2:3, 3:1}.

Second operation: choose three 2's, replace with two 2's.

Now, frequencies: {1:2, 2:2, 3:1}.

No more operations can be performed.

Final number of cards is 5, but according to the program, it prints 2, which is less than the actual minimum.

Wait, this is a problem. The program is printing 2, but in reality, I can't have fewer than 5 cards.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the program should print the minimum number of cards possible.

In this case, it's printing 2, but actually, I can't reach 2 cards.

So, the program is wrong in this case.

Therefore, the answer is:

**False**

But wait, maybe I misunderstood the program.

Looking back at the program:

if k in freq.values():

print(k - 1)

else:

print(n)

In the above case, frequencies are {1:2, 2:2, 3:1}, and k=3 is not in freq.values(), so it would print n=7, which is correct.

Wait, no. In the earlier step, after operations, frequencies become {1:2, 2:2, 3:1}, and k=3 is not in these frequencies, so it would print 7, which is more than the actual minimum of 5.

Wait, but in the initial step, frequencies are {1:3,2:3,3:1}, and k=3 is in freq.values(), so it would print 3 - 1 = 2, which is incorrect because actually, the minimum is 5.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Initially, frequencies are {1:3,2:3,3:1}.

k=3 is in freq.values(), so the program prints 3 - 1 = 2.

But as I simulated, after operations, I end up with {1:2,2:2,3:1}, totaling 5 cards.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the answer is:

**False**

But according to the sample inputs, it seems correct.

Maybe there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the logic is that if any frequency is >= k, then the minimum number of cards is k - 1.

But that doesn't seem right, as shown in the above counterexample.

Alternatively, maybe the logic is that if any frequency is exactly k, then the minimum is k - 1.

But in the program, it checks if k is in freq.values(), which means frequency exactly equal to k.

But in the counterexample, frequencies are {1:3,2:3,3:1}, and k=3 is in freq.values(), so it prints 3 - 1 = 2, but actually, the minimum is 5.

So, it's incorrect.

Hence, the answer is:

**False**

But perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Maybe the logic is that if any frequency is >=k, then the minimum is k - 1.

But in the program, it's checking if k is in freq.values(), which is exact equality.

Wait, but in the first sample input, frequencies are {4:3,1:2}, and k=3 is in freq.values(), so it prints 3 - 1 = 2, which matches.

In the fourth sample input, frequencies are {1:10}, and k=4 is less than 10, so it prints 4 - 1 = 3, which matches.

But in my counterexample, frequencies are {1:3,2:3,3:1}, and k=3 is in freq.values(), so it prints 2, but actually, the minimum is 5.

So, it's incorrect.

Hence, the answer is:

**False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
