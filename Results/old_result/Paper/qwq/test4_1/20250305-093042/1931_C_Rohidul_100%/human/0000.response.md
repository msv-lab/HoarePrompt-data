Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers: i, j, and x, where i and j are indices between 1 and n, and x is any integer. Then, I set all elements from index i to j to be equal to x, and the cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements I'm changing.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the minimum cost to do this. I can perform this operation at most once.

First, I need to understand what happens if I don't perform any operation. Well, if all elements are already equal, then the cost is zero, which is perfect. But if they're not all equal, I need to make them equal by changing some of them.

Since I can only perform the operation once, I need to choose which part of the array to change to make all elements equal in the most efficient way, minimizing the cost.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Change the entire array to a single value.

If I change the entire array to a single value, the cost would be n, which is the total number of elements. But maybe I can do better by leaving some parts of the array unchanged.

Option 2: Identify sections of the array that already have the same value and only change the parts that don't.

This seems more efficient. If I can find the longest segment of the array that has the same value, I can leave that unchanged and only change the remaining parts.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation, which means I can only change one segment of the array to a specific value.

Wait, no. Actually, the operation allows me to change one contiguous segment of the array to a single value x, and I can choose i, j, and x.

So, I can choose to change one substring to a specific value, and the rest will remain as is. After this operation, all elements need to be equal.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x such that after changing the segment from i to j to x, the entire array becomes x.

But that doesn't make sense because if I change a segment to x, the elements outside that segment remain unchanged. So, for the entire array to be x, I need the elements outside the segment to already be x.

Wait, maybe I need to set the segment from i to j to x, and choose x such that the elements outside that segment are already x.

In that case, the cost would be (j - i + 1), and the elements from i to j are set to x, while the elements outside are already x, so the entire array becomes x.

But, if the elements outside the segment are not all equal to x, then this won't work.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x to be the value that appears most frequently in the array, and then find the minimal segment to change so that the entire array becomes x.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the example to understand better.

In the first example:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

The output is 4.

If I change indices 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4.

That makes sense.

In the second example:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Output is 0, since all elements are already equal.

Third example:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Output is 2.

If I change indices 4 and 5 to 8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], and the cost is 2.

Okay, so the strategy seems to be: find the minimal number of elements to change so that the entire array becomes equal, with only one operation.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation, which is changing a contiguous segment to a single value.

So, I need to choose a segment and a value to set that segment to, such that, after this change, all elements in the array are equal.

I need to minimize the cost, which is the length of the segment I'm changing.

Wait, but I need to make sure that after changing that segment, all elements are equal.

So, let's think about it differently.

Suppose I choose to set the entire array to a specific value, say x.

Then, I need to change all elements that are not equal to x to x.

But I can only perform one operation, which is changing a contiguous segment.

So, I need to find a contiguous segment such that, if I change all elements in this segment to x, then all elements in the array become x.

That means, the elements outside this segment must already be equal to x.

So, the segment I'm changing should cover all the elements that are not equal to x.

In other words, the parts of the array that are already x should be outside this segment.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the length of the array that is already equal to x.

Then, the segment I need to change will be the part that is not equal to x.

But, since I can only perform one operation, I need to choose x such that the part that is not equal to x is a contiguous segment.

So, I need to choose x and a contiguous segment such that all elements outside this segment are equal to x.

Then, the cost is the length of this segment.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the length of the array that is already equal to x, and ensure that the part that is not equal to x is a contiguous segment.

That's the key.

So, for each possible x, find the longest contiguous segment where all elements are equal to x, and the parts outside this segment are all equal to x.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think differently.

I need to choose a value x and a contiguous segment to set to x, such that, after setting that segment to x, the entire array is equal to x.

That means, the elements outside this segment must already be equal to x.

So, the part that needs to be set to x is the part that is not already x.

But, these parts that are not x must form a contiguous segment.

So, for the array to become all x after one operation, the elements that are not equal to x must form a contiguous segment.

Then, the cost is the length of that segment.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the elements not equal to x form a contiguous segment, and this segment is as small as possible.

Wait, but in the first example:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

If I choose x = 1, then the elements not equal to 1 are positions 2,3,4,5, which form a contiguous segment from 2 to 5, length 4.

So, cost is 4.

If I choose x = 2, the elements not equal to 2 are positions 1,3,4,5,6, which are not contiguous.

So, x = 2 is invalid.

Similarly, for x = 3, elements not equal to 3 are positions 1,2,4,5,6, which are not contiguous.

Same for x = 4 and x =5.

So, only x =1 works, with cost 4.

In the second example:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Choose x =1, no elements to change, cost 0.

Third example:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Choose x =8, elements not equal to 8 are positions 4 and 5, which form a contiguous segment, length 2.

So, cost is 2.

Okay, so the strategy is:

- Iterate through all possible x (from 1 to n, since a_i are from 1 to n).

- For each x, find the positions where a[i] != x.

- Check if these positions form a single contiguous segment.

- If they do, then the cost is the length of this segment.

- Among all such x, choose the one with the minimal cost.

- It's guaranteed that at least one such x exists.

But, this approach would be O(t * n^2), which is too slow because t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, with total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, I need a more efficient way.

Wait, perhaps for each x, I can find the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

Then, the segment from first to last should be the only segment that needs to be changed to x, and the parts outside are already x.

So, for each x, find the minimum i where a[i] != x, and the maximum j where a[j] !=x.

Then, the segment from i to j needs to be changed to x, and the cost is (j - i +1).

Then, among all such x, choose the one with the minimal (j - i +1).

But, I need to make sure that between i and j, all elements are covered, and outside that, all elements are equal to x.

Wait, but in the first example, for x=1, the segment from 2 to 5 needs to be changed, and outside that, elements are already 1.

Similarly, in the third example, for x=8, segment from 4 to 5 needs to be changed, and outside that, elements are already 8.

So, this seems correct.

So, the plan is:

- For each x, find the minimum i where a[i] != x, and the maximum j where a[j] !=x.

- Then, the cost is (j - i +1).

- If no such i exists (all elements are x), then cost is 0.

- Choose the minimum cost among all x.

But, iterating over all x from 1 to n for each test case would be acceptable since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so it should be fine time-wise.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum length of a prefix and a suffix that have the same value, and are equal to each other.

Then, the middle part would be the one to change.

Wait, in the first example:

[1,2,3,4,5,1]

The longest prefix and suffix with the same value are [1] and [1], so the segment to change is from index 2 to 5, length 4.

In the second example:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

The entire array is already equal, so cost is 0.

In the third example:

[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

The longest prefix and suffix with the same value are [8,8,8] and [8,8,8], so the segment to change is from index 4 to 5, length 2.

Wait, this seems promising.

So, the idea is to find the longest prefix and suffix that have the same value, and are equal to each other, and then change the middle segment.

Then, the cost would be n - (length of prefix + length of suffix).

But, we need to make sure that the prefix and suffix have the same value.

So, perhaps iterate through possible lengths of prefix and suffix, from 0 to n, and check if the first st elements and the last st elements have the same value, and find the maximum such st.

Then, the cost would be n - st, where st is the maximum length where prefix and suffix have the same value.

Wait, but in the first example, st=1 (first and last element are both 1), so cost is 6 -1 =5, but the correct cost is 4.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 2*st + st, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's n - max(st, end), where st is the length of the prefix, and end is the length of the suffix, and they have the same value.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (st + end - overlap), but overlapping is zero.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The provided code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

le = len(a)

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

(st, end) = (1, 1)

while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:

l += 1

st += 1

while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:

r -= 1

end += 1

ans = le - max(st, end)

if a[0] == a[-1]:

ans = max(0, le - (st + end -1))

print(ans)

So, it's trying to find the length of the prefix and suffix that have the same value.

It starts by finding the length of the prefix that has the same value as the first element, and the length of the suffix that has the same value as the last element.

Then, if the first and last elements are equal, it sets ans to n - (st + end -1), else, n - max(st, end).

Wait, in the first example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,1]

st =1 (only first element is 1)

end =1 (last element is 1)

a[0] == a[-1], so ans = max(0, 6 - (1 +1 -1)) = max(0, 6-1) =5, but correct answer is 4.

So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's counting wrong.

Wait, in the third example:

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

st =3 (first three 8's)

end =3 (last three 8's)

a[0] == a[-1], so ans = max(0, 8 - (3+3 -1)) = max(0,8-5)=3, but correct answer is 2.

So, this is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the correct approach is to find the maximum of st + end - overlap, where st and end are the lengths of the prefix and suffix with the same value, and overlap is the common part if they overlap.

But, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible x, find the minimal segment to change so that the entire array is x.

Then, among all x, choose the one with the minimal segment to change.

So, for each x, find the leftmost i where a[i] !=x, and the rightmost j where a[j] !=x, and set the segment from i to j to x.

Then, the cost is (j - i +1).

Then, choose the x where this cost is minimized.

So, in the first example, for x=1:

i=1 (a[1]=2 !=1), j=5 (a[5]=5 !=1), so cost=5-1 +1=5, but in the solution, it's 4.

Wait, indices are 1-based in the problem, but in Python, they are 0-based.

Wait, no, the problem uses 1-based indexing.

But in Python, lists are 0-based.

So, in the first example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,1]

For x=1:

i=2 (a[2]=2 !=1), j=5 (a[5]=5 !=1), so cost=5-2 +1=4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the code above, it's setting st=1 (only first element is 1), and end=1 (last element is 1), and since a[0]==a[-1], ans=6-(1+1-1)=6-1=5, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust how st and end are calculated.

Wait, perhaps st should be the length of the prefix that is equal to a[0], and end the length of the suffix that is equal to a[-1], and if a[0]==a[-1], then the overlapping part is counted only once.

So, in the first example:

st=1 (only a[0]==1), end=1 (only a[-1]==1), and a[0]==a[-1], so ans=6 - (1 +1 -1)=6-1=5, but correct is 4.

Still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be n - (st + end - overlap), where overlap is the length of the common part if prefix and suffix overlap.

But in this case, st=1, end=1, and overlap=0 (since prefix ends at index 0 and suffix starts at index 5, no overlap), so ans=6 - (1 +1 -0)=6-2=4, which matches.

Wait, but in the third example:

a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

st=3 (a[0:3]==8), end=3 (a[5:8]==8), and a[0]==a[-1]==8, so overlap=1 (since prefix ends at index 2 and suffix starts at index 5, no overlap).

So, ans=8 - (3 +3 -0)=8-6=2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the first example, with st=1, end=1, overlap=0, ans=6 - (1+1 -0)=6-2=4, which matches.

But earlier, when I tried this formula, it didn't match, but now it does.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in calculating overlap.

In the code provided, when a[0]==a[-1], it sets ans=max(0, n - (st + end -1)), which in the first example would be 6 - (1 +1 -1)=6-1=5, which is incorrect.

But according to the correct formula, it should be 6 - (1 +1 -0)=4.

So, the code is wrong.

Wait, but in the third example, st=3, end=3, so ans=8 - (3 +3 -1)=8-5=3, but correct is 2.

Wait, confusion.

Wait, perhaps overlap is the length of the intersection of prefix and suffix.

In the first example, prefix is a[0:1], suffix is a[5:6], no overlap, so overlap=0.

In the third example, prefix is a[0:3], suffix is a[5:8], no overlap, so overlap=0.

So, ans=n - (st + end - overlap)

In the first example, 6 - (1 +1 -0)=4, correct.

In the third example, 8 - (3 +3 -0)=2, correct.

In the second example, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], st=7, end=7, a[0]==a[-1], overlap=7, ans=7 - (7 +7 -7)=7-7=0, correct.

Wait, but in the code, when a[0]==a[-1], it sets ans=max(0, n - (st + end -1)), which in the third example would be 8 - (3 +3 -1)=8-5=3, but correct is 2.

So, the code is wrong.

It should be ans = n - (st + end - overlap), where overlap is the length of the intersection of prefix and suffix.

But in the code, it's using n - (st + end -1), assuming overlap=1 when a[0]==a[-1], which is incorrect.

In reality, overlap is zero unless the prefix and suffix overlap, which in the first example they don't, and in the third example they don't, but in the second example they do.

So, perhaps a better way is:

- Find the maximum length where prefix and suffix have the same value and are equal.

- Then, ans = n - (st + end - overlap), where overlap is min(end, len(prefix) - (n - end)).

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe it's better to iterate over all possible x, find the minimal (j - i +1) where i is the smallest index with a[i] !=x, and j is the largest index with a[j] !=x.

Then, choose the x with the smallest (j - i +1).

This seems straightforward, but might be too slow.

But since n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, so overall time complexity should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

So, for each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Initialize min_cost to n.

- For each x from 1 to n:

- Find the smallest i where a[i] !=x.

- Find the largest j where a[j] !=x.

- If such i and j exist, set cost = j - i +1.

- Else, cost =0.

- Set min_cost to the minimum of min_cost and cost.

- Print min_cost.

But, to optimize, since n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but total n is up to 2e5, it should be fine.

But perhaps we can do better.

Alternative approach:

- Find the most frequent value x in the array.

- Find the minimal segment that needs to be changed to make all elements equal to x.

- The minimal segment is the segment from the first occurrence of a value !=x to the last occurrence of a value !=x.

- So, for the most frequent x, find the positions where a[i] !=x, and set the segment from the first to the last of these positions.

- The cost is (j - i +1).

- This would be correct because choosing the most frequent x minimizes the segment to change.

Wait, but in the first example, x=1 appears twice, x=2 once, x=3 once, x=4 once, x=5 once.

So, x=1 is the most frequent.

Then, positions where a[i] !=1 are 2,3,4,5.

So, segment from 2 to 5, cost=4, which matches.

In the third example, x=8 appears four times, which is the most frequent.

Positions where a[i] !=8 are 4 and 5.

So, segment from 4 to 5, cost=2, which matches.

In the second example, x=1 appears seven times.

No positions where a[i] !=1, so cost=0.

So, this seems correct.

So, the minimal cost is n - freq[x], where freq[x] is the frequency of x in the array.

Wait, but in the first example, n=6, freq[1]=2, n - freq[1]=4, which matches.

In the third example, n=8, freq[8]=4, n - freq[8]=4, but the correct answer is 2.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, no, because in the third example, even though freq[8]=4, the positions where a[i] !=8 are only positions 4 and 5, which are contiguous, so cost is 2, not 8-4=4.

So, the cost is not n - freq[x], but rather the length of the segment to change, which is j - i +1.

So, to minimize this, I need to choose x such that the positions where a[i] !=x form a single contiguous segment, and among such x, choose the one with the minimal j - i +1.

So, it's not just about choosing the most frequent x, but choosing x such that the non-x elements form a single contiguous segment.

In the first example, x=1: positions 2,3,4,5 need to be changed.

x=2: positions 1,3,4,5,6 need to be changed, which are not contiguous.

x=3: positions 1,2,4,5,6 need to be changed, not contiguous.

x=4: positions 1,2,3,5,6 need to be changed, not contiguous.

x=5: positions 1,2,3,4,6 need to be changed, not contiguous.

So, only x=1 is valid, with cost 4.

In the third example, x=8: positions 4,5 need to be changed, which are contiguous, cost=2.

x=1: positions 1,2,3,6,7,8 need to be changed, not contiguous.

x=2: positions 1,2,3,6,7,8 need to be changed, not contiguous.

So, only x=8 is valid, with cost 2.

In the second example, x=1: no positions need to be changed, cost 0.

So, in this case, there may be multiple x with the positions to change forming a contiguous segment, and I need to choose the one with the minimal cost.

So, perhaps the approach is:

- Find all x such that the positions where a[i] !=x form a single contiguous segment.

- For each such x, compute the cost as j - i +1.

- Choose the x with the minimal cost.

- If no such x exists, which according to the problem, it's guaranteed that it does, so no need to handle this case.

But, to implement this efficiently, I need an efficient way to find such x.

One way is:

- For each x, find all positions where a[i] !=x.

- Check if these positions form a single contiguous segment.

- If yes, compute the cost as j - i +1.

- Choose the minimal cost among all such x.

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

So, I need a smarter way.

Alternative idea:

- Find the maximum substring where all elements are equal.

- Then, the minimal cost is n - len of this maximum substring.

Because, you can choose x to be the value of this maximum substring, and change the parts before and after it to x.

Wait, but in the first example, the maximum substring with equal elements is [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [1], so length 1.

Then, n -1 =5, but correct answer is 4.

So, incorrect.

In the third example, maximum substring with equal elements is [8,8,8] appearing twice, length 3.

Then, n -3=5, but correct answer is 2.

So, doesn't work.

Alternative idea:

- Find the maximum length of a prefix and suffix that have the same value and are equal.

- Then, the minimal cost is n - (st + end - overlap).

- Where st is the length of the prefix, end is the length of the suffix, and overlap is the intersection length.

But, as seen earlier, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible split points.

- Find the minimal cost by trying all possible segments to change.

But this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal j - i +1 such that all elements outside [i,j] are equal.

So, for each possible segment [i,j], check if all elements outside [i,j] are equal, and keep the minimal j - i +1 among such segments.

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

Need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can fix the value x and find the minimal segment to change so that the entire array is x.

- Find the first i where a[i] !=x.

- Find the last j where a[j] !=x.

- Set the segment [i,j] to x.

- The cost is j - i +1.

- Choose the x where this cost is minimized.

So, for each x, find the minimal j - i +1 where i is the smallest index with a[i] !=x, and j is the largest index with a[j] !=x.

If no such i and j exist, cost is 0.

Then, choose the minimal cost among all x.

This seems correct, and since total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, and for each test case, iterating over x from 1 to n, and finding i and j, it should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read n and a.

- Initialize min_cost to n.

- For x from 1 to n:

- Find the smallest i where a[i] !=x.

- Find the largest j where a[j] !=x.

- If such i and j exist, set cost = j - i +1.

- Else, cost =0.

- Set min_cost to the minimum of min_cost and cost.

- Print min_cost.

But, to optimize, I can precompute for each x, the smallest i and largest j where a[i] !=x.

But, in Python, iterating over x from 1 to n for each test case might be slow if n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but since total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, it should be fine.

Alternatively, I can find the value x that appears the most times in the array, and set min_cost to n - freq[x].

But, as seen in the third example, freq[8]=4, n=8, n - freq[8]=4, but the correct cost is 2.

So, this is incorrect.

Hence, the correct approach is to iterate over all possible x and find the minimal j - i +1 where a[i] !=x and a[j] !=x.

Now, looking back at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

le = len(a)

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

(st, end) = (1, 1)

while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:

l += 1

st += 1

while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:

r -= 1

end += 1

ans = le - max(st, end)

if a[0] == a[-1]:

ans = max(0, le - (st + end -1))

print(ans)

This code seems to be trying to compute something similar to what I described, but it's not correct, as seen in the first and third examples.

In the first example, it sets st=1 and end=1, and since a[0]==a[-1], ans=6 - (1 +1 -1)=6-1=5, but correct is 4.

In the third example, st=3 and end=3, and a[0]==a[-1], so ans=8 - (3 +3 -1)=8-5=3, but correct is 2.

So, the code is incorrect.

The correct approach should be to find, for each x, the minimal segment [i,j] to change so that the entire array is x, and choose the x with the minimal such segment.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
