Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X. X can be as large as 10^18, which is a really big number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, and they maintain their relative order in the array. Also, even if subsequences have the same elements but different positions, they are considered different. For example, in the array [2, 2], there are two different subsequences [2] corresponding to each 2.

The problem allows me to output any array that satisfies the condition, as long as it has at most 200 elements and each element is within [-1e9, 1e9]. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

Let me think about how to count the number of increasing subsequences in an array. For a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated by considering all possible non-empty subsets of the array that are in increasing order.

But calculating this directly for large X is not feasible, especially since X can be up to 10^18. So, I need a smarter way to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

I recall that in sequences where elements are strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1, where n is the length of the sequence, because every non-empty subset is an increasing subsequence. However, in this problem, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing; it can have repeats, and the subsequences must be strictly increasing.

Wait, but in the example given, for X=2, the output is an array of length 1 with element 0. Let's see: an array of length 1 has only one subsequence, which is [0], so that's one subsequence, but according to the problem, X=2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem, it says that an empty subsequence is also considered increasing, but in the example for X=2, with an array of length 1, there are two subsequences: the empty subsequence and the single element subsequence. So, total increasing subsequences are 2, which matches X=2.

Ah, so the total number of increasing subsequences includes the empty subsequence.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that the empty subsequence is also increasing, so for an array of length n, the total number of increasing subsequences can be up to 2^n (including the empty one).

But in the example, for X=2, with n=1, we have 2 subsequences: empty and [0]. For X=5, with n=3, how many increasing subsequences are there?

Let's consider the array [0,1,0]. The possible subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first element)

- [1]

- [0] (second element)

- [0,1]

- [0,0] (but this is not strictly increasing, so it shouldn't be counted)

- [0,1,0] (not strictly increasing)

So, the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [1]

- [0] (second)

- [0,1]

Total of 5 subsequences, which matches the example.

Okay, so the total number of increasing subsequences is the number of non-empty strictly increasing subsequences plus the empty one.

So, for an array, the total number of increasing subsequences is the number of strictly increasing subsequences plus one (for the empty subsequence).

Wait, but in the example, there are 5 increasing subsequences, including the empty one. But in the array [0,1,0], there are 4 non-empty strictly increasing subsequences: [0], [1], [0], [0,1], plus the empty one, totaling 5.

So, the total number is the number of strictly increasing subsequences plus one.

Given that, the problem seems to be asking for the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one, to be exactly X.

So, I need to find an array where the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one, is exactly X.

Given that, I need a way to construct an array whose total number of increasing subsequences is X.

Given that the total number is the number of strictly increasing subsequences plus one, I need the number of strictly increasing subsequences to be X - 1.

But I need to find a way to construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences relates to the structure of the array.

One approach is to consider building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences can be controlled.

I recall that in binary representations, any number can be represented as a sum of powers of two. Maybe I can use that here.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,...]. In this case, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty one.

But I need to be able to have exactly X increasing subsequences, which might not be a power of two.

Maybe I can construct the array by combining smaller sequences in a way that their total number of increasing subsequences multiplies or adds up to X.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of certain elements to reach the total count of X.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in certain parts of the array.

But I'm not sure about that.

Let me consider the properties of increasing subsequences.

Suppose I have a sequence where some elements are equal, like [1,2,2,3]. In this case, the increasing subsequences would be:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2] (first or second 2)

- [3]

- [1,2] (first 2 or second 2)

- [1,3]

- [2,3] (from first or second 2)

- [1,2,3] (from first or second 2)

So, total of 1 (empty) + 3 (single elements) + 3 (two-element subsequences) + 1 (three-element subsequence) = 8 increasing subsequences.

But wait, X=13 in one of the examples, and the output is an array of length 5 with elements [2,2,3,4,2]. I need to verify how many increasing subsequences this array has.

Possible increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first, second, or fifth)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3] (first or second 2)

- [2,4] (first or second 2)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (first or second 2)

So, total of 1 (empty) + 3 (single elements) + 3 (two-element subsequences) + 1 (three-element subsequence) = 8, but the example says X=13. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's list all possible increasing subsequences for [2,2,3,4,2]:

- Empty

- [2] (positions 1,2,5)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3] (position 1-3 or 2-3)

- [2,4] (position 1-4 or 2-4 or 5-4, but 5-4 is not increasing since 2 < 4 and positions 5 before 4)

- [2,3,4] (position 1-3-4 or 2-3-4)

- [3,4]

- [2,4] (only positions 1-4 and 2-4, since 5-4 is not increasing)

Wait, position 5 is 2, and position 4 is 4, but since position 5 comes after position 4, [2,4] from 5-4 is not increasing.

So, total increasing subsequences:

- Empty: 1

- Single elements: 2 (positions 1,2,5), 3 (position 3), 4 (position 4) → 4

- Two elements: [2,3], [2,4], [3,4] → 3

- Three elements: [2,3,4] → 1

Total: 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 9, but the example shows X=13. So, perhaps I'm missing some subsequences.

Wait, maybe I need to consider all possible increasing subsequences more carefully.

Let's list all possible increasing subsequences for [2,2,3,4,2]:

- Empty

- [2] (positions 1,2,5)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3] (positions 1-3, 2-3)

- [2,4] (positions 1-4, 2-4)

- [3,4] (position 3-4)

- [2,3,4] (positions 1-3-4, 2-3-4)

So, that's 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8, but the example shows X=13. There must be something wrong with my counting.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some subsequences. Let's see:

- [2] (position 1)

- [2] (position 2)

- [2] (position 5)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3] (1-3 and 2-3)

- [2,4] (1-4 and 2-4)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (1-3-4 and 2-3-4)

That's 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 9, but according to the example, X=13. So, perhaps I'm missing some subsequences.

Wait, maybe there are more subsequences that I'm not considering. For example, [2,4] from position 5 to position 4 is not allowed because position 5 comes after position 4, but the value is the same, so it's not increasing.

Wait, no, position 5 is 2 and position 4 is 4, but position 5 comes after position 4, so [2,4] from 5 to 4 is not a valid subsequence because the positions are not in increasing order.

So, I think my count of 9 is correct, but the example shows X=13. There must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the problem counts the empty subsequence differently, or perhaps I'm missing some subsequences.

Let me try to calculate the total number of increasing subsequences for the example where X=13 and the array is [2,2,3,4,2].

Total number of increasing subsequences:

- Empty: 1

- Single elements: 2 (positions 1,2,5), 3 (position 3), 4 (position 4) → 4

- Two elements: [2,3] (positions 1-3 and 2-3), [2,4] (positions 1-4 and 2-4), [3,4] (positions 3-4) → 4

- Three elements: [2,3,4] (positions 1-3-4 and 2-3-4) → 2

Total: 1 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 11, still not 13. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there are more subsequences involving position 5. Let's see:

- [2,4] from position 5 to position 4 is invalid because positions must be in increasing order.

- [2,3,4] only from positions 1-3-4 and 2-3-4, not involving position 5.

Wait, maybe I need to consider subsequences that skip some positions.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some subsequences. Let's try to calculate it differently.

I recall that the total number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Let me think about a DP approach to count the number of increasing subsequences in an array.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i.

Then, dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for all j < i and a[j] < a[i]) + 1 (for the subsequence consisting only of a[i]).

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

Wait, let's apply this to the example [2,2,3,4,2].

Initialize dp array for each position:

- dp[1] = 1 (only [2])

- dp[2]: a[2]=2, which is equal to a[1]=2, so no previous j < 2 with a[j] < a[2], so dp[2] = 1 ([2])

- dp[3]: a[3]=3 > a[1]=2 and a[2]=2, so dp[3] = dp[1] + dp[2] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ([3], [2,3] from position 1, [2,3] from position 2)

- dp[4]: a[4]=4 > a[1], a[2], a[3], so dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[3] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 ([4], [2,4] from position 1, [2,4] from position 2, [3,4], [2,3,4] from position 1 and 2)

- dp[5]: a[5]=2, only a[1]=2 and a[2]=2 are less than or equal, but not less than, so no previous j with a[j] < a[5], so dp[5] = 1 ([2])

Total number of increasing subsequences: dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[3] + dp[4] + dp[5] + 1 (empty) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 13.

Ah, so the total is indeed 13, matching the example.

So, my earlier manual counting was incomplete because I didn't account for all possible subsequences correctly.

Therefore, to solve this problem, I need a way to construct an array such that the sum of dp[i] over all i, plus one for the empty subsequence, equals X.

Given that, I need to find a way to build such an array with at most 200 elements.

I need to think about how to maximize or minimize the number of increasing subsequences based on the array's structure.

One idea is to use repeated elements to control the number of subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations.

I recall that in binary, any number can be represented as a sum of powers of two.

Similarly, perhaps I can construct the array in such a way that the total number of increasing subsequences is a sum of certain values corresponding to the binary representation of X.

Wait, but X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, so I need a way to represent X as a sum of up to 200 terms, each of which is a power of two.

But I need to relate this to the array's structure.

Let me consider building the array in levels, where each level corresponds to a certain value, and the number of times a value appears controls the number of subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding a new element to the array can potentially double the number of increasing subsequences, similar to how binary works.

Wait, perhaps not exactly double, but in a way that allows me to build up to X.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider starting with an empty array, which has one subsequence: the empty one.

Then, when I add an element, it can either be included or not in the subsequences.

But in this problem, since the subsequences must be strictly increasing, adding an element that is larger than all previous elements will double the number of increasing subsequences (since each existing subsequence can choose to include or not include the new element).

Wait, but only if the new element is larger than all previous elements.

In that case, the number of increasing subsequences would indeed double, because for each existing subsequence, we can choose to append the new element or not.

But if the new element is not larger than all previous elements, then it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by adding elements in such a way that each new element is larger than all previous ones, effectively doubling the number of increasing subsequences each time.

In that case, starting from the empty subsequence (1), adding a new element would make it 2, adding another larger element would make it 4, and so on.

So, if I have n elements in strictly increasing order, the total number of increasing subsequences would be 2^n.

But in this approach, I can only achieve X being a power of two, which is not sufficient for X up to 10^18.

So, I need a way to combine elements in a way that allows me to reach any X up to 10^18.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary and correspond each bit to a certain substructure in the array.

For example, I can have groups of elements where each group corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

Each group would contribute a certain number of increasing subsequences corresponding to its bit's value.

But I need to think carefully about how to structure these groups.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that adding an element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences, and adding an element that is equal to a previous element doesn't change the count.

Wait, adding an element equal to a previous element would only add new subsequences that include this element, but since the subsequences must be strictly increasing, adding an equal element doesn't add any new strictly increasing subsequences.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [2,2,3,4,2], there are multiple 2's, and they do contribute to different subsequences as long as their positions are different.

But for strictly increasing subsequences, adding an equal element doesn't increase the number of strictly increasing subsequences, because [2,2] is not strictly increasing.

Wait, but [2,3] with two different 2's is allowed, as long as the positions are in order.

Wait, no, positions must be in increasing order, but the values must be strictly increasing.

So, [2,3] is allowed regardless of which 2 is chosen, as long as the position of 2 is before the position of 3.

But [2,2] is not allowed because it's not strictly increasing.

So, adding an element equal to a previous one allows for more subsequences that include the new element, but only if they don't violate the strictly increasing condition.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

I recall that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be expressed as the sum over all i of the number of increasing subsequences ending at i.

And the number of increasing subsequences ending at i is equal to the sum over all j < i where a[j] < a[i] of the number of increasing subsequences ending at j, plus one (for the subsequence consisting only of a[i]).

Given that, perhaps I can build the array in such a way that the contributions from each element add up to X - 1 (since X includes the empty subsequence).

Wait, but this seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal array length needed to reach X increasing subsequences.

Since each new element can potentially double the number of increasing subsequences if it's larger than all previous elements, I can think of building an array where the first element has 2 subsequences (empty and itself), the second element, if larger than the first, would double that to 4, and so on.

So, with n elements in strictly increasing order, I can have 2^n increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

But 2^n can only represent X being a power of two, which is not sufficient for arbitrary X.

So, I need a way to combine elements in a way that allows me to reach any X up to 10^18.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set in X, include a certain structure in the array that contributes 2^k to the total number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to ensure that these contributions are additive.

Is the total number of increasing subsequences additive when the array is divided into disjoint segments?

Not necessarily, because subsequences can include elements from different segments as long as their positions are in order and values are strictly increasing.

So, to make the contributions additive, I need to ensure that no increasing subsequence can be formed by combining elements from different segments.

To achieve that, I can make sure that all elements in one segment are larger than all elements in previous segments.

Wait, but if I have segments where each segment's elements are larger than all elements in previous segments, then any combination of elements from different segments can form an increasing subsequence, which would make the total number of increasing subsequences the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each segment, including the empty ones.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have two segments, A and B, where all elements in B are larger than all elements in A.

Then, any increasing subsequence can be formed by choosing a subsequence from A, a subsequence from B, and concatenating them.

The total number of such subsequences would be (number of increasing subsequences in A) * (number of increasing subsequences in B).

But this includes the empty subsequence from A and/or B, so the total number would be (subseq_A + 1) * (subseq_B + 1) - 1, if we exclude the case where both subsequences are empty.

Wait, but in reality, the empty subsequence is only counted once, so the total number of increasing subsequences when combining A and B is (subseq_A + 1) * (subseq_B + 1) - 1.

Wait, no, actually, the total number would be subseq_A + subseq_B + (subseq_A * subseq_B), since each subsequence from A can be combined with each subsequence from B to form a new subsequence.

But also, the empty subsequence is counted once.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of generating functions.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one, is a product when segments are concatenated with all elements in one segment larger than all in the previous one.

Wait, suppose segment A has subseq_A increasing subsequences including the empty one, and segment B has subseq_B increasing subsequences including the empty one.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences in the combined array would be subseq_A * subseq_B, because any combination of a subsequence from A and a subsequence from B can be concatenated to form a new increasing subsequence, including the empty one.

Wait, but this would count the empty subsequence only once.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences would be subseq_A * subseq_B.

Given that, I can think of building the array as a concatenation of segments, where each segment contributes a certain number of increasing subsequences including the empty one, and the total is the product of these numbers.

So, if I can represent X as a product of numbers, each corresponding to a segment's contribution, then I can build the array accordingly.

But X can be up to 10^18, and I need to factorize it into up to 200 factors, each of which is at least 2 (since a segment with one element has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and the element itself).

Wait, but X can be as small as 2, so I need to handle that.

Given that, I can try to factorize X into as many factors of 2 as possible, since a segment with one element contributes 2 increasing subsequences.

Then, any remaining factor can be represented by a segment with more elements.

Wait, but 2 is the smallest number of increasing subsequences for a non-empty segment.

Wait, actually, an empty segment would have 1 increasing subsequence (the empty one), but I can't have an empty segment.

A segment with one element has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and the element itself.

A segment with two elements, if they are in increasing order, has 4 increasing subsequences: empty, each element, and the two-element subsequence.

If they are equal, it's different.

Wait, but if I have two elements where the second is larger than the first, it's 4.

If they are equal, it's 3: empty, each element, but not the two-element subsequence since it's not strictly increasing.

Wait, but in the previous example, [2,2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [2,2] (not strictly increasing, so not counted)

So, total of 3 increasing subsequences including the empty one.

Wait, but in my earlier DP calculation, for [2,2], the dp would be:

- dp[1] = 1 ([2])

- dp[2]: a[2] = 2, which is not greater than a[1]=2, so dp[2] = 1 ([2])

Total increasing subsequences: dp[1] + dp[2] + 1 (empty) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

So, for two equal elements, the total number is 3.

If they are strictly increasing, like [2,3], dp would be:

- dp[1] = 1 ([2])

- dp[2] = dp[1] (since a[1] < a[2]) + 1 ([3])

So, dp[2] = 2.

Total: dp[1] + dp[2] + 1 (empty) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So, for two strictly increasing elements, total is 4.

For three strictly increasing elements, it's 8, and so on.

So, in general, for a segment with n elements in strictly increasing order, the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Given that, if I have segments where each segment has elements strictly increasing within the segment and the last element of a segment is smaller than the first element of the next segment, then the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each segment.

Because any combination of subsequences from different segments can be concatenated to form a new increasing subsequence.

Given that, I can represent X as a product of numbers, each of which is a power of two, corresponding to segments with elements in strictly increasing order.

But X may not be a perfect power of two; it could be any number up to 10^18.

So, I need to factorize X into factors that are powers of two, possibly including one factor that is not a power of two, but since X can be up to 10^18, and I can have up to 200 segments, I need to find a way to represent X as a product of up to 200 factors, each being at least 2.

Wait, but in reality, since each segment must have at least one element, contributing at least 2 to the product, I can represent X as a product of factors, each being at least 2, and the number of factors being at most 200.

Given that, I need to factorize X into at most 200 factors, each being at least 2.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60 (since 2^60 ≈ 1.1529215e+18).

So, if I take 200 factors of 2, their product is 2^200, which is way larger than 10^18, so it's feasible.

But I need to handle cases where X is not a perfect power of two.

So, I can represent X as a product of as many 2's as possible, and then handle the remaining factor.

For example, if X=5, which is not a power of two, I can represent it as 5, which is greater than 2, and build a segment that contributes 5 to the total number of increasing subsequences.

But how do I build a segment that contributes exactly 5 increasing subsequences, including the empty one?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have a segment with two elements.

If they are equal, total increasing subsequences are 3: empty, each element.

If they are strictly increasing, total is 4.

So, to get 5, I need to have a segment with three elements.

Let me try with three elements.

Possible configurations:

- All equal: [2,2,2]

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (each of the three 2's)

Total: 4, which is less than 5.

- Two equal, one different.

For example, [2,2,3]

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (each of the two 2's)

- [3]

- [2,3] (each 2 can pair with 3)

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which is more than 5.

- All distinct and strictly increasing: [2,3,4]

Total: 8, which is more than 5.

So, none of these give exactly 5.

Wait, maybe I can have a segment with three elements where some are equal.

For example, [2,3,2]

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first or third)

- [3]

- [2,3] (only from first 2)

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Yes, this gives exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

So, for X=5, I can have a segment with three elements: [2,3,2], which gives 5 increasing subsequences including the empty one.

Similarly, for X=13, in the example, they provided [2,2,3,4,2], which, as per my earlier DP calculation, gives 13 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can generalize this approach.

Given X, I can factorize it into factors that are achievable by small segments.

For example, for X=13, which is 5 * 3 * 1 + something, but perhaps it's better to represent X as a product of factors corresponding to small segments.

Wait, but 13 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and 13.

But I need factors of at least 2.

So, for X=13, I can have one segment that contributes 13 increasing subsequences.

But how do I build such a segment?

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of certain values, but earlier I thought in terms of products because of the way segments combine.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum over all non-empty subsets of the array that are strictly increasing.

But this seems too broad.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think recursively.

Suppose I have already built a part of the array that contributes a certain number of increasing subsequences, and I add a new element.

How does this new element affect the total number of increasing subsequences?

Well, the new element can be appended to any existing increasing subsequence that ends with an element smaller than it, or it can start a new subsequence of length one.

So, the contribution of the new element is equal to the number of increasing subsequences ending with elements smaller than it, plus one for the new single-element subsequence.

But this seems complicated to manage for large X.

Let me consider another approach.

I recall that in binary, any number can be represented as a sum of powers of two.

Similarly, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of certain values corresponding to the contribution of each element.

But in this problem, since the contributions are multiplicative when segments are combined in a certain way, perhaps I can think in terms of multiplying factors.

Given that, perhaps I can represent X as a product of up to 200 factors, each being at least 2, and build segments accordingly.

For example, for X=13, which is a prime number, I can have one segment that contributes 13 increasing subsequences.

But how do I build such a segment?

Wait, perhaps I can have a segment with n elements that contributes exactly n+1 increasing subsequences.

Wait, in the earlier example, [2,3,2] contributes 5 increasing subsequences, which is n+2, where n=3.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have a segment with n elements that contributes 2^n increasing subsequences, but only if the elements are strictly increasing.

But in the earlier example, [2,3,2] is not strictly increasing, yet it contributes 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to build segments with a specific number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding an element that is equal to a previous element doesn't increase the number of strictly increasing subsequences, but adds new subsequences that include this element.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Given that I can have at most 200 elements, and X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, I can think of building the array by including as many elements as possible, each contributing minimally to the total number of increasing subsequences.

For example, if I have n elements, all equal, the total number of increasing subsequences is n + 1 (empty and each single element), which is linear in n.

But to reach 10^18, I would need n = 10^18, which is way more than 200 elements.

So, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, if I have n elements in strictly increasing order, the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, which for n=60 would be 2^60 = 10^18, which is within the limit of 200 elements.

But 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18, but close.

So, for X up to 10^18, I can use up to 60 elements in strictly increasing order to represent X as a sum of powers of two.

Wait, but earlier I thought in terms of products, but now perhaps sums.

Wait, no, the number of increasing subsequences is additive when combining disjoint sets, but in this problem, it's multiplicative when segments are concatenated with all elements in one segment larger than all in the previous one.

Wait, to clarify:

- If I have two segments, A and B, where all elements in B are larger than all in A, then the total number of increasing subsequences is subseq_A * subseq_B, where subseq_A and subseq_B include the empty subsequence.

- So, total increasing subsequences would be subseq_A * subseq_B.

Given that, I can represent X as a product of up to 200 factors, each being at least 2.

Given that, for X up to 10^18, I can factorize X into factors of 2 as much as possible, and handle any remaining factor separately.

For example, if X=13, which is not a power of two, I can represent it as 13 itself, which is greater than 2, and build a segment that contributes 13 increasing subsequences.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can build a segment where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly the desired factor.

For example, for 13, I can build a segment with n elements such that the number of increasing subsequences is 13.

From the earlier example, [2,3,2] gives 5, which is achievable.

Similarly, perhaps I can find a segment that gives 13.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Is there a systematic way to build such segments?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for a segment with elements that are not fully strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^n.

For example, in [2,3,2], it's 5, which is less than 2^3=8.

So, by carefully choosing which elements are equal, I can control the number of increasing subsequences.

But this seems too error-prone for large X.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I represent X in binary.

Let's say X is represented as the sum of powers of two: X = 2^{k1} + 2^{k2} + ... + 2^{kn}, where n is the number of 1's in the binary representation of X.

Then, perhaps I can build n segments, each contributing 2^{ki} increasing subsequences.

But I'm not sure how to make segments contribute exactly 2^{ki} increasing subsequences.

Wait, if I have a segment with ki elements in strictly increasing order, it contributes 2^{ki} increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

But then, the total would be the product of these, not the sum.

Wait, no, if I have n segments, each contributing subseq_i increasing subsequences, and all segments are concatenated with each segment's elements larger than all previous segments', then the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of subseq_i for all i.

So, in this case, if I have n segments, each contributing 2^{ki}, then the total would be product of 2^{ki}, which is 2^{sum ki}, which is not necessarily equal to X.

So, that doesn't help directly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose I represent X as a product of up to 200 factors, each being at least 2.

Then, for each factor, I build a segment that contributes that factor to the total number of increasing subsequences.

So, for example, for X=13, which is a prime, I can have one segment that contributes 13.

But how do I build a segment that contributes exactly 13 increasing subsequences?

From the earlier example, [2,3,2] gives 5, which is less than 13.

Wait, perhaps I need a larger segment.

Let me try with four elements.

Consider [2,3,4,2].

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first or fourth)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3] (first to third)

- [2,4] (first to fourth or third to fourth)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (first to third to fourth)

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10, which is still less than 13.

Wait, perhaps [2,2,3,4,2] as in the example gives 13.

Yes, as per earlier DP calculation.

So, for [2,2,3,4,2], total is 13.

So, perhaps I can build segments with a specific structure to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Is there a better way?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for a segment with elements that are not necessarily strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using the DP approach I mentioned earlier.

But constructing such segments for arbitrary X seems too complicated.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I represent X as a sum of powers of two, but as earlier, the total number of increasing subsequences is multiplicative when combining segments.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a product of (n_i + 1), where n_i is the number of elements in each segment.

Wait, but earlier I saw that for a segment with n elements in strictly increasing order, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

But if the segment has some elements equal, the number is less than 2^n.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a product of numbers, each of which is achievable as the number of increasing subsequences in a segment.

Given that, perhaps I can factorize X into factors that are powers of two, corresponding to segments with strictly increasing elements.

But X may not be a perfect power of two.

In that case, I need to handle the factors that are not powers of two.

Wait, but 13 is a prime number, so it can't be factored into smaller integers greater than one, except for 1 and 13.

So, in that case, I need to build a single segment that contributes 13 increasing subsequences.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can allow some segments to contribute more than 2^{n_i}, by having elements that are not strictly increasing.

Wait, but earlier attempts to do that didn't give me the exact number I wanted.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a segment with one element: it contributes 2 increasing subsequences (empty and the element itself).

With two elements, both equal: contributes 3 increasing subsequences.

With two elements, strictly increasing: contributes 4.

With three elements, all equal: contributes 4.

With three elements, two equal and one larger: contributes 5.

With three elements, strictly increasing: contributes 8.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize this.

Let me consider that for a segment with k elements, the number of increasing subsequences can be anywhere from k+1 (all elements equal) to 2^k (all elements strictly increasing).

So, for k elements, the number of increasing subsequences is between k+1 and 2^k.

Given that, for a given k, I can achieve any number between k+1 and 2^k by choosing appropriate equalities among elements.

But achieving arbitrary numbers in this range might still be too ad-hoc.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that constructing such segments for arbitrary X is too complex, and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of certain values corresponding to different substructures.

But earlier, I thought about products because of the way segments combine.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of products.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for a single element, it contributes one new subsequence (itself), plus the empty one.

For two elements, it contributes new subsequences based on the previous ones.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations again.

Suppose I represent X in binary.

Each bit in X corresponds to a certain power of two, which could correspond to a segment with elements in strictly increasing order.

But since the total number of increasing subsequences is multiplicative when combining segments, this doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a product of up to 200 factors, each being at least 2, and build segments accordingly.

Given that, I can factorize X into as many factors of 2 as possible, and handle any remaining factor separately.

For example, for X=13, which is a prime, I can have one segment that contributes 13.

But how do I build a segment that contributes exactly 13 increasing subsequences?

From the earlier example, [2,2,3,4,2] gives 13.

So, perhaps for prime numbers, I can build a segment with a specific structure that gives the desired number of increasing subsequences.

But this seems too case-specific.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that constructing such segments for arbitrary X is too complex, and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for a segment with n elements, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over k from 0 to n of the number of increasing subsequences of length k.

But this is just the total number of increasing subsequences, which is what I'm trying to calculate.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively.

Suppose I have already built part of the array that contributes a certain number of increasing subsequences, and I add a new element.

How does this affect the total?

Well, adding a new element that is larger than all previous elements will double the number of increasing subsequences,
