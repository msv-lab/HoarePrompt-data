Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X. X can be as large as 10^18, which is a really big number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, and they maintain their relative order in the array. Also, even if subsequences have the same elements but different positions, they are considered different. For example, in the array [2, 2], there are two different subsequences [2] corresponding to each 2.

The problem allows me to output any array that satisfies the condition, as long as it has at most 200 elements and each element is within [-1e9, 1e9]. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

Let me think about how to count the number of increasing subsequences in an array. For a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated by considering all possible non-empty subsets of the array that are in increasing order.

But calculating this directly for large X is not feasible, especially since X can be up to 10^18. So, I need a smarter way to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

I recall that in sequences where elements are strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1, where n is the length of the sequence, because every non-empty subset is an increasing subsequence. However, in this problem, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing; it can have duplicates, and the subsequences must be strictly increasing, meaning that duplicates would create different subsequences based on their positions.

Wait, but in the example given, for X=2, the output is an array of length 1 with element 0. Let's see: an array of length 1 has only one subsequence, which is the element itself, so that would be 1 subsequence, but the problem says for X=2. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says "note that an empty subsequence is also increasing," but in the output for X=2, it's giving an array of length 1, which should have two subsequences: the empty subsequence and the single element itself. So, X=2 corresponds to an array of length 1.

Wait, but the problem says "exactly X increasing subsequences," and for X=2, it's outputting an array of length 1, which has two subsequences: the empty one and the single element. So that seems consistent.

But in the example provided in the problem, for X=2, output is:

1

0

Which is an array of length 1 with element 0.

For X=5, it's:

3

0 1 0

Let's see why this is correct.

First, list all increasing subsequences of [0, 1, 0]:

- Empty subsequence

- [0] (first 0)

- [0] (third 0)

- [1]

- [0,1] (first 0 and 1)

- [0,0] (first and third 0), but this is not strictly increasing, so it shouldn't be counted.

So valid increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [0] (third)

- [1]

- [0,1] (first 0 and 1)

That's 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, my goal is to construct an array such that the number of strictly increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, I need a way to represent X as the sum of combinations of elements in the array.

I recall that in binary representation, any number can be represented as a sum of powers of 2. Maybe I can use that here.

Let's think about it differently. Suppose I have a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,4,...]. In this case, every non-empty subset is an increasing subsequence, so the total number is 2^n - 1.

But X can be up to 10^18, and n can be at most 200, since the array can have at most 200 elements. 2^200 is way larger than 10^18, so that's feasible.

But in this problem, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing; it can have duplicates, and only strictly increasing subsequences are counted.

Wait, but if I have duplicates, it complicates things because different positions of the same value can form different subsequences, but only if they are in increasing order.

Maybe I should try to construct an array that is as increasing as possible, and then adjust it to get exactly X increasing subsequences.

Another idea: since the number of increasing subsequences can be in the order of 2^n, and n can be up to 200, which is more than enough for X up to 10^18.

But I need a way to construct the array such that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Let me consider the binary representation of X. Since X can be up to 10^18, its binary representation can have up to 60 bits (since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18).

Wait, but n can be up to 200, which is more than enough to represent X in binary.

But I need to relate the binary representation to the array's structure.

Let me consider that each bit in X corresponds to choosing certain elements in the array to include in the subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the inclusion of elements based on their positions.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have an array of length n, and I add one more element at the end.

The number of increasing subsequences in the new array is equal to the number of increasing subsequences in the original array plus the number of increasing subsequences that include the new element.

If the new element is larger than all previous elements, then any subsequence of the original array plus the new element forms a new increasing subsequence.

So, if I can control the number of increasing subsequences by adding elements in a specific way, I might be able to build up to X.

This sounds similar to building a binary number, where each new element doubles the number of subsequences.

Wait, actually, in a strictly increasing array, adding a new largest element would double the number of subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, you can choose to include or not include the new element.

But in this problem, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where each element is larger than the previous one, then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1.

But if I have duplicates or decreasing elements, it reduces the total number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, but in the example given, [0,1,0], which is not strictly increasing, has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can construct an array that is mostly increasing, but with some elements adjusted to reduce the total number of subsequences.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representation.

Let's consider that each position in the array corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

If I can arrange the array such that including or excluding certain elements corresponds to the binary digits, I might be able to achieve exactly X subsequences.

But I need to ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing.

Let me consider constructing an array where elements are grouped in such a way that each group corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the minimal number of elements needed to achieve X subsequences.

Given that with n elements, the maximum number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1, but I can have less by introducing duplicates or decreasing elements.

But 2^200 is way larger than X=10^18, so with n=200, I have more than enough "potential" subsequences.

I need a way to "turn off" some of these subsequences to reach exactly X.

But that seems inefficient.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I start with an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

How can I build such an array?

One way is to have a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences sums up to X.

I can think of X as a sum of numbers, each corresponding to the contribution of a subset of the array.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the inclusion of each element.

Each element can be included or not in a subsequence, as long as the subsequence is increasing.

If I have a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, then the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1.

If I make some elements equal, then some subsequences that include multiple instances of the same value in different positions are no longer strictly increasing.

Wait, in the example [0,1,0], the subsequence [0,1] is valid, but [0,0] is not, because it's not strictly increasing.

So, by introducing duplicates, I can reduce the number of valid increasing subsequences.

But it's not straightforward how to calculate the exact number for arbitrary arrays.

Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider building the array step by step, and keep track of the number of increasing subsequences added at each step.

Suppose I start with an empty array, which has one subsequence: the empty one.

Then, I add the first element, say 0. Now, I have the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0], total of 2.

Which matches the example for X=2.

Then, for X=5, I need to add more elements.

Wait, in the example for X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me try to find a pattern.

If I have an array of length n, with elements strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1.

But if I have duplicates or decreasing elements, it's less.

So, to get X increasing subsequences, I need to find a way to set up the array such that the total number is exactly X.

But X can be up to 1e18, and n is at most 200, which is more than enough since 2^200 is way larger.

But I need a way to construct the array accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, include a certain element in the array.

But I need to ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

I can do this by considering the binary representation of X and constructing corresponding segments in the array.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the minimal number of elements needed to achieve X subsequences.

But with n=200, I have plenty of room.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is the sum over all k of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length k.

But that seems too general.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I have a sequence that is mostly increasing, but with some "blocks" where elements are equal.

For example, if I have [1,2,2,3], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2] (first 2)

- [2] (second 2)

- [3]

- [1,2] (1 and first 2)

- [1,2] (1 and second 2)

- [2,3] (first 2 and 3)

- [2,3] (second 2 and 3)

- [1,2,3] (1, first 2, 3)

- [1,2,3] (1, second 2, 3)

Wait, but [2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, total increasing subsequences: 1 (empty) + 2 (single 2's) + 1 (3) + 2 (1,2) + 2 (2,3) + 2 (1,2,3) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.

But actually, let's list them:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [1,2] (1 and first 2)

- [1,2] (1 and second 2)

- [2,3] (first 2 and 3)

- [2,3] (second 2 and 3)

- [1,2,3] (1, first 2, 3)

- [1,2,3] (1, second 2, 3)

That's 11 subsequences.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, I had 10, but listing them gives 11. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Anyway, the point is that duplicates can increase the number of subsequences, but not as much as distinct elements.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [0,1,0] had 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

So, perhaps I can construct the array by repeating certain elements to adjust the total count.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, say [1,2,3,...,n]. The number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1.

If I want exactly X subsequences, I can choose n such that 2^n - 1 <= X < 2^{n+1} - 1.

But X can be up to 1e18, and n can be up to 200, which is more than enough since 2^{60} is already over 1e18.

But the problem is that X might not be of the form 2^n - 1, so I need a way to adjust the total count to be exactly X.

One way to do this is to have a sequence that is mostly increasing, but with some elements duplicated or decreased to reduce the total number of subsequences.

But controlling this precisely seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I can build the array by deciding for each position whether to include a new element or repeat the previous one, and keep track of the total number of increasing subsequences.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Start with an empty array, which has one subsequence: the empty one.

Then, decide to add elements one by one, each time choosing the smallest possible element that achieves the desired total number of subsequences.

But I need to think about how adding a new element affects the total number of increasing subsequences.

If I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, then the number of new subsequences added is equal to the number of all existing subsequences (since each can have the new element appended to it), plus the new single-element subsequence.

Wait, more precisely, if I add a new element y that is larger than all previous elements, then:

- All existing subsequences remain valid.

- For each existing subsequence, I can append y to it to form a new subsequence.

- Plus the new subsequence consisting only of y.

So, the total number of subsequences becomes twice the number of subsequences before, minus the empty subsequence, plus the new subsequence [y].

But wait, twice the number of subsequences before would be 2*(total subsequences), but that includes the empty subsequence, which when appended y, becomes [y], which is already counted separately.

So, total subsequences after adding y would be:

- All previous subsequences: S

- All previous subsequences with y appended: S - 1 (since empty subsequence appended with y is just [y], which is already counted)

- So, total subsequences = S + (S - 1) = 2S - 1

But wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think differently.

If I have S subsequences in the original array, including the empty one.

When I add a new element y that is larger than all previous elements:

- Each existing subsequence can be extended by adding y, except the empty one, which becomes [y].

- So, the new subsequences are:

- All existing subsequences: S

- All existing subsequences except the empty one, each extended by y: S - 1

- So, total new subsequences: S + (S - 1) = 2S - 1

Yes, that matches the earlier conclusion.

So, if I have S subsequences before adding y, after adding y, the total becomes 2S - 1.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=1, S=2 (empty and [0]), then adding 1, which is larger than 0, should give 2*2 - 1 = 3 subsequences, but in reality, [0], [1], and [0,1], which is 3, not matching the earlier count.

Wait, but including the empty subsequence, it's 4 subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1]. So, perhaps my formula is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the empty subsequence separately.

Let me recast this.

If I have S subsequences including the empty one, and I add a new element y larger than all previous elements:

- The new subsequences are:

- All previous subsequences: S

- All previous non-empty subsequences extended by y: S - 1

- So total: 2S - 1

But in the example with n=1, S=2 (empty and [0]), adding y=1 should give 2*2 - 1 = 3 subsequences, but in reality, there are 4: empty, [0], [1], [0,1].

So, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

If I have S subsequences including the empty one, and I add a new element y larger than all previous elements:

- All previous subsequences: S

- All previous non-empty subsequences with y appended: S - 1

- But [y] is already included in the previous subsequences.

Wait, in the example:

- Before adding y=1: empty, [0]

- After adding y=1: empty, [0], [1], [0,1]

So, total is 4 = 2*2, not 2*2 -1.

So, my earlier formula is wrong.

Wait, actually, in this case, it's 2S, because each subsequence can be either without y or with y.

Wait, but in general, for a new element larger than all previous, it's like each subsequence can choose to include or exclude y, but since including y appends it to the subsequence, making it still increasing.

Wait, but the empty subsequence including y becomes [y], which is a new subsequence.

So, total subsequences should be 2S - 1, but in the example, it's 2S.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me search for a formula for the number of increasing subsequences in an array.

After some research, I find that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for all j < i and a[j] < a[i])

The total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

Wait, but in the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so I need to include it.

But implementing this DP approach to target exactly X subsequences seems complicated, especially since X can be up to 1e18.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider building the array in a way that allows me to control the number of increasing subsequences more easily.

One idea is to create segments of the array where each segment corresponds to a certain number of subsequences.

For example, if I have a segment that is strictly increasing, it contributes 2^k - 1 subsequences, where k is the length of the segment.

But if I have multiple such segments, the total number of subsequences would be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the structure of the array to maximize or minimize the number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to target exactly X subsequences.

Another idea: since X can be up to 1e18, and n is at most 200, which allows for up to 2^200 - 1 subsequences, which is way more than X.

So, perhaps I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each element in the array as contributing a certain number of subsequences based on its position and value.

But I need to ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing.

Let me consider starting with an empty array and adding elements one by one, keeping track of the total number of increasing subsequences.

I can use the relationship that when adding a new element, the number of new subsequences depends on how many previous elements are less than it.

But this seems too vague for constructing an array for such large X.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I have a sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order, then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1.

If I want X increasing subsequences, I can find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 >= X.

Then, if 2^n - 1 == X, I can output an array of n strictly increasing elements.

If 2^n - 1 > X, I need to adjust the array to reduce the number of increasing subsequences to exactly X.

But how?

One way is to introduce duplicates or decreasing elements to eliminate some subsequences.

But controlling exactly which subsequences are eliminated is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have k elements that are equal, the number of increasing subsequences that include those elements is C(k,1) + C(k,2) + ... + C(k,k) = 2^k - 1.

But in reality, since the positions are different, even if values are equal, they are considered different subsequences as long as their positions are different.

Wait, no, if values are equal, and positions are different, but in a strictly increasing subsequence, only one of them can be included.

Wait, no, in a strictly increasing subsequence, if you have multiple equal elements, only one can be included, but since their positions are different, you can choose which one to include.

Wait, but if two elements have the same value, you cannot have both in a strictly increasing subsequence.

Wait, actually, you can have both if they are in increasing order based on their positions, but if their values are equal, it's not strictly increasing.

So, in reality, if you have multiple equal elements, only one can be included in any increasing subsequence.

Therefore, for elements with the same value, only one of them can be included in a strictly increasing subsequence.

So, in terms of counting, having multiple equal elements doesn't increase the number of strictly increasing subsequences, because you can only choose one of them.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [0,1,0], it had 5 increasing subsequences, including [0] (first), [0] (third), [1], [0,1] (first 0 and 1), and [0,1] (third 0 and 1).

So, even though the 0's are equal, their positions are different, so they are considered different subsequences as long as they are in increasing order.

So, in this case, having duplicates can increase the number of subsequences, but only if their positions allow for different sequences.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I build the array step by step, and keep track of the number of increasing subsequences at each step.

I can use a greedy algorithm where I try to add elements in a way that adds the minimal number of new subsequences necessary to reach X.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, given the time constraints.

But since n can be up to 200 and t can be up to 1000, I need an efficient solution for each test case.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute something, but given the large range of X, that seems impractical.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Find the minimal n such that 2^n - 1 >= X.

- If 2^n - 1 == X, output a strictly increasing array of n elements.

- If 2^n - 1 > X, I need to adjust the array to reduce the number of subsequences to exactly X.

- To reduce the number of subsequences, I can introduce duplicates or decreasing elements to eliminate some subsequences.

But how to do this precisely?

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Let me consider that each element in the array corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where the first element is A, and the second is B, where A < B.

Then, the number of increasing subsequences is 3: empty, [A], [A,B].

Wait, but actually, with two elements, A < B, the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [A]

- [B]

- [A,B]

So, total of 4, which is 2^2.

Wait, but 2^2 - 1 = 3, but in reality, it's 4, including the empty subsequence.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 2^n, including the empty subsequence.

Yes, for n elements strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty one.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2^n - 1, but the example with n=1 has 2 subsequences (empty and [A]), and with n=2, it's 4 subsequences.

So, perhaps the total number is 2^n, including the empty subsequence.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for n elements strictly increasing, number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Then, if I want exactly X subsequences, I can choose n such that 2^n >= X, and adjust the array to have exactly X subsequences.

But X can be up to 1e18, and n=60 would give 2^60 = 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 1e18.

So, I can represent X in binary using up to 60 bits.

But with n=200, I have more than enough elements.

Wait, perhaps I can group the elements into segments, where each segment corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider building the array by adding elements in a way that each new element doubles the number of subsequences, minus one.

Wait, from earlier, adding a new element larger than all previous ones multiplies the number of subsequences by 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2S - 1, but according to the example, it's 2S.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.

Let me consider:

If I have S subsequences including the empty one, and I add a new element Y larger than all previous elements, then:

- All previous subsequences remain (S)

- All previous subsequences except the empty one can have Y appended to them (S - 1)

- Plus the new subsequence [Y]

But [Y] is already included in the previous subsequences, so total should be S + (S - 1) = 2S - 1

But in the example with n=1, S=2, adding Y gives 2*2 -1=3, but in reality, it's 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Let me think again.

If I have n elements strictly increasing, number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty one.

So, adding a new element larger than all previous ones should indeed double the number of subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element, maintaining the increasing order.

So, total subsequences should be 2^{n+1}.

But according to the earlier formula, it should be 2S, where S=2^n.

So, 2^{n+1}, which matches.

But earlier, I thought it was 2S -1, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Let me verify with n=1:

- Subsequences: empty, [A] -> 2

- Add B > A: subsequences are empty, [A], [B], [A,B] -> 4, which is 2*2

So, it's indeed 2S, not 2S -1.

So, my earlier formula was incorrect.

Therefore, adding a new element larger than all previous ones multiplies the number of subsequences by 2.

So, starting from an empty array (S=1), adding an element gives S=2, then adding another gives S=4, and so on.

So, for n elements strictly increasing, S=2^n.

Now, to get exactly X subsequences, I need S = X, including the empty subsequence.

But X can be up to 1e18, so n up to 60.

But in the problem, n can be up to 200, which is more than enough.

So, if X is a power of two, I can just create a strictly increasing array of length log2(X).

But if X is not a power of two, I need to adjust the array to have exactly X subsequences.

Since X can be up to 1e18, and 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 1e18, I can represent X in binary using up to 60 bits.

Wait, but n can be up to 200, so I have room to work with.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of two, which corresponds to choosing which elements to include in the subsequences.

But I need to relate this to the array's structure.

Let me consider that each element in the array corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

But I need to ensure that the subsequences correspond to the binary representation.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I build the array step by step, starting with an empty array.

At each step, I can decide to add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, which doubles the number of subsequences.

Or, I can add an element that is equal to or less than some previous elements, which would affect the count in a different way.

But controlling this precisely to reach exactly X seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, include a corresponding segment in the array.

But I need to think about how to structure these segments.

Let me consider building the array by grouping elements into "levels," where each level corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

But I need to think carefully about how to structure this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X to determine where to introduce duplicates or decreasing elements to adjust the total count.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I start with a strictly increasing sequence of length n, which gives me 2^n subsequences, including the empty one.

If 2^n = X, I'm done.

If 2^n > X, I need to reduce the number of subsequences to exactly X.

To reduce the number of subsequences, I can introduce duplicates or decreasing elements to eliminate some subsequences.

But controlling exactly which subsequences are eliminated is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can remove some subsequences by making certain elements not strictly increasing.

But this seems too error-prone.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I represent X as a sum of distinct powers of two, which is essentially its binary representation.

Then, I can construct corresponding segments in the array that contribute those powers of two to the total count.

For example, if X=5=4+1, I can have one segment that contributes 4 subsequences and another that contributes 1 subsequence.

But I need to ensure that these segments don't interfere with each other in terms of the subsequences they form.

Wait, perhaps I can have separate blocks in the array that don't interact in terms of forming increasing subsequences.

For example, if I have two blocks that are strictly increasing, but the second block starts with elements larger than the first block, then the total number of subsequences is the product of the subsequences in each block.

Wait, but actually, if I have two separate strictly increasing blocks where the second block starts after the first, then any subsequence can include elements from the first block, followed by elements from the second block, as long as they are increasing.

So, the total number of subsequences would not be simply the product.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I build the array such that it has segments where each segment corresponds to a '1' bit in the binary representation of X.

Each segment would contribute a certain number of subsequences, and by choosing the structure of each segment appropriately, I can make them contribute 2^k for various k's.

Then, by combining these segments in a way that their contributions sum up to X, I can achieve the desired total.

But I need to ensure that the segments don't interfere with each other in terms of forming subsequences.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I build the array in such a way that it has a certain number of elements, and by choosing their values appropriately, I can control the total number of increasing subsequences.

But without a clear formula, this seems too vague.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that for any array, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all k of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length k.

But calculating this directly is not feasible for large X.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty subsets that are strictly increasing.

But again, without a way to target exactly X, this is not helpful.

Let me consider starting with a strictly increasing sequence of length n, which has 2^n subsequences (including the empty one).

If I want exactly X subsequences, and X is less than 2^n, I need to find a way to reduce the total by a specific amount.

But how?

One idea is to introduce an element that is not larger than some previous elements, which would reduce the number of possible subsequences.

For example, if I have [1,2,3], which has 8 subsequences (including empty), and I add a 2, making it [1,2,3,2], then some subsequences are no longer strictly increasing, like [1,2,2].

But calculating exactly how many subsequences are eliminated is not straightforward.

This seems too error-prone for large X.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, I include a segment in the array that contributes 2^k subsequences, where k is the position of the bit.

Then, by combining these segments appropriately, I can make the total number of subsequences equal to X.

But I need to ensure that these segments don't interfere with each other.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the array in such a way that these segments are separated, so their contributions multiply rather than add.

But earlier, I saw that adding a new element larger than all previous ones doubles the number of subsequences.

So, perhaps I can build the array by deciding at each step whether to add a new element that is larger than all previous ones or not, based on the binary representation of X.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array based on the binary representation of X.

Let me consider that.

Suppose X is represented in binary as X = 2^{b1} + 2^{b2} + ... + 2^{bk}, where b1 > b2 > ... > bk.

Then, I can construct k segments in the array, each contributing 2^{bi} subsequences.

But I need to ensure that these segments don't interfere with each other, meaning that subsequences from one segment don't mix with subsequences from another segment.

How can I achieve that?

One way is to have each segment be completely isolated, meaning that elements in one segment are neither greater than nor less than elements in another segment.

But in an array, elements have a specific order, so it's difficult to completely isolate segments.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the segments in such a way that elements from one segment are all less than elements from the next segment, but introduce duplicates or decreasing elements to adjust the counts.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a different plan.

Suppose I build the array by iteratively deciding to double the number of subsequences or not at each step.

Starting with an empty array (1 subsequence), I can choose to add an element that doubles the number of subsequences, or add an element that increases it by a smaller amount.

But controlling this precisely to reach exactly X seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Start with an empty array (1 subsequence).

At each step, decide whether to add an element that is larger than all previous elements (doubling the number of subsequences) or add an element that doesn't change the number of subsequences.

But adding an element that isn't larger than all previous ones would complicate the count.

This seems too error-prone.

Let me consider another idea.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, I include a corresponding "block" in the array that contributes that power of two to the total number of subsequences.

But I need to ensure that these blocks don't interfere with each other.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the array in such a way that there are independent branches, each contributing a certain number of subsequences.

But in an array, elements are in a linear order, so achieving independent branches is tricky.

This seems too complicated.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that for any X, I can represent it as X = 2^n - r, where r < 2^n.

Then, I can create a strictly increasing sequence of n elements, which has 2^n subsequences, and then adjust it to remove r subsequences.

But removing exactly r subsequences in a controlled way is not straightforward.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I build the array by starting with a strictly increasing sequence and then introducing duplicates to reduce the number of subsequences.

But again, controlling exactly how many subsequences are reduced is difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation.

Let me consider that each bit in the binary representation of X corresponds to adding a certain number of subsequences.

But I need to relate this to the array's structure.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider looking for patterns in small examples.

For X=2, output [0] (subsequences: empty, [0])

For X=5, output [0,1,0] (subsequences: empty, [0] (first), [0] (third), [1], [0,1])

For X=13, output [2,2,3,4,2] (need to list all 13 subsequences)

For X=37, output [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1] (need to list all 37 subsequences)

Looking at these examples, it seems that by carefully choosing duplicates and the order of elements, I can adjust the total number of increasing subsequences.

But without a clear pattern or formula, it's hard to generalize this to arbitrary X.

Given the time constraints, I think I need to accept that there isn't a straightforward formula or algorithm to construct such an array for arbitrary X, and perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is equal to the sum of binomial coefficients corresponding to the lengths of the subsequences.

But again, without a clear way to target X, this is not helpful.

At this point, I think I need to consider that constructing such an array is possible for any X up to 2^200, given that n can be up to 200.

Therefore, for any X in the range [2,1e18], there exists an array of at most 200 elements that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

So, the answer should always be possible, and I just need to construct such an array.

But without a clear method, I'm stuck.

Perhaps I need to look for a different way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that for X=2, the minimal array is of length 1.

For X=3, it would be an array of length 2 with strictly increasing elements, giving 4 subsequences, but that's more than 3.

Wait, but according to the earlier formula, for n=1, S=2; n=2, S=4; n=3, S=8, and so on.

So, for X=3, I need to find an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

But 2^n is 4 for n=2, which is more than 3.

How can I adjust it to have exactly 3?

Perhaps by introducing a duplicate element.

Let's try [0,0].

Subsequences:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [0] (second)

- [0,0] (not strictly increasing, so invalid)

So, total of 3 subsequences: empty, [0] (first), [0] (second).

Yes, that works for X=3.

Wait, but in this case, [0,0] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, total is 3, as desired.

Similarly, for X=5, the example given is [0,1,0], which has 5 subsequences.

So, perhaps I can construct arrays with duplicates to adjust the total count.

But without a clear formula, it's hard to generalize.

Let me consider that for X=5, which is 4 + 1, I can have two segments: one that contributes 4 subsequences and one that contributes 1 subsequence.

For example, [0,1] contributes 4 subsequences, and adding a duplicate 0 at the end contributes 1 more subsequence.

But in reality, adding a duplicate 0 to [0,1] gives [0,1,0], which has 5 subsequences, as shown in the example.

So, perhaps I can build the array by combining such segments.

But I need a systematic way to do this for any X.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach, starting with the largest power of two less than or equal to X, include a segment that contributes that many subsequences, then subtract and repeat for the remainder.

For example, for X=5:

- Largest power of two <=5 is 4.

- Include a segment that contributes 4 subsequences: [0,1]

- Remaining X=5-4=1

- Include a segment that contributes 1 subsequence: [0]

- Combine them: [0,1,0], which has 5 subsequences.

Similarly, for X=13:

- Largest power of two <=13 is 8.

- Include a segment that contributes 8 subsequences: [0,1,2]

- Remaining X=13-8=5

- Largest power of two <=5 is 4.

- Include a segment that contributes 4 subsequences: [0,1]

- Remaining X=5-4=1

- Include a segment that contributes 1 subsequence: [0]

- Combine them: [0,1,2,0,0], but in the example, it's [2,2,3,4,2], which also has 13 subsequences.

So, perhaps this approach works.

But I need to ensure that the segments are combined in a way that their contributions don't interfere with each other.

To do this, I need to make sure that elements from different segments don't form invalid subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the segments in such a way that elements from later segments are larger than elements from previous segments, ensuring that only subsequences within each segment are considered.

Wait, but in the example [2,2,3,4,2], it seems that elements are mostly increasing, but with some duplicates or decreases to adjust the count.

But in my earlier example, [0,1,2,0,0], this would have elements that are not strictly increasing across the entire array, but within each segment, they are handled appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can group the segments in a way that each segment is strictly increasing, and separated by elements that are equal to or less than the previous elements, to prevent mixing of subsequences.

But I need to verify if this works.

Let me try constructing an array for X=5.

- X=5

- Largest power of two <=5 is 4, corresponding to n=2: [0,1] with 4 subsequences.

- Remaining X=1

- Include a segment with 1 subsequence: [0]

- Combine them: [0,1,0]

- Total subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1], [0] (second 0)

- Total: 5, which matches.

Similarly, for X=13:

- X
