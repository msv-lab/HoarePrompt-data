Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships in a line, each with some durability a_i. The Kraken attacks them k times, alternating between the first and the last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. After each attack, if a ship sinks, it's removed, which changes what's considered the first and last ship.

This seems like a simulation problem, but simulating each attack one by one could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15. That's way too big for a naive simulation.

I need a smarter way to handle this. Let's think about it.

If I look at the attacks in pairs: one on the first ship and one on the last ship. In each pair, the Kraken attacks both the first and the last ship once, provided they still exist.

So, if I can process these pairs efficiently, I can reduce the number of operations.

Let me consider the ships as a list, with indices from 0 to n-1. I'll keep track of the current first ship (left) and the current last ship (right).

I'll need to keep attacking in turns until k attacks are used up.

But with large n and large k, I need a way to handle this without looping through each attack.

Maybe I can calculate how many full pairs of attacks I can perform before any ship sinks, and then handle the remaining attacks.

Let's think about the ships' durabilities. Suppose I have ships with durabilities a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r-1], a[r], where l and r are the current first and last ship indices.

In each pair of attacks, the first ship loses 1 durability, and the last ship loses 1 durability.

I can keep subtracting the minimum durability between the first and last ship in each pair of attacks, until one of them sinks.

Wait, no. I need to be careful. Because after each pair of attacks, if a ship's durability reaches zero, it's removed, which changes the first and last ship for the next pair.

This seems a bit tricky to handle directly.

Perhaps I can model this as a process where I repeatedly find the number of attacks until the next ship sinks, and then update accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize l = 0 and r = n - 1.

While l <= r and k > 0:

If l == r: # only one ship left

if k >= a[l]:

ans += 1

k = 0

else:

k = 0 # no more attacks needed

else:

# Two or more ships left

# Determine how many attacks until one of them sinks

# The first ship is attacked on odd attacks, the last on even attacks.

# Wait, but the attacks alternate between first and last.

# So, attack sequence: first, last, first, last, etc.

# I need to see how many attacks are needed until either the first or the last ship sinks.

# Let's say the first ship has a[l] durability, and the last has a[r].

# Each pair of attacks reduces both by 1.

# So, the number of full pairs until one of them sinks is min(a[l], a[r]).

# After that, if a[l] == a[r], both ships would sink at the same time, but since attacks alternate, only one gets the final attack.

# Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the smaller durability.

# Let me consider that.

# Suppose a[l] <= a[r].

# Then, in a[l] pairs, the first ship will sink.

# Similarly, if a[r] < a[l], then in a[r] pairs, the last ship will sink.

# After these pairs, I need to see which ship sank and update l and r accordingly.

# Then, subtract the number of pairs from k, and continue.

# This seems manageable.

Let me try to outline the steps:

- While l <= r and k > 0:

- If l == r:

- If k >= a[l], ans += 1, k = 0

- Else: k = 0 (no more attacks needed)

- Else:

- If a[l] < a[r]:

- num_pairs = a[l]

- k -= 2 * num_pairs

- a[r] -= num_pairs

- a[l] = 0

- l += 1

- ans += 1

- Else:

- num_pairs = a[r]

- k -= 2 * num_pairs

- a[l] -= num_pairs

- a[r] = 0

- r -= 1

- ans += 1

- If k > 0 after this, repeat.

Wait, but this might not be accurate because in the pairs, both ships are being attacked in each pair, so their durabilities are being reduced simultaneously.

Wait, no. Actually, in each pair, first the first ship is attacked, then the last ship is attacked.

So, it's not exactly simultaneous.

But in terms of durability reduction, yes, both are reduced by 1 per pair.

Wait, but if a[l] is smaller, it will sink first after a[l] pairs, and similarly for a[r].

Yes, that seems correct.

Let me try an example to verify.

Take n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Initial state: l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3]

a[l]=1, a[r]=3

Since a[l] < a[r], num_pairs = 1

k -= 2*1 = 2*1=2, so k=3

a[r] -=1, so a[r]=2

a[l]=0, so sink ship at l, l +=1, ans +=1 (ans=1)

New state: l=1, r=3, a=[2,4,2]

k=3

a[l]=2, a[r]=2

a[l] == a[r], num_pairs=2

k -= 4, k=-1

a[l]-=2, a[r]-=2, both become 0, sink both, ans +=2, l=3, r=1

But l=3 > r=1, so end

Total ans=3, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, in the example, after 5 attacks, the ships remaining are [4,1], meaning 2 ships sunk.

But according to my steps, I got ans=3.

Hmm, seems like a mistake in my logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle the sinking of ships.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I should track the number of attacks needed to sink each ship, considering their positions in the sequence.

But that seems complicated.

Another approach: Since the attacks alternate between first and last, I can think in terms of rounds. Each round consists of two attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last ship.

In each round, both ships lose 1 durability, unless one of them has already sunk.

I need to process these rounds until k rounds are done or until one of the ships sinks.

When one ship sinks, it's removed, and the next first or last ship becomes the new target.

This seems similar to the previous approach but perhaps more carefully managed.

Let me try to simulate this step by step.

Initialize l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3], k=5, ans=0

Round 1:

- Attack first ship: a[0] -=1, a=[0,2,4,3]

- Since a[0]=0, sink ship at l, l +=1, ans=1

- Remaining ships: a=[2,4,3], l=1, r=3

- k -=1, k=4

Round 2:

- Attack first ship: a[1] -=1, a=[2,3,3]

- Attack last ship: a[3] -=1, a=[2,3,2]

- k -=1, k=3

Round 3:

- Attack first ship: a[1] -=1, a=[2,2,2]

- Attack last ship: a[3] -=1, a=[2,2,1]

- k -=1, k=2

Round 4:

- Attack first ship: a[1] -=1, a=[2,1,1]

- Attack last ship: a[3] -=1, a=[2,1,0]

- Since a[3]=0, sink ship at r, r -=1, ans=2

- Remaining ships: a=[2,1], l=1, r=1

- k -=1, k=1

Round 5:

- Only one ship left, a[1]=1

- Since k=1 >= a[1]=1, sink the ship, ans=3

But according to the example, only 2 ships should be sunk.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back at the example in the problem:

After 5 attacks, the ships remaining are [4,1], meaning that 2 ships have sunk.

But in my simulation, I have ans=3.

So, there must be an error in my simulation.

Let me check again.

Initial state: a=[1,2,4,3], l=0, r=3, k=5

Attack 1: first ship, a[0]-=1 -> a=[0,2,4,3], sink ship at l, l=1, ans=1, k=4

Remaining: a=[2,4,3], l=1, r=2

Attack 2: first ship, a[1]-=1 -> a=[2,3,3]

Attack 3: last ship, a[2]-=1 -> a=[2,3,2]

k=3

Attack 4: first ship, a[1]-=1 -> a=[2,2,2]

Attack 5: last ship, a[2]-=1 -> a=[2,2,1]

k=0

At this point, no ship has sunk in the last pair of attacks, so ans=1.

But according to the problem, after 5 attacks, a=[2,2,1], meaning that 2 ships have sunk, but in my count, ans=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a ship sinks, it's removed immediately, and the remaining ships shift.

Wait, in my simulation, when a ship sinks, I update l or r accordingly.

In the first attack, a[0] sinks, so l=1, and the remaining ships are a[1:4] = [2,4,3].

Then, in the next attacks, I attack a[1] and a[3], and so on.

But according to the problem, after the first attack, a[0] sinks, and the remaining ships are a=[2,4,3].

Then, second attack: attack last ship, a[3]-=1 -> a=[2,4,2]

Third attack: attack first ship, a[1]-=1 -> a=[2,3,2]

Fourth attack: attack last ship, a[3]-=1 -> a=[2,3,1]

Fifth attack: attack first ship, a[1]-=1 -> a=[2,2,1]

At this point, no ship has sunk, so only one ship has sunk, which is a[0].

But the problem says that after 5 attacks, a=[2,4,2], which seems inconsistent with my simulation.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Looking back at the problem description:

After each attack, if a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed.

So, after the first attack, a[0] becomes 0 and sinks, removing it from the list.

So, a becomes [2,4,3], l=0, r=2.

Second attack: attack first ship (a[0]=2)-=1 -> a=[1,4,3]

Third attack: attack last ship (a[2]=3)-=1 -> a=[1,4,2]

Fourth attack: attack first ship (a[0]=1)-=1 -> a=[0,4,2], sink a[0], remove it, a=[4,2], l=0, r=1, ans=2

Fifth attack: attack first ship (a[0]=4)-=1 -> a=[3,2]

So, after 5 attacks, a=[3,2], meaning that 2 ships have sunk.

But in my previous simulation, I had a different result.

I see where I went wrong.

In my simulation, after the first ship sinks, l increases, but I should reset l to 0 for the new first ship.

Wait, no.

Wait, in Python, when I have a list, and I reassign a = a[l:], I can reset l to 0.

But in my previous simulation, I was keeping l and r as indices into the original list, which might be confusing.

Perhaps it's better to maintain a list and adjust l and r accordingly.

Let me try again.

Initialize:

a = [1,2,4,3], l=0, r=3, k=5, ans=0

Attack 1: first ship, a[0]-=1 -> a[0]=0, sink, remove a[0], a=[2,4,3], l=0, r=2, ans=1, k=4

Attack 2: last ship, a[2]-=1 -> a[2]=2

Attack 3: first ship, a[0]-=1 -> a[0]=1

Attack 4: last ship, a[2]-=1 -> a[2]=1

Attack 5: first ship, a[0]-=1 -> a[0]=0, sink, remove a[0], a=[4,1], l=0, r=1, ans=2, k=0

Final answer: ans=2

Yes, that matches the example.

So, in my previous simulation, I mistakenly didn't remove the ship immediately after sinking, which led to incorrect counts.

Therefore, I need to make sure that when a ship's durability reaches 0, it's immediately removed from the list, and l and r are updated accordingly.

But maintaining a dynamic list and updating l and r accordingly in code could be inefficient for large n and large k, since list operations can be costly.

I need a better way to handle this.

Let me think about the process more carefully.

I can keep track of the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately.

Let’s define:

- attacks_on_first = number of times the first ship was attacked

- attacks_on_last = number of times the last ship was attacked

Initially, attacks_on_first = 0, attacks_on_last = 0

Each time the Kraken attacks the first ship, attacks_on_first +=1

Each time it attacks the last ship, attacks_on_last +=1

The total number of attacks is attacks_on_first + attacks_on_last

But I need to ensure that the attacks alternate between first and last.

So, the sequence of attacks is: first, last, first, last, ..., up to k attacks.

Therefore, attacks_on_first = ceil(k / 2)

attacks_on_last = floor(k / 2)

Because the first ship is attacked on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., attacks.

Similarly, the last ship is attacked on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.

So, attacks_on_first = (k + 1) // 2

attacks_on_last = k // 2

Now, I need to distribute these attacks among the first and last ships, considering that ships can sink and be removed.

I need a way to handle this efficiently.

Maybe I can use two pointers, l and r, to track the current first and last ships, and keep track of how many attacks each ship can absorb before sinking.

For each ship at position l, it can absorb a[l] attacks before sinking.

Similarly, for ship at position r, it can absorb a[r] attacks before sinking.

I can calculate how many attacks I can perform on the current first and last ships before one of them sinks.

Let’s say I have attacks_on_first and attacks_on_last available.

But this seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a list of ships, and I keep track of the number of attacks each ship has received.

I can iterate through the attacks one by one, alternating between first and last, and increment the attack count for those ships until one of them sinks.

But with k up to 10^15, I need a better approach.

An optimized way would be to process in blocks.

Calculate how many attacks can be performed before any ship sinks, then handle the sinking and update the ships list accordingly.

But again, with large n and large k, this needs to be efficient.

Perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach, where I keep track of the current first and last ships, and calculate the number of attacks until one of them sinks.

Then, subtract that number of attacks from k, remove the sunk ship, and repeat.

This seems promising.

Let's formalize this.

Initialize l = 0, r = n-1

While l <= r and k > 0:

if l == r:

# Only one ship left

if k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k =0

else:

k=0 # no more attacks needed

else:

# Two or more ships

# Determine how many attacks until one of them sinks

# The first ship is attacked on odd attacks, the last on even attacks.

# But since attacks alternate, I need to see how many pairs of attacks can be performed.

# Each pair consists of one attack on the first and one on the last.

# So, in each pair, both ships lose 1 durability.

# The number of full pairs until one of them sinks is min(a[l], a[r])

num_pairs = min(a[l], a[r])

# If k is greater than or equal to the number of attacks needed for these pairs

if k >= 2 * num_pairs:

# Perform the pairs

k -= 2 * num_pairs

# Both ships lose num_pairs durability

a[l] -= num_pairs

a[r] -= num_pairs

# If any ship's durability reaches 0, sink it

if a[l] ==0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] ==0:

ans +=1

r -=1

else:

# k < 2 * num_pairs

# Need to distribute the remaining k attacks between first and last ships

# attacks_on_first = (k +1) // 2

# attacks_on_last = k // 2

attacks_on_first = (k +1) // 2

attacks_on_last = k // 2

# Subtract the attacks from the first and last ships

a[l] -= attacks_on_first

a[r] -= attacks_on_last

# If a[l] <=0:

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

l +=1

# If a[r] <=0:

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

r -=1

# Update k to 0, since all attacks are used

k =0

This seems like a solid plan.

Let me test this logic with the example.

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Initialize l=0, r=3

First loop:

l != r

num_pairs = min(1,3) =1

k=5 >= 2*1=2

k -=2, k=3

a[l]=1-1=0

a[r]=3-1=2

a now: [0,2,4,2]

since a[l]=0, ans +=1, l +=1, l=1

since a[r]=2 >0, r remains 3

Second loop:

l=1, r=3

num_pairs = min(2,2)=2

k=3 >= 4? No, 3 < 4

So, attacks_on_first = (3+1)//2 =2

attacks_on_last = 3//2=1

a[l]=2-2=0

a[r]=2-1=1

a now: [0,0,4,1]

ans +=1, l=2

ans +=0 (since a[r]=1>0)

Third loop:

l=2, r=3

num_pairs = min(4,1)=1

k=0, so stop

Total ans=2, which matches the example.

Great, this seems correct.

Now, let's see another test case.

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

First loop:

l=0, r=3

num_pairs=1

k=6 >=2, k-=2, k=4

a[l]=0, a[r]=2

sink l, l=1, ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=3

num_pairs=min(2,2)=2

k=4 >=4

k-=4, k=0

a[l]=0, a[r]=0

sink l and r, l=2, r=2

ans=3

Which matches the sample output of 3 for n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Good.

Another test case: n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Initialize l=0, r=4

First loop:

num_pairs=min(2,2)=2

k=20 >=4

k-=4, k=16

a[l]=0, a[r]=0

sink l and r, l=1, r=3, ans=2

Second loop:

l=1, r=3

num_pairs=min(7,8)=7

k=16 >=14

k-=14, k=2

a[l]=0, a[r]=1

sink l and r, l=2, r=2, ans=4

Third loop:

l=2, r=2

k=2 >= a[l]=1

sink l, ans=5, k=0

Total ans=5, which matches the sample output.

Perfect.

Another test case: n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

First loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=min(3,2)=2

k=2 >=4? No, 2 <4

So, attacks_on_first=(2+1)//2=1

attacks_on_last=1

a[l]=3-1=2

a[r]=2-1=1

k=0

No ships sunk, ans=0

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Good.

Another test case: n=2, k=15, a=[1,5]

First loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=min(1,5)=1

k=15 >=2

k-=2, k=13

a[l]=0, a[r]=4

sink l, l=1, ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=1

k=13 >= a[l]=4

sink l, ans=2, k=0

Total ans=2, matches the sample.

Last test case: n=2, k=7, a=[5,2]

First loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=min(5,2)=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

Since l > r, stop

Total ans=1, but sample output is 2.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, let's check.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

num_pairs=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

l > r, stop

But according to the sample, output should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the case when l > r properly.

Wait, in this case, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, which is l > r, so no more ships to attack.

But according to the sample, output is 2, meaning that both ships are sunk.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if k is still greater than 0 after sinking r, and if l == r, check if k >= a[l].

But in this case, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no more ships.

But the sample output is 2, which suggests that both ships are sunk.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps when l == r after sinking one ship, I need to check if k is enough to sink the remaining ship.

But in this case, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no more ships.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after sinking a ship, I check if l <= r again.

Let me try to simulate again.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

num_pairs=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Now, l=1, r=0

l > r, so stop

But according to the sample, output should be 2.

Wait, perhaps in the sample, both ships are sunk.

Maybe I need to consider that after sinking r, if k is still greater than or equal to the remaining durability of l.

Wait, in this case, after sinking r, l=1, a[l]=3, and k=3 >=3, so sink l, ans=2.

Ah, I see the mistake in my earlier logic.

I need to ensure that after sinking one ship, if k is still greater than or equal to the remaining durability of the other ship, I can sink it as well.

So, in the case where l > r after sinking r, I need to check if k >= a[l], and if so, sink l, ans +=1.

Similarly, if l == r and k >= a[l], sink it.

Let me adjust my logic accordingly.

So, in the loop:

While l <= r and k >0:

if l == r:

if k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k =0

else:

k=0

else:

num_pairs = min(a[l], a[r])

if k >= 2 * num_pairs:

k -= 2 * num_pairs

a[l] -= num_pairs

a[r] -= num_pairs

if a[l] ==0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] ==0:

ans +=1

r -=1

else:

attacks_on_first = (k +1)//2

attacks_on_last = k//2

a[l] -= attacks_on_first

a[r] -= attacks_on_last

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

r -=1

k=0

After the loop, if l == r and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

But in the earlier case, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no need to check.

Wait, perhaps I need to add an extra check after the loop.

If l == r and k >= a[l], then ans +=1

But in the earlier simulation, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no more ships.

But in that case, a[l]=3 and k=3, which should allow sinking l, but since l > r, it's not entering the loop.

So, perhaps I need to add a check after the loop to see if there's one remaining ship that can be sunk with the remaining k.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no more ships.

But in reality, there is still one ship left, a[l]=3, and k=3, which can sink it.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the loop condition to allow checking if there's one remaining ship that can be sunk.

Let me try to adjust the loop:

While l < r and k >0:

# process as before

if l == r and k >0:

if k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k=0

else:

k=0

In this way, after the main loop, if l == r, meaning only one ship left, and k >0, check if it can be sunk.

In the earlier case, after sinking r, l=1, r=0, l > r, so l != r, but l ==1, r==0, which is l > r.

So, perhaps I need to handle l == r outside the loop.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the loop condition to l <= r.

Let me try.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

l < r: True

num_pairs=min(5,2)=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

l <= r is False, so exit loop

Now, check if l == r and k >0: no, because l > r

So, ans=1, but sample output is 2.

Hence, my logic is still flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the case when l == r after sinking r.

Wait, in the first loop, after sinking r, r=0, and l=1, so l > r, but l == r is not true because l > r.

So, perhaps I need to handle the case when l == r before exiting the loop.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set r = r -1 first, and then check l <= r.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the order of operations.

Let me try to simulate again.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

l < r: True

num_pairs=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Now, l=1, r=0

l <= r: False, so exit loop

But a[l]=3, k=3, which could sink l, so perhaps I need to add a final check.

After the loop, if l > r, do nothing.

Else, if l == r and k >= a[l], ans +=1

But in this case, l > r, so no need to check.

Wait, but according to the sample, output should be 2, meaning both ships are sunk.

Perhaps there's an error in the sample explanation.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

6

4 5

1 2 4 3

4 6

1 2 4 3

5 20

2 7 1 8 2

2 2

3 2

2 15

1 5

2 7

5 2

Output:

2

3

5

0

2

2

So, for n=2, k=7, a=[5,2], output is 2.

But according to my simulation, ans=1.

Perhaps the sample is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after sinking r, k=3, and l=1, r=0, l > r, but a[l]=3, and k=3, so I can consider sinking l as well.

So, perhaps after the main loop, if l == r and k >= a[l], ans +=1

But in this case, l > r, so l != r, but a[l]=3, k=3.

Maybe I need to handle l == r separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after each sinking, I need to check if l <= r again.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to keep track of the total attacks performed and update the durabilities accordingly.

But to make it efficient for large n and k, I need a way to handle this without iterating through each attack.

Another idea: Since attacks alternate between first and last, I can calculate how many attacks are performed on the first and last ships separately.

As I did earlier, attacks_on_first = (k +1) //2

attacks_on_last = k //2

Then, I can subtract these attacks from the durabilities of the first and last ships respectively.

But I need to handle the sinking of ships appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate until there are no more ships or k=0, and in each iteration, calculate the number of attacks that can be performed before any ship sinks.

Then, perform those attacks and update the durabilities accordingly.

Wait, perhaps using a priority queue or something similar.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e15, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in each "phase", I can perform min(a[l], a[r]) pairs of attacks, reducing both a[l] and a[r] by that amount.

Then, after that, one of the ships sinks, and I remove it and continue.

This seems similar to what I did earlier, but perhaps I can optimize it.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize l=0, r=n-1, ans=0

While l <= r and k >0:

if l == r:

if k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k=0

else:

k=0

else:

num_pairs = min(a[l], a[r])

attacks_needed = 2 * num_pairs

if k >= attacks_needed:

k -= attacks_needed

a[l] -= num_pairs

a[r] -= num_pairs

if a[l] ==0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] ==0:

ans +=1

r -=1

else:

attacks_on_first = (k +1) //2

attacks_on_last = k //2

a[l] -= attacks_on_first

a[r] -= attacks_on_last

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

r -=1

k=0

After the loop, if l == r and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

This seems comprehensive.

Let me test it with the problematic test case.

n=2, k=7, a=[5,2]

First loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=2

attacks_needed=4

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

l > r, stop

But according to the sample, output should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to add a final check after the loop to see if l == r and k >= a[l].

In this case, l=1, r=0, l > r, so no need to check.

But intuitively, since k=3 and a[l]=3, I can sink l.

So, perhaps I need to add a final check after the loop:

if l <= r and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k=0

But in this case, l > r, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to set r after sinking r.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the order of operations.

Let me try to adjust the code:

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

l < r: True

num_pairs=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

l <= r: False, stop

But intuitively, l=1, r=0, which is l > r, meaning no more ships.

But a[l]=3, and k=3, which could sink l.

So, perhaps I need to add a final check:

if l < n and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k -= a[l]

In this case, l=1 <2, and k=3 >= a[l]=3, so ans=2, k=0

This seems correct.

Let me adjust the logic accordingly.

So, after the main loop, add:

if l < n and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k -= a[l]

This should handle the case where only one ship remains after the loop.

Let me test it again.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[5,2], k=7

First loop:

l < r: True

num_pairs=2

k=7 >=4

k-=4, k=3

a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sink r, r=0

ans=1

Second loop:

l=1, r=0

l <= r: False, exit loop

Now, final check:

if l < n and k >= a[l]:

ans +=1

k -= a[l]

Here, l=1 <2, k=3 >= a[l]=3

ans=2, k=0

Which matches the sample output.

Great, this seems correct now.

Let me verify with another test case.

n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

First loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=2

k=2 >=4? No

attacks_on_first=1

attacks_on_last=1

a[l]=2, a[r]=1

No ship sinks, ans=0, k=0

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Another test case: n=1, k=5, a=[3]

Initialize l=0, r=0

Since l == r:

if 5 >=3:

ans=1, k=0

else:

k=0

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=10, a=[4,5,3]

Initialize l=0, r=2

First loop:

num_pairs=3 (min(4,3))

attacks_needed=6

k=10 >=6

k-=6, k=4

a[l]=1, a[r]=0

sink r, r=1

ans=1

Second loop:

l=0, r=1

num_pairs=1 (min(1,5))

attacks_needed=2

k=4 >=2

k-=2, k=2

a[l]=0, a[r]=4

sink l, l=1

ans=2

Third loop:

l=1, r=1

k=2 >=5? No

Since k=2 < a[l]=4, don't sink l

Final ans=2

Which seems correct.

Therefore, this logic seems solid.

Now, to implement this efficiently in code.

Given that t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, with sum of n over t <=2e5, I need to make sure that each test case runs in O(n), but ideally O(1) per operation.

However, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over t is 2e5, it's manageable.

I can implement the above logic using two pointers, l and r, and iterate until l > r or k=0.

In code, I'll need to be careful with the indices and updates.

Also, since k can be up to 1e15, I need to make sure that I handle large k values efficiently, but since I'm processing in blocks of min(a[l], a[r]), it should be fine.

Edge cases to consider:

- n=1: only one ship, attack it k times, sink it if k >= a[0]

- n=2, k < attacks needed to sink any ship

- All ships have a[i]=1, and k is large

- Ships have varying a[i], needing precise counting of attacks

I should make sure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases efficiently, reading inputs correctly.

In terms of code structure, I can write a function to handle each test case and call it t times.

I need to read t, then for each test case, read n and k, then read the a list.

Finally, print the answer for each test case.

Regarding code optimization, since sum of n over all test cases is <=2e5, it's acceptable.

I need to make sure that I don't use any operations that are slower than O(n) per test case.

In Python, list operations are efficient, but I need to be cautious with large inputs.

I can use list slicing if necessary, but it's better to use two pointers to avoid slicing.

Now, let's proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ships are sunk after a series of attacks by the Kraken, based on the ships' durability and the sequence of attacks.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Simulate Attacks**:
   - Use two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the current first and last ships.
   - While there are ships left (`l <= r`) and attacks remaining (`k > 0`):
     - If only one ship is left (`l == r`), check if the remaining attacks can sink it.
     - If multiple ships are left, calculate the number of full pairs of attacks that can be performed on the first and last ships without sinking either.
     - Adjust the durability of the ships and update the count of sunk ships if their durability drops to zero.
   - After the loop, check if there is one remaining ship that can be sunk with the remaining attacks.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - For each test case, output the number of ships that were sunk.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        ans = 0
        while l < r and k > 0:
            if a[l] <= 0 or a[r] <= 0:
                break
            mi = min(a[l], a[r])
            attacks_needed = 2 * mi
            if k >= attacks_needed:
                k -= attacks_needed
                a[l] -= mi
                a[r] -= mi
                if a[l] <= 0:
                    ans += 1
                    l += 1
                if a[r] <= 0:
                    ans += 1
                    r -= 1
            else:
                attacks_on_first = (k + 1) // 2
                attacks_on_last = k // 2
                a[l] -= attacks_on_first
                a[r] -= attacks_on_last
                if a[l] <= 0:
                    ans += 1
                    l += 1
                if a[r] <= 0:
                    ans += 1
                    r -= 1
                k = 0
        if l == r and k > 0:
            if k >= a[l]:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Read the input data and initialize variables for each test case.
- **Simulate Attacks**:
  - Use a while loop to handle attacks until no ships are left or no attacks remain.
  - Handle the case where only one ship is left separately.
  - Calculate the number of full pairs of attacks that can be performed on the first and last ships.
  - Adjust the durability of the ships and update the count of sunk ships accordingly.
- **Output the Result**: Print the number of sunk ships for each test case.

This approach ensures that the simulation is efficient and handles large inputs effectively by processing pairs of attacks in blocks, reducing the time complexity.
