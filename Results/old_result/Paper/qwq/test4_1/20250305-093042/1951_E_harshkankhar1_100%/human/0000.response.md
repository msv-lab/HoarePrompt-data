Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of substrings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string into substrings, none of which are palindromes. If such a partition exists, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition, and then the partition itself. If no such partition exists, I should output "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters long, with a total sum of |s| across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably linear time per test case.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

sinktheyacht

lllllllll

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

NO

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Explanation:

- For "sinktheyacht", the whole string is not a palindrome, so partitioning it as a single substring works.

- For "lllllllll", every possible substring is a palindrome (since all characters are 'l'), so there's no way to partition it without having at least one palindrome substring.

- For "uwuowouwu", it's possible to partition it into three substrings that are not palindromes: "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

From this, I can see that if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can simply output the whole string as one partition. If it is a palindrome, I need to try partitioning it into smaller substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, in the second test case, "lllllllll", every substring is a palindrome because all characters are the same. So, in such cases, it's impossible to have a partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome.

I need to find a way to determine whether such a partition exists and, if so, find one such partition.

Let me think about the properties of strings that allow such a partition.

First, if the string is not a palindrome, I can partition it into one substring, which is the string itself.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, as seen in the second test case, if all characters are the same, any substring of length greater than 1 will still be a palindrome, and single-character substrings are also palindromes. So, in this case, it's impossible.

Another case to consider is when the string has repeating characters but is not entirely identical characters. For example, "aabb". Let's see:

- "aabb" is not a palindrome.

- But, if I partition it into "aa" and "bb", both are palindromes.

- If I partition it into "a", "a", "b", "b", each single character is a palindrome.

- If I partition it into "aab", "b", "aab" is not a palindrome, and "b" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, partitioning into "aab" and "b" doesn't work because "b" is a palindrome. I need to find a partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome.

Wait, but "aabb" itself is not a palindrome, so I can just partition it as one substring: "aabb". That would satisfy the condition.

Wait, no, "aabb" is not a palindrome, so that works.

Another example: "abba".

- "abba" is a palindrome.

- So, I need to split it into smaller parts.

- Possible partitions:

- "a", "bba" -> "a" is a palindrome.

- "ab", "ba" -> both "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes. So, this works.

- "abb", "a" -> "a" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, partitioning into "ab" and "ba" works.

Another example: "abc".

- "abc" is not a palindrome, so partitioning it as one substring works.

Another example: "aaa".

- "aaa" is a palindrome.

- Possible partitions:

- "a", "a", "a" -> all single characters are palindromes.

- "aa", "a" -> both are palindromes.

- "a", "aa" -> both are palindromes.

- So, no partition exists where none of the substrings is a palindrome.

So, seems like if the string is a palindrome and all its substrings are palindromes, then it's impossible.

But, in the case of "abba", I could partition it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for a palindrome string, I can check if there exists at least one position where I can split the string into two non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "aabb", splitting into "aabb" as one substring works since it's not a palindrome.

In "aaa", no split results in non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, for a palindrome string, I need to check if I can split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But, in "abba", I can do that.

Wait, but "abba" is a palindrome, and I split it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

Similarly, in "abc", which is not a palindrome, I can keep it as one substring.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome, no split results in non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, for a palindrome string, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split it into two substrings where neither substring is a palindrome.

To check if a string is a palindrome, I can compare it with its reverse.

To check if a substring is a palindrome, same way.

But, with the constraints being up to 10^6 characters in total, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome, then it reads the same forwards and backwards.

If I try to split a palindrome into two parts, say, at position i, then the two parts are s[0..i-1] and s[i..n-1].

For these two parts to both be non-palindromes, neither s[0..i-1] nor s[i..n-1] should be palindromes.

But, since s is a palindrome, s[0..i-1] is a prefix, and s[i..n-1] is the corresponding suffix that mirrors s[0..i-1].

So, if s[0..i-1] is not a palindrome, then s[i..n-1], being its mirror, might or might not be a palindrome, depending on the specific string.

Wait, but in "abba", s[0..1] is "ab", which is not a palindrome, and s[2..3] is "ba", which is also not a palindrome.

In "aaa", s[0..1] is "aa", which is a palindrome, and s[2..2] is "a", which is also a palindrome.

So, in "abba", I can find a split where both parts are not palindromes, but in "aaa", I cannot.

So, for a palindrome string s, I need to check if there exists at least one position i (1 <= i < n) such that both s[0..i-1] and s[i..n-1] are not palindromes.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[0..i-1] and s[i..n-1] are mirror images of each other.

So, if s[0..i-1] is not a palindrome, then s[i..n-1] may or may not be a palindrome.

I need to find at least one i where both are not palindromes.

To optimize this, I need an efficient way to check if a substring is a palindrome.

One way is to precompute the prefix and suffix sums for equality, but that might not be straightforward.

An alternative approach is to iterate through possible split points and check for palindromes.

But, with strings up to 10^6 characters, I need this to be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find a position where s[0] != s[i], which would make s[0..i-1] not equal to s[i..n-1], but I need to ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

Wait, no, that might not be sufficient.

Let me think differently.

If the string is not a palindrome, I can output the whole string as one partition.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to try splitting it into two or more parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

To check if a string is a palindrome, I can compare it with its reverse.

To check if a substring is a palindrome, same approach.

But, for efficiency, I need a way to quickly determine if a substring is a palindrome.

One efficient way to check for palindromes is using Manacher's algorithm, which can find all palindromic substrings in linear time.

However, implementing Manacher's algorithm might be complex, and I need to think if there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, I can observe that if a string is a palindrome and consists of repeating characters, like "aaa", then any substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

If a string is a palindrome but does not consist of repeating characters, like "abba", then I might be able to find a split where both parts are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, I can check if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, and the string is a palindrome, then it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

If the string is a palindrome but has at least two different characters, then I can try splitting it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "racecar", splitting into "rac" and "ecar" works, as neither is a palindrome.

So, perhaps, for palindrome strings with at least two distinct characters, such a partition always exists.

I need to verify this.

Take "racecar":

- "racecar" is a palindrome.

- Split into "rac" and "ecar".

- "rac" is not a palindrome.

- "ecar" is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

Another example: "rotator".

- "rotator" is a palindrome.

- Split into "rota" and "tor".

- "rota" is not a palindrome.

- "tor" is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

Another example: "aabbccbaab".

- This is a palindrome.

- Split into "aabbcc" and "baab".

- "aabbcc" is not a palindrome.

- "baab" is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Try another split: "aabb" and "cbaab".

- "aabb" is not a palindrome.

- "cbaab" is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

So, in this case, I can find a split where both parts are not palindromes.

But, is this always possible for palindromes with at least two distinct characters?

Let me consider a palindrome with at least two distinct characters.

Suppose the string is of length n.

Since it's a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

If there are at least two distinct characters, there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[0].

Let me consider splitting the string at such a position.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a position i where s[i] != s[0], and then split the string into s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1].

Since s is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i].

So, if s[i] != s[0], then s[n-1-i] != s[0].

So, both s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1] are not single-character strings, and perhaps not palindromes.

But, I need to ensure that neither of these parts is a palindrome.

Let me try this approach with "abba":

- s = "abba"

- s[0] = 'a'

- Find i > 0 where s[i] != 'a', so i=1 (s[1]='b')

- Split into s[0..1]='ab' and s[2..3]='ba'

- Both 'ab' and 'ba' are not palindromes.

- So, this works.

Another example: "racecar"

- s = "racecar"

- s[0] = 'r'

- Find i > 0 where s[i] != 'r', say i=1 (s[1]='a')

- Split into s[0..1]='ra' and s[2..6]='cecarr'

- Wait, s[2..6] is 'cecarr', which is not a palindrome.

- 'ra' is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

Another example: "aabbccbaab"

- s = "aabbccbaab"

- s[0] = 'a'

- Find i > 0 where s[i] != 'a', say i=2 (s[2]='b')

- Split into s[0..2]='aab' and s[3..11]='bccbaab'

- 'aab' is not a palindrome.

- 'bccbaab' is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

Another example: "abcba"

- s = "abcba"

- s[0] = 'a'

- Find i > 0 where s[i] != 'a', say i=1 (s[1]='b')

- Split into s[0..1]='ab' and s[2..4]='cba'

- 'ab' is not a palindrome.

- 'cba' is not a palindrome.

- So, this works.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Now, consider a palindrome with all characters the same, like "aaa".

- s = "aaa"

- s[0] = 'a'

- There is no i > 0 where s[i] != 'a', so this approach doesn't apply.

- As we saw earlier, it's impossible to partition "aaa" into non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, the general approach is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output the whole string as one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome and consists of repeating the same character, output "NO".

- If the string is a palindrome and has at least two distinct characters, find a position i where s[i] != s[0], and split the string into s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1], and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- If not, try another split.

But, in the examples above, this approach seems to work.

Is there any case where this approach fails, i.e., the string is a palindrome with at least two distinct characters, but splitting at some i where s[i] != s[0] doesn't result in both parts being non-palindromes?

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider s = "abba"

- As above, splitting at i=1: s[0..1]='ab', s[2..3]='ba'

- Both are not palindromes.

Another example: s = "racecar"

- Split at i=1: s[0..1]='ra', s[2..6]='cecarr'

- Both are not palindromes.

Another example: s = "rotator"

- Split at i=3: s[0..3]='rota', s[4..7]='tor'

- 'tor' is not a palindrome.

- 'rota' is not a palindrome.

Another example: s = "aabbccbaab"

- Split at i=2: s[0..2]='aab', s[3..11]='bccbaab'

- Both are not palindromes.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if the string is a palindrome and has at least two distinct characters, but splitting at some i where s[i] != s[0] results in one part being a palindrome?

Is there such a case?

Let me construct a palindrome with at least two distinct characters where splitting at any i where s[i] != s[0] results in at least one palindrome part.

Suppose s = "abba"

- Split at i=1: 'ab' and 'ba' — both not palindromes.

- Split at i=2: 'abb' and 'a' — 'a' is a palindrome.

- So, in this case, if I split at i=1, both parts are not palindromes.

- So, it's fine.

Another example: s = "abcba"

- Split at i=1: 'ab' and 'cba' — both not palindromes.

- Split at i=2: 'abc' and 'ba' — 'abc' is not a palindrome, 'ba' is not a palindrome.

- Split at i=3: 'abcb' and 'a' — 'a' is a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting at i=1 or i=2 works.

Another example: s = "abcdcba"

- Split at i=1: 'ab' and 'dcbabcd'

- 'ab' is not a palindrome.

- 'dcbabcd' is not a palindrome.

- So, it works.

Another example: s = "abacaba"

- This is a palindrome with distinct characters.

- Split at i=1: 'ab' and 'acaba'

- 'ab' is not a palindrome.

- 'acaba' is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Split at i=2: 'aba' and 'caba'

- 'aba' is a palindrome.

- 'caba' is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Split at i=3: 'abac' and 'aba'

- 'abac' is not a palindrome.

- 'aba' is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Split at i=4: 'abaca' and 'ba'

- 'abaca' is a palindrome.

- 'ba' is not a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Split at i=5: 'abacab' and 'a'

- 'abacab' is not a palindrome.

- 'a' is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

Hmm, in this case, it seems that for s = "abacaba", which is a palindrome with distinct characters, splitting into two parts always results in at least one palindrome.

Wait, but earlier examples seemed to work.

Is there something different about "abacaba"?

Let me check if "abacaba" has any substring that is not a palindrome.

"abacaba" is a palindrome.

Let's check its substrings:

- "a": palindrome

- "ab": not palindrome

- "aba": palindrome

- "abac": not palindrome

- "abaca": palindrome

- "abacab": not palindrome

- "abacaba": palindrome

So, possible non-palindrome substrings are "ab", "abac", and "abacab".

So, if I partition into "ab" and "acaba", but "acaba" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "abac" and "aba" — "aba" is a palindrome.

"abaca" is a palindrome.

"abacab" and "a" — "a" is a palindrome.

So, it seems impossible to partition "abacaba" into substrings where none are palindromes.

But according to my earlier approach, since it's a palindrome with distinct characters, I should be able to split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But in this case, it's not working.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Is there a way to partition "abacaba"?

Let's try partitioning into more than two parts.

For example:

- "ab", "ac", "aba"

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "ac" is not a palindrome.

- "aba" is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

Another partition:

- "ab", "a", "caba"

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "a" is a palindrome.

- "caba" is a palindrome.

- Doesn't work.

Another partition:

- "aba", "c", "aba"

- All are palindromes.

- Doesn't work.

Another partition:

- "ab", "ac", "ab", "a"

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "ac" is not a palindrome.

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "a" is a palindrome.

- So, this doesn't work.

It seems that no matter how I partition "abacaba", at least one substring is a palindrome.

So, in this case, even though the string is a palindrome with distinct characters, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

This contradicts my earlier assumption that such a partition always exists for palindromes with distinct characters.

So, I need a better way to determine when such a partition exists.

Let me think about the properties of the string.

If a string is a palindrome and consists of repeating the same character, like "aaa", then any substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

If a string is a palindrome and has at least two distinct characters, it's possible that I can split it into non-palindrome substrings, but as seen in "abacaba", it's not always possible.

So, I need a way to determine whether such a partition exists.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- To do this, find a position i where s[i] != s[0], and split into s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1].

- Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If yes, output them.

- If not, try another i.

- If no such i exists, output "NO".

In the case of "abacaba", this approach would try splitting at i=1 ("ab" and "acaba"), but "acaba" is a palindrome, so it doesn't work.

Then, try i=2 ("aba" and "caba"), but "aba" is a palindrome.

Then, i=3 ("abac" and "aba"), "aba" is a palindrome.

i=4 ("abaca" and "ba"), "abaca" is a palindrome.

i=5 ("abacab" and "a"), "a" is a palindrome.

So, no split into two parts works, so output "NO".

Similarly, in "aaa", which is a palindrome with all characters the same, output "NO".

In "abba", splitting at i=1 ("ab" and "ba") works.

In "racecar", splitting at i=1 ("ra" and "cecarr") works.

So, this approach seems valid.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a fast way to check if a substring is a palindrome.

One way is to precompute the palindromicity of all substrings, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=10^6.

An alternative is to observe that for a substring s[l..r] to be a palindrome, s[l] must equal s[r], s[l+1] must equal s[r-1], and so on.

But checking this for each potential split point i would be too slow.

Is there a smarter way?

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest substring that is not a palindrome and output the string split into that substring and the rest.

But I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Another idea: if the string is a palindrome and has at least one position where s[i] != s[0], then I can split at that position and check if both parts are not palindromes.

If not, try splitting at multiple positions.

But, with large n, I need this to be efficient.

Let me consider that for a palindrome string s, if I can find a position i such that s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome, then I can partition the string into s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can find the smallest i such that s[0..i] is not a palindrome, and then check if s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

But, this might not always work, as shown in "abacaba".

Wait, in "abacaba", s[0..1]='ab' is not a palindrome, and s[2..6]='caba' is a palindrome.

s[0..2]='aba' is a palindrome.

s[0..3]='abac' is not a palindrome, but s[4..6]='aba' is a palindrome.

s[0..4]='abaca' is a palindrome.

s[0..5]='abacab' is not a palindrome, but s[6..6]='a' is a palindrome.

So, in this case, no split into two parts where both are not palindromes exists.

Hence, output "NO".

So, perhaps, in general, for palindrome strings with at least two distinct characters, if I can find at least one split where both parts are not palindromes, then output "YES" with that partition; else, output "NO".

But checking this for every possible split is too slow for n=10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a palindrome string s, if I can find a prefix that is not a palindrome and a suffix that is not a palindrome, then I can split the string into those prefix and suffix.

To find such a prefix efficiently, I can iterate through the string and find the smallest i such that s[0..i] is not a palindrome.

Then, check if s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

If it is, then this split works.

If not, try the next i where s[0..i] is not a palindrome.

But, in "abacaba", s[0..1]='ab' is not a palindrome, but s[2..6]='caba' is a palindrome.

s[0..3]='abac' is not a palindrome, but s[4..6]='aba' is a palindrome.

s[0..5]='abacab' is not a palindrome, but s[6..6]='a' is a palindrome.

So, no split works.

Hence, "NO".

In "abba", s[0..1]='ab' is not a palindrome, and s[2..3]='ba' is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

In "racecar", s[0..1]='ra' is not a palindrome, and s[2..6]='cecarr' is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

In "aaa", all prefixes and suffixes are palindromes, so no split works.

Hence, "NO".

So, perhaps, implementing this approach would work.

To make it efficient, I need a way to quickly check if a substring is a palindrome.

One way is to precompute the palindromicity of all prefixes.

Let me think about prefix palindromes.

Define P[i] to be True if s[0..i] is a palindrome, else False.

Similarly, define S[i] to be True if s[i..n-1] is a palindrome, else False.

Since s is a palindrome, S[i] == P[n-1-i].

So, I can compute P[i] for all i.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, if not P[i] and not S[i+1], then splitting at i+1 works.

So, I can iterate through i from 0 to n-1, and find the smallest i where not P[i] and not S[i+1].

If such an i exists, output "YES", and the partition s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1].

Else, output "NO".

To compute P[i], I can iterate through i and check if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

But, for large n, this would be O(n^2).

To optimize, I can compute P[i] in O(1) time using the fact that P[i] is True if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

But checking s[0..i] == s[i..0] for each i is O(n^2).

Alternatively, I can use dynamic programming to compute P[i] in O(n) time.

Define P[i] as follows:

- P[0] = True

- For i > 0, P[i] = P[i-1] and s[0] == s[i]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, P[i] should be True if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

So, P[i] = P[i-1] and s[0] == s[i]

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

For example, s = "aba", P[2] = True because "aba" is a palindrome.

P[1] = True because "ab" is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, P[1] is False because "ab" is not a palindrome.

But according to P[i] = P[i-1] and s[0] == s[i], P[1] = P[0] and s[0] == s[1] = True and 'a' == 'b' = False, which is correct.

P[2] = P[1] and s[0] == s[2] = False and 'a' == 'a' = False, which is incorrect because "aba" is a palindrome.

Wait, this doesn't work.

So, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Let me think differently.

I can precompute the longest prefix which is a palindrome.

But I need to check for each i if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

An efficient way to check if s[0..i] is a palindrome is to reverse s[0..i] and see if it equals s[0..i].

But reversing each prefix would take O(n^2) time.

Alternatively, I can compute the hash of s[0..i] and its reverse, and compare the hashes.

If the hashes match, it's a palindrome.

This can be done in O(n) time using rolling hashes.

Similarly, compute the hash of s[i..n-1] and its reverse.

But, this might be complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can optimize the approach.

Let me consider that s is a palindrome.

So, s[0..i] is a palindrome if and only if s[i..n-1] is a palindrome.

Wait, no, since s is a palindrome, s[i..n-1] is the mirror of s[0..n-1-i].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that s is a palindrome.

So, s[0] == s[n-1], s[1] == s[n-2], and so on.

Now, for a split at position i, s[0..i-1] and s[i..n-1].

Since s is a palindrome, s[i..n-1] is the mirror of s[0..n-1-i].

So, s[0..i-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[i..n-1] is a palindrome.

Wait, no.

If s is a palindrome, then s[0..i-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[n-i..n-1] is a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the center of the palindrome.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I recall that in palindromic strings, certain properties hold regarding their prefixes and suffixes.

Perhaps I can use the concept of the longest palindromic prefix.

Compute the longest palindromic prefix for the string.

If the entire string is a palindrome, but not all prefixes are palindromes, then I can find a position to split the string into two non-palindrome parts.

Wait, but in "abacaba", all necessary splits result in at least one palindrome.

So, maybe I need to check if there exists at least one position where both parts are not palindromes.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can implement the following:

- For each test case, check if the string is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the whole string as one partition.

- If it is a palindrome, check if all characters are the same. If so, output "NO".

- Else, try to find a position i where s[i] != s[0], and check if s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1] are both not palindromes.

- If such an i exists, output "YES" and the partition.

- Else, output "NO".

To optimize, I can precompute the positions where s[i] != s[0], and for each such i, check if s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1] are not palindromes.

But checking for palindromes for each i would be too slow for large n.

So, perhaps, I can find a way to quickly determine if s[0..i] is a palindrome for the positions where s[i] != s[0].

Wait, but even better, perhaps I can find the smallest i where s[i] != s[0], and check if s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

If not, try the next i where s[i] != s[0].

Given time constraints, perhaps I can implement this and see.

Let me try with "abacaba":

- s = "abacaba"

- s[0] = 'a'

- Find i where s[i] != 'a': i=1,3,5

- Check s[0..1]='ab' (not palindrome), s[2..6]='caba' (palindrome) — doesn't work.

- Check s[0..3]='abac' (not palindrome), s[4..6]='aba' (palindrome) — doesn't work.

- Check s[0..5]='abacab' (not palindrome), s[6..6]='a' (palindrome) — doesn't work.

- So, no split works.

Hence, "NO".

Another example: "abba"

- s = "abba"

- s[0] = 'a'

- Find i where s[i] != 'a': i=1,2

- Check s[0..1]='ab' (not palindrome), s[2..3]='ba' (not palindrome) — works.

- So, output "YES" with partition ["ab", "ba"]

Great.

Another example: "aaa"

- s = "aaa"

- s[0] = 'a'

- No i where s[i] != 'a'

- So, "NO"

Perfect.

So, this seems to work.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a way to quickly check if s[0..i] is a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome.

But, since s is a palindrome, s[i+1..n-1] is the mirror of s[0..n-1-i].

So, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[0..n-1-i] is a palindrome.

Wait, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[i+1..n-1] == reverse(s[i+1..n-1]).

But since s is a palindrome, s[i+1..n-1] == s[0..n-1-i].

So, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if s[0..n-1-i] is a palindrome.

Wait, no.

Wait, s is a palindrome, so s[0..k] == s[n-1-k..n-1].

So, s[i+1..n-1] == s[0..n-1-i].

Therefore, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[0..n-1-i] is a palindrome.

So, to check if s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome, I can check if s[0..n-1-i] is a palindrome.

Similarly, to check if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

So, I need to precompute for each i, whether s[0..i] is a palindrome.

Let me define P[i] = True if s[0..i] is a palindrome, else False.

Then, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if P[n-1-i].

So, for a given i, I need not P[i] and not P[n-1-i-1].

Wait, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if P[n-1 - (i+1)] = P[n-2 - i].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that s is a palindrome, so s[i] == s[n-1-i].

Therefore, s[i+1..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[0..n-2-i] is a palindrome.

Wait, this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to iterate through the string and find the first position i where s[i] != s[0], and then check if s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

If not, try the next i where s[i] != s[0].

If no such i exists, output "NO".

This seems straightforward, and for the given constraints, it should be efficient enough, especially since the sum of |s| across all test cases is 10^6.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I can precompute all positions where s[i] != s[0], and then for each such position, check if s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

But, checking s[0..i] for palindrome for each such i would be O(n) per check, which is too slow for large n.

Is there a smarter way?

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal i where s[i] != s[0], and check if s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

If that doesn't work, try the next i, and so on.

But, in the worst case, this could still be O(n^2).

To optimize, perhaps I can find the smallest i where s[i] != s[0], and s[0..i] is not a palindrome, and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

To check if s[0..i] is a palindrome, I can precompute the hash of s[0..i] and its reverse, and compare them.

Similarly for s[i+1..n-1].

But implementing hashing might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can observe that if s[0..i] is not a palindrome, and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome, then both parts must have at least one position where the characters don't match their counterparts.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider that for s[0..i] to not be a palindrome, there must exist at least one pair (k, i-k) where s[k] != s[i-k].

But this is the definition of a non-palindrome.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can implement the following:

- For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the whole string.

- Else:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else:

- Find all positions i where s[i] != s[0].

- For each such i, check if s[0..i] is not a palindrome and s[i+1..n-1] is not a palindrome.

- If any such i exists, output "YES" and the partition s[0..i] and s[i+1..n-1].

- Else, output "NO".

To optimize, I can find the smallest i where s[i] != s[0], and check the conditions.

If it doesn't work, try the next i.

Given that the sum of |s| is 10^6, and t <= 10^4, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient.

To make it efficient, perhaps I can precompute the palindromicity of all prefixes.

Let me try to precompute P[i], which is True if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

I can do this using dynamic programming.

Define P[i] as follows:

- P[-1] = True (empty string is a palindrome)

- For i >= 0, P[i] = P[i-1] and s[0] == s[i]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, P[i] should be True if s[0..i] is a palindrome.

So, P[i] = P[i-1] and s[i] == s[n-1-i]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the string and check for each i if s[0..i
