Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a permutation p of size n, and a number x that we need to find. A permutation is an array of distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation of size 5.

We are supposed to perform at most 2 swap operations on the permutation before running a binary search algorithm. The goal is to rearrange the permutation in such a way that after performing the binary search, p_l equals x.

Wait, but binary search requires the array to be sorted, right? So, if the array isn't sorted, the binary search might not work as expected. But the problem says we can perform up to 2 swaps to make it work.

It also mentions that it can be shown that 2 operations are always sufficient. That's interesting. So, no matter how the permutation is arranged, we can always make the binary search find x with at most 2 swaps.

First, I need to understand how the binary search is being performed here.

Looking at the algorithm:

- Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1

- While r - l > 1:

- Set m = floor((r + l) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- End loop

- After the loop, p_l should be equal to x

Wait, this seems a bit unusual. In standard binary search, we have l = 0 and r = n - 1, and we adjust m based on comparisons.

Here, l starts at 1 and r at n + 1, which is different from the standard indices.

Also, p_m is accessed using 1-based indexing, while in Python, lists are 0-based.

I need to make sure I understand how the indices work in this algorithm.

Let me try to rephrase the binary search steps:

- Initialize l = 0 (0-based index) and r = n (one past the last element)

- While r - l > 1:

- Set m = floor((l + r) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- End loop

- After the loop, p_l should be equal to x

Wait, but in the problem statement, l starts at 1 and r at n + 1, which suggests 1-based indexing.

But in Python, lists are 0-based, so I need to adjust for that.

Maybe it's better to stick with 1-based indexing for p to avoid confusion.

Let me try to understand what the binary search is trying to achieve.

The loop invariant seems to be that after each iteration, p_l <= x < p_r.

Eventually, when r - l = 1, p_l should be the largest value <= x, and p_r should be the smallest value > x.

But the problem wants p_l to be exactly equal to x.

So, for p_l to be equal to x after the binary search, x must be present in the array, which it is, since p is a permutation of 1 to n, and x is between 1 and n.

Wait, no, x can be any integer between 1 and n, inclusive, and p is a permutation of 1 to n, so x is guaranteed to be in p.

But the binary search algorithm provided might not necessarily find x if the array is not sorted.

So, the challenge is to perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find x correctly.

The problem also says that 2 swaps are always sufficient.

I need to find a way to rearrange the array with at most 2 swaps so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, let's understand what the binary search does.

Given the way it's implemented, it seems to be finding the largest index l such that p_l <= x.

But we need p_l to be exactly equal to x.

So, we need to arrange the array such that after the binary search, p_l == x.

One way to think about this is to make sure that x is in a position where the binary search will land on it.

But the array isn't sorted, so the binary search might not work as expected.

However, since we can perform up to 2 swaps, we have some flexibility to adjust the array.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Determine where the binary search will end up without any swaps.

2. See if x is already at that position. If yes, then no swaps are needed.

3. If not, see if we can swap x to that position with one swap.

4. If x is not at the target position and cannot be brought there with one swap, consider two swaps.

Wait, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Let me try to simulate this with an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 6, x = 3

p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This is already sorted.

Perform the binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

Loop:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, set r = 4

Now, r - l = 4 - 1 = 3 > 1

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 3? Yes, set l = 2

Now, r - l = 4 - 2 = 2 > 1

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, set l = 3

Now, r - l = 4 - 3 = 1 <= 1, exit loop

p_l = p_3 = 3, which equals x = 3

So, no swaps are needed in this case.

Output: 0

Which matches the first output in the example.

Second example:

n = 6, x = 5

p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Perform the binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, set l = 4

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, set l = 5

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, set l = 6

Now, r - l = 7 - 6 = 1, exit loop

p_l = p_6 = 4 != 5

So, need to perform swaps.

In the example, they performed one swap: swap indices 3 and 4

Original p: [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

After swap 3 and 4: [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 6 <= 5? No, set r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 1 <= 5? Yes, set l = 2

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 5 <= 5? Yes, set l = 3

Now, r - l = 4 - 3 = 1, exit loop

p_l = p_3 = 5 == x = 5

So, one swap was enough.

Third example:

n = 5, x = 1

p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3

p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, set r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2

p_2 = 5 <= 1? No, set r = 2

Now, r - l = 2 - 1 = 1, exit loop

p_l = p_1 = 3 != 1

Need to perform swaps.

In the example, they performed two swaps:

Swap 2 and 4: [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

Then swap 1 and 5: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3

p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, set r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 1? No, set r = 2

Now, r - l = 2 - 1 = 1, exit loop

p_l = p_1 = 1 == x = 1

So, two swaps were needed in this case.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to make sure that x is at the position where the binary search will end up.

So, if I can determine the final l after the binary search, and make sure that p_l = x, then the condition is satisfied.

But how do I determine where the binary search will end up without knowing the sorted order?

Wait, the binary search is being performed on an unsorted array, which means that the behavior is unpredictable, unless I can control the positions in a certain way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I know where the binary search will stop, say at position l_final.

I need to have p[l_final] = x.

To achieve this, I can:

- Option 1: Swap x to position l_final.

- Option 2: If x is already at l_final, do nothing.

- Option 3: If x is not at l_final, and some other element is at l_final, I might need to swap x to l_final, but if x is not directly swappable, I might need a second swap to make it happen.

But how do I know where the binary search will stop?

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the binary search to find out where it would stop.

Given that the binary search is deterministic, for a given array, l and r, it will always stop at the same l.

So, I can simulate the binary search to find l_final.

Then, check if p[l_final] == x.

If yes, do nothing.

If not, see if I can make p[l_final] == x with at most 2 swaps.

One way to do this is:

- Find the current p[l_final].

- Find the position of x in the array.

- If p[l_final] != x, swap p[l_final] with x.

- If x was at some position k, swap p[l_final] with p[k].

- If p[l_final] was already x, do nothing.

Wait, but I need to perform swaps before running the binary search.

So, I need to rearrange the array such that after the rearrangement, when I run the binary search, it stops at p[l] == x.

To achieve this, I need to ensure that after swaps, p[l] == x, where l is determined by the binary search on the swapped array.

This seems recursive, because l depends on the arrangement of the array.

This seems tricky.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me consider that with at most 2 swaps, I can place x anywhere I want in the array.

Wait, no. With one swap, I can place x at one position, but the other element involved in the swap might disrupt the array in a way that affects the binary search.

Wait, maybe I should consider where the binary search stops, and make sure that x is at that position.

But to know where the binary search stops, I need to know the final l, which depends on the array's arrangement.

This seems circular.

Perhaps I can consider that after at most 2 swaps, I can make the array such that p_l == x.

Let me consider that I can choose any two positions to swap, in order to achieve p_l == x after the binary search.

But I don't know l in advance because it depends on the array's arrangement.

This seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can consider that no matter where the binary search stops, I can make p_l == x by swapping x to that position.

But I don't know where it will stop in advance.

Wait, perhaps I can fix l to be the position where x should be, and arrange the array so that the binary search stops at that l.

But again, I need to determine l in advance.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix l to be the position where x is after the swaps.

Then, I need to arrange the array so that the binary search stops at that l.

But the binary search stops at l when r - l == 1, and p_m > x or p_m <= x determines the direction.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that with at most 2 swaps, I can make the array such that p_l == x after the binary search.

Given that, perhaps I can consider swapping x to the position where the binary search stops, and if necessary, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But again, I don't know where the binary search stops in advance.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the binary search stops at a specific l, and see what needs to be done to make p_l == x.

Let me try to simulate the binary search to see where it stops.

Given the initial array, I can simulate the binary search to find l_final.

Then, if p[l_final] != x, I can swap p[l_final] with x.

But if x is at some other position, I need to swap x to l_final.

If there are no other elements in between, one swap might suffice.

If there are, I might need a second swap.

Wait, but in the second example, they performed one swap to achieve the goal.

In the third example, they performed two swaps.

So, it seems that in some cases, one swap is enough, and in others, two swaps are needed.

But the problem allows up to two swaps.

I need to find a general strategy that works for any permutation and any x.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Simulate the binary search on the original array to find l_final.

2. Check if p[l_final] == x.

- If yes, output 0 swaps.

- If not, find the position of x in the array, say k.

- Swap p[l_final] with p[k], and output 1 swap.

But wait, in the third example, this approach would have worked:

- Original p: [3,5,4,2,1]

- Binary search stops at l = 1, p[1] = 3 != 1.

- Position of x=1 is at index 5.

- Swap p[1] and p[5]: [1,5,4,2,3]

- Now, binary search stops at l=1, p[1]=1==x=1.

- So, one swap suffices.

But in the example, they performed two swaps: swap 2 and 4, then swap 1 and 5.

Maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the goal.

So, my approach seems valid.

Wait, but in another example, it might require two swaps.

Let me think of a case where one swap is not enough.

Suppose n=4, x=2, p=[4,3,2,1]

Binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=2 <=2? Yes, l=3

m= floor((3+5)/2)=4

p[4]=1 <=2? Yes, l=4

m= floor((4+5)/2)=4

p[4]=1 <=2? Yes, l=4

Now, r - l =5-4=1, stop.

p_l = p[4]=1 !=2

So, need to perform swaps.

Position of x=2 is at index 3.

Swap p[4] and p[3]: [4,3,1,2]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=1 <=2? Yes, l=3

m= floor((3+5)/2)=4

p[4]=2 <=2? Yes, l=4

m= floor((4+5)/2)=4

p[4]=2 <=2? Yes, l=4

Now, p_l = p[4]=2 ==x=2

So, one swap suffices.

But according to the problem, 2 swaps are always sufficient, but sometimes one might be enough.

In the third example, they performed two swaps, but one swap could have sufficed.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap is not enough, but in reality, one swap seems to suffice in all cases.

Wait, maybe in some cases, one swap isn't enough.

Let me think of a case where one swap isn't enough.

Suppose n=4, x=3, p=[1,2,4,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=4 <=3? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=2 <=3? Yes, l=2

m= floor((2+3)/2)=2

p[2]=2 <=3? Yes, l=2

Now, r - l =3-2=1, stop.

p_l = p[2]=2 !=3

So, need to perform swaps.

Position of x=3 is at index 4.

Swap p[2] and p[4]: [1,3,4,2]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=4 <=3? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=3? Yes, l=2

m= floor((2+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=3? Yes, l=2

p_l = p[2]=3 ==x=3

So, one swap suffices.

Another example:

n=5, x=2, p=[5,3,4,1,2]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=4 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=2? No, r=2

Now, r - l =2-1=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=5 !=2

Position of x=2 is at index 5.

Swap p[1] and p[5]: [2,3,4,1,5]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=4 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=2? No, r=2

m= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=2 <=2? Yes, l=1

Now, r - l =2-1=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=2 ==x=2

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, perhaps in all cases, one swap suffices.

But the problem says that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but maybe one swap is sufficient in all cases.

Wait, in the third example, they performed two swaps, but perhaps one swap would have sufficed.

Let me check.

n=5, x=1, p=[3,5,4,2,1]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=4 <=1? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=5 <=1? No, r=2

m= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=3 <=1? No, r=1

Now, r - l =1-1=0 <=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=3 !=1

Position of x=1 is at index 5.

Swap p[1] and p[5]: [1,5,4,2,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=4 <=1? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=5 <=1? No, r=2

m= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=1 <=1? Yes, l=1

Now, r - l =2-1=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=1 ==x=1

So, one swap suffices.

But in the example, they performed two swaps: swap 2 and 4, then swap 1 and 5.

Maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the goal.

So, perhaps in all cases, one swap suffices, but the example showed two swaps.

Maybe the problem allows up to two swaps, but sometimes fewer swaps are needed.

So, the general strategy is:

- Simulate the binary search to find l_final.

- If p[l_final] == x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p[l_final] with x.

- Output the number of swaps (1 in this case).

But in the third example, they performed two swaps, but one swap would have sufficed.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap isn't enough, but in reality, one swap seems to suffice in all cases.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a case where one swap isn't enough.

Let me think of n=4, x=3, p=[1,4,2,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=2 <=3? Yes, l=3

m= floor((3+5)/2)=4

p[4]=3 <=3? Yes, l=4

m= floor((4+5)/2)=4

p[4]=3 <=3? Yes, l=4

p_l = p[4]=3 ==x=3

So, no swaps needed.

Another case: n=4, x=2, p=[4,1,3,2]

Binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=3 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=1 <=2? Yes, l=2

m= floor((2+3)/2)=2

p[2]=1 <=2? Yes, l=2

Now, r - l =3-2=1, stop.

p_l = p[2]=1 !=2

Swap p[2] with p[4]: [4,2,3,1]

Binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p[3]=3 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=2 <=2? Yes, l=2

m= floor((2+3)/2)=2

p[2]=2 <=2? Yes, l=2

p_l = p[2]=2 ==x=2

So, one swap suffices.

Wait, I can't find a case where one swap isn't enough.

Maybe in all cases, one swap suffices.

Perhaps the problem allows up to two swaps to cover all possible cases, and in some cases, two swaps are needed, but in the examples, one swap suffices.

Wait, in the third example, they performed two swaps, but as shown earlier, one swap would have sufficed.

So, perhaps in all cases, one swap suffices, but the problem allows up to two swaps for safety.

Alternatively, maybe in some specific cases, two swaps are needed.

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider n=5, x=2, p=[4,3,5,1,2]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=5 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=2? No, r=2

m= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=4 <=2? No, r=1

Now, r - l =1-1=0 <=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=4 !=2

Position of x=2 is at index 5.

Swap p[1] and p[5]: [2,3,5,1,4]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p[3]=5 <=2? No, r=3

m= floor((1+3)/2)=2

p[2]=3 <=2? No, r=2

m= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=2 <=2? Yes, l=1

Now, r - l =2-1=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=2 ==x=2

Again, one swap suffices.

Another example: n=6, x=3, p=[4,5,6,1,2,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p[4]=1 <=3? Yes, l=4

m= floor((4+7)/2)=5

p[5]=2 <=3? Yes, l=5

m= floor((5+7)/2)=6

p[6]=3 <=3? Yes, l=6

Now, r - l =7-6=1, stop.

p_l = p[6]=3 ==x=3

So, no swaps needed.

Wait, I'm not finding a case where one swap isn't enough.

Maybe in all cases, one swap suffices.

Perhaps the problem allows up to two swaps to cover all possible cases, but in practice, one swap is enough.

So, my strategy will be:

- Simulate the binary search to find l_final.

- If p[l_final] == x, output 0 swaps.

- Else, swap p[l_final] with x, and output 1 swap.

This seems straightforward.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

t = int(input())

while t > 0:

(n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))

array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]

res = func_1(array, x)

if res:

print(' '.join(res))

t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):

n = len(array)

(l, r) = (0, n)

while r - l > 1:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if array[mid] <= find:

l = mid

else:

r = mid

if l != array.index(find):

print(1)

return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]

else:

print(0)

So, the main function reads the input and calls func_1 for each test case.

func_1 performs the binary search to find l_final.

Then, checks if p[l_final] == x.

- If yes, prints 0.

- Else, prints 1 and the indices to swap (l_final + 1 and find's current index + 1).

Wait, but in Python, list indices start at 0, but the problem uses 1-based indexing.

In the function, array is 0-based.

So, array[l] corresponds to p_{l+1} in the problem's 1-based indexing.

Wait, but in the binary search, it's using 0-based indices.

Let me check.

Initialize l = 0, r = n

While r - l > 1:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if array[mid] <= find:

l = mid

else:

r = mid

This seems correct for 0-based indexing.

After the loop, l is the final position.

Then, it checks if l != array.index(find).

Wait, array.index(find) returns the index of find in the array.

If p[l] != x, then l != array.index(find), so it performs a swap between l and array.index(find).

Which corresponds to swapping positions l+1 and array.index(find)+1 in 1-based indexing.

Then, it prints 1 and the swap indices.

This seems to match the strategy I thought of.

But in the third example, they performed two swaps, while this approach would perform only one swap.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap isn't enough, but in reality, one swap seems to suffice.

Maybe the problem allows up to two swaps, but in practice, one swap is enough.

Alternatively, perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough, but I can't find such a case.

Let me consider n=5, x=3, p=[5,4,2,1,3]

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

mid=2, p[2]=2 <=3? Yes, l=2

mid= floor((2+5)/2)=3

p[3]=1 <=3? Yes, l=3

mid= floor((3+5)/2)=4

p[4]=3 <=3? Yes, l=4

Now, r - l =5-4=1, stop.

p_l = p[4]=3 ==x=3

So, no swaps needed.

Another case: n=5, x=4, p=[2,3,5,1,4]

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

mid=2, p[2]=5 <=4? No, r=2

mid= floor((0+2)/2)=1

p[1]=3 <=4? Yes, l=1

mid= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=3 <=4? Yes, l=1

Now, r - l =2-1=1, stop.

p_l = p[1]=3 !=4

Swap p[1] and p[4]: [4,3,5,1,2]

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

mid=2, p[2]=5 <=4? No, r=2

mid= floor((0+2)/2)=1

p[1]=4 <=4? Yes, l=1

mid= floor((1+2)/2)=1

p[1]=4 <=4? Yes, l=1

p_l = p[1]=4 ==x=4

So, one swap suffices.

Wait, I'm still not finding a case where one swap isn't enough.

Perhaps, in all cases, one swap suffices, and the problem allows up to two swaps as a safety net.

So, the provided program seems correct.

It simulates the binary search to find l_final.

If p[l_final] == x, it outputs 0.

Else, it outputs 1 and the swap between l_final and the position of x.

This seems to align with the strategy I thought of.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given Python program correctly addresses the problem of rearranging a permutation so that a binary search algorithm can find a specified element `x` with at most two swap operations.

## Approach
1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
    - We can perform up to two swaps on the permutation.
    - After swapping, a binary search is executed to find `x`, and we need to ensure that the binary search correctly identifies `x`.

2. **Binary Search Analysis**:
    - The binary search algorithm provided might not work correctly on an unsorted permutation.
    - Our goal is to adjust the permutation such that the binary search can locate `x` correctly.

3. **Strategy**:
    - Simulate the binary search to determine the final position `l_final` where the binary search stops.
    - If the element at `p[l_final]` is already `x`, no swaps are needed.
    - If `p[l_final]` is not `x`, swap the element at `p[l_final]` with `x` to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

4. **Implementation**:
    - Implement the binary search to find `l_final`.
    - Check if `p[l_final]` is `x`. If yes, output 0 swaps.
    - If not, perform a swap between `p[l_final]` and `x`, and output the swap operation.

## Solution Code
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

## Explanation
- **Step-by-step Simulation**:
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and the permutation array.
  - Use the `func_1` function to determine the necessary swaps.
  
- **Binary Search Simulation**:
  - Initialize `l` and `r` for binary search.
  - Adjust `l` and `r` based on the comparison of `p[m]` and `x`.
  
- **Swap Logic**:
  - If `p[l]` is not `x`, find the position of `x` and swap it with `p[l]`.
  - Output the swap operation if needed, otherwise indicate no swaps are needed.

This approach ensures that the binary search correctly finds `x` with at most one swap, adhering to the problem constraints.
