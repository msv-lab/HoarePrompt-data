Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a larger array of m integers. The goal is to make Vasya's array as different as possible from Petya's array, measured by the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what I'm supposed to do with them. For each test case, I get n and m, which are the sizes of Petya's array and the larger array from which Vasya will choose his array, respectively. Then, I get the array a of size n and the array b of size m.

My task is to select n elements from b, arrange them in a certain order, and call this array c. The objective is to maximize the sum of absolute differences between a and c, i.e., maximize D = sum(|a_i - c_i|) for i from 1 to n.

I need to consider all possible selections and arrangements of n elements from b to form c and find the one that gives the maximum D.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to maximize the difference is to make c as different as possible from a. That means, for each a_i, I want to choose a c_i that is as far away from a_i as possible.

Given that b is sorted, maybe sorting a and b in specific orders can help.

Wait, in the code provided, it sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each element in a, it chooses the corresponding element in b to maximize the difference.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4]

b = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

Sorted a: [1,2,4,6]

Sorted b in reverse: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Now, the code seems to select the first n elements from sorted b, which would be [7,5,3,3], and then compute the differences with sorted a.

So, D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13

But in the example, it says the output is 16, which is achieved by choosing c = [1,5,7,2], giving D = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

Wait, that's higher than 13. So, the approach in the code is not giving the correct maximum difference.

Hmm, maybe I need to pair the smallest a with the largest b, and so on.

Let me try that.

Sorted a: [1,2,4,6]

Sorted b in reverse: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pair a[0]=1 with b[0]=7: difference = 6

Pair a[1]=2 with b[1]=5: difference = 3

Pair a[2]=4 with b[2]=3: difference = 1

Pair a[3]=6 with b[3]=3: difference = 3

Total D = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13

But the example achieves 16 by choosing [1,5,7,2], which is higher.

So, perhaps just pairing sorted a with sorted b in reverse is not always optimal.

Maybe I need to consider all possible pairings.

Wait, that would be too slow for large n and m.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think differently.

For each a_i, I want to choose a c_i from b that maximizes |a_i - c_i|.

But I have to choose n distinct elements from b, since it's specified that Vasya chooses n integers from b.

Wait, no, the problem says "choose some n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order", but it doesn't specify that the integers have to be distinct. So, if there are duplicates in b, I can choose the same value multiple times.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "he wants to choose some n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n."

It doesn't specify that the integers have to be distinct, so duplicates in b can be chosen multiple times for c.

So, c can have duplicates if b has them.

In the first example, b = [3,5,1,7,2,3], so c could have up to two 3's, one 1, one 2, one 5, and one 7.

Wait, but in the example, c = [1,5,7,2], which are all unique, but it's possible to have duplicates if b has them.

So, I need to select n elements from b, allowing for duplicates if they exist, and arrange them in any order to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a.

This seems similar to assigning each a_i to a c_i such that the sum of |a_i - c_i| is maximized.

This sounds like a matching problem where I need to pair each a_i with a c_i from b to maximize the sum.

I recall that in assignment problems, the Hungarian algorithm can be used to minimize the sum, but here I need to maximize it.

Maybe I can convert it to a minimization problem by considering the negative differences.

Wait, but that might not work directly.

Another approach is to sort a and b in opposite orders and pair them accordingly.

Wait, in the code provided, it sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then pairs them.

But as seen in the example, this doesn't give the maximum difference.

In the example, pairing sorted a with sorted b in reverse gives D=13, but the example achieves D=16.

So, this approach is not optimal.

Maybe I need to consider all possible pairings.

But that's not efficient for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following:

For each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - c_i| is achieved by choosing the c_i that is either the largest possible or the smallest possible in b, depending on a_i's value.

But I need to choose c_i's such that each c_i is selected from b.

Wait, perhaps for each a_i, I can consider the maximum difference it can have with any c_i in b, and then select c_i's that maximize the total difference without reusing c_i's more times than they appear in b.

This sounds like a matching problem where I need to assign each a_i to a c_i in b, allowing for multiple assignments to the same c_i up to its frequency in b.

This seems similar to the assignment problem in weighted bipartite graphs, where one set is a_i's and the other set is b_i's with their frequencies.

But this might be too slow for large n and m.

Is there a smarter way?

Wait, perhaps I can sort both a and b, and then decide for each a_i whether to pair it with the largest possible b_j or the smallest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet.

Let me try to think of a greedy approach.

Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, for each a_i, choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, considering the available b_j's.

But I need to keep track of which b_j's have been used.

This seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can precompute for each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - b_j|, and then select n such differences without reusing b_j more times than their frequency.

But again, this seems like it would require some kind of matching algorithm.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Let me consider the maximum possible D.

The maximum D would be achieved if for each a_i, we can choose a c_i that is as far away from a_i as possible.

In other words, for each a_i, we want to choose c_i to be either the smallest or the largest possible in b, whichever gives the larger difference.

But since we have to choose n c_i's, we need to distribute them appropriately.

Wait, maybe I can sort b in sorted order and then select c_i's from both ends to maximize the differences.

For example, for some a_i's, choose the largest available b_j's, and for others, choose the smallest available b_j's.

This might be a way to maximize the total difference.

Let me try this with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6]

b = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

If I sort b: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Now, for a_i=1, the maximum difference is max(|1-1|=0, |1-7|=6) = 6, so choose 7.

For a_i=2, choose 7 again, but since 7 is already used once, and there are two 3's, I can still choose another 7.

Wait, b has only one 7.

Wait, b has two 3's, but only one 7.

So, if I choose 7 for a_i=1, then for a_i=2, I can choose 5, giving |2-5|=3.

Then for a_i=4, choose 1, giving |4-1|=3.

For a_i=6, choose 1 again, but only one 1 is available.

Wait, b has one 1, one 2, two 3's, one 5, and one 7.

So, if I choose 7 for a_i=1, then 5 for a_i=2, then 3 for a_i=4, and 3 for a_i=6.

Then D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13

But in the example, they achieved 16 by choosing c = [1,5,7,2], which gives D = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

So, how is that possible?

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I assumed that I have to choose c_i's in a specific order, but actually, I can arrange them in any order.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible arrangements of c.

Wait, but that's too time-consuming.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, pair a_i with b_i for i from 1 to n.

In the first example, sorted a: [1,2,4,6], sorted b in descending order: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

So, c = [7,5,3,3]

Then, D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13

But the example achieves 16 with c = [1,5,7,2], which is arranged differently.

So, perhaps I need to arrange c in a way that maximizes the differences, not necessarily in the order of sorted b in descending order.

Wait, maybe I should sort both a and b, and then choose c_i's by picking some from the smallest in b and some from the largest in b, depending on a_i.

Let me try that.

Sort a: [1,2,4,6]

Sort b: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

For a_i=1, to maximize |1 - c_i|, I can choose c_i=7 (difference=6) or c_i=1 (difference=0). So, choose 7.

For a_i=2, now b has [1,2,3,3,5], choose c_i=5 (difference=3).

For a_i=4, b has [1,2,3,3], choose c_i=1 (difference=3).

For a_i=6, b has [2,3,3], choose c_i=2 (difference=4).

Total D = 6 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16, which matches the example.

Okay, that works.

So, the strategy is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- For each a_i, if a_i is less than b[m-1], choose b[m-1] to pair with a_i.

- Otherwise, choose b[0] to pair with a_i.

- But in the above step, we need to consider the availability of b_j's, i.e., we cannot choose a b_j more times than its frequency in b.

Wait, but in the above example, for a_i=1, we chose b_j=7; for a_i=2, chose b_j=5; for a_i=4, chose b_j=1; for a_i=6, chose b_j=2.

This seems to be choosing the farthest possible b_j for each a_i, considering the availability.

But how to generalize this?

Maybe I can consider two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of sorted b, and for each a_i, choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and b, and then for each a_i, choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, considering the availability.

To implement this efficiently, I need a way to keep track of the available b_j's.

Perhaps using a multiset or a sorted list of b, and for each a_i, find the b_j that gives the maximum difference, remove it from the set, and proceed.

But this would be O(n log m), which should be acceptable since n and m are up to 2e5.

Let me think about the implementation.

Sort a in ascending order.

Sort b in ascending order.

Initialize a pointer to the start of b and a pointer to the end of b.

For each a_i in sorted a:

- If a_i is less than b[end], then choose b[end], subtract from sum, and move end pointer left.

- Else, choose b[start], subtract from sum, and move start pointer right.

Wait, but in the first example, sorted a: [1,2,4,6], sorted b: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

For a_i=1, choose b_j=7, sum += 6, b becomes [1,2,3,3,5]

For a_i=2, choose b_j=5, sum += 3, b becomes [1,2,3,3]

For a_i=4, choose b_j=1, sum += 3, b becomes [2,3,3]

For a_i=6, choose b_j=2, sum += 4, total D=6+3+3+4=16

This works.

In code, I can sort a and b, and then for each a_i, choose the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet if it gives a larger difference, else choose the smallest possible b_j.

Essentially, for each a_i, I choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, considering the available b_j's.

To implement this efficiently, I can use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of sorted b.

For each a_i in sorted a, I choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference with a_i, which is either b[start] or b[end], depending on which one gives a larger difference.

Then, I remove that b_j from consideration by moving the respective pointer.

This should work and be efficient.

Let me try this with another example.

Take the second example:

n=3, m=4

a = [1,1,1]

b = [1,1,1,1]

Sorted a: [1,1,1]

Sorted b: [1,1,1,1]

Using two pointers, start=0, end=3

For a_i=1, choose b_j=1 (since both start and end are 1), difference=0

For a_i=1, choose b_j=1, difference=0

For a_i=1, choose b_j=1, difference=0

Total D=0, which matches the example.

Another example:

n=5, m=5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

b = [1,2,3,4,5]

Sorted a: [1,2,3,4,5]

Sorted b: [1,2,3,4,5]

Using two pointers:

For a_i=1, choose b_j=5, difference=4

For a_i=2, choose b_j=4, difference=2

For a_i=3, choose b_j=3, difference=0

For a_i=4, choose b_j=2, difference=2

For a_i=5, choose b_j=1, difference=4

Total D=4+2+0+2+4=12, which matches the example.

Another example:

n=2, m=6

a = [5,8]

b = [8,7,5,8,2,10]

Sorted a: [5,8]

Sorted b: [2,5,7,8,8,10]

Using two pointers:

For a_i=5, choose b_j=10, difference=5

For a_i=8, choose b_j=2, difference=6

Total D=5+6=11, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Wait, but looking back at the code provided, it sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pairs a[i] with b[i], and under certain conditions switches to pairing with b[-(n-i)].

But this seems different from what I just described.

In my approach, I sort b in ascending order and use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end, choosing for each a_i the b_j that gives the maximum difference.

In the code, it sorts b in descending order and takes the first n elements, then pairs them with sorted a.

But as seen in the first example, this gives D=13, whereas the optimal is 16.

So, the code's approach is not optimal.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says to assume valid inputs as described, so I need to check if the code handles all cases correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

temp = -1

ans = []

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

if temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

Wait, this is a bit confusing.

It sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, it iterates through a and b, and for each i, it checks if pairing a[i] with b[-(n - i)] gives a larger difference than pairing with b[i].

If it finds such an i, it sets temp to that i and breaks.

Then, it appends differences for i from temp to n, pairing with b[-(n - i)].

Wait, this seems overly complicated and not clearly thought out.

In the first example, n=4, m=6

a = [1,2,4,6]

b = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

For i=0:

abs(1-7) = 6

abs(1 - b[-4]) = abs(1 - 2) = 1

Since 6 > 1, temp remains -1

Append 6 to ans

For i=1:

abs(2-5) = 3

abs(2 - b[-3]) = abs(2 - 3) = 1

Since 3 > 1, temp remains -1

Append 3 to ans

For i=2:

abs(4-3) = 1

abs(4 - b[-2]) = abs(4 - 3) = 1

Equal, so temp remains -1

Append 1 to ans

For i=3:

abs(6-3) = 3

abs(6 - b[-1]) = abs(6 - 1) = 5

Since 5 > 3, temp=3

Then, for i from 3 to 4:

ans.append(abs(6 - 1)) = 5

Total ans = [6,3,1,5], sum=15

But in the example, it's supposed to be 16.

So, the code gives 15, but the example output is 16.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, it's summing up to 15, but the example output is 16.

So, the code is indeed incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: False

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2e5", so it's acceptable.

But the approach in the code is flawed.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
