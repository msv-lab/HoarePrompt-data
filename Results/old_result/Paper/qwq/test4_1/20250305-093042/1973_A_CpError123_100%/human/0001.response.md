Alright, I've got this problem here about three friends playing chess, and I need to figure out the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on their final scores. The scores are p1, p2, and p3, and they're sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to understand how the scoring works. In each game, two players play against each other. If one player wins, they get 2 points, and the other gets 0. If it's a draw, both players get 1 point each. Also, the same pair can play multiple times, and there could be zero games played.

So, the total points distributed in each game are either 2 (in case of a win and loss) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, in both cases, it's 2 points per game. That's interesting. So, regardless of whether it's a win/loss or a draw, each game contributes 2 points to the total points sum.

Given that, the total points sum is p1 + p2 + p3, and since each game contributes 2 points, the total number of games played should be (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2. But, since the number of games has to be an integer, (p1 + p2 + p3) must be even; otherwise, it's impossible, and we should return -1.

So, my first check is if (p1 + p2 + p3) is even. If not, return -1.

Assuming it is even, then the total number of games is (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, I need to maximize the number of draws. Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a win/loss does, but in a draw, both players get 1 point each.

To maximize draws, I need to have as many games as possible end in draws.

However, I have to respect the individual scores p1, p2, and p3.

Let me think about it differently. Let's consider that some games are draws, and the rest are win/loss games.

Let’s denote:

- d = number of draws

- w = number of win/loss games

Then, total games are d + w = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

In draws, each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved.

In win/loss games, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

I need to maximize d, given the constraints on p1, p2, and p3.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

But I have to make sure that the scores can be achieved with some combination of draws and win/loss games.

Let me consider the minimal number of win/loss games required to achieve the scores.

In other words, some players might have odd scores, which must come from draws, since win/loss games always distribute even points (2 for the winner, 0 for the loser).

Wait, actually, in win/loss games, the points distributed are 2 in total, with one player getting 2 and the other getting 0.

In draw games, the points distributed are 2 in total, with each player getting 1.

Given that, the total points sum is always even, which aligns with our earlier check.

But to maximize draws, I need to make as many games as possible be draws.

However, the individual scores might constrain this.

Let me consider that each draw increases both players' scores by 1.

So, to achieve certain scores, the number of draws a player is involved in affects their total score.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the sum and the possible pairings.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to get some intuition.

Sample Input 1:

0 0 0

Output: 0

Explanation: No games were played, so no draws.

Sample Input 2:

0 1 1

Output: 1

Explanation: One draw between player 2 and 3, both get 1 point each.

Sample Input 3:

1 1 1

Output: -1

Explanation: It's impossible to have all three players with 1 point.

Wait, why is that?

If I have three draws:

- Draw between player 1 and 2: both get 1 point.

- Draw between player 1 and 3: both get 1 point.

- Draw between player 2 and 3: both get 1 point.

Then, each player would have 2 points, which is more than 1.

Alternatively, if I have only one draw between two players, they both get 1 point, and the third player has 0, which doesn't match 1 1 1.

Alternatively, if I have two draws:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both get 1.

- Draw between 1 and 3: both get 1.

Then, player 1 has 2, player 2 has 1, player 3 has 1, which doesn't match 1 1 1.

Alternatively:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both have 1.

- Draw between 2 and 3: both have 1 +1=2.

But then player 1 has 1, player 2 has 2, player 3 has 1, which doesn't match.

It seems impossible to have all three players with exactly 1 point, so output is -1.

Sample Input 4:

1 1 2

Output: 2

How is this possible?

Let's see:

Total points: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is even. So total games: 4 / 2 = 2.

To maximize draws, set d as high as possible.

If both games are draws:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both get 1.

- Draw between 1 and 3: both get 1.

Then, player 1 has 2, player 2 has 1, player 3 has 1, which matches 1 1 2 if we consider p1 <= p2 <= p3.

Wait, but in this case, p3 is 2, which is player 1.

But the problem states that p1 <= p2 <= p3, so perhaps the players are ordered accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the labeling doesn't matter.

But according to the sample output, it's possible with 2 draws.

Wait, but in the earlier case with 1 1 1, it was impossible.

So, perhaps in this case, it's possible.

Another sample:

3 3 3

Output: -1

Explanation: It's impossible to have all three players with 3 points each.

Wait, why?

If I have three draws among all pairs:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both get 1.

- Draw between 1 and 3: both get 1.

- Draw between 2 and 3: both get 1.

Then, each player has 3 points, which matches 3 3 3.

But according to the sample output, it's -1.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, in this case, total points: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is odd, so it's impossible because total points must be even.

Wait, but 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is odd, so it should be invalid.

But in the earlier case with 1 1 1, total points are 3, which is odd, so it should be invalid, which matches the sample output of -1.

Wait, but in the explanation for 1 1 1, they said it's impossible even if the total points are odd, but according to the program, if the total points are odd, it's invalid.

Wait, but in the sample input 3, it's invalid because total points are odd.

Wait, but in sample input 4, 1 1 2, total points are even, so it's valid.

Wait, but in sample input 5, 3 3 3, total points are odd, so it's invalid, which matches the sample output of -1.

Wait, but in sample input 6, 3 4 5, total points are 12, which is even.

Output is 6, which presumably means 6 draws.

Wait, but total games would be 12 / 2 = 6.

If all 6 games are draws, then each game contributes 2 points (1 to each player), so total points would be 12.

If we have three players, and we have 6 games, all draws, then each player would be involved in 4 games (since each pair plays multiple times).

Wait, but in this case, if all 6 games are draws, and assuming each game is between two players, then each player would have points equal to the number of draws they participated in.

Wait, but in this case, with 6 games, and three players, the maximum number of draws is 6, but the scores would be distributed accordingly.

Wait, but in this sample, the scores are 3, 4, 5, which sum to 12, which matches the total points.

But is it possible to achieve these scores with some combination of draws and win/loss games?

I need to think about how to maximize the number of draws while still achieving the given scores.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:

print(-1)

continue

x = (a + b + c) // 2

y = a + b

print(min(x, y))

So, the program does the following:

- If the sum of a, b, c is odd, return -1.

- Otherwise, compute x = (a + b + c) // 2 (total number of games).

- Compute y = a + b.

- Print the minimum of x and y.

Wait, why y = a + b?

I need to understand why the program is taking y = a + b and then taking min(x, y).

Let me see.

In the sample input 2: 0 1 1

Sum is 2, which is even.

x = 2 // 2 = 1

y = 0 + 1 = 1

min(x, y) = 1, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 4: 1 1 2

Sum is 4, which is even.

x = 4 // 2 = 2

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(x, y) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 6: 3 4 5

Sum is 12, which is even.

x = 12 // 2 = 6

y = 3 + 4 = 7

min(x, y) = 6, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 7: 1 1 10

Sum is 12, which is even.

x = 12 // 2 = 6

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(x, y) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in sample input 3: 1 1 1

Sum is 3, which is odd, so return -1, which matches.

So, in all the sample inputs, the program seems to be correct.

But why is y = a + b?

What does a + b represent?

Wait, a, b, c are the scores in non-decreasing order, so a ≤ b ≤ c.

I think y = a + b represents the total points of the first two players.

The maximum number of draws occurs when as many games as possible are draws.

Each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point.

To maximize draws, we need to see how many games can be draws without exceeding the points of any player.

But why is the maximum number of draws min(x, y)?

Where x is the total number of games, and y is the sum of the points of the first two players.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that the maximum number of draws is limited by the smallest sum that can support those draws.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Each draw increases the points of two players by 1 each.

So, for d draws, the points added are 2d (since each draw adds 2 points to the total).

The remaining games are win/loss games, which also add 2 points each.

So, total points are 2 * (d + w), where w is the number of win/loss games.

But since total points are 2 * x, where x = (a + b + c) // 2, then d + w = x.

Our goal is to maximize d, which would mean minimizing w.

But we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with d draws and w win/loss games.

The constraint comes from how the points are distributed among the players.

Each draw involves two players, adding 1 to each.

Each win/loss game involves two players, adding 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser.

Given that, we need to make sure that the sum of points for each player can be achieved through some combination of draws and win/loss games.

The program seems to suggest that the maximum number of draws is the minimum of x and y, where y = a + b.

But why a + b?

Wait, perhaps because c is the highest score, and a and b are lower or equal to c.

But in the sample input 6: 3 4 5

x = 6

y = 3 + 4 = 7

min(x, y) = 6

But is it possible to have 6 draws?

Wait, with 6 draws, and three players, the total points would be 12, which matches the sum.

But how are the individual scores distributed?

If we have 6 draws, and assuming that each draw is between different pairs, the points would be distributed based on which pairs are drawn.

Wait, but in reality, the same pair can play multiple times.

So, for example, if we have 5 draws between player 1 and 2, and 1 draw between player 1 and 3:

- Player 1: 5 (from draws with 2) + 1 (from draw with 3) = 6

- Player 2: 5 (from draws with 1) + 0 = 5

- Player 3: 1 (from draw with 1) + 0 = 1

But we need scores 3, 4, 5.

This doesn't match.

Alternatively, if we have 3 draws between player 1 and 2, 2 draws between player 1 and 3, and 1 draw between player 2 and 3:

- Player 1: 3 (from draws with 2) + 2 (from draws with 3) = 5

- Player 2: 3 (from draws with 1) + 1 (from draw with 3) = 4

- Player 3: 2 (from draws with 1) + 1 (from draw with 2) = 3

This matches 3, 4, 5.

But in this case, all 6 games are draws, and the scores add up correctly.

So, it's possible.

Another way to think about it is that the maximum number of draws is limited by the smallest sum that can support those draws without exceeding any individual's score.

But I still don't fully understand why y = a + b is used.

Wait, perhaps it's because c is the highest score, and a + b represents the combined score of the other two players.

But in the sample input 6, a + b = 3 + 4 = 7, but we take min(x, y) = min(6,7) = 6, which works.

In sample input 7: 1 1 10

x = 6

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(x, y) = 2

Is it possible to have 2 draws?

Let's see:

- Draw between player 1 and 2: both get 1 point.

- Draw between player 1 and 3: player 1 gets 1, player 3 gets 1.

- Now, player 1 has 2, player 2 has 1, player 3 has 1.

But we need player 3 to have 10 points.

So, we need more games.

Wait, total games are 6.

If we have 2 draws:

- 2 draws: 4 points distributed (2 points per draw).

- Remaining 4 games are win/loss: 8 points distributed.

Total points: 4 + 8 = 12, which matches.

But how can player 3 reach 10 points?

If we have 2 draws involving player 1 and 3, and player 1 and 2, then:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both get 1.

- Draw between 1 and 3: both get 1.

- Now, player 1 has 2, player 2 has 1, player 3 has 1.

- Remaining 4 games are win/loss.

- To maximize draws, we've already used 2 draws.

- For the remaining 4 games, they must be win/loss games.

- To get player 3 to 10 points, they need 9 more points.

But in the remaining 4 win/loss games, the maximum player 3 can get is 8 points (if they win all 4 games).

But they already have 1 point from the draw, so total 9 points, which is still less than 10.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's possible with 2 draws.

But according to my calculation, player 3 can only get up to 9 points, which is less than 10.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the sample output for 1 1 10, it's 2, which might be incorrect.

Wait, no, in the sample output, it's 2, but according to my reasoning, it's impossible to reach 10 points for player 3 with only 2 draws.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input 6, 3 4 5, output is 6, which seems possible.

But in sample input 7, 1 1 10, output is 2, which seems insufficient.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let me try again.

If we have 2 draws:

- Draw between 1 and 2: both get 1.

- Draw between 1 and 3: both get 1.

- So, player 1: 2, player 2: 1, player 3: 1.

- Remaining 4 games are win/loss.

- To maximize player 3's points, have player 3 win all 4 games.

- Each win gives 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

- So, player 3 wins all 4 games, getting 8 points.

- Therefore, player 3's total points: 1 (from draw) + 8 (from wins) = 9.

But we need 10 points for player 3.

So, it's impossible with only 2 draws.

Wait, but according to the program, it outputs 2.

But according to the sample output, it should be 2.

But according to my calculation, it's impossible to reach 10 points for player 3 with only 2 draws.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct, and it's possible to have 2 draws and still reach the scores, but in this specific case, it's impossible, hence the output should be -1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe the program allows for 2 draws, and the remaining games are win/loss, and it's possible to reach the scores, but in this case, it's not possible, so the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct, and in this case, it's possible to have 2 draws and achieve the scores somehow.

Wait, perhaps there is a way to have more than 2 draws.

Wait, but the program outputs 2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, in the sample input 7: 1 1 10

Output is 2.

But according to my calculation, it's impossible to reach 10 points for player 3 with only 2 draws.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is min(x, y), but in some cases, even if min(x, y) is achievable, the individual scores might not be achievable.

So, perhaps the program is incomplete.

It checks if the total points are even, and then takes min(x, y), but it doesn't ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with that number of draws.

In the sample input 7, with a + b + c = 12, x = 6, y = 2, min(x, y) = 2.

But as I calculated, it's impossible to reach 10 points for player 3 with only 2 draws.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

It should output -1, but it outputs 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2.

Does that mean the sample output is incorrect, or that my reasoning is wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the program is correct, and in this case, it's possible to have 2 draws and achieve the scores somehow.

Let me try to find a way.

Suppose we have 2 draws:

- Draw between player 1 and 3: both get 1.

- Draw between player 2 and 3: both get 1.

- So, player 1: 1, player 2: 1, player 3: 2.

- Remaining 4 games are win/loss.

- To maximize player 3's points, have player 3 win all 4 games.

- Each win gives 2 points to player 3.

- So, player 3 gets additional 8 points.

- Total points for player 3: 2 (from draws) + 8 (from wins) = 10.

- Player 1: 1 (from draw) + 0 (from win/loss, since they lost all) = 1.

- Player 2: 1 (from draw) + 0 (from win/loss, since they lost all) = 1.

- This matches the required scores: 1, 1, 10.

So, it is possible with 2 draws.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

Therefore, the program is correct in this case.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and we must verify if such scores are achievable based on the game's scoring rules.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check for Validity**:
    - If the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games since each game contributes exactly 2 points (either through a win/loss or a draw). Hence, we return `-1` in such cases.

2. **Calculate Total Games**:
    - If the sum is even, calculate the total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.

3. **Maximize Draws**:
    - To maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of win/loss games.
    - The maximum possible draws are limited by the combined scores of the first two players (`p1 + p2`), as draws involve two players each gaining 1 point.
    - Therefore, the maximum number of draws is the minimum of the total games and the sum of the scores of the first two players.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Check if the sum of scores is even. If not, return `-1` because it's invalid.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
- **Step 3**: Determine the maximum possible draws by taking the minimum of the total games and the sum of the scores of the first two players (`p1 + p2`).

This approach ensures that we are maximizing the number of draws while respecting the constraints imposed by the players' scores and the rules of the game.
