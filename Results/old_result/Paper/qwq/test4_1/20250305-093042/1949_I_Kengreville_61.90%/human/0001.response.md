Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n disks in a plane, each with integer coordinates for their centers and positive integer radii. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent to each other.

2. I need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of these disks such that:

   a. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

3. The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers cannot be changed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. Mathematically, for two disks with centers at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and radii r1 and r2, respectively, they are tangent if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii:

√((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) = r1 + r2

Given that, the problem allows me to adjust the radii as long as this tangency condition is maintained for disks that were originally tangent. Additionally, no two disks should overlap, meaning that for any two disks that were not originally tangent, the distance between their centers should be greater than the sum of their new radii.

The goal is to decrease the total sum of the radii as much as possible while satisfying these conditions.

I need to think about how to approach this. It seems like a graph problem where disks are nodes, and tangencies are edges. In this graph, the radii adjustments must satisfy certain constraints along the edges.

Let me consider setting up a system of equations based on the tangency conditions.

Suppose I have two disks i and j that are tangent:

r_i + r_j = d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between their centers.

If I want to change the radii to r_i' and r_j', I must have:

r_i' + r_j' = d_ij

Similarly, for all pairs of tangent disks.

My aim is to minimize the sum of all r_i', while ensuring that for non-tangent pairs, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

This sounds like a linear programming problem, but given the constraints on time and the problem's nature, there must be a more straightforward way to determine if such a reduction is possible.

Let me think about it in terms of graph theory. If I model the disks as nodes and tangencies as edges, I can consider connected components in this graph.

Within each connected component, the radii of the disks are interdependent because changing one affects the others through the tangency constraints.

So, for each connected component, I need to find if there exists a set of radii that satisfies all the tangency conditions and makes the total sum smaller than the original sum.

Let's consider a single connected component.

Suppose I have a connected component with disks a, b, c, where a is tangent to b, and b is tangent to c.

Then, I have:

r_a + r_b = d_ab

r_b + r_c = d_bc

From these, I can express all radii in terms of one radius, say r_a.

From the first equation: r_b = d_ab - r_a

From the second equation: r_c = d_bc - r_b = d_bc - (d_ab - r_a) = r_a + d_bc - d_ab

Now, I need to ensure that all radii are positive.

So:

r_a > 0

r_b = d_ab - r_a > 0 ⇒ r_a < d_ab

r_c = r_a + d_bc - d_ab > 0 ⇒ r_a > d_ab - d_bc

Additionally, for any other tangency constraints within the component, similar equations would apply.

My goal is to choose r_a such that all these inequalities hold and the sum s' = r_a + r_b + r_c is less than the original sum s = original r_a + r_b + r_c.

Given that, I can compute s' in terms of r_a:

s' = r_a + (d_ab - r_a) + (r_a + d_bc - d_ab) = r_a + d_ab - r_a + r_a + d_bc - d_ab = r_a + d_bc

Original sum s = original r_a + r_b + r_c = original r_a + (d_ab - original r_a) + (original r_a + d_bc - d_ab) = original r_a + d_ab - original r_a + original r_a + d_bc - d_ab = original r_a + d_bc

So, s' = r_a + d_bc

s = original r_a + d_bc

Therefore, s' < s ⇒ r_a < original r_a

Given that, and considering the constraints on r_a:

d_ab - d_bc < r_a < d_ab

And r_a < original r_a

So, if original r_a > d_ab - d_bc, and original r_a < d_ab, then I can set r_a to be slightly less than original r_a, thus decreasing the sum.

But wait, in this specific case, s' = r_a + d_bc and s = original r_a + d_bc, so s' < s iff r_a < original r_a, which is possible as long as r_a can be decreased without violating the other constraints.

This seems promising, but I need to generalize this to larger connected components and ensure that no two disks overlap in the adjusted configuration.

Wait, the problem mentions that it's possible for disks to be tangent but not necessarily connected through tangencies. So, there could be multiple connected components in the graph.

For disks in different connected components, their radii can be adjusted independently, as they don't affect each other's constraints.

Therefore, I can consider each connected component separately and see if I can decrease the sum of radii within that component without causing overlaps.

But the problem is to decrease the total sum of all radii, so I need to check if across all components, I can make such adjustments.

However, since components are independent, I can make adjustments in some components and not in others.

My aim is to see if I can make adjustments in at least one component that leads to a decrease in the total sum, without causing overlaps in any component.

But the constraints also require that no two disks overlap, even across components.

Wait, but since components are independent, and adjustments in one component don't affect the constraints in another component, as long as within each component, the tangency conditions are satisfied, and across components, disks don't overlap, which is already guaranteed because they weren't overlapping before and their centers are fixed.

So, if I adjust radii within a component without violating the tangency conditions and without causing overlaps within the component, and since the components are separate, the adjustments shouldn't cause overlaps across components.

Therefore, I can focus on each connected component separately.

Now, in the earlier example with three disks, I saw that I can decrease r_a as long as it stays above d_ab - d_bc, and below d_ab, and below its original value.

Similarly, in general, for each connected component, I need to express all radii in terms of one variable, find the range of possible values for that variable, and see if I can choose a value that decreases the sum.

But this seems a bit tedious for large components. Is there a smarter way to determine if such a decrease is possible?

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the centers of the disks and consider the graph where edges represent tangencies.

In graph theory terms, this is an undirected graph where nodes are disks and edges are tangencies.

In each connected component, the radii are interdependent through the tangency constraints.

I need to find if there's a way to adjust the radii within each component to satisfy the tangency conditions and decrease the sum.

An alternative approach is to consider that in each connected component, the radii are linearly related through the tangency equations.

Therefore, the system of equations formed by the tangency conditions is linear, and I can solve for the radii in terms of a free variable.

Then, I can check if there exists a choice of the free variable that makes the sum of radii smaller than the original sum, while keeping all radii positive and satisfying the non-overlapping conditions.

But solving systems of equations for potentially large components (up to n=1000) might be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can model this as a system of linear equations and see if there's a solution where the sum decreases.

But linear programming might be too slow for the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of graph cycles and determine if there are any constraints that prevent me from decreasing the sum.

But I need a better approach.

Let's consider the dual problem: instead of decreasing the sum of radii, think about increasing the sum.

If I can find a way to increase the sum without violating the tangency conditions, that might give me insight into the original problem.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of scaling the radii.

If I scale all radii by a factor less than 1, the sum decreases, but I need to ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained.

However, scaling all radii uniformly would not necessarily preserve the tangency conditions, because the sum of radii for tangent disks is fixed by the distance between centers.

So, uniform scaling isn't an option.

Back to square one.

Let me consider the residuals.

Suppose I have a connected component, and I express all radii in terms of one variable, say r_a.

Then, I can compute the sum s' in terms of r_a, and find the range of r_a where all radii are positive.

Within that range, I can find the minimum and maximum possible sums.

If the minimum sum is less than the original sum, then I can decrease the sum.

Similarly, if the maximum sum is greater than the original sum, I can increase it.

But I need to ensure that the sum can be decreased.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where I have variables for each radius, with constraints based on the tangency conditions and positivity.

Then, I can try to minimize the sum of the variables subject to these constraints and see if the minimum sum is less than the original sum.

But implementing this from scratch is too complex for the time constraints.

I need a smarter observation.

Let me consider the dual problem again.

Suppose I fix the sum of radii and try to maximize the minimum distance between non-tangent disks.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of graph flows or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a flow network where the flow represents the adjustment in radii.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose I have two disks that are tangent.

Then, r1 + r2 = d, where d is the distance between centers.

If I want to decrease the sum r1 + r2, but they must still satisfy r1 + r2 = d, which is impossible unless I can reduce d, but d is fixed because centers are fixed.

Therefore, for two tangent disks, I cannot decrease the sum of their radii while maintaining tangency.

Similarly, if I have a chain of tangent disks, I might not be able to decrease the sum.

But in the first sample input, it's possible to decrease the sum.

So, perhaps there are cases where it's possible and cases where it's not.

I need to find a way to determine when it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for cycles in the tangency graph.

In a tree structure, perhaps I cannot decrease the sum, but in cycles, I can.

Let me think about that.

Suppose I have a cycle of disks where each is tangent to its neighbors.

Then, I have a system of equations where r1 + r2 = d12, r2 + r3 = d23, ..., r_n + r1 = d_n1.

This is a system of linear equations that might have a solution where the sum of radii is less than the original sum.

In such a cycle, I might be able to adjust the radii in a way that decreases the total sum while maintaining tangencies.

Similarly, in trees, perhaps I cannot decrease the sum.

Therefore, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there are any cycles in the tangency graph.

If there are cycles, then it's possible to decrease the sum; otherwise, it's not.

But I need to verify this.

In the first sample input, there are cycles, and it's possible to decrease the sum.

In the second sample input, perhaps there are no cycles, and it's not possible.

Wait, in the second sample input, there are four disks arranged in a square, each tangent to two others, forming a cycle.

But the answer is NO.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

There must be more to it.

Let me look back at the first sample input.

There are five disks:

(0,2,1)

(0,0,1)

(4,-3,4)

(11,0,3)

(11,5,2)

I need to see how they are connected through tangencies.

First, calculate the distances between centers and see if they equal the sum of radii.

For disks 1 and 2:

Distance: sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

Sum of radii: 1 + 1 = 2, so they are tangent.

Disks 1 and 3:

Distance: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (2-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, which is less than sqrt(41), so not tangent.

Disks 1 and 4:

Distance: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 1 and 5:

Distance: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 2 and 3:

Distance: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, so tangent.

Disks 2 and 4:

Distance: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 2 and 5:

Distance: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.083

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 3 and 4:

Distance: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Sum of radii: 4 + 3 = 7, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 3 and 5:

Distance: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-5)^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) ≈ 10.630

Sum of radii: 4 + 2 = 6, which is less, so not tangent.

Disks 4 and 5:

Distance: sqrt((11-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5, so tangent.

Therefore, the tangency graph has edges between disks 1-2, 2-3, and 4-5.

So, there are two connected components: {1,2,3} and {4,5}.

In the first component, disks 1,2,3 form a path.

In the second component, disks 4 and 5 are directly connected.

Now, according to the sample explanation, decreasing the radii of disks 1 and 3 by 0.5 and increasing the radius of disk 2 by 0.5 results in a decrease of the total sum by 0.5.

Let's verify this.

Original sums:

Disk 1: 1

Disk 2: 1

Disk 3: 4

Total sum: 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 11

New radii:

Disk 1: 0.5

Disk 2: 1.5

Disk 3: 3.5

Disk 4: 3

Disk 5: 2

New sum: 0.5 + 1.5 + 3.5 + 3 + 2 = 10.5, which is less than 11.

Now, check tangency conditions:

Disks 1 and 2: 0.5 + 1.5 = 2, which matches the distance of 2.

Disks 2 and 3: 1.5 + 3.5 = 5, which matches the distance of 5.

Disks 4 and 5: 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the distance of 5.

So, tangency conditions are satisfied.

Also, check that no other pairs overlap.

For example, disks 1 and 3: distance = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403, new sum of radii = 0.5 + 3.5 = 4, which is less than 6.403, so no overlap.

Similarly, check other pairs.

Therefore, it's possible to decrease the sum in this case.

Now, in the second sample input:

4 disks arranged in a square, each tangent to two others.

Let's consider their connections.

Suppose disks are arranged in a square, each tangent to its neighbors.

Then, the tangency graph forms a cycle.

According to the sample output, it's NO, meaning it's not possible to decrease the sum.

So, even though there is a cycle, it's not possible to decrease the sum.

This contradicts my earlier assumption that cycles allow sum reduction.

Therefore, there must be more to it.

Perhaps in some cycles, it's possible to decrease the sum, and in others, it's not.

I need to find a condition that determines when it's possible.

Let me consider the general case of a cycle.

Suppose I have a cycle of three disks: a, b, c.

Tangency conditions:

r_a + r_b = d_ab

r_b + r_c = d_bc

r_c + r_a = d_ca

Adding all three equations:

2(r_a + r_b + r_c) = d_ab + d_bc + d_ca

Therefore, r_a + r_b + r_c = (d_ab + d_bc + d_ca)/2

So, the sum of radii is fixed by the distances between centers.

Therefore, in a cycle, the sum of radii is determined uniquely.

Hence, I cannot decrease the sum; it's already fixed by the tangency conditions.

Similarly, in a cycle of any length, the sum of radii is fixed.

Therefore, in the second sample input, which forms a cycle, it's not possible to decrease the sum.

In the first sample input, the components are trees (no cycles), and in such cases, it is possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, in the first sample, the first component {1,2,3} is a path (a tree without cycles), and the second component {4,5} is an edge (also a tree without cycles).

In such tree structures, the sum of radii is not uniquely determined; there is flexibility to adjust the radii while maintaining tangency.

Therefore, in tree components, it's possible to decrease the sum, whereas in cycle components, it's not.

Hence, the problem reduces to checking if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree (i.e., has no cycles).

If there is at least one such component, then it's possible to decrease the sum; otherwise, it's not.

Therefore, I need to find if the tangency graph has at least one connected component that is a tree.

To do this, I can perform DFS on the graph and check for cycles in each component.

If all components have cycles, output NO; if at least one component is a tree, output YES.

But wait, in the first sample, there are two components: {1,2,3} (a path, no cycles) and {4,5} (an edge, no cycles), so output YES.

In the second sample, all components have cycles, so output NO.

This seems to make sense.

Therefore, my approach should be:

1. Build the tangency graph: nodes are disks, edges are tangencies.

2. Perform DFS to find connected components and check for cycles in each component.

3. If at least one component is a tree (no cycles), output YES; otherwise, output NO.

But in the first sample, both components are trees, and in the second sample, there is a cycle.

Wait, but in the first sample, it's possible to decrease the sum, and in the second sample, it's not.

This seems consistent with my observation.

But I need to confirm this logic.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose I have three disks forming a triangle, all pairwise tangent.

This forms a cycle.

According to my logic, since there is a cycle, it's not possible to decrease the sum.

Is that true?

In this case, as shown earlier, the sum of radii is fixed by the distances, so I cannot decrease it.

Similarly, if I have a tree structure, I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

Therefore, my logic seems correct.

Hence, the problem reduces to checking if the tangency graph has at least one connected component that is a tree.

To implement this, I can:

- Build the adjacency list based on tangencies.

- Perform DFS on each unvisited node to explore its component.

- During DFS, check if there's a cycle in the component.

- If all components have cycles, output NO; else, output YES.

But detecting cycles in undirected graphs requires careful implementation to distinguish between cycles and mere back-edges.

In undirected graphs, back-edges indicate cycles.

Therefore, during DFS, if I find a back-edge (an edge to an already visited ancestor), it indicates a cycle.

If at least one component has no cycles, then output YES; otherwise, NO.

This should work.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently, considering n can be up to 1000 and the graph can be dense.

But since the graph is undirected and can have up to n(n-1)/2 edges, I need an efficient way to represent it and traverse it.

I can use adjacency lists and perform DFS with cycle detection.

But with n=1000, and potentially up to 1000^2/2 edges, I need to optimize the implementation.

Wait, but in practice, the number of edges might be much smaller, especially since disks can't overlap positively, which might limit the number of tangencies.

But to be safe, I need an efficient implementation.

Alternatively, I can note that in a tree with k nodes, there are k-1 edges, and in a cyclic component with k nodes, there are at least k edges.

Therefore, for each connected component, I can count the number of nodes and edges.

If, for any component, the number of edges is less than the number of nodes, it's a tree (or forest), and I can output YES.

Otherwise, if all components have number of edges >= number of nodes, output NO.

This is a faster way to check for cycles in each component.

So, I can iterate through all components, count nodes and edges, and check this condition.

This should be efficient enough.

Therefore, my plan is:

- Build the adjacency list based on tangencies.

- Initialize visited array.

- For each unvisited node, perform DFS to explore the component, counting nodes and edges.

- If, for any component, edges < nodes, output YES.

- If all components have edges >= nodes, output NO.

This should solve the problem efficiently.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

I need to be careful with the cycle detection and ensure that I correctly count nodes and edges in each component.

Also, I need to handle the input correctly, parsing the disk centers and radii, and determining tangencies based on distances.

Let's think about how to determine if two disks are tangent.

Given centers (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), and radii r1 and r2, they are tangent if:

sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) == r1 + r2

To avoid floating point precision issues, I can compare the squared distances:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 == (r1 + r2)^2

This way, I can avoid dealing with floating points.

Therefore, in the code, I'll compute the squared distances and compare them to the squared sum of radii.

This should handle the comparisons accurately.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need to read n, then read n lines of x, y, r.

Then, build the adjacency list based on tangencies.

Then, perform DFS on each unvisited node, counting nodes and edges in each component.

If any component has edges < nodes, output YES; else, output NO.

I need to make sure that the DFS is implemented efficiently, especially considering that n can be up to 1000.

I should use adjacency lists represented as lists of lists.

For DFS, I can use a recursive function with a visited array.

I need to handle large inputs efficiently, so I should avoid unnecessary computations.

Also, since the coordinates can be large (up to 10^9), I need to ensure that there are no integer overflows when computing squared distances.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not an issue.

In other languages, I might need to use long long or big integers, but in Python, it's fine.

Therefore, I can proceed with this plan.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read n.

- Read n lines of x, y, r.

- Build adjacency list: for each pair (i,j), if squared distance equals (r_i + r_j)^2, add edge between i and j.

- Initialize visited array of size n, all False.

- For each unvisited node:

- Perform DFS to explore the component.

- Count nodes and edges in the component.

- If edges < nodes, set a flag to True.

- After all components are explored, if the flag is True, output YES; else, output NO.

Wait, but in a connected component with nodes and edges, if edges < nodes, it's a forest (acyclic); if edges >= nodes, it has cycles.

Therefore, if any component is a forest, output YES; else, output NO.

This should work.

I need to implement this logic carefully.

Now, I need to think about how to count edges during DFS.

In DFS, when traversing from a node to its neighbors, I can count the number of tree edges and back edges.

But to simply count edges, I can maintain a counter that increments by the number of neighbors for each node.

However, since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted twice (once from each end), so I need to divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Therefore, in code, I can have a variable total_edges, initialized to 0.

During DFS, for each node, I can add the number of its neighbors to total_edges.

At the end of DFS, total_edges will be twice the actual number of edges in the component.

So, actual_edges = total_edges // 2.

Then, if actual_edges < nodes, it's a forest; else, it's cyclic.

This should work.

I need to implement this logic correctly.

Also, I need to ensure that the DFS doesn't run into recursion depth issues for large n.

In Python, the default recursion depth is 1000, which matches the maximum n, so I need to be careful.

I can either increase the recursion limit or implement DFS iteratively.

To be safe, I'll implement DFS iteratively using a stack.

This will avoid recursion depth issues.

Therefore, I'll use an iterative DFS implementation.

Let me sketch the code structure:

- Read n.

- Read n lines of x, y, r, store in lists.

- Build adjacency list: adj = [ [] for _ in range(n) ]

- For i from 0 to n-1:

- For j from i+1 to n-1:

- Compute dx = x[i] - x[j]

- Compute dy = y[i] - y[j]

- If dx*dx + dy*dy == (r[i] + r[j])*(r[i] + r[j]):

- adj[i].append(j)

- adj[j].append(i)

- Initialize visited = [False] * n

- Initialize has_tree = False

- For i in range(n):

- if not visited[i]:

- nodes = 0

- edges = 0

- stack = [i]

- visited[i] = True

- while stack:

- curr = stack.pop()

- nodes += 1

- for neighbor in adj[curr]:

- if not visited[neighbor]:

- stack.append(neighbor)

- visited[neighbor] = True

- edges += 1

- actual_edges = edges // 2

- if actual_edges < nodes:

- has_tree = True

- break

- if has_tree:

- print('YES')

- else:

- print('NO')

This seems correct.

I need to make sure that the edge counting is accurate.

Wait, in this implementation, edges += 1 counts each edge twice (once from each end), so actual_edges = edges // 2.

Then, if actual_edges < nodes, it's a forest.

This should work.

Let me test this logic with the first sample input.

First sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

As determined earlier, tangencies are between:

1-2, 2-3, 4-5

So, adjacency list:

0: [1]

1: [0, 2]

2: [1]

3: [4]

4: [3]

So, components:

{0,1,2} and {3,4}

For component {0,1,2}:

nodes = 3

edges = 2 (since it's a path)

actual_edges = 2

3 nodes, 2 edges: 2 < 3, so it's a tree.

Therefore, has_tree = True

Hence, output YES.

Correct.

Second sample input:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

Tangencies are between all neighboring disks, forming a cycle.

Let's compute distances:

Disk 1: (2,2), r=2

Disk 2: (7,2), r=3

Distance: sqrt(25 + 0) = 5, r1 + r2 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 2: (7,2), r=3

Disk 3: (7,7), r=2

Distance: sqrt(0 + 25) = 5, r2 + r3 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 3: (7,7), r=2

Disk 4: (2,7), r=3

Distance: sqrt(25 + 0) = 5, r3 + r4 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 4: (2,7), r=3

Disk 1: (2,2), r=2

Distance: sqrt(0 + 25) = 5, r4 + r1 = 5, so tangent.

Therefore, all four disks form a cycle.

Adjacency list:

0: [1,3]

1: [0,2]

2: [1,3]

3: [0,2]

Connected component: all four disks.

nodes = 4

edges = 4 (since it's a cycle)

actual_edges = 4

4 edges, 4 nodes: 4 >= 4, so it's cyclic.

Therefore, has_tree = False

Hence, output NO.

Correct.

Therefore, this logic seems sound.

I need to implement this in code carefully, ensuring that edge counting is accurate and that there are no off-by-one errors.

Also, since n can be up to 1000 and the adjacency list can have up to n(n-1)/2 edges, I need to make sure that the code runs efficiently.

In Python, this should be manageable.

I need to optimize the code as much as possible.

Now, I need to think about how to handle the input.

I can read all lines at once and process them.

Also, to build the adjacency list, I need to compare each pair of disks.

But with n=1000, this would be O(n^2), which is 10^6 operations, acceptable.

I need to make sure that the comparison is done correctly using squared distances.

Let me think about potential optimizations.

If there are multiple disks, perhaps I can group them based on their positions or something, but for now, I'll stick with the O(n^2) approach.

It should be fine for n=1000.

Now, I need to think about implementing the iterative DFS.

I need to make sure that I don't miss any nodes or count edges incorrectly.

Let me think about the DFS implementation.

I'll use a stack to implement DFS.

For each unvisited node, I'll start a new DFS traversal.

I'll maintain a counter for nodes and edges.

For each node visited, increment nodes.

For each neighbor that is unvisited, add it to the stack and mark it visited, and increment edges.

At the end, actual_edges = edges // 2

If actual_edges < nodes, set has_tree = True

Proceed to the next component if needed.

This should work.

I need to make sure that I don't miss any edges or nodes.

Also, I need to ensure that the visited array is reset properly.

Wait, in the code above, visited is initialized once outside the loop.

So, in the DFS loop, for each unvisited node, I mark it visited, and during DFS, I mark its reachable nodes as visited.

So, it should be fine.

I need to make sure that the edges are counted correctly.

Each edge is counted twice, once from each end, so dividing by 2 should give the correct number of edges.

Alright, I think this is solid.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1

Single disk, no tangencies.

It's a tree (a single node), so output YES.

Edge case 2: n=2, tangent.

Connected component with 2 nodes and 1 edge: edges = 1, nodes = 2, edges < nodes, so YES.

Edge case 3: n=3, all pairwise tangent: cycle, output NO.

Edge case 4: n=4, two pairs of tangent disks, no connection between pairs: two components, each a tree, output YES.

Edge case 5: n=1000, all disks tangent to each other: complete graph, which is cyclic, output NO.

Edge case 6: n=1000, disks form a tree: output YES.

I need to make sure that my code handles these cases correctly.

In particular, for large n, the code should run efficiently.

But since the time complexity is O(n^2), and n=1000, it's acceptable.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need to make sure that the code is optimized and doesn't have any unnecessary operations.

I can read all input at once for speed.

In Python, it's efficient to read all input at once using sys.stdin.read(), split it into tokens, and process them.

This is faster than reading line by line, especially for large inputs.

But since n can be up to 1000, and each line has three integers, it's manageable.

I'll proceed with reading all input at once.

Let me sketch the code structure:

import sys

def main():

import sys

data = sys.stdin.read().split()

n = int(data[0])

ptr = 1

x = [None] * n

y = [None] * n

r = [None] * n

for i in range(n):

x[i] = int(data[ptr])

y[i] = int(data[ptr+1])

r[i] = int(data[ptr+2])

ptr += 3

# Build adjacency list

adj = [ [] for _ in range(n) ]

for i in range(n):

for j in range(i+1, n):

dx = x[i] - x[j]

dy = y[i] - y[j]

if dx*dx + dy*dy == (r[i] + r[j]) * (r[i] + r[j]):

adj[i].append(j)

adj[j].append(i)

visited = [False] * n

has_tree = False

for i in range(n):

if not visited[i]:

nodes = 0

edges = 0

stack = [i]

visited[i] = True

while stack:

curr = stack.pop()

nodes += 1

for neighbor in adj[curr]:

if not visited[neighbor]:

stack.append(neighbor)

visited[neighbor] = True

edges += 1

actual_edges = edges // 2

if actual_edges < nodes:

has_tree = True

break

if has_tree:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':

main()

This seems correct.

I need to make sure that the edge counting is accurate.

Wait, in this implementation, edges += 1 is inside the loop where neighbors are added to the stack.

So, for each unvisited neighbor, edges += 1.

Since each edge is counted twice (once from each end), actual_edges = edges // 2.

Then, if actual_edges < nodes, it's a tree.

This should work.

I think this is a correct implementation of the algorithm.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
