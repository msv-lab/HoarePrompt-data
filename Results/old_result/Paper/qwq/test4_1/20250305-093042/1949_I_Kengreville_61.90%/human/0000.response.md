Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the problem is about disks in a plane. Each disk has a center with integer coordinates and a positive integer radius. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent to each other.

2. I need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of these disks in such a way that:

   a. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

3. The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers cannot be changed.

Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what it means for two disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. In terms of their centers and radii, if disk A has center (x1, y1) and radius r1, and disk B has center (x2, y2) and radius r2, then they are tangent if the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. So, the condition for tangency is:

Distance between centers = r1 + r2

Similarly, if two disks do not overlap in a region of positive area, it means that the distance between their centers is at least the sum of their radii. So, for any two disks that are not tangent, the distance between their centers is greater than r1 + r2.

Now, the task is to adjust the radii so that:

- Tangent disks remain tangent, meaning that if two disks were tangent before, their new radii should still satisfy the tangency condition.

- No two disks overlap in a positive area, which is similar to saying that for any two disks, the distance between their centers is at least the sum of their new radii.

- The sum of all radii strictly decreases, meaning that the total sum of the new radii is less than the sum of the original radii.

Additionally, the new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers stay fixed.

Alright, so how can I approach this?

I think I need to model the constraints imposed by the tangency conditions and see if there's room to adjust the radii while satisfying these constraints and achieving a strictly smaller sum.

Let me consider that for each pair of tangent disks, there's an equation that relates their radii. Specifically, if disks A and B are tangent, then:

Distance between A and B = new_r1 + new_r2

Similarly, for other tangent pairs, there will be similar equations.

So, it seems like I have a system of equations based on the tangency conditions.

Moreover, for non-tangent disks, I have inequalities:

Distance between centers > new_r1 + new_r2

But since the problem allows the disks to remain non-overlapping (i.e., no positive area overlap), I think these inequalities can be treated as "at least" conditions, but to achieve a strictly smaller sum, I need to see if there's a way to minimize the sum of radii while satisfying these constraints.

Wait a minute, maybe I can think of this as an optimization problem where I'm trying to minimize the sum of the radii subject to the constraints imposed by the tangency conditions and the non-overlapping conditions.

But optimization might be overkill, and given the constraints, there might be a simpler way to determine if such a adjustment is possible.

Let me think about the tangency conditions more carefully.

If two disks are tangent, their radii must sum to the fixed distance between their centers. So, for tangent pairs, there's a linear relationship between their radii.

For example, if disks A and B are tangent, then:

new_r1 + new_r2 = d_ab, where d_ab is the fixed distance between A and B.

Similarly, if disk A is tangent to disk C, then:

new_r1 + new_r3 = d_ac

And so on for other tangent pairs.

So, these are linear equations relating the new radii.

Now, if I have a set of such equations, I can solve for the new radii in terms of each other.

In other words, the new radii are constrained by these equations, and I can express some radii in terms of others.

For example, from new_r1 + new_r2 = d_ab, I can express new_r2 = d_ab - new_r1

Similarly, from new_r1 + new_r3 = d_ac, I can express new_r3 = d_ac - new_r1

If disk B is also tangent to disk C, then I might have new_r2 + new_r3 = d_bc, which would give another equation involving new_r2 and new_r3.

By substituting, I can relate all the radii in a connected component of tangent disks.

Wait, connected component? That sounds interesting.

Yes, because the tangency relations can form connected components where disks are tangent to each other, directly or indirectly.

So, if I have a group of disks where each is tangent to one or more others in the group, forming a connected component, then within that component, the radii are all related through the tangency equations.

In contrast, disks in different connected components are independent in terms of their radii, as there are no tangency constraints between them.

So, perhaps I can consider each connected component separately.

Within a connected component, I have a system of linear equations relating the radii of the disks in that component.

My goal is to adjust the radii so that:

1. All the tangency conditions are satisfied (i.e., the equations are satisfied).

2. The sum of the radii is strictly less than the original sum.

3. No two disks overlap in a positive area, which, given the tangency conditions, might be automatically satisfied if the equations are satisfied.

Wait, but I need to ensure that no two disks overlap in positive area, which means that for any two disks, even those not tangent, the sum of their new radii should not exceed the distance between their centers.

For tangent disks, the sum of their new radii must equal the distance between their centers.

For non-tangent disks, the sum of their new radii must be less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

But in the problem statement, it says "no two disks overlap in a region of positive area," which includes both the cases where they are tangent (sum of radii equals distance) and non-tangent (sum of radii less than distance).

So, in the connected components, I need to adjust the radii so that the sum of radii in each connected component is strictly less than the original sum for that component, while satisfying the tangency equations.

But how?

Let me consider a simple case where there are no tangencies at all. In this case, all disks are separate, and I can independently decrease each radius a bit, as long as they don't start overlapping. But since there are no tangencies, I can decrease each radius a small amount, and the sum will strictly decrease.

However, in the problem, there can be tangencies, and I need to adjust the radii while preserving the tangencies.

Wait, but in the sample input, there are tangent disks, and the solution involves decreasing some radii and increasing others, but overall decreasing the sum.

So, in the connected component, there are relationships between the radii, and I can adjust them accordingly.

I need to find if there's a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, while preserving the tangency conditions.

Maybe I can fix one radius and express others in terms of it, then find if there's a way to adjust the fixed radius to make the total sum smaller.

Let me try to model this mathematically.

Suppose I have a connected component with k disks, and t tangency constraints.

Each tangency constraint gives an equation of the form:

r_i + r_j = d_ij

Where d_ij is the fixed distance between centers i and j.

This is a system of linear equations with k variables (the radii) and t equations.

The general solution to this system will have k - t free variables, assuming the equations are independent.

So, if k - t > 0, I have some freedom in choosing the radii.

My goal is to choose the radii such that:

1. All r_i > 0

2. Sum of new r_i < sum of original r_i

3. For any two disks i and j (whether tangent or not), r_i + r_j <= d_ij

Wait, but for tangent pairs, r_i + r_j = d_ij, and for non-tangent pairs, r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

So, for non-tangent pairs, I just need to ensure that r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

Now, in the connected component, if I can find a solution where the sum of radii is strictly less than the original sum, while satisfying all the tangency equations and the non-overlapping inequalities, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

But this seems complicated. Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me think about the degrees of freedom in the system.

In a connected component with k disks and t tangency constraints, the number of degrees of freedom is k - t.

I can choose k - t radii freely (within certain bounds to keep r_i > 0 and satisfy the constraints), and the remaining radii are determined by the tangency equations.

So, I need to choose the free radii in such a way that:

- All determined radii are positive.

- The sum of all radii is strictly less than the original sum.

- For all pairs of disks, whether tangent or not, r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

But this still seems tricky.

Maybe I can look at the system in terms of graph theory.

Let me consider each disk as a vertex in a graph, and each tangency as an edge connecting two vertices.

Then, the connected components in this graph correspond to groups of disks that are connected through tangencies.

Within each connected component, the radii are related through the tangency equations.

So, I can process each connected component separately.

For each connected component, I need to determine if I can adjust the radii to satisfy the conditions.

If all connected components allow such adjustments, then the overall answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

So, focusing on one connected component, how can I determine if such an adjustment is possible?

Let me consider assigning variables to the radii.

Let’s choose one disk in the component as a reference and set its new radius to a variable, say r0.

Then, using the tangency equations, I can express all other radii in terms of r0.

For example, if disk 0 is tangent to disk 1, then r1 = d01 - r0

If disk 0 is tangent to disk 2, then r2 = d02 - r0

If disk 1 is tangent to disk 2, then r1 + r2 = d12

Substituting, (d01 - r0) + (d02 - r0) = d12

Which simplifies to 2r0 = d01 + d02 - d12

So, r0 = (d01 + d02 - d12)/2

This gives a specific value for r0, and consequently for r1 and r2.

In general, in a connected component, choosing one radius as a variable, the others are expressed in terms of it, and there might be constraints on r0 to ensure all radii are positive and satisfy the non-overlapping conditions.

Wait, but in the above example, r0 is determined by the equation, leaving no freedom to adjust it to make the sum smaller.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a connected component, and I have a system of equations from the tangency conditions.

I can represent this system in matrix form.

Let’s denote the vector of new radii as r_new.

Then, the tangency conditions can be written as A * r_new = b, where A is a matrix derived from the tangency graph, and b depends on the distances between centers.

The problem is to find r_new such that:

1. A * r_new = b

2. Sum(r_new) < sum(r_original)

3. For all i < j, r_new[i] + r_new[j] <= d_ij if not tangent, and r_new[i] + r_new[j] == d_ij if tangent.

But since the tangent pairs are already covered in A * r_new = b, I just need to ensure that for non-tangent pairs, r_new[i] + r_new[j] <= d_ij.

Additionally, all r_new[i] > 0.

This seems like a system of linear inequalities and equations.

Solving such a system can be done with linear programming, but that's probably not the intended approach for this problem, especially since n can be up to 1000, and linear programming would be too slow.

So, I need a smarter way to determine if such an adjustment is possible.

Let me consider the sum of radii in a connected component.

Suppose I have a connected component with k disks and t tangency constraints.

From the tangency equations, I have t equations relating the radii.

The sum of radii is s = sum(r_i)

I need to find if there's a solution to the system A * r_new = b such that s < sum(r_original)

Additionally, all r_new[i] > 0 and for non-tangent pairs, r_new[i] + r_new[j] <= d_ij.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express the sum s in terms of the tangency equations.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum s as a linear combination of the radii, and see if it can be made smaller while satisfying the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I can look at the differences between the new and original radii.

Let’s define delta_i = new_r_i - r_i

Then, the sum of delta_i should be negative for the sum to decrease.

Moreover, for tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0, because the sum of radii must remain equal to the distance.

So, for tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0

For non-tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j <= (d_ij - r_i - r_j)

But d_ij >= r_i + r_j + epsilon for some epsilon > 0, since they don't overlap in positive area.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be tangent to each other."

So, for non-tangent pairs, d_ij > r_i + r_j

Thus, delta_i + delta_j <= d_ij - (r_i + r_j)

But d_ij - (r_i + r_j) > 0, since they are not tangent.

So, delta_i + delta_j <= some positive value.

But for tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0

And for non-tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j <= some positive value.

Moreover, all new_r_i > 0, which implies delta_i > -r_i

So, delta_i > -r_i

Now, I need to find delta_i such that:

1. For tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0

2. For non-tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j <= d_ij - (r_i + r_j)

3. Sum of delta_i < 0

4. delta_i > -r_i for all i

This seems like a system of linear inequalities and equations.

Is there a way to determine if such a system has a solution?

This sounds like a linear programming feasibility problem.

But linear programming is too slow for n up to 1000.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the connected components separately.

Within a connected component, the tangency constraints form a system of equations that relate the radii.

I can solve this system to express all radii in terms of one free variable, say r0.

Then, I can express the sum s in terms of r0, and see if there exists an r0 such that s < sum(r_original) while satisfying all the constraints.

But this still seems involved.

Perhaps there's a graph-theoretic approach here.

Let me consider the graph where disks are nodes, and tangency is an edge.

In this graph, connected components correspond to sets of disks that are connected through tangencies.

Within each connected component, the radii are related through the tangency equations.

So, perhaps I can model this as a system where radii are related by offsets.

Wait, maybe I can assign a "potential" to each disk, where the potential is the radius, and the tangency constraints impose differences between potentials.

This sounds similar to solving an electrical network or a system of voltages.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of graph cycles.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose there are two disks, A and B, tangent to each other.

Then, r_a + r_b = d_ab

I can choose r_a freely, and then r_b is determined as r_b = d_ab - r_a

The sum s = r_a + r_b = d_ab

So, s is fixed and equal to d_ab.

Therefore, I cannot change s; it's locked by the tangency constraint.

Hence, in this case, I cannot make the sum strictly smaller.

Wait, but according to the problem, disks can have their radii adjusted as long as the sum decreases and tangencies are preserved.

But in this case, the sum is fixed by the tangency condition.

So, unless the original sum was larger than d_ab, which it can't be because they are tangent, the sum cannot be decreased.

Wait, but in this case, the original sum is exactly d_ab, and I cannot make it smaller without making some r_a or r_b negative.

Hence, in this case, the answer is NO.

Now, consider three disks forming a triangle, all tangent to each other.

So, disk A is tangent to B, B is tangent to C, and C is tangent to A.

Then, we have:

r_a + r_b = d_ab

r_b + r_c = d_bc

r_c + r_a = d_ca

This is a system of three equations with three variables.

I can solve this system to find the values of r_a, r_b, and r_c.

Once I have these values, I can compare the sum s = r_a + r_b + r_c to the original sum.

If s < sum(original radii), and all new radii are positive, then YES; else, NO.

But in practice, solving this system for each connected component seems inefficient for n up to 1000.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the general case.

In a connected component with k disks and t tangency constraints, the system A * r_new = b has t equations.

The general solution has k - t free variables.

I need to choose the free variables such that:

1. All r_new[i] > 0

2. Sum(r_new) < sum(r_original)

3. For all non-tangent pairs i,j, r_new[i] + r_new[j] <= d_ij

But checking this for each connected component seems too involved.

Is there a simpler condition that determines whether such an adjustment is possible?

Let me think about the sum of radii in a connected component.

In the case of two tangent disks, the sum is fixed and cannot be decreased.

In the case of three disks forming a triangle, the sum is also fixed.

Wait, in the first sample input, there are five disks, and the answer is YES.

Looking back at the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

In the explanation, it says that one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by 0.5, and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5, resulting in a decrease of 0.5 in the sum.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Looking at the disks:

Disk 1: (0,2), r=1

Disk 2: (0,0), r=1

Disk 3: (4,-3), r=4

Disk 4: (11,0), r=3

Disk 5: (11,5), r=2

I need to see which disks are tangent to each other.

Compute the distances between centers:

Distance between 1 and 2: sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

Sum of radii: 1 + 1 = 2, so they are tangent.

Distance between 1 and 3: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (2-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, which is less than sqrt(41), so not tangent.

Distance between 1 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4, which is less than sqrt(125), so not tangent.

Distance between 1 and 5: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than sqrt(130), so not tangent.

Distance between 2 and 3: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, so tangent.

Distance between 2 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4, which is less than 11, so not tangent.

Distance between 2 and 5: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.083

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than sqrt(146), so not tangent.

Distance between 3 and 4: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Sum of radii: 4 + 3 = 7, which is less than sqrt(58), so not tangent.

Distance between 3 and 5: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-5)^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) ≈ 10.630

Sum of radii: 4 + 2 = 6, which is less than sqrt(113), so not tangent.

Distance between 4 and 5: sqrt((11-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5, so tangent.

So, the tangent pairs are:

1-2, 2-3, 4-5

Therefore, the connected components are:

- Component 1: disks 1,2,3 (connected through 1-2 and 2-3)

- Component 2: disks 4,5 (connected through 4-5)

Disk 3 is connected to disk 2, which is connected to disk 1, forming one component.

Disks 4 and 5 are connected through their tangency.

Disks 3 and 4 are not tangent, so they are in different components.

Okay, so there are two connected components.

In the first component (disks 1,2,3), there are three disks and two tangency constraints (1-2 and 2-3).

So, the system has 3 variables and 2 equations, leaving one degree of freedom.

Similarly, in the second component (disks 4 and 5), there is one tangency constraint, so one equation and two variables, leaving one degree of freedom.

In each connected component, I need to see if I can adjust the radii to make the sum strictly smaller, while satisfying the tangency conditions and keeping all radii positive.

In the first sample explanation, they decreased the radii of disks 1 and 3 by 0.5 each and increased the radius of disk 2 by 0.5.

So, the total sum decreases by 0.5.

Similarly, in the connected component of disks 4 and 5, perhaps they didn't change the radii, or maybe they adjusted them in a way that the sum remains the same.

But since the problem allows adjusting radii in any connected component independently, as long as the sum decreases overall.

Wait, but in the first sample, they only adjusted radii in one connected component, causing the total sum to decrease.

So, if at least one connected component allows for such an adjustment, then the overall sum can be decreased.

Hence, the answer is YES.

In contrast, in the second sample, perhaps no connected component allows for such an adjustment, leading to a NO answer.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- Identify connected components based on tangency.

- For each connected component, determine if it's possible to adjust the radii to make the sum strictly smaller, while satisfying the tangency conditions and keeping all radii positive.

- If at least one connected component allows such an adjustment, then the overall sum can be decreased, and the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

So, now I need to figure out how to determine, for a given connected component, whether such an adjustment is possible.

Let's consider a connected component with k disks and t tangency constraints.

From the tangency constraints, I have t equations relating the radii.

I can represent this system as A * r_new = b, where A is a t x k matrix, and b is determined by the distances between centers of tangent disks.

The general solution to this system has k - t free variables.

I can choose values for these free variables and solve for the remaining radii.

My goal is to choose the free variables such that:

1. All r_new[i] > 0

2. Sum(r_new) < sum(r_original)

Now, to make this feasible, I need to see if there's a way to adjust the radii in such a way that the sum decreases.

Let me consider that in a connected component, the sum of radii is determined up to a constant.

Wait, in the earlier example with three disks, the sum is fixed.

But in the first sample, it seems like the sum isn't fixed, and can be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the rank of the system.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum of radii as a linear combination of the radii, and see if it's possible to make it smaller.

Let’s denote s = sum(r_new)

I need s < sum(r_original)

Given the system A * r_new = b

I need to find if there exists r_new such that A * r_new = b and s < sum(r_original), with all r_new[i] > 0.

This seems like a linear programming feasibility problem.

But for n up to 1000, linear programming would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in a connected component, the sum of radii can be expressed in terms of the distances between centers.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of a spanning tree.

In a connected component with k disks and t tangency constraints, if I consider the tangency graph, I can find a spanning tree.

In the spanning tree, there are k - 1 edges.

Each edge corresponds to a tangency constraint.

Then, I can use these constraints to express k - 1 radii in terms of one reference radius.

Wait, actually, in a connected graph with k nodes and t edges, the number of independent constraints is k - 1 if t = k - 1 (a tree).

But in general, for a connected graph with t edges and k nodes, the number of independent constraints is k - 1, assuming the graph is fully connected.

Wait, but in general, t can be greater than k - 1, in which case there are cycles, and the constraints might be dependent.

This complicates things.

Perhaps I can assign a reference radius to one disk in the component and express all other radii in terms of it.

Then, the sum s can be expressed as a linear function of the reference radius.

Then, I can see if there's a value of the reference radius where s < sum(r_original), while keeping all radii positive.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Choose one disk in the connected component as the root, and set its new radius to a variable, say r0.

Then, using the tangency constraints, express all other radii in terms of r0.

For example, if disk A is tangent to disk B, then r_b = d_ab - r_a

If disk B is tangent to disk C, then r_c = d_bc - r_b = d_bc - (d_ab - r_a) = d_bc - d_ab + r_a

And so on for other disks in the component.

Once all radii are expressed in terms of r0, I can write the sum s as s = sum(expressions in terms of r0)

Then, I can set s < sum(r_original)

Also, I need to ensure that all r_i > 0.

So, I have inequalities for each r_i in terms of r0.

Then, I need to find if there exists an r0 such that s < sum(r_original) and all r_i > 0.

This seems feasible.

Let me try this approach with the first sample input.

In the first connected component: disks 1,2,3

Tangency pairs: 1-2 and 2-3

Let’s set r1 = r0

Then, from r1 + r2 = d12 = 2, so r2 = 2 - r0

From r2 + r3 = d23 = 5, so r3 = 5 - r2 = 5 - (2 - r0) = 3 + r0

Now, sum s = r1 + r2 + r3 = r0 + (2 - r0) + (3 + r0) = 5 + r0

Original sum = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, s = 5 + r0 < 6 ⇒ r0 < 1

Also, all radii must be positive:

r1 = r0 > 0 ⇒ r0 > 0

r2 = 2 - r0 > 0 ⇒ r0 < 2

r3 = 3 + r0 > 0 ⇒ r0 > -3

Combining these, 0 < r0 < 1

So, for any r0 in (0,1), s = 5 + r0 < 6, and all radii are positive.

Hence, it's possible to decrease the sum in this connected component.

In the second connected component: disks 4 and 5

Tangency pair: 4-5

Set r4 = r0

Then, r5 = d45 - r0 = 5 - r0

Sum s = r4 + r5 = r0 + (5 - r0) = 5

Original sum = 3 + 2 = 5

So, s = 5 < 5 is not possible; it's only <=, but not strictly less.

Hence, in this component, the sum cannot be decreased.

Therefore, overall, since at least one component allows decreasing the sum, the answer is YES.

In the second sample input, perhaps no component allows decreasing the sum, leading to a NO.

So, this seems like a viable approach.

Hence, the plan is:

- Build the tangency graph, where disks are nodes and tangency constraints are edges.

- Identify connected components in this graph.

- For each connected component, choose one disk as a reference and express all other radii in terms of its radius r0.

- Express the sum s in terms of r0.

- Determine if there exists an r0 such that s < sum(r_original), and all radii are positive.

- If at least one component allows such an r0, then answer YES; otherwise, NO.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Represent the tangency graph efficiently.

- Traverse the connected components efficiently.

- For each connected component, perform the necessary calculations without running into floating-point precision issues.

Given that n can be up to 1000, and distances can be large (up to 10^9), I need to be careful with integer operations to avoid overflows.

Also, since the coordinates are integers and radii are positive integers, all distances and radii are integers, so I can work with integers throughout.

Now, in the implementation provided, it seems to be attempting something similar.

Let me try to understand the given code.

The code defines a function func_1() which seems to be the main function.

It reads n, the number of disks, and then reads n lines each containing x, y, r for each disk.

It initializes arrays x[], y[], r[] to store the coordinates and radii.

It also initializes a visited[] array to keep track of which disks have been processed.

Then, it seems to iterate through each unvisited disk, and performs some operations, including setting coef0[i] and coef1[i], and calling dfs(i).

Inside the dfs function, it marks the current disk as visited, adds it to the nodes list, and then iterates through all other disks, checking if they are tangent to the current disk.

If they are tangent and not visited, it sets coef0[j] and coef1[j] based on the current coef0[i] and coef1[i], and recurses with dfs(j).

Now, I need to understand what coef0 and coef1 represent.

From the code:

coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]

coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

It seems like it's trying to express the radii in terms of a reference variable.

Perhaps coef0 and coef1 are coefficients in an expression like r_j = coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r0, where r0 is the reference radius.

Wait, in the first iteration, for the reference disk, coef0[i] = 0 and coef1[i] = 1, meaning r_i = 0 + 1 * r0, so r_i = r0.

Then, for a tangent disk j, r_j = d_ij - r_i = d_ij - r0, so coef0[j] = d_ij and coef1[j] = -1.

If there's another tangent disk k to j, then r_k = d_jk - r_j = d_jk - (d_ij - r0) = -d_ij + d_jk + r0, so coef0[k] = -d_ij + d_jk and coef1[k] = 1.

And so on.

So, it seems like it's accumulating coefficients for each disk in terms of r0.

Then, after the dfs, it seems to compute c0 and c1 as the sum of coef0[j] and coef1[j] for all nodes in the component.

Then, it sets ok = ok or (c1 != 0)

Finally, if ok is True, it prints 'YES'; else, 'NO'

So, it seems like it's checking if c1 is non-zero for any connected component.

But why?

Let me think about what c0 and c1 represent.

Suppose, in a connected component with nodes, after setting r0 for the reference disk, all other radii are expressed in terms of r0, as r_j = coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r0

Then, the sum s = sum over j of (coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r0)

So, s = sum(coef0[j]) + sum(coef1[j]) * r0

Let’s denote c0 = sum(coef0[j]), c1 = sum(coef1[j])

Then, s = c0 + c1 * r0

Now, the original sum is sum(r_original)

To have s < sum(r_original), we need c0 + c1 * r0 < sum(r_original)

Also, we need to choose r0 such that all r_j > 0, which translates to coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r0 > 0 for all j.

Now, in the code, it seems to set ok = ok or (c1 != 0)

Then, if ok is True, it prints 'YES'; else, 'NO'

So, it's checking if there's at least one connected component where c1 != 0

But why is c1 != 0 significant?

Let’s consider the sum equation: s = c0 + c1 * r0

If c1 != 0, then s is a linear function of r0 with a non-zero slope, meaning that by adjusting r0, I can make s either increase or decrease.

Specifically, if c1 < 0, then decreasing r0 decreases s, and if c1 > 0, increasing r0 increases s.

Therefore, if c1 != 0, I have the possibility to adjust r0 to make s smaller.

On the other hand, if c1 == 0, then s = c0, a constant, and I cannot change it by adjusting r0.

Hence, if at least one connected component has c1 != 0, then it's possible to adjust the radii in that component to make the sum smaller, leading to a 'YES' answer.

Otherwise, if all components have c1 == 0, then in all components, s is fixed and cannot be adjusted, leading to a 'NO' answer.

Wait, but in the first sample, for the first component, s = 5 + r0, so c1 = 1 != 0, and for the second component, s = 5, c1 = 0.

Hence, since at least one component has c1 != 0, the answer is 'YES'.

In the second sample, perhaps all components have c1 == 0, leading to 'NO'.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

But, is this entirely accurate?

Wait, in the first component of the first sample, s = 5 + r0, and the original sum is 6.

To have s < 6, I need 5 + r0 < 6, which implies r0 < 1.

Also, r0 > 0, and other radii must be positive.

In this case, r0 < 1 ensures that r3 = 3 + r0 > 0, and r2 = 2 - r0 > 0.

So, it's possible to choose r0 in (0,1) to make s < 6.

But, in the second component, s = 5, which is equal to the original sum of 5, so no decrease is possible there.

Hence, overall, since one component allows decreasing the sum, the answer is 'YES'.

In the second sample, perhaps all components have c1 == 0, meaning that s is fixed and cannot be decreased.

Hence, 'NO'.

So, the condition seems to hold.

But, is this always true?

Let me consider a case where c1 != 0, but adjusting r0 cannot make s < sum(r_original).

Is that possible?

Suppose in a connected component, s = c0 + c1 * r0, and sum(r_original) is fixed.

If c1 > 0, then increasing r0 increases s, and decreasing r0 decreases s.

Similarly, if c1 < 0, increasing r0 decreases s, and decreasing r0 increases s.

But, I also have to ensure that all r_j > 0.

So, there might be bounds on r0.

For example, in the first sample, r0 must be in (0,1).

Within this range, s = 5 + r0 < 6.

So, it's possible.

But suppose in another scenario, s = c0 + c1 * r0, and the bounds on r0 don't allow s to be less than sum(r_original).

Is that possible?

Let me consider an example.

Suppose I have a connected component with two tangent disks.

Then, r1 + r2 = d12

Let’s set r1 = r0, then r2 = d12 - r0

Sum s = r0 + (d12 - r0) = d12

Original sum is r1_original + r2_original, say r1 + r2 = d12

So, s = d12, which is equal to the original sum.

In this case, c1 = 0, since s = d12 + 0 * r0

Hence, c1 == 0, and indeed, s cannot be less than d12.

Now, consider a connected component with three disks, where s = c0 + c1 * r0, and c1 != 0.

If c1 > 0, then to decrease s, I need to decrease r0.

But r0 has lower and upper bounds to keep all radii positive.

If the lower bound of r0 is r0_min, and the upper bound is r0_max.

Then, s decreases as r0 decreases if c1 < 0, or increases as r0 increases if c1 > 0.

Wait, no.

If c1 > 0, s increases as r0 increases, and decreases as r0 decreases.

If c1 < 0, s decreases as r0 increases, and increases as r0 decreases.

So, to make s < sum(r_original), I need to choose r0 such that s < sum(r_original), within the bounds r0_min <= r0 <= r0_max.

In the first sample, c1 = 1 > 0, so s increases as r0 increases.

To make s < 6, I need to decrease r0, since s = 5 + r0.

So, choose r0 as small as possible, i.e., approach r0_min = 0+.

Then, s approaches 5 + 0 = 5 < 6.

Hence, possible.

But what if c1 > 0, and sum(r_original) <= s for all r0 in [r0_min, r0_max]?

Is that possible?

Wait, in the first sample, sum(r_original) = 6, and s = 5 + r0.

For r0 in (0,1), s is between 5 and 6, which is less than 6.

Hence, it's possible.

But suppose sum(r_original) = 5, and s = 5 + r0.

Then, for r0 > 0, s > 5, which is greater than sum(r_original).

Wait, but in the first sample, sum(r_original) = 6 > s = 5 + r0.

Hence, s < 6.

Wait, no, in the first component, sum(r_original) = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, and s = 5 + r0.

For r0 in (0,1), s is between 5 and 6, which is less than 6.

In the second component, sum(r_original) = 3 + 2 = 5, and s = 5.

Hence, s cannot be less than 5.

So, overall, the sum can be decreased by decreasing s in the first component.

Now, consider a different scenario.

Suppose I have a connected component where s = c0 + c1 * r0, with c1 != 0.
