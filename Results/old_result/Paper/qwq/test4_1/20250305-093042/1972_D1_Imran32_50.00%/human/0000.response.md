Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. Gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b. So, b * gcd(a, b) is b multiplied by that gcd. The condition is that a + b is divisible by this product.

Let me try to rephrase this condition to see if I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it. If a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b), then there exists some integer k such that a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can look at the ratio a + b over b * gcd(a, b) and see if that can be simplified.

Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) is divisible by d^2 * b1

Which means d * (a1 + b1) / (d^2 * b1) should be an integer.

Simplifying, (a1 + b1) / (d * b1) should be an integer.

But since a1 and b1 are coprime, a1 + b1 and b1 are also coprime, I think. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if a1 = 1 and b1 = 2, then a1 + b1 = 3, which is coprime with b1 = 2. But if a1 = 2 and b1 = 3, a1 + b1 = 5, which is coprime with b1 = 3. Hmm, maybe in general, since a1 and b1 are coprime, a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime.

Assuming that, then (a1 + b1) / (d * b1) being an integer would imply that d * b1 divides a1 + b1. But since a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, that would mean d * b1 divides a1 + b1, but a1 + b1 is less than or equal to a1 + b1, which is less than or equal to (d * a1/d) + (d * b1/d) = a1 + b1, wait, this is getting messy.

Maybe I should try another approach. Let's consider the condition a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * gcd(a, b)). Since a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, with gcd(a1, b1) = 1, then a + b = d * (a1 + b1), and b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d * (a1 + b1) ≡ 0 mod (d^2 * b1). This implies that d^2 * b1 divides d * (a1 + b1), which simplifies to d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1, but since gcd(a1, b1) = 1, b1 can only divide a1 if b1 = 1.

Wait, if b1 divides a1 + b1 and gcd(a1, b1) = 1, then b1 divides a1 + b1. Since b1 divides b1, it must divide a1. But gcd(a1, b1) = 1, so b1 can only divide a1 if b1 = 1.

Therefore, the only possibility is b1 = 1.

So, b1 = 1, which means b = d * 1 = d.

Similarly, a = d * a1, and since b1 = 1, and gcd(a1, 1) = 1, a1 can be any positive integer.

So, a = d * a1, b = d, with a1 being any positive integer such that a = d * a1 ≤ n, and b = d ≤ m.

Wait, but d = b, since b = d * b1 and b1 = 1.

So, b = d, and a = d * a1 ≤ n, with a1 being any positive integer.

Also, b = d ≤ m.

So, for each d from 1 to m, a can be any multiple of d that is ≤ n, i.e., a = d, 2d, 3d, ..., up to floor(n/d) * d.

So, for each d from 1 to m, the number of a's is floor(n/d), since a must be ≤ n.

Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum over d from 1 to m of floor(n/d).

Wait, but in the problem, m can be up to 2*10^6, and t can be up to 10^4, and the sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6.

So, if I naively compute floor(n/d) for each d from 1 to m for each test case, it would be too slow, since it's O(t * m), which is up to 10^4 * 2*10^6 = 2*10^10 operations, which is way too slow.

I need a faster way to compute this sum.

I recall that sum(floor(n/d)) for d from 1 to m can be computed efficiently using harmonic decomposition or by grouping terms with the same value of floor(n/d).

Yes, the number of distinct values of floor(n/d) for d from 1 to m is approximately 2 * sqrt(n)), and similar techniques can be used to compute this sum efficiently.

But in this problem, since n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6, it's feasible to compute this sum for each test case separately in O(sqrt(n)) time.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let me look at the code.

The code reads t, the number of test cases, then calls func_1 t times.

In func_1, it reads n and k (which should be m, probably a typo in variable name), then initializes ans = n, then computes root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, then loops from i=2 to root+1, computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

Wait, that seems off.

So, for each test case, it sets ans = n, then for i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, it computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

Then, it prints ans.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the correct answer should be the sum of floor(n/d) for d from 1 to m.

But in the code, it's setting ans = n, which is sum(floor(n/d)) for d=1, since floor(n/1) = n.

Then, it loops from i=2 to sqrt(n)+1, computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

Wait, that doesn't seem to correspond to summing floor(n/d) for d from 2 to sqrt(n)+1.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to optimize the sum by grouping terms with the same floor(n/d) value.

But it's not clear to me what the code is doing exactly.

Let me try to see.

Suppose n=10, m=10.

According to the correct approach, the sum of floor(10/d) for d from 1 to 10 is:

floor(10/1)=10

floor(10/2)=5

floor(10/3)=3

floor(10/4)=2

floor(10/5)=2

floor(10/6)=1

floor(10/7)=1

floor(10/8)=1

floor(10/9)=1

floor(10/10)=1

Total sum = 10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1 = 27.

But according to the code:

ans = 10

root = int(sqrt(10)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

Loop from i=2 to 4:

i=2, cnt=4, add (10 + 2)//4 = 12//4 = 3 to ans → ans=13

i=3, cnt=9, add (10 + 3)//9 = 13//9 = 1 to ans → ans=14

i=4, cnt=16, add (10 + 4)//16 = 14//16 = 0 to ans → ans=14

Then, print 14

But according to the correct sum, it should be 27.

So, the code is giving 14, but the correct sum is 27.

Clearly, the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to compute something else.

Looking back at the problem, I see that m is the upper limit for b, but in the code, it's not using m at all except for reading it as k.

Wait, in the function func_1(), it reads n and k, but only uses n in the computation.

Wait, is m being ignored in the code?

Looking back, in the code:

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

ans = n

root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1

for i in range(2, root + 1):

cnt = i * i

ans += (n + i) // cnt

print(ans)

So, it reads n and k (which should be m), sets ans = n, computes root = sqrt(n)+1, then loops from i=2 to root+1, sets cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

Then, prints ans.

But according to the problem, we need to sum floor(n/d) for d from 1 to m.

In this case, for n=10 and m=10, the correct sum is 27, but the code outputs 14.

So, the code is clearly incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to optimize the sum using divisor groups, but it's implemented wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the code is intended for a different problem.

Looking back at the problem, it's version 2, which might be different from version 1.

But in any case, the code is not solving the given problem correctly, as it ignores the variable m and computes a sum that doesn't match the required sum.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
