Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where I'm placing white rooks and the computer is placing black rooks in a specific way. The goal is to find out how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game until no more moves can be made, starting from a certain number of initial moves.

First, I need to understand the rules of the game:

1. I place a white rook on the board.

2. The computer mirrors my move by placing a black rook at (c, r), where I placed at (r, c).

3. If I place a rook on the diagonal, i.e., r = c, the computer can't mirror it, so it skips that turn.

4. We have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other, meaning no two rooks share the same row or column.

5. After k initial moves, I need to continue the game until no more valid moves are left and count the number of possible final configurations.

Given that, I need to process multiple test cases, each with parameters n (size of the board) and k (number of initial moves), followed by k pairs of (r, c).

Constraints are:

- t ≤ 10^4

- n ≤ 3*10^5

- k ≤ n

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 3*10^5

So, efficiency is crucial here.

Let me try to rephrase the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it.

We have a chessboard of size n x n. I place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks in a mirrored position. The computer mirrors by swapping rows and columns. If I place on the diagonal, the computer skips because (r,c) would be the same as (c,r).

Our moves must not attack existing rooks, meaning no two rooks share the same row or column.

After k initial moves, I need to continue the game until no more moves can be made and count the number of possible final configurations.

First, I need to process the k initial moves and see their impact on the board.

Let me think about how to model this.

Each rook, whether white or black, occupies a unique row and column since no two rooks can attack each other.

Given that, placing a rook on (r,c) blocks row r and column c for future moves.

Similarly, the computer places a rook on (c,r), which blocks row c and column r, provided that r != c.

Wait, but if r = c, the computer skips, so only one rook is placed on the diagonal.

So, for each of my moves:

- If r != c:

- I place a white rook at (r,c)

- Computer places a black rook at (c,r)

- Rows r and c are blocked

- Columns c and r are blocked

- If r == c:

- I place a white rook at (r,r)

- Computer skips

- Row r and column r are blocked

So, each move blocks rows and columns.

I need to keep track of blocked rows and columns.

Wait, more precisely, each rook blocks its row and column.

So, if I place a rook at (r,c), it blocks row r and column c.

Similarly, the computer's rook at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

So, in total, for r != c:

- Rows r and c are blocked

- Columns c and r are blocked

- So, rows r and c are fully blocked

- Columns r and c are fully blocked

Wait, no.

Actually, a rook placed at (r,c) blocks row r and column c.

Similarly, a rook at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

So, row r is blocked by my rook at (r,c)

Column c is blocked by my rook at (r,c)

Row c is blocked by the computer's rook at (c,r)

Column r is blocked by the computer's rook at (c,r)

So, after my move and the computer's move, rows r and c are blocked, and columns r and c are blocked.

Wait, but only partially blocked, because other positions in those rows and columns can still be occupied, as long as they don't attack existing rooks.

Wait, no. In chess, rooks attack along the entire row and column.

So, placing a rook on a specific square blocks the entire row and column for other rooks.

Wait, but in this problem, it seems that no two rooks can be in the same row or column, which implies that each row and each column can have at most one rook.

So, it's similar to placing non-attacking rooks.

Given that, placing a rook on (r,c) means that no other rook can be in row r or column c.

Similarly, placing another rook in row r or column c would cause them to attack each other.

So, each move blocks one row and one column.

Given that, the entire problem seems to be about placing non-attacking rooks on the board, with the additional mirroring constraint.

Wait, but in standard non-attacking rook placements, the number of ways is n!, but here it's more complicated due to the mirroring.

Let me think differently.

After k initial moves, some rows and columns are already blocked.

I need to find out how many ways to place the remaining rooks, considering the mirroring rule.

Wait, but the mirroring rule is only applied for the initial k moves, or for all moves?

Actually, the problem says: "you make a move, then the computer mirrors it, and so on."

So, it's turn-based: you place a white rook, then the computer places a black rook by mirroring, and so on.

Given that, after k moves, you have made k moves, and the computer has made k moves (unless some are skipped due to diagonal placements).

Wait, but the problem says: "you have already played k moves with the computer, and the computer tries to mirror these moves too."

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Let's read it again: "You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there are no valid moves remaining."

So, it seems that k is the number of moves you have already made, and for each of your moves, the computer has mirrored it (if possible).

Given that, I need to consider the state of the board after these k moves and continue the game from there.

First, I need to process the k initial moves and see which rows and columns are already blocked.

Then, determine how many free rows and columns are left, and calculate the number of ways to continue placing rooks until no more moves are possible.

Given that rooks block their rows and columns, the number of free rows and columns decreases with each move.

Moreover, since the computer mirrors your moves, there is some symmetry in the placements.

Wait, but the mirroring is only done for the initial k moves, and then the game continues without mirroring, right?

Wait, no, the problem says: "you make a move, then the computer mirrors it", and this continues until no more moves are left.

So, it's not just the initial k moves; it's the entire game.

But in the initial k moves, some moves have already been made, and now I need to continue the game from there, following the same procedure: you place a rook, then the computer mirrors it, and so on.

Given that, I need to model the entire game process starting from the current state.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Each pair of your move and the computer's mirror move blocks two rows and two columns (if r != c), or one row and one column (if r = c).

So, for each of your moves:

- If r != c:

- Block rows r and c

- Block columns r and c

- So, two rows and two columns are blocked

- If r = c:

- Block row r and column r

- So, one row and one column are blocked

Given that, after k moves, the total number of blocked rows and columns can be calculated.

Wait, but there might be overlaps if different moves block the same row or column.

So, I need to keep track of the unique blocked rows and columns.

Let me define:

- Let S_r be the set of rows blocked by your moves and the computer's mirror moves.

- Let S_c be the set of columns blocked by your moves and the computer's mirror moves.

Initially, S_r and S_c are empty.

For each of your k moves:

- Place a white rook at (r,c)

- If r != c:

- Computer places a black rook at (c,r)

- Add r and c to S_r and S_c

- Else (r = c):

- Computer skips

- Add r to S_r and S_c

So, after k moves, S_r and S_c contain the blocked rows and columns.

Wait, but in this problem, rows and columns are blocked based on the moves made.

But in reality, placing a rook at (r,c) blocks row r and column c, regardless of the color.

So, in terms of blocking, each rook, whether white or black, blocks its row and column.

Given that, for each rook placed, regardless of color, its row and column are blocked for future moves.

So, the total blocked rows and columns are the union of all rows and columns where rooks have been placed.

Wait, but in the mirroring rule, when you place at (r,c), the computer places at (c,r), which blocks row c and column r.

So, effectively, placing at (r,c) and (c,r) blocks rows r, c and columns r, c.

Unless r = c, in which case, only one rook is placed, blocking row r and column r.

So, in general, for each pair of your move and the computer's mirror move:

- If r != c:

- Block rows r and c

- Block columns r and c

- Else (r = c):

- Block row r and column r

So, the total number of blocked rows and columns is the union of all rows and columns involved in the initial k moves.

Given that, the number of free rows and columns left is n minus the number of unique blocked rows and columns.

Let me define m = n - |S|, where S is the set of unique rows and columns blocked.

Wait, more precisely, let S be the set of all rows and columns that have at least one rook.

So, S = S_r ∪ S_c, where S_r is the set of rows with at least one rook, and S_c is the set of columns with at least one rook.

But since rooks block their rows and columns, S_r and S_c are the sets of blocked rows and columns.

So, the total number of blocked rows and columns is |S_r ∪ S_c| = |S_r| + |S_c| - |S_r ∩ S_c|

But in this problem, since each rook blocks its row and column, and rooks are placed such that no two rooks attack each other, S_r and S_c are disjoint sets.

Wait, no. Actually, in standard non-attacking rook placements, S_r and S_c can have overlaps if a rook is placed on the diagonal.

Wait, in this problem, rooks can be placed on the diagonal, but only your rooks can be on the diagonal, since the computer mirrors your move, but if r = c, the computer skips.

So, in that case, only your rook is placed on the diagonal, blocking that row and column.

Otherwise, both your rook and the computer's rook block their respective rows and columns.

So, in general, S_r and S_c can have overlaps only if you place a rook on the diagonal.

Wait, no.

Wait, if you place a rook on (r,r), then S_r and S_c both include r, so |S_r ∩ S_c| >=1 for each such move.

Whereas, if you place a rook at (r,c) with r != c, then S_r includes r and S_c includes c, and they are distinct.

So, |S_r ∩ S_c| is equal to the number of your moves where r = c.

Because only those moves add the same row and column to both S_r and S_c.

So, in general, |S_r ∪ S_c| = |S_r| + |S_c| - |S_r ∩ S_c|

Given that, |S_r| is equal to the number of distinct rows you have placed rooks in, including both your moves and the computer's mirror moves.

Similarly, |S_c| is the number of distinct columns where rooks have been placed.

Wait, but it's getting complicated.

Let me try to count the total number of unique rows and columns that have at least one rook.

For each of your moves:

- If r != c:

- Add r to S_r and c to S_c

- Computer places at (c,r), so add c to S_r and r to S_c

- So, in total, both r and c are added to S_r and S_c

- Else (r = c):

- Add r to S_r and S_c

- Computer skips

So, in this case, S_r and S_c will have the same elements: all the rows and columns that have at least one rook.

Wait, but in the case where r != c:

- Your move adds r to S_r and c to S_c

- Computer's move adds c to S_r and r to S_c

So, effectively, both r and c are added to both S_r and S_c.

Hence, S_r = S_c in this scenario.

Wait, no.

Wait, S_r is the set of rows with at least one rook.

S_c is the set of columns with at least one rook.

But in this problem, rooks are placed in such a way that rows and columns are blocked.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the positions that are blocked, rather than separate S_r and S_c.

Let me consider the board as a graph where rows and columns are separate sets.

Wait, perhaps bipartite graph thinking could help, but maybe it's overcomplicating.

Let me try to think in terms of available rows and columns.

Each move blocks some rows and columns, and the remaining moves must be placed in the unblocked rows and columns.

Given that, after k moves, there are some blocked rows and columns, and the remaining board is like a subgrid where no rooks have been placed yet.

I need to find out how many ways to place rooks in this subgrid, following the same placement rules.

Wait, but the mirroring rule complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the remaining game as placing pairs of rooks: one by you and one by the computer, mirrored, until no more moves are possible.

But, in the end, if there's an odd number of moves left, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of remaining free positions and see how many ways to pair them up.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n = 4, k = 1

Your move: (1,2)

Computer's move: (2,1)

So, rows 1 and 2 are blocked, columns 1 and 2 are blocked.

Remaining board is 2x2: rows 3 and 4, columns 3 and 4.

Now, in this remaining board, you continue placing rooks alternately, with the computer mirroring your moves.

Possible configurations:

1. You place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

2. You place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4)

3. You place at (3,3), then at (4,4), or you place at (4,4) then (3,3)

So, total 3 configurations.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n = 8, k = 1

Your move: (7,6)

Computer's move: (6,7)

Blocked rows: 6 and 7

Blocked columns: 6 and 7

Remaining board: 6x6 (rows 1-5,8 and columns 1-5,8)

Number of configurations: 331

Third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4

Some moves given

Output: 671968183

Given these, it seems like there's a pattern or formula that can be applied.

Looking back at the first test case, with n=4, k=1, and output=3.

Similarly, if k=0 (no initial moves), for n=1, output should be 1 (only one configuration: no rooks).

For n=2, k=0, possible configurations:

- Place no rooks: 1 way

- Place one rook: you place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1); or you place at (2,1), computer places at (1,2); but since the computer mirrors, these are the same configuration.

Wait, no.

Wait, for n=2, k=0:

You place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1); or you place at (2,1), computer places at (1,2).

These are the same configuration.

Or you could place at (1,1), computer skips; or (2,2), computer skips.

But in both cases, only one rook is placed.

So total configurations: placing no rooks, placing one rook at (1,2) and (2,1), placing one rook at (1,1), placing one rook at (2,2).

So, 4 configurations.

But according to the problem, configurations are different if there's a position with a rook in one and not in the other, or different colors.

But in this case, all placements are unique.

Wait, but for n=2, k=0, starting from scratch.

But in the problem, k is given, and we have to continue from there.

I need to find a general formula.

Let me consider that after processing the k moves, there are m free rows and columns left.

Then, the number of configurations is some function of m.

Looking at the first test case, n=4, k=1, m=2 (since 4 - num_blocked = 2), and output=3.

Similarly, for n=8, k=1, m=6, output=331.

For n=1000, k=4, m=996, output=671968183.

I need to find a pattern or formula that maps m to the output.

Looking at m=2, output=3

m=6, output=331

m=996, output=671968183

It seems like the output grows rapidly with m.

Perhaps it's related to factorials or combinations.

Wait, for m=2, output=3

For m=3, what would be the output?

Not given in the samples.

Wait, perhaps it's dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]

Like the number of ways to pair up remaining positions.

Wait, for m=2: dp[2] = dp[1] + (2-1)*dp[0]

Assuming dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1 + 1*1=2, but sample has dp[2]=3 for m=2.

Wait, maybe dp[2]=3, dp[1]=1, dp[0]=1

Then dp[3]=dp[2] + 2*dp[1]=3 + 2*1=5

dp[4]=dp[3] + 3*dp[2]=5 + 3*3=14

But I don't see a direct match with the sample outputs.

Wait, perhaps it's dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2] * 2

Wait, for m=2: dp[2]=dp[1] + 1*dp[0]*2=1 + 1*1*2=3, matches sample.

For m=3: dp[3]=dp[2] + 2*dp[1]*2=3 + 2*1*2=7

But sample for m=6 is 331, let's see:

dp[4]=dp[3] + 3*dp[2]*2=7 + 3*3*2=7 + 18=25

dp[5]=dp[4] + 4*dp[3]*2=25 + 4*7*2=25 + 56=81

dp[6]=dp[5] + 5*dp[4]*2=81 + 5*25*2=81 + 250=331

Yes, matches the second sample.

So, it seems dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]*2, with dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=3

Therefore, the number of configurations is dp[m], where m is the number of free rows and columns left after processing the k initial moves.

So, in the program, it seems to implement this dp.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t -= 1

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

num = 0

for i in range(k):

(c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if c == r:

num += 1

else:

num += 2

m = n - num

if m == 0:

print(1)

elif m == 1:

print(1)

else:

dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

for i in range(3, m + 1):

dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

print(dp[m])

So, it calculates num as the total number of blocked rows and columns.

For each of your k moves:

- If c == r, num +=1

- Else, num +=2

Then, m = n - num

And then computes dp[m]

Seems to align with what I thought.

Wait, but why num +=1 if c == r, and num +=2 if c != r?

Because, for c != r:

- Your move blocks rows r and c

- Computer's move blocks rows c and r

- So, total blocks: rows r and c, columns r and c

- So, 2 rows and 2 columns blocked

Wait, but no, wait.

Wait, in the code, it's num +=1 if c == r, else num +=2

But according to my earlier reasoning, for c != r, num should be increased by 2 (since two rows and two columns are blocked), and for c == r, num should be increased by 1 (since one row and one column are blocked).

Wait, but actually, for c == r, num +=1, which seems correct.

Wait, but in reality, for c == r, only one row and one column are blocked.

But, in the mirroring rule, when c == r, computer skips, so only one rook is placed, blocking one row and one column.

For c != r, two rooks are placed, blocking two rows and two columns.

Hence, num should be incremented by 1 for c == r, and by 2 for c != r.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, no.

Wait, for c != r:

- Your move: place at (r,c), block row r and column c

- Computer's move: place at (c,r), block row c and column r

- So, in total, rows r and c are blocked, columns r and c are blocked

- So, 2 rows and 2 columns are blocked

Wait, but actually, the blocks are on rows and columns.

But in terms of the union of blocked rows and columns, it's the unique set of rows and columns that have at least one rook.

So, for c != r:

- Add r to blocked rows

- Add c to blocked columns

- Add c to blocked rows (from computer's move)

- Add r to blocked columns (from computer's move)

- So, blocked rows: r and c

- Blocked columns: r and c

- So, unique blocked rows and columns: r and c

- So, total unique blocked rows and columns: 2

- Hence, num +=2

For c == r:

- Your move: place at (r,r), block row r and column r

- Computer skips

- So, only one row and one column are blocked

- Hence, num +=1

So, the code seems correct in incrementing num by 1 if c == r, else by 2.

Then, m = n - num, which is the number of free rows and columns left.

Then, it computes dp[m], where dp[m] is calculated as dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]*2, modulo 10^9+7

With dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=3

This seems to match the pattern I observed earlier.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible on an n x n chessboard after placing rooks according to specific rules. The solution involves understanding the constraints imposed by the rook placements and using dynamic programming to count the valid configurations efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup and Input Parsing**:
   - We read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of initial moves (k).
   - We process each of the k moves to determine how many rows and columns are blocked.

2. **Blocked Rows and Columns Calculation**:
   - For each move:
     - If the row and column are different (r != c), both rows and columns are blocked (num += 2).
     - If the row and column are the same (r == c), only one row and one column are blocked (num += 1).
   - Calculate the remaining free rows and columns (m = n - num).

3. **Dynamic Programming to Count Configurations**:
   - Use a DP array to compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining free positions.
   - Initialize DP for m = 0 and m = 1.
   - Use the recurrence relation to fill the DP array for larger m.
   - The DP relation is: dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2, modulo 10^9 + 7.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - For each test case, print the DP value corresponding to the remaining free positions.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])

# Execute the function to handle input and output
func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Blocked Rows and Columns**:
   - Each move blocks specific rows and columns based on whether the row and column indices are the same or different.
   - This step ensures we accurately account for the positions that are no longer available for rook placement.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations**:
   - We use a DP array to store the number of configurations for a given number of free rows and columns.
   - The DP relation accounts for placing rooks in pairs (considering the mirroring) and ensures no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The DP approach efficiently computes the configurations in O(m) time, where m is the number of free rows and columns.
   - Given the constraints, this method ensures the solution is computationally feasible for large inputs.

By following this approach, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient, adhering to the problem's requirements and constraints.
