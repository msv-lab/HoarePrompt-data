Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a certain value. Then, he arranges them in non-increasing order, meaning from largest to smallest. If there are ties, the order of those cubes can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among those removed or not. The tricky part is that since there might be ties, the position of the favorite cube after sorting isn't fixed.

Let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand the possible positions the favorite cube can be in after sorting.

Given that the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the cubes with the highest values will be at the beginning. If there are multiple cubes with the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified, meaning they can be in any order.

So, to determine if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see if it's possible for it to be in the first k positions after sorting.

Let's consider the maximum possible position the favorite cube can have after sorting. If its value is very low, it could be at the end. If its value is very high, it could be at the front.

But more specifically, I need to find out in which positions the favorite cube could end up after sorting.

I think the key is to look at the number of cubes that have a higher value than the favorite cube. Those cubes will definitely be before the favorite cube in the sorted list.

Similarly, the cubes with the same value as the favorite cube can be in any order relative to each other.

So, let's define:

- Let count_higher be the number of cubes with a value higher than the favorite cube.

- Let count_equal be the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

Then, in the sorted list, the favorite cube can be in any position from count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal.

Because:

- The first count_higher positions are taken by cubes with higher values.

- The next count_equal positions are taken by cubes with the same value as the favorite, and their order among themselves is arbitrary.

So, if the favorite cube is in position p after sorting, p ranges from count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal.

Now, Dmitry removes the first k cubes. So, if p <= k, the favorite cube is removed; otherwise, it's not.

Given that p can be from count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal, we need to see if all possible p values are <= k or all are > k, or if some are <= k and some are > k.

Based on this, we can decide whether the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it's possible in some cases but not others.

Let me formalize this:

- If count_higher + count_equal <= k, then even the last possible position of the favorite cube (count_higher + count_equal) is within the first k, so it's always removed. So, answer is "YES".

- If count_higher + 1 > k, meaning even the earliest possible position of the favorite cube is after k, so it's never removed. So, answer is "NO".

- Otherwise, some positions are within the first k and some are not, so it's "MAYBE".

Wait, let me double-check these conditions.

First, count_higher is the number of cubes with higher values than the favorite cube.

count_equal is the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

So, in the sorted list:

Positions 1 to count_higher: cubes with higher values.

Positions (count_higher + 1) to (count_higher + count_equal): cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

Any cubes with lower values come after position (count_higher + count_equal).

Now, the favorite cube can be in any position from count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal, since those cubes have the same value and their order is arbitrary.

Now, if k >= (count_higher + count_equal), then all positions from count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal are within the first k, so the favorite cube is always removed. So, "YES".

If k < count_higher + 1, then even the first possible position of the favorite cube (count_higher + 1) is already after k, so it's never removed. So, "NO".

If k is such that count_higher + 1 <= k < count_higher + count_equal, then some of the positions of the favorite cube are within the first k and some are not, so it's "MAYBE".

Wait, actually, let's think again.

If k >= count_higher + count_equal, then all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k, so "YES".

If k < count_higher + 1, then all possible positions are after k, so "NO".

If count_higher + 1 <= k < count_higher + count_equal, then some positions are removed and some are not, so "MAYBE".

Yes, that seems correct.

So, in the code, I need to calculate count_higher and count_equal, and then based on the values of k, count_higher, and count_equal, decide whether it's "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE".

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it's implementing this logic correctly.

The function func() seems to be handling multiple test cases, since the first input is t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the list a of n integers

- Determine the favorite value: favorite_value = a[f - 1] (since lists are 0-indexed in Python)

- Sort the list in non-increasing order: sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)

- Count how many times the favorite value appears in the sorted list: favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)

- Then, iterate through the first k elements of the sorted list and count how many times the favorite value appears in those k elements: removed_count

- Based on removed_count and favorite_count:

- If removed_count == favorite_count, print 'YES'

- Elif removed_count == 0, print 'NO'

- Else, print 'MAYBE'

Wait, this seems different from my earlier reasoning.

In my reasoning, I based the decision on count_higher and count_equal, but in this code, it's based on how many favorite_value cubes are in the first k positions after sorting.

Let me see if this achieves the same result.

So, in the sorted list, the first count_higher positions have values higher than the favorite_value, and the next count_equal positions have the favorite_value.

So, in the first k positions, the number of favorite_value cubes that can be present is between max(0, k - count_higher) and min(k, count_higher + count_equal) - count_higher.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, since the first count_higher positions are higher than favorite_value, and the next count_equal are equal.

So, in the first k positions, the number of favorite_value cubes is min(k - count_higher, count_equal).

But in the code, it's iterating through the first k elements and counting how many have the favorite_value.

So, removed_count is the number of favorite_value cubes in the first k positions.

Now, in my earlier reasoning, I had:

- If k >= count_higher + count_equal, then removed_count == count_equal, so print 'YES'

- If k < count_higher, then removed_count == 0, so print 'NO'

- Else, 0 < removed_count < count_equal, so print 'MAYBE'

Wait, but in the code, it's checking:

- If removed_count == favorite_count, print 'YES'

- Elif removed_count == 0, print 'NO'

- Else, print 'MAYBE'

Wait, favorite_count is the total number of cubes with the favorite_value in the entire list.

So, in the sorted list, the favorite_value cubes are from position count_higher + 1 to count_higher + count_equal.

If k >= count_higher + count_equal, then the first k positions include all favorite_value cubes, so removed_count == favorite_count, so 'YES'

If k < count_higher, then none of the favorite_value cubes are in the first k positions, so removed_count == 0, so 'NO'

If count_higher <= k < count_higher + count_equal, then removed_count == k - count_higher (since the first count_higher positions are higher values, and the next count_equal are equal), but only up to count_equal.

Wait, but in this case, removed_count would be min(k - count_higher, count_equal)

So, if k - count_higher < count_equal, then removed_count < favorite_count, and since removed_count > 0, it would print 'MAYBE'

Which matches my earlier reasoning.

So, yes, this seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first example from the sample input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

favorite_value = 3 (since a[1] = 3)

sorted_a = [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc., but sorted in non-increasing order, so [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]

count_equal = 3 (three 3's)

count_higher = 1 (only 4 is higher than 3)

So, positions of favorite_value are from 2 to 4.

k = 2, so removing first 2 cubes.

In this case, the first 2 cubes are 4 and 3.

So, removed_count = 1 (only one 3 in the first 2)

favorite_count = 3

So, removed_count != favorite_count and removed_count != 0, so 'MAYBE'

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

favorite_value = 5 (a[4] = 5)

sorted_a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

count_equal = 1 (only one 5)

count_higher = 0 (no values higher than 5)

k = 3, so removing first 3: 5, 4, 3

removed_count = 1 (the 5 is removed)

favorite_count = 1

So, removed_count == favorite_count, so 'YES'

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

favorite_value = 5

sorted_a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

count_equal = 1

count_higher = 0

k = 2, removing first 2: 5 and 4

removed_count = 1

favorite_count = 1

So, 'YES'

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "NO"

Wait, in the sample input, n=5, f=5, k=2, a=[5,2,4,1,3]

Wait, let's check the sample output again.

Wait, in the sample input, it's:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

And the sample output is "NO"

But according to my calculation, it should be "YES"

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the favorite cube is the fifth cube, which has value 3, not 5.

Wait, no, a=[5,2,4,1,3], so a[4]=3, since Python is 0-indexed.

Wait, but in the problem, cubes are numbered from 1 to n, so f=5 refers to the fifth cube, which is a[4]=3.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says:

After sorting a=[5,4,3,2,1], so favorite_value=3 is in position 3.

If k=2, removing first 2: 5 and 4, so favorite cube is not removed. So, "NO"

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly thought favorite_value was 5, but actually it's 3.

So, favorite_value=3, count_equal=1 (only one 3), count_higher=2 (5 and 4 are higher than 3)

So, positions of favorite_value are from count_higher +1 to count_higher + count_equal, which is position 3.

k=2, so removing first 2: positions 1 and 2, which are 5 and 4.

So, favorite cube at position 3 is not removed. So, "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

So, my earlier mistake was not correctly identifying the favorite_value.

Back to the code.

In the code, it's calculating removed_count by iterating through the first k elements of sorted_a and counting how many are equal to favorite_value.

Then, comparing removed_count to favorite_count (total number of favorite_value in the list).

If removed_count == favorite_count, meaning all favorite cubes are in the first k, so always removed, "YES"

If removed_count == 0, meaning none of the favorite cubes are in the first k, so never removed, "NO"

Else, it's possible that some are removed and some are not, so "MAYBE"

This seems correct.

Another way to think about it is:

- The favorite cube could be in any position among the count_equal cubes with the same value.

- So, in the sorted list, the positions of these count_equal cubes are from count_higher +1 to count_higher + count_equal.

- If k >= count_higher + count_equal, then all these positions are within the first k, so always removed.

- If k < count_higher, then none of these positions are within the first k, so never removed.

- If count_higher <= k < count_higher + count_equal, then some of these positions are within the first k, so it's possible for the favorite cube to be removed or not, depending on its position.

Which aligns with the code's logic.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
