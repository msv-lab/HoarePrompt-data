Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, I need to buy k tickets for my employees over n days, where each day the price per ticket is given by a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then for all subsequent days, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying exactly k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Suppose n=3, m=2, k=3, and a=[1,2,3].

If I buy 1 ticket on day 1, it costs 1. Then, for day 2 and day 3, the prices increase by 1, so they become 3 and 4 respectively.

Then, I can buy 2 tickets on day 2, which would cost 6 in total. So, total cost is 1 + 6 = 7.

Alternatively, if I buy 2 tickets on day 1, it costs 2 (since price is 1 each), and then prices for day 2 and 3 increase by 2, becoming 4 and 5 respectively.

Then, I need to buy 1 more ticket on day 2, which costs 4. Total cost is 2 + 4 = 6.

So, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 is cheaper than buying 1 on day 1 and 2 on day 2.

Wait, but in the first scenario, I could also consider buying 0 on day 1, then prices remain the same, buy 2 on day 2 (cost 4), and 1 on day 3 (cost 3), total 7.

So, buying more on earlier days seems beneficial, but I need to confirm this.

Let me think about the general case.

I need to decide how many tickets to buy on each day, respecting the daily limit m, and considering that future prices increase by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I make decisions step by step, considering the impact on future days.

But given the constraints (n up to 3e5, m up to 1e9, k up to 1e9), a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to minimize the total cost.

Let me consider the effect of buying x tickets on day i.

The cost on day i is x * a_i, and then for all future days, the price increases by x.

So, for day j > i, the price becomes a_j + sum of x for all days up to i.

Wait, more precisely, the price on day j after buying x tickets on day i is a_j plus the sum of x for all days before j.

Wait, no. According to the problem, "if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, the price increase is cumulative based on all previous purchases.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define s_i as the sum of x for all days up to day i.

Then, the price on day j is a_j + s_{j-1}, where s_{j-1} is the sum of x from day 1 to day j-1.

Wait, more accurately:

Let s_i be the total tickets bought before day i.

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}.

Our goal is to choose x_i (tickets bought on day i) such that:

- 0 ≤ x_i ≤ m for each i

- Sum of x_i over all i equals k

And minimize the total cost, which is sum of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

This seems complex because s_{i-1} depends on previous x's.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Let me consider that s_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i) + sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

This seems tricky to minimize directly.

Maybe there's another approach.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, and the number of tickets per day, respecting the daily limit m.

Then, the total cost can be calculated based on the cumulative sum of previous purchases affecting future prices.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I should consider the greedy approach.

Given that buying more tickets on earlier days seems beneficial because it increases future prices, but I need to confirm if buying as much as possible early on leads to the minimum cost.

Wait, in my earlier example, buying more on day 1 led to a lower total cost.

Let me try another example.

Suppose n=2, m=1, k=2, a=[1,2].

Option 1: Buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 become 2 + 1 = 3, buy 1 on day 2 (cost 3), total 4.

Option 2: Buy 0 on day 1, prices for day 2 remain 2, buy 1 on day 2 (cost 2), then buy another 1 on day 2 (cost 2), total 4.

Wait, but m=1, so I can't buy 2 on day 2; I can only buy 1 per day.

Wait, actually, in this case, both options are the same: total cost is 4.

Let me try another example: n=3, m=1, k=3, a=[1,2,3].

Option: Buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 2+1=3 and 3+1=4.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 3), prices for day 3 become 4+1=5.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 5), total cost 1+3+5=9.

Alternative option: Buy 0 on day 1, prices remain the same.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 2), prices for day 3 become 3+1=4.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 4), and another 1 on day 3 is not possible because m=1.

Wait, m=1, so I can't buy more than 1 per day.

So, seems like only the first option is feasible.

Wait, but in this case, is there a better way?

Let me see.

Another option: Buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 3 and 4.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 3), prices for day 3 become 4+1=5.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 5), total 9.

Alternative: Buy 0 on day 1, prices remain the same.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 2), prices for day 3 become 3+1=4.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 4), and another 1 on day 3 is not allowed since m=1.

So, seems like only buying one per day is possible, total cost 1+3+5=9 or 2+4=6, but m=1, so can't buy more than one per day.

Wait, in the second option, I can only buy one per day, so total is 2 + 4 = 6, but k=3, so I need to buy three tickets.

Wait, but m=1, so I can only buy one per day, so I have to buy on three days.

So, buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 3 and 4.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 3), prices for day 3 become 4 +1=5.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 5), total 9.

Alternatively, buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 3 and 4.

Buy 0 on day 2, prices for day 3 remain 4 +1=5.

Buy 2 on day 3 (cost 10), total 1 + 10 = 11, which is worse.

So, seems like buying as much as possible early is better.

Wait, but in this case, buying all on day 1 is not possible because m=1.

So, in this constrained case, buying one per day is necessary.

Let me consider another example: n=3, m=2, k=3, a=[1,2,3].

Option 1: Buy 2 on day 1 (cost 2), prices for day 2 and 3 become 2+2=4 and 3+2=5.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 4), total 6.

Option 2: Buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 2+1=3 and 3+1=4.

Buy 1 on day 2 (cost 3), prices for day 3 become 4+1=5.

Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 5), total 9.

So, buying more on earlier days seems better.

Another option: Buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), prices for day 2 and 3 become 3 and 4.

Buy 2 on day 2 (cost 6), total 7.

Still worse than buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

So, seems like buying as much as possible on the cheapest days is beneficial.

But I need to generalize this.

Let me think about sorting the days by a_i.

If I sort the days in increasing order of a_i, and buy as much as possible on the earliest (cheapest) days, that might be the optimal strategy.

But I need to consider the constraints on m and how the price increases affect future purchases.

Wait, but the days are given in a specific order, and I need to respect that order.

I can't rearrange the days; I have to buy on the given days in sequence.

But perhaps I can consider the days in order and make decisions based on the current price plus the accumulated increase from previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can model this as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, where the price on each day is a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

This seems complex.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I decide to buy x tickets on day 1.

Then, for all subsequent days, the price increases by x.

So, the total cost would be x * a_1 + (total cost of buying k - x tickets over the remaining days, with each price increased by x).

This sounds like a recursive relation.

Define dp[i][s] as the minimum cost to buy s tickets starting from day i, with a price increase of s per ticket.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into selecting q days to buy tickets, where q is the number of days I choose to buy tickets.

On those q days, I buy x_i tickets on day i, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

And the total cost is sum x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i).

This seems similar to assigning costs based on the order of purchases.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as arranging the tickets in order of purchase, with the earliest purchases increasing the price for all later purchases.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get more insights.

Sample Input:

4

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

4 2 8

8 6 4 2

5 100 1

10000 1 100 10 1000

5 5 5 5 5 5

Sample Output:

10

64

72

In the first test case, n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

From the note, buying 0 on day1, 0 on day2, 1 on day3 (cost 4), and 2 on day4 (cost 6), total 10.

Another option: buy 2 on day1 (cost 16), prices for day2-4 become [8,6,4]+2=[10,8,6]

Then buy 1 on day2 (cost 8), total 24.

So, buying later is better in this case.

Wait, contrary to my earlier thought.

So, in this case, buying later is better.

Wait, perhaps buying on the days with lower a_i is better, considering the price increases.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i + the sum of x_j for j < i.

But since sum x_j for j < i depends on previous decisions, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe I can consider the days in increasing order of a_i, and buy as much as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases.

But I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me consider that I need to choose q days to buy tickets, where q is the number of days I buy tickets.

Let’s define q as the number of days I choose to buy tickets.

Then, I need to choose q days, buy x_i tickets on each chosen day, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

The total cost would be sum x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i and j is chosen).

This seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a subset of days, and for each day, buying some tickets, with the price on that day being a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous chosen days.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Let’s consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over all tickets of the price at the time they are bought.

Each ticket bought on day i has a price of a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, each of these tickets costs a_i plus the sum of all x_j for j < i.

Therefore, the cost for day i is x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i).

So, total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i), with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

This seems similar to assigning a cost to each ticket based on the day it's bought and the accumulated sum of previous purchases.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that the minimal cost would be achieved by buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the price increases.

But I need to factor in that buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days.

So, there's a trade-off: buying on a day with a low a_i but potentially increasing the prices for future purchases.

Wait, perhaps I should prioritize buying on days with the lowest a_i minus the sum of x_j for j < i.

But since sum x_j for j < i is not known in advance, this is tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of days q on which I buy tickets.

Then, I choose q days, and on each chosen day, buy some x_i tickets, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

The total cost would be sum x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i and j is chosen).

This still seems too complex.

Is there a better way to approach this?

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into selecting q days, and assigning x_i tickets to each, with constraints, and minimizing the total cost based on the accumulated sum.

This seems like a minimum cost assignment problem, but I need a more efficient way to compute it.

Given the constraints on n and k, I need an O(n log n) or O(n) solution.

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases.

Wait, but the price on cheaper days would be increased by the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, maybe sorting the days in increasing order of a_i and then buying as much as possible on those days could lead to a greedy solution.

Let me try this approach.

Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, process the days in this order, buying as many tickets as possible on each day until k tickets are bought.

However, I need to consider that buying on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

Wait, but in the sorted order, the subsequent days may not be the original subsequent days.

This seems confusing.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is achieved by buying on the days with the lowest a_i, but taking into account the price increases due to previous purchases.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal cost can be achieved by selecting q days with the lowest a_i, and buying as many tickets as possible on those days, considering the constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the sample input.

In the first test case, n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sorted a: [2,4,6,8]

So, the cheapest day is day4 with a=2, then day3 with a=4, etc.

If I buy 1 ticket on day3 (a=4, cost=4), and 2 tickets on day4 (a=2 +1=3, cost=6), total 10.

This matches the sample output.

Alternatively, buying 2 on day4 first (a=2, cost=4), then day3 (a=4+2=6, cost=6), total 10.

Wait, but in the note, they bought 1 on day3 and 2 on day4.

But in this case, both orders give the same total cost.

Wait, but according to the note, they bought 1 on day3 and 2 on day4 for total 10.

So, seems like buying on the cheapest days, in any order, gives the minimal cost.

Wait, but in this case, buying on the cheapest days directly gives the minimal cost.

Is this always true?

Let me check another sample.

Second test case: n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sorted a: [2,4,6,8]

To buy 8 tickets, with m=2 per day.

If I buy 2 on day4 (a=2, cost=4), then day3 (a=4+2=6, cost=12), day2 (a=6+2=8, cost=16), day1 (a=8+2=10, cost=20), total 4+12+16+20=52.

But the sample output is 64.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, m=2, k=8, n=4.

So, need to buy 2 tickets per day on all 4 days.

Option 1: Buy 2 on day1 (a=8, cost=16), prices for remaining days increase by 2.

So, day2 a=6+2=8, cost=16.

Day3 a=4+2=6, cost=12.

Day4 a=2+2=4, cost=8.

Total: 16+16+12+8=52.

But sample output is 64.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, sample output is 64.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days more.

Let me recast this.

If I buy 2 on day1 (a=8, cost=16), then prices for day2-4 become [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6].

Then, buy 2 on day2 (cost=20), prices for day3-4 become [10+2=12, 6+2=8].

Buy 2 on day3 (cost=16), prices for day4 become [8+2=10].

Buy 2 on day4 (cost=10), total 16+20+16+10=62.

Still not matching the sample output of 64.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, if I buy 2 on day1 (cost 16), prices for day2-4 become [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6].

Buy 2 on day2 (cost 16), prices for day3-4 become [10+2=12, 6+2=8].

Buy 2 on day3 (cost 16), prices for day4 become [8+2=10].

Buy 2 on day4 (cost 10), total 16+16+16+10=58.

Still not 64.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when you buy on a day, the price increase applies to all subsequent days, including those already adjusted.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, when I buy x on day i, from day i+1 onwards, prices increase by x.

So, in the second test case:

Buy 2 on day1 (cost 16), prices for day2-4 become [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6].

Buy 2 on day2 (cost 20), prices for day3-4 become [10+2=12, 6+2=8].

Buy 2 on day3 (cost 24), prices for day4 become [12+2=14].

Buy 2 on day4 (cost 14), total 16+20+24+14=74.

Still not 64.

Wait, perhaps I need to buy in a different order.

Let me try buying on the cheapest days first.

Sort days by a_i: day4 (2), day3 (4), day2 (6), day1 (8).

Buy 2 on day4 (a=2, cost=4), prices for day4 only, as no future days.

Wait, but in this case, buying on day4 doesn't affect other days since there are no days after it.

Then, buy 2 on day3 (a=4+2=6, cost=12), prices for day4 become 2+2=4.

Then, buy 2 on day2 (a=6+4=10, cost=20), prices for day3 and day4 become 6+2=8 and 4+2=6.

Wait, but day3 already had a price increase from previous purchases.

This is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be calculated as sum over all tickets of the price at the time they are bought.

Each ticket bought on day i has a price of a_i plus the sum of x_j for all j < i.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, each costing a_i plus sum x_j for j < i.

So, the cost for day i is x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i).

This seems similar to assigning a cost to each ticket based on the day it's bought and the accumulated sum of previous purchases.

This is still tricky to minimize directly.

Let me consider that the minimal total cost is achieved by assigning the earliest (in terms of accumulated sum) tickets to the days with the lowest a_i.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and assign as many tickets as possible to the earliest chosen days.

Wait, maybe it's better to choose the q days with the lowest a_i and assign tickets accordingly.

But I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me consider that the optimal solution involves selecting q days to buy tickets, where q is minimized, and buying as many tickets as possible on those days.

But I need to find a way to calculate q.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that q is the smallest integer such that m*q >= k.

Because if I can buy m tickets per day, I need at least ceil(k/m) days to buy k tickets.

So, q = ceil(k/m).

Then, I need to choose q days with the smallest a_i, and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, that seems promising.

Let me think about it.

If I need to buy k tickets, and I can buy up to m per day, then the minimal number of days I need is q = ceil(k/m).

Then, I should choose the q days with the smallest a_i, and assign tickets to those days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But I need to consider that buying on a day increases the prices for all subsequent days.

Wait, but if I choose q days, and assign x_i tickets to each, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m, then the total cost would be sum x_i * (a_i + sum x_j for j < i and j is chosen).

This still seems complex.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the q chosen days in increasing order of a_i, and then assign as many tickets as possible to the earliest chosen days.

Wait, maybe I can model this as assigning tickets to the q chosen days in a specific order.

This is getting too involved.

Let me consider that the minimal total cost is achieved by selecting q = ceil(k/m) days with the smallest a_i, and then buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining tickets on the q-th day.

Then, the total cost would be sum over the q days of m * (a_i + s_{i-1}), where s_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j < i.

But s_{i-1} would be m*(i-1) for the i-th day.

Wait, no, s_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j < i and j is chosen.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix q = ceil(k/m).

Then, choose the q days with the smallest a_i.

Sort these q days in increasing order of a_i.

Let’s say these days have a_i1 <= a_i2 <= ... <= a_iq.

Then, assign m tickets to the first q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) tickets to the q-th day.

Then, the total cost would be:

sum over j from 1 to q-1 of m * (a_ij + m*(j-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_iq + m*(q-1))

Wait, this might be a way to calculate it.

Let me see.

Suppose q = ceil(k/m).

Sort the q smallest a_i.

Assign m tickets to the first q-1 days.

Assign k - m*(q-1) tickets to the q-th day.

Then, the total cost would be:

sum over j from 1 to q-1 of m * (a_ij + m*(j-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_iq + m*(q-1))

Wait, is this correct?

Let’s see with the first sample input.

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

q = ceil(3/2) = 2

Sort the 2 smallest a_i: 2 and 4.

Assign m=2 to the first day (a=2), cost: 2*(2 + 0) = 4

Assign k - m*(q-1) = 3 - 2*1 =1 to the second day (a=4), cost: 1*(4 + 2*1) = 6

Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

q = ceil(8/2) = 4

Sort the 4 smallest a_i: 2,4,6,8

Assign m=2 to the first q-1=3 days:

Day1: a=2, cost: 2*(2 + 0) = 4

Day2: a=4, cost: 2*(4 + 2*1) = 12

Day3: a=6, cost: 2*(6 + 2*2) = 20

Day4: a=8, cost: (8 - 2*3)=2*(8 + 2*3) = 2*14 = 28

Wait, k=8, m=2, q=4, so assign 2 to each of the 4 days.

Total cost: 4 + 12 + 20 + 28 = 64, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in my earlier calculations, I got different totals, but this seems correct.

So, this seems to be a valid approach.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate q = ceil(k/m)

2. Select the q smallest a_i

3. Sort these q a_i in increasing order

4. Assign m tickets to the first q-1 days

5. Assign k - m*(q-1) tickets to the q-th day

6. Calculate the total cost based on the formula above

This seems to work for the sample inputs.

Let me verify with another sample.

Third sample: n=5, m=100, k=1, a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

q = ceil(1/100) =1

Select the smallest a_i: 1

Assign 1 ticket to this day, cost: 1*(1 + 0) = 1, which matches the sample output.

Fourth sample: n=6, m=3, k=9, a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

q = ceil(9/3) =3

Select the 3 smallest a_i: all are 5, since all are equal.

Assign 3 to each of the 3 days.

Total cost: 3*(5 + 0) + 3*(5 + 3*1) + 3*(5 + 3*2) = 15 + 24 + 33 = 72, which matches the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, let's formalize this.

Given q = ceil(k/m)

Select the q smallest a_i.

Sort these q a_i in increasing order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= aq

Assign m tickets to the first q-1 days.

Assign k - m*(q-1) tickets to the q-th day.

Then, the total cost is:

sum over j from 1 to q-1 of m * (aj + m*(j-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (aq + m*(q-1))

This seems to be the formula to calculate the minimal total cost.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 3e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, we need an efficient implementation.

We can proceed as follows:

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read the array a of size n

- Calculate q = ceil(k/m)

- If q > n, handle it appropriately, but since we have to select q days, and q can be up to n, but in reality, q <= n, as we can't select more days than available.

- But actually, q can be larger than n, but in that case, we need to select all n days and buy as many as possible.

- Wait, but m is up to 1e9 and k up to 1e9, so q can be up to 1e9, but n is only up to 3e5, so we need to handle q > n.

- In that case, we need to select all n days, and buy m tickets on each of the n days, and then buy the remaining tickets on the last day.

- Wait, but according to the problem, n can be up to 3e5, and q can be up to 1e9, but since q = ceil(k/m), and m can be up to 1e9, q can be up to 1e9, but n is only up to 3e5.

- So, if q <= n, we select q smallest a_i.

- If q > n, we select all n days, and buy m tickets on each of the first n - (q - n) days, and m on the remaining days.

- Wait, this seems confused.

- Wait, if q > n, it means we need to select more days than available, which is not possible, so we need to select all n days and buy m tickets per day, and adjust for the remaining tickets.

- Wait, but m is the maximum per day, so if q > n, we need to select all n days and buy m per day, and still, it might not be enough if n*m < k, but according to the problem, k <= min(n*m, 1e9), so it's guaranteed that k <= n*m.

- Wait, no, the problem says k <= min(n*m, 1e9), so n*m >=k always.

- So, q = ceil(k/m), and q <= n, because n*m >=k.

- Wait, no, n*m can be larger than k, but q can be larger than n if m is small and n is small, but according to k <= n*m, it's possible.

- Wait, no, q = ceil(k/m), and n can be less than q.

- But, in that case, we need to select all n days, and buy m per day on n-1 days, and the remaining on the last day.

- Wait, but the problem allows us to select up to n days, and buy up to m per day, and total k tickets.

- So, if q <= n, we select q days with the smallest a_i, and assign m to the first q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) to the q-th day.

- If q > n, we select all n days, buy m per day on n-1 days, and k - m*(n-1) on the n-th day.

- But, according to k <= n*m, it's always possible to buy k tickets.

- So, in implementation, we need to handle both cases.

- But in the earlier samples, q <= n.

- Let me confirm with an example where q > n.

Suppose n=2, m=1, k=3, a=[1,2]

q = ceil(3/1) =3

But n=2, so we need to select all 2 days, buy m=1 on each, total 2 <3, which violates k <=n*m.

But according to the problem, k <= min(n*m,1e9), so in this case, k <=2*1=2, so k=1 or 2.

So, q <=n in all cases.

Hence, q <=n always.

Therefore, we can safely proceed by selecting q smallest a_i, sorting them, assigning m to the first q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) to the q-th day.

Then, calculate the total cost using the formula.

Now, in terms of implementation, since q can be up to n, and n up to 3e5, we need an efficient way to select the q smallest a_i.

We can do this by sorting the array a, taking the first q elements, sorting them again in increasing order, and then applying the formula.

But, to optimize, since we need the q smallest a_i, we can use a partial sort or a heap to get the q smallest elements, then sort those q elements.

In Python, it's efficient enough for n up to 3e5.

Now, let's see the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

M = list(map(int, input().split()))

(n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])

m = min(m, k)

M.sort()

q = int(math.ceil(k / m))

N = M[:q]

n = len(N)

if n * m == k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu = k - (n - 1) * m

cost = mu * w

n = len(N)

cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu

print(cost)

continue

So, it reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read the array a (M)

- Set m = min(m, k), which is correct because we can't buy more than m per day, and m is at least 1.

- Sort the array a (M.sort())

- Calculate q = ceil(k/m)

- Take the first q elements from the sorted M (N = M[:q])

- If n*m ==k, calculate cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 )

- Else, pop the last element w from N, set mu = k - (n-1)*m

- cost = mu*w + m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 ) + n*m*mu

- Print the cost

Let me verify if this matches the logic I derived.

From my earlier reasoning:

- Select q smallest a_i

- Sort these q a_i in increasing order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= aq

- Assign m to the first q-1 days

- Assign k - m*(q-1) to the q-th day

- Total cost: sum over j=1 to q-1 of m*(aj + m*(j-1)) + (k - m*(q-1))*(aq + m*(q-1))

Now, in the code:

- It sorts M (a) in increasing order and takes the first q elements as N.

- If n*m ==k, which means k is exactly m*(q-1) + m, i.e., q*m =k

- Then, cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 )

- Else, it pops w (which is the largest in N, since N is sorted in ascending order)

- Sets mu = k - (n-1)*m

- cost = mu*w + m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 ) + n*m*mu

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

Let me see.

In my formula:

cost = sum over j=1 to q-1 of m*(aj + m*(j-1)) + mu*(aq + m*(q-1))

Which is:

m*sum(a1 to a_{q-1}) + m*m*(0 + 1 + ... + (q-2)) + mu*(aq + m*(q-1))

Now, sum of 0 to q-2 is (q-1)*(q-2)/2

So, cost = m*sum(a1 to a_{q-1}) + m*m*(q-1)*(q-2)/2 + mu*(aq + m*(q-1))

Now, in the code:

If n*m ==k:

cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 )

Else:

w = N.pop() # which is aq

mu = k - (n-1)*m

cost = mu*w + m*sum(N) + m*m*( (n-1)*n//2 ) + n*m*mu

Comparing with my formula:

- In the equal case, q*m =k, so mu =0, which is handled separately.

- In the else case, mu = k - m*(q-1)

- So, the cost in the else case is:

mu*a_q + m*sum(a1 to a_{q-1}) + m*m*( (q-1)*(q-2)/2 ) + q*m*mu

Wait, in the code, n = len(N), which is q-1 after popping w.

Wait, no, in the else case, N has q elements, w is popped, so N has q-1 elements.

Then, n = len(N) = q-1

So, cost = mu*w + m*sum(N) + m*m*( (q-1)*(q-2)/2 ) + (q-1)*m*mu

Comparing with my formula:

m*sum(a1 to a_{q-1}) + m*m*(q-1)*(q-2)/2 + mu*(aq + m*(q-1))

In the code:

mu*w + m*sum(N) + m*m*( (q-1)*(q-2)//2 ) + (q-1)*m*mu

Which is:

m*sum(a1 to a_{q-1}) + m*m*(q-1)*(q-2)/2 + mu*a_q + (q-1)*m*mu

Now, in my formula, it's mu*(a_q + m*(q-1)) = mu*a_q + mu*m*(q-1)

But in the code, it's mu*a_q + (q-1)*m*mu

Wait, (q-1)*m*mu vs mu*m*(q-1)

Wait, they are the same.

So, the code's cost calculation matches my formula.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost to purchase a specified number of tickets across multiple days, considering constraints on daily purchases and dynamic price increases.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with daily constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased.
   - Each day has a base price for tickets, and purchasing tickets on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

2. **Insight**:
   - To minimize the total cost, it is optimal to buy tickets on the days with the lowest base prices.
   - We need to calculate the minimal cost considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the number of days required to buy all tickets (`q = ceil(k
