Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are specific conditions about who comes to the party based on who gets invited. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

So, Monocarp has n friends, and he wants at least 2 of them to come to the party. Each friend has a best friend, and these best friends are specified in the list p, where p_i is the best friend of the i-th friend. The conditions are that for a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation. Also, all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, which means no one is their own best friend, and each friend has a unique best friend.

First, I need to understand the relationship between friends and their best friends. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this forms a kind of matching or pairing among friends. However, it's not necessarily a perfect matching because n could be odd, but since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, it means that the best friendships are pairwise unique.

Let me consider some examples to grasp this better.

Example 1:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

In this case:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

So, if I invite friend 1 and 3, friend 1 will come because both 1 and 3 are invited, and friend 3 will come because both 3 and 2 are invited. But wait, friend 3's best friend is 2, who is also invited, so friend 3 will come, and friend 1's best friend is 3, who is invited, so friend 1 will come. So, both will come. But the example in the problem says that if you invite 4 and 5, then friends 4 and 5 will come because each is the best friend of the other.

Wait, in the problem's example, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 2, 4, and 5 come. Wait, friend 4's best friend is 5, who is invited, so friend 4 comes, and friend 5's best friend is 4, who is invited, so friend 5 comes. Friend 2's best friend is 1, who is not invited, so friend 2 does not come. So, only friends 4 and 5 come. But in the problem's explanation, it says friends 2, 4, and 5 will come. Maybe I misread.

Wait, let's check the problem again.

"In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 , for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2 have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3 won't come since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 , and both of them will attend."

Okay, so in the first testcase, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, as explained.

In the second testcase, inviting 1, 2, and 3 makes friends 1 and 2 come, but not friend 3, because friend 3's best friend is 4, who isn't invited.

In the third testcase, inviting 1 and 2 makes both come, since each is the other's best friend.

So, the goal is to minimize the number of invitations sent while ensuring that at least 2 friends come to the party.

I need to find the minimal number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Let me think about the structure of the problem.

Given that p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this means that the best friendships form a permutation of the friends where no one is mapped to themselves.

This permutation can be decomposed into cycles. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, these cycles are disjoint cycles of length at least 2.

For example, in the first testcase:

p = [3,1,2,5,4]

This can be seen as:

1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle of length 3)

4 -> 5 -> 4 (cycle of length 2)

So, two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

In the second testcase:

p = [2,3,4,1]

2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 (one cycle of length 4)

In the third testcase:

p = [2,1]

1 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle of length 2)

So, cycles are important here.

Now, let's think about how to minimize the number of invitations.

Each friend comes to the party if both they and their best friend are invited.

But their best friend is another specific friend, not necessarily the one who comes.

Wait, in the problem statement:

"The i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

So, friend i comes if both friend i and friend p_i are invited. But friend p_i may or may not come, depending on whether both p_i and p_{p_i} are invited.

Wait, but the problem says that friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited, regardless of whether p_i comes or not.

So, the coming of friends is only directly dependent on whether they and their best friend are invited.

There is no chain effect beyond that.

So, in the first testcase, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come, because each is the best friend of the other.

Inviting 1 and 3 makes friend 1 come, and inviting 1 and 2 makes friend 2 come, etc.

Wait, but in the second testcase, inviting 1,2,3 makes friends 1 and 2 come, but not friend 3, because friend 3's best friend is 4, who isn't invited.

So, it's only direct: friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

No indirect effects beyond that.

So, to minimize the number of invitations while ensuring at least 2 friends come, I need to find a set of invitations such that at least 2 friends have both themselves and their best friend invited.

I need to minimize the size of this set.

Let me consider different scenarios.

First, if there are two friends who are each other's best friends, i.e., p_i = j and p_j = i, then inviting both i and j will make both come. In this case, the number of invitations is 2.

In the third testcase, p = [2,1], which is a cycle of length 2, so inviting both 1 and 2 makes both come.

In the first testcase, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle of length 2: 4 and 5 are each other's best friends. So, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come.

In the second testcase, p = [2,3,4,1], which is a single cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

In this cycle, there are no two friends who are each other's best friends directly; each friend's best friend is another in the cycle.

So, in this case, to make at least two friends come, I need to invite a set where at least two friends have both themselves and their best friend invited.

In the second testcase, inviting 1,2,3 makes friends 1 and 2 come.

Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

Friend 3 does not come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited.

So, with 3 invitations, at least 2 friends come.

Is it possible to do with 2 invitations?

Let's see:

If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 2 does not come.

Wait, no. According to the condition, friend 2 comes only if both 2 and p_2=3 are invited. But 3 is not invited, so friend 2 does not come.

So, only friend 1 comes.

If I invite 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 comes if 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited, so friend 3 does not come.

So, only friend 2 comes.

If I invite 3 and 4:

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 4 are invited.

- Friend 4 comes if 4 and 1 are invited, but 1 is not invited, so friend 4 does not come.

So, only friend 3 comes.

If I invite 1 and 4:

- Friend 1 comes if 1 and 2 are invited, but 2 is not invited, so friend 1 does not come.

- Friend 4 comes if 4 and 1 are invited.

So, only friend 4 comes.

So, with any two invitations, only one friend comes, which is not enough.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

So, in cycles of even length, like the third testcase with cycle length 2, inviting 2 friends is enough.

In cycles of odd length, like the first testcase with a cycle of length 3, inviting 2 friends might be enough if they are a pair.

Wait, in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 3 and one of length 2.

Inviting 2 friends from the cycle of length 3 can make 1 friend come, and inviting 2 from the cycle of length 2 makes 2 friends come.

But in the first testcase, the answer is 2, which corresponds to inviting from the cycle of length 2.

So, in general, if there are cycles of length 2, inviting 2 friends from that cycle is enough.

If there are only cycles of longer length, inviting 3 friends might be necessary, as in the second testcase.

Wait, but in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 3 and one of length 2, and the minimal number is 2.

In the second testcase, there is only one cycle of length 4, and the minimal number is 3.

In the third testcase, there is one cycle of length 2, and the minimal number is 2.

So, it seems that if there exists a cycle of length 2, then the minimal number is 2, else it's 3.

Wait, but in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, and the minimal number is 2.

In the second testcase, there is only a cycle of length 4, and the minimal number is 3.

In the third testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, and the minimal number is 2.

So, it seems that if there is a cycle of length 2, then 2 invitations are enough, else 3 are needed.

But in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, and indeed, 2 invitations suffice.

In the second testcase, no cycle of length 2, and 3 invitations are needed.

In the third testcase, cycle of length 2, and 2 invitations suffice.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2, else 3.

But wait, in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 3 and one of length 2, and 2 invitations suffice.

In the second testcase, only a cycle of length 4, and 3 invitations are needed.

So, perhaps, in general, for cycles of even length, 2 invitations suffice, and for cycles of odd length, 3 are needed.

Wait, but in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 3 (odd) and one of length 2 (even), and 2 invitations suffice.

Wait, maybe it's about selecting a pair where p_i = j and p_j = i, which is a cycle of length 2.

If such a pair exists, then inviting those two makes both come, so minimal invitations are 2.

If no such pair exists, then need to invite 3 friends in a way that at least two of them come.

In the second testcase, no such pair exists, so need to invite 3.

In the first testcase, such a pair exists (4 and 5), so inviting them makes both come.

In the third testcase, 1 and 2 are a pair, inviting them makes both come.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2, else 3.

But in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, so 2 invitations suffice.

In the second testcase, no cycle of length 2, so 3 invitations are needed.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there is a cycle of length 2, else 3.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me think about a cycle of length 4.

Suppose n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]

So, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1

In this case, inviting any two adjacent friends, say 1 and 2, doesn't make both come, because friend 2 needs 3 to be invited as well.

So, inviting 1,2: friend 1 comes only if 2 is invited, which is true, but friend 2 needs 3 to be invited, which is not, so only friend 1 comes.

Inviting 1 and 3: friend 1 needs 2 to be invited, which is not, so friend 1 doesn't come; friend 3 needs 4 to be invited, which is not, so friend 3 doesn't come; so no one comes.

Inviting 1 and 4: friend 1 needs 2 to be invited, which is not, so friend 1 doesn't come; friend 4 needs 1 to be invited, which is true, but friend 1 doesn't come because 2 is not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

Inviting 2 and 3: friend 2 needs 3 to be invited, which is true, so friend 2 comes; friend 3 needs 4 to be invited, which is not, so friend 3 doesn't come; hence only friend 2 comes.

Inviting 2 and 4: friend 2 needs 3 to be invited, which is not, so friend 2 doesn't come; friend 4 needs 1 to be invited, which is true, but friend 1 needs 2 to be invited, which is true, but friend 2 isn't coming because 3 isn't invited, so friend 1 doesn't come; hence only friend 4 comes.

Inviting 3 and 4: friend 3 needs 4 to be invited, which is true, but friend 4 needs 1 to be invited, which is not, so friend 3 doesn't come; friend 4 doesn't come for the same reason.

So, with any two invitations, at most one friend comes.

With three invitations, for example, inviting 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 needs 4 to be invited, which is not, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- Friend 4 needs 1 to be invited, which is true, but friend 4 doesn't come because friend 1 doesn't come (since friend 2 is not coming, as friend 3 isn't invited, which is not necessary for friend 1's coming).

Wait, no. Friend 1 comes because both 1 and 2 are invited, regardless of whether friend 2 comes or not.

Similarly, friend 2 comes because both 2 and 3 are invited.

But in this case, friend 2 doesn't come because friend 3 isn't coming, but according to the problem, friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited, regardless of whether friend 3 comes or not.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"The i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

So, friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited, regardless of whether p_i comes or not.

So, in the second testcase, if I invite 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes if 1 and 2 are invited: yes, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2 comes if 2 and 3 are invited: yes, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 4 are invited: 3 is invited, 4 is not invited, so friend 3 does not come.

- Friend 4 comes if 4 and 1 are invited: 4 is not invited, so friend 4 does not come.

So, with invitations to 1,2,3, friends 1 and 2 come.

Similarly, in the first testcase, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come.

In the third testcase, inviting 1 and 2 makes both come.

So, in cycles of even length, inviting two friends who are each other's best friends makes both come.

In cycles of odd length, such pairs don't exist, so need to invite three friends to make at least two come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2, else 3.

But in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, so 2 invitations suffice.

In the second testcase, no cycle of length 2, so 3 invitations are needed.

In the third testcase, cycle of length 2, so 2 invitations suffice.

Therefore, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2 in the permutation, else 3.

Hence, in the program, we need to check if there exists a cycle of length 2.

But in the first testcase, there is a cycle of length 2, so output 2.

In the second testcase, no cycle of length 2, so output 3.

In the third testcase, cycle of length 2, so output 2.

So, the program seems to be checking for the existence of a cycle of length 2.

Looking at the program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

i = 0

j = 0

while i <= n - 1:

p = l[i]

q = l[p - 1]

if q == i + 1:

print(2)

j = 1

break

i += 1

if j == 0:

print(3)

It reads t test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list p.

Then, it iterates through each friend i from 0 to n-1.

For each i, it gets p_i and then q = p_{p_i}, i.e., p_{p_i}.

If q == i + 1, which means p_{p_i} == i + 1, meaning that p_p_i = i + 1, which implies that i and p_i are a pair: p_i is the best friend of i, and p_p_i is the best friend of p_i, which should be i.

So, if p_p_i == i, then i and p_i form a cycle of length 2.

Hence, if such a pair exists, it prints 2 and sets j=1, breaks the loop.

If no such pair is found after checking all i, it prints 3.

So, this seems correct based on the earlier reasoning.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{2}}\]
