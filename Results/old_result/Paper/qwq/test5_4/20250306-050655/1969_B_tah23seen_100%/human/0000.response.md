Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. So, for example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the substring "10". If I perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01". The cost for this operation is 2, since the substring length is 2.

Another example: "110". A cyclic shift would make it "011". Cost is 3.

So, essentially, each cyclic shift can change the order of the substring in a specific way, and I can do this multiple times to different substrings to eventually get the whole string sorted.

Now, I need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

Input: 10

Output: 2

Explanation: Perform a cyclic shift on the entire string "10" to get "01", which is sorted. Cost is 2.

Second test case:

Input: 0000

Output: 0

Explanation: Already sorted, so no operations needed.

Third test case:

Input: 11000

Output: 9

Explanation: Perform three operations, each costing 3, to get to "00011".

So, seems like the cost is the sum of the lengths of the substrings you choose to shift.

I need to find the most efficient way to do this, minimizing the total cost.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to count how many '1's are before '0's in the string, because those are the ones that need to be moved to make the string sorted.

But, since the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, I need to think about how to use this operation to move the '1's past the '0's.

Wait, in a cyclic shift, moving the last character to the front can change the order in a specific way.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can effectively move the last character of the substring to the front, which might help in reordering the substring.

But, this seems a bit too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

In the final sorted string, all '0's should be before any '1'.

So, for each '1' that is before a '0', I need to find a way to move that '1' past the '0's.

Each cyclic shift can be seen as moving the last character of the substring to the front.

Wait, maybe I can model this as inversion counts or something similar.

But inversion counts measure the number of pairs that are out of order, but here I need to fix the order with specific operations.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of bubble sort, where each swap corresponds to a certain cost.

But in this case, the operation is not a swap, it's a cyclic shift of a substring.

Hmm.

Let me consider the properties of the operation.

When I perform a cyclic shift on a substring, I'm essentially rotating it by one position.

For example, "110" -> "011".

So, each operation can fix certain inconsistencies in the string.

I need to find a sequence of such operations that, when composed, result in the string being sorted, and the total cost is minimized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation can be used to move a '1' past a '0' if they are adjacent.

Wait, but in a cyclic shift of a substring, I might be able to affect multiple characters at once.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the number of '1's that are to the left of any '0', because those '1's need to be moved to the right of all '0's.

Wait, but in the operation, I can choose any substring and perform a cyclic shift on it.

Maybe I can think about the positions where the string is not sorted, and see how to fix those positions with minimal cost.

Let me consider that in the final sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, I can find the position where the first '1' appears in the sorted string, and make sure that all '0's are before that position.

But I need to do this with the given operation.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of '1's encountered so far, and whenever I see a '0', if there are '1's before it, I need to move those '1's past this '0'.

But how does that translate into the operation of cyclic shift?

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as moving '1's to the right and '0's to the left, and calculate the cost based on how many positions each needs to be moved.

But again, the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, which isn't directly equivalent to moving individual characters.

This is confusing.

Let me look at the sample input again.

First test case: "10" -> "01" with cost 2.

Second test case: "0000" is already sorted, cost 0.

Third test case: "11000" -> "00011" with cost 9.

Wait, in the third test case, they performed three operations, each of cost 3.

Is there a better way to do it with fewer operations or lower total cost?

Wait, no, according to the problem, 9 is the minimum cost for that test case.

Okay, so perhaps my initial thought is correct.

Let me consider that for each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0', it costs a certain amount.

But I need to find a way to group these operations efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of blocks.

Let me consider the string and find runs of '1's and '0's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the left and keep track of the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have the string "11000".

In the sorted string, it should be "00011".

So, I need to move the first two '1's past the three '0's.

Each time I move a '1' past a '0', it costs something.

But in the operation, I can cyclically shift a substring, which might allow me to move multiple '1's at once.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the cost as the number of positions each '1' needs to be moved past '0's.

But I need to find a way to group these movements to minimize the total cost.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe dynamic programming could be used here, where I keep track of the state of the string and the operations performed.

But that might be too slow, considering the constraints.

The constraints are t <= 10^4 test cases, and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, per test case, the string length can be up to 2*10^5, but since t is 10^4, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

Wait, the code given is:

t = int(input())

while t:

s = input()

print(func_1(s))

t = t - 1

def func_1(s):

cost = 0

one = 0

for i in s:

if i == '1':

one += 1

elif i == '0' and one > 0:

cost += one + 1

return cost

So, this function iterates through the string, counts the number of '1's encountered, and whenever a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it, it adds "one + 1" to the cost.

Wait, let's see with the first test case: "10"

- i=0, s[0]='1', one=1, cost=0

- i=1, s[1]='0', one=1 >0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

So, cost=2, which matches the sample output.

Second test case: "0000"

- i=0, '0', one=0, cost=0

- i=1, '0', one=0, cost=0

- i=2, '0', one=0, cost=0

- i=3, '0', one=0, cost=0

So, cost=0, matches the sample.

Third test case: "11000"

- i=0, '1', one=1, cost=0

- i=1, '1', one=2, cost=0

- i=2, '0', one=2>0, cost += 2 +1 =3

- i=3, '0', one=2>0, cost +=2 +1=3, total cost=6

- i=4, '0', one=2>0, cost +=2 +1=3, total cost=9

Which matches the sample output.

Okay, so the function seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But is this the correct approach?

Let me try to understand what this function is doing.

It's iterating through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered so far in the variable 'one'.

When it encounters a '0', and there are '1's before it (i.e., one > 0), it adds "one + 1" to the cost.

So, for each '0' that has '1's before it, it adds the number of '1's before it plus one to the cost.

Why is it adding "one + 1"?

Is there a specific reason for adding one extra to the cost?

Wait, perhaps for each '0' that needs to be moved past the '1's, it's considering the cost as the number of '1's plus one.

But I need to verify if this is indeed the minimum cost.

Let me consider another example.

Take "101011".

According to the function:

- i=0, '1', one=1, cost=0

- i=1, '0', one=1>0, cost +=1+1=2

- i=2, '1', one=2, cost=2

- i=3, '0', one=2>0, cost +=2+1=3, total cost=5

- i=4, '1', one=3, cost=5

- i=5, '1', one=4, cost=5

So, total cost is 5.

According to the sample input, for "101011", the output is 5, which matches.

Another test case: "01101001"

- i=0, '0', one=0, cost=0

- i=1, '1', one=1, cost=0

- i=2, '1', one=2, cost=0

- i=3, '0', one=2>0, cost +=2+1=3

- i=4, '1', one=3, cost=3

- i=5, '0', one=3>0, cost +=3+1=4, total cost=7

- i=6, '0', one=3>0, cost +=3+1=4, total cost=11

Which matches the sample output of 11.

Okay, so it seems to be working for the sample inputs.

But is this the correct logic?

Let me try to think about what this logic is implementing.

It seems that for each '0' that appears after some '1's, it's costing "one + 1".

Is there a way to interpret this in terms of the operations allowed?

Wait, perhaps each "one + 1" corresponds to performing a cyclic shift on a substring that includes all the '1's before the '0' and the '0' itself.

Wait, let's see.

Take "11000".

- When i=2, '0', one=2, cost +=2+1=3

- When i=3, '0', one=2, cost +=2+1=3, total=6

- When i=4, '0', one=2, cost +=2+1=3, total=9

So, three operations, each costing 3.

Similarly, in "101011":

- i=1, '0', one=1, cost +=1+1=2

- i=3, '0', one=2, cost +=2+1=3, total=5

So, two operations, costing 2 and 3, total 5.

In "01101001":

- i=3, '0', one=2, cost +=2+1=3

- i=5, '0', one=3, cost +=3+1=4, total=7

- i=6, '0', one=3, cost +=3+1=4, total=11

So, three operations, costing 3,4,4, total 11.

But is this the minimal cost?

Looking back at the first test case: "10" -> cost=2.

If I perform a single cyclic shift on the entire string "10" to get "01", cost=2.

That matches the function's output.

In "11000", the function says cost=9.

In the explanation, they perform three operations, each costing 3, total 9.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, let's see.

If I perform a single operation on the entire string "11000":

- Cyclic shift: move the last character '0' to the front, resulting in "01100".

- Cost:5

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110".

- Cost:3, total cost:8

- Finally, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011".

- Cost:3, total cost:11

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, they performed three operations each costing 3, total 9.

But in this sequence, I have total cost 11.

So perhaps there's a better sequence.

Alternatively, perform:

- Operation on substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Operation on substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Operation on substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Total cost:9

So, that matches the sample explanation.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

Suppose I perform:

- Operation on substring [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost:5

- Operation on substring [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost:4

- Operation on substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Total cost:12

Which is higher than 9.

So, 9 seems better.

Alternatively:

- Operation on substring [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost:4

- Operation on substring [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost:4

- Operation on substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Total cost:11

Still higher than 9.

So, 9 seems better.

Is there a way to do it with less than 9?

Suppose I perform:

- Operation on substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Operation on substring [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", cost:4

- Total cost:7

Wait, is that possible?

Let's see:

Original: "11000"

- Operation on [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

- Operation on [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", resulting in "00110"

- Now, perform operation on [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

- Total cost:3 +4 +3=10

Still higher than 9.

Alternatively:

- Operation on [3,5]: "000" -> "000", which doesn't change anything, so that's not useful.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not possible to do better than 9 in this case.

Looking at the function, it adds "one +1" for each '0' that has '1's before it.

In "11000", there are three '0's, each with two '1's before them, so cost = 3*(2+1) = 9.

Which matches the sample explanation.

So, perhaps this is the minimal cost.

Another test case: "101011"

Function says cost=5.

Let's see how to achieve that.

Original: "101011"

- Operation on [1,3]: "101" -> "110", resulting in "110011"

- Operation on [4,6]: "011" -> "101", resulting in "111010"

- Operation on [5,6]: "10" -> "01", resulting in "111001"

- Operation on [4,6]: "001" -> "100", resulting in "111100"

- Total cost:3+3+2+3=11

Wait, but function says cost=5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a better sequence.

Wait, maybe:

- Operation on [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", cost:4

- Operation on [2,5]: "1011" -> "1101", cost:4

- Operation on [3,6]: "0111" -> "1011", cost:4

- Total cost:12

Still higher than 5.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively:

- Operation on [2,3]: "01" -> "10", resulting in "110011"

- Operation on [5,6]: "11" -> "11", no change

- Wait, not helpful.

Wait, maybe:

- Operation on [1,2]: "10" -> "01", resulting in "011011"

- Operation on [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "001111"

- Total cost:2+3=5

Yes, that matches the function's output of 5.

So, it's possible to achieve the same cost as the function suggests.

Hence, perhaps the function is correctly calculating the minimal cost.

Another test case: "01101001"

Function says cost=11.

Let's see:

- Operation on [3,5]: "101" -> "110", cost:3

- Operation on [6,8]: "001" -> "100", cost:3

- Operation on [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Operation on [5,7]: "100" -> "001", cost:3

- Total cost:3+3+3+3=12

Higher than 11.

Alternatively:

- Operation on [4,6]: "010" -> "001", cost:3

- Operation on [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost:4

- Operation on [1,3]: "011" -> "101", cost:3

- Operation on [6,8]: "010" -> "001", cost:3

- Total cost:3+4+3+3=13

Still higher.

Is there a way to do it with cost 11?

Perhaps:

- Operation on [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost:3

- Operation on [5,7]: "100" -> "001", cost:3

- Operation on [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", cost:4

- Total cost:3+3+4=10

Wait, but the function says cost=11.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating.

Wait, maybe:

- Operation on [2,5]: "1101" -> "1011", cost:4

- Operation on [4,7]: "0100" -> "0010", cost:4

- Operation on [6,8]: "010" -> "001", cost:3

- Total cost:4+4+3=11

Which matches the function's output.

So, perhaps the function is correct.

But I still need to understand why it works.

Let me try to think differently.

Each time there is a '0' after some '1's, I need to move those '1's past the '0'.

Each cyclic shift operation can move one '1' past one '0', but in a grouped manner.

Wait, perhaps for each '0' that has '1's before it, I need to pay a cost equal to the number of '1's before it plus one.

But why plus one?

Wait, maybe it's the cost to perform the operation that moves one '1' past one '0'.

But I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's treating each '0' that needs to be moved past '1's as requiring a separate operation, and the cost is the number of '1's plus one.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that moving a '0' past '1's requires shifting the substring that includes all the '1's and the '0', which would cost the length of that substring.

Wait, let's consider:

For each '0' that has '1's before it, the minimal substring that includes all the '1's before it and the '0' itself would have a length equal to the number of '1's plus one ('0').

So, the cost would be "one +1".

Hence, for each such '0', adding "one +1" to the total cost.

This seems to align with the function provided.

In the earlier example, "11000":

- First '0' has two '1's before it, so cost=2+1=3

- Second '0' has two '1's before it, so cost=2+1=3

- Third '0' has two '1's before it, so cost=2+1=3

- Total cost=9

Which matches the sample explanation.

Similarly, in "101011":

- First '0' has one '1' before it, cost=1+1=2

- Second '0' has two '1's before it, cost=2+1=3

- Total cost=5

Which matches the sample.

Hence, it seems that this logic correctly calculates the minimal cost.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
