Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. That's a really big number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, two subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions in the array, even if the elements are the same.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences would include [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3]. That's a total of 8 subsequences. Wait, but according to the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so I should include that as well.

Now, I need to find an array whose number of increasing subsequences is exactly X. Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is a huge number, I need a way to generate arrays that can have a large number of increasing subsequences without making the array too long.

I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is related to the array's structure. Let's consider a simple case first. If the array is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,4,...], then every subset of the array is an increasing subsequence. The total number of subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array, including the empty subsequence.

But wait, in this problem, X can be up to 10^18, and 2^60 is already over 10^18, so an array of length 60 would be sufficient in the best case. But the problem allows up to 200 elements, which is more than enough.

However, the problem is not just to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, but to do so in a way that the array has at most 200 elements. Given that X can be up to 10^18, I need to find a way to represent X as the number of increasing subsequences in an array of integers.

I need to think about how to construct such an array. One way to approach this is to think in terms of binary representation, since 2^n gives the total number of subsets for a set of size n.

Let me consider building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences can be controlled by the positions and values of the elements in the array.

I recall that in combinatorics, the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated using dynamic programming. Maybe I can use that idea here.

Let's think about dynamic programming. If I define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i, then the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i.

Wait, but actually, in the problem, we need to count all increasing subsequences, not just those that end at a particular position. So, perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Another approach is to consider that each increasing subsequence corresponds to a subset of the array where the elements are in strictly increasing order.

Given that, I need to find an array where the number of such subsets is exactly X.

Now, the problem allows elements to be in the range from -10^9 to 10^9, so I have a lot of flexibility in choosing the values.

I need to find a way to construct an array with at most 200 elements such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Let me consider the minimal array size required for a given X.

If I have an array of size n, the maximum number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, which occurs when the array is strictly increasing.

But in this problem, X can be up to 10^18, so n needs to be at least 60, since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18.

But the problem allows up to 200 elements, so that's fine.

However, X can be any number up to 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, I need a way to combine smaller arrays or choose values such that the total number of increasing subsequences adds up to X.

One idea is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle or some form of combination to achieve the desired count.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the array as consisting of several independent parts, each contributing a certain number of increasing subsequences, and then sum them up to get X.

Wait, but subsequences can span across different parts, so that might not work directly.

Let me think differently. Suppose I build the array incrementally, adding one element at a time, and keep track of how the number of increasing subsequences changes.

When I add a new element to the array, it can either be larger than some of the previous elements, in which case it can extend some existing increasing subsequences, or it can be smaller, in which case it might start new subsequences.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of binary representation.

Since 2^60 is around 1.1529215e+18, which covers up to 10^18, I can think of X as a binary number with up to 60 bits.

Now, perhaps I can construct the array such that it has groups of elements that correspond to each bit in the binary representation of X.

For example, for each set bit in X, I can have a group of elements in the array that contributes exactly 2^k increasing subsequences for some k.

Then, by combining these groups, I can achieve the total of X increasing subsequences.

But I need to ensure that these groups are independent, meaning that their contributions don't overlap in a way that affects the total count.

To make them independent, I can ensure that the elements in different groups are not comparable, i.e., no element in one group is greater than an element in another group.

Wait, but if I do that, then subsequences cannot contain elements from different groups, which means the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each group, not the sum.

Hmm, that's not what I want. I need the sum because I want to add up the contributions from each group.

Alternatively, perhaps I can arrange the groups in such a way that the increasing subsequences can span across groups, but it becomes complicated.

Let me think of another approach.

Suppose I have an array that consists of a sequence of decreasing blocks.

For example, the array is divided into several blocks, and each block is decreasing.

In this case, the only increasing subsequences are those that pick at most one element from each block.

Wait, no. If blocks are decreasing, and blocks are placed in order, then the increasing subsequences can pick one element from each block, as long as the chosen elements are in increasing order.

This seems similar to the way we can decompose the array into chains in Dilworth's theorem.

But I'm not sure if this directly helps me.

Let me consider the opposite: have increasing blocks.

If I have increasing blocks, then subsequences can span across blocks, which might not help in controlling the total count.

Wait, maybe I should look for a way to represent X as a sum of certain numbers that correspond to the number of increasing subsequences contributed by different parts of the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be expressed in terms of the number of increasing subsequences in its suffixes or prefixes.

Let me consider defining dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences that include the element at position i.

But I'm not sure.

Maybe I should look for a way to represent X in a way that corresponds to the structure of the array.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as a sequence of elements where each element is larger than all previous elements, but not necessarily larger than the immediate previous one.

In that case, the number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of combinations of these elements.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the example provided in the problem.

For X=2, the output is an array of length 1 with element 0. The number of increasing subsequences is 2: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0].

For X=5, the output is an array of length 3: [0,1,0]. Let's see the increasing subsequences:

- [] (empty)

- [0] (first element)

- [0] (third element)

- [1] (second element)

- [0,1] (first and second elements)

That's 5 increasing subsequences.

Okay, that makes sense.

For X=13, the array is [2,2,3,4,2]. Let's list the increasing subsequences:

- []

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3]

- [2,4]

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4]

- [2] (fifth)

- [2,4]

- [2,3,4]

Wait, but some of these might be duplicates.

Wait, according to the problem, subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

So, [2] (first element) and [2] (fifth element) are considered different.

Similarly, [2,4] where 2 is from the first element and [2,4] where 2 is from the fifth element are different subsequences.

So, for X=13, the array [2,2,3,4,2] has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, for X=37, the array is [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1], which should have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

From these examples, it seems that repeating elements in certain positions allow for a controlled increase in the total number of increasing subsequences.

I need to find a general way to construct such arrays for any X up to 10^18.

Let me think about how to generalize this.

One idea is to use the binary representation of X and construct the array accordingly.

For example, represent X in binary, and for each set bit, have a corresponding group in the array that contributes a specific number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to ensure that these groups don't interfere with each other, meaning that their contributions to the total count are additive.

To make them non-interfering, perhaps I can arrange the array so that elements from different groups are not comparable, i.e., no element from one group is greater than an element from another group.

Wait, but if groups are arranged so that elements from one group are all less than elements from another group, then subsequences can span across groups, which would multiply the counts instead of adding them.

That's not what I want.

Alternatively, if I arrange the array so that elements from different groups are all equal, then subsequences can be formed by choosing elements from different groups without violating the increasing order.

But if elements are equal, then subsequences that include elements from different groups would only be counted if the positions are in order.

Wait, but according to the problem, subsequences are considered different based on their positions, even if the elements are the same.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I have an array where all elements are equal. In this case, the only increasing subsequences are the empty subsequence and the subsequences consisting of a single element.

So, for an array of length n with all elements equal, the number of increasing subsequences is n+1.

This is because all single-element subsequences are increasing, and the empty subsequence.

If I have an array where elements are strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

If I have an array with some elements equal and some increasing, the count would be somewhere in between.

I need a way to combine these to reach exactly X.

Perhaps I can think of the array as consisting of several "levels", where each level corresponds to a certain value, and the number of elements at each level controls the number of subsequences.

Wait, maybe I can model this using stars and bars or some combinatorial construction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all k of the number of increasing subsequences of length k.

But I need a smarter way to construct the array.

Let me consider building the array by adding elements in a specific order, and keeping track of the cumulative number of increasing subsequences.

I can start with an empty array, which has one subsequence: the empty subsequence.

Then, when I add a new element, I can calculate how many new increasing subsequences it introduces.

If I add an element that is larger than all previous elements, it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, thus doubling the number of increasing subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or not include this new element).

Wait, but that's only if the new element is larger than all previous elements.

In that case, the number of increasing subsequences would indeed double, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include the new element at the end or not.

But if the new element is not larger than all previous elements, then it can only extend certain subsequences.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the array as a sequence of elements a1, a2, ..., an.

Let me define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences that end with ai.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i.

To compute dp[i], I can look at all j < i such that a[j] < a[i], and add dp[j] to dp[i].

Also, dp[i] is at least 1, since the subsequence consisting of only ai is increasing.

Wait, but according to the problem, subsequences can include any subset of elements in order, as long as they are strictly increasing.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum over all non-empty subsets of the array where the elements are in strictly increasing order.

Including the empty subsequence, it's 1 plus that sum.

But in the problem, the empty subsequence is included and counts as one.

Wait, but in the example for X=2, with array [0], the number of increasing subsequences is 2: empty and [0].

For X=5, array [0,1,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- []

- [0] (first)

- [0] (third)

- [1]

- [0,1]

That's 5.

So, in this case, the total is 5.

If I think in terms of binary choices, but it's not just binary because of the value constraints.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I build the array incrementally, and at each step, decide what value to add based on how much I need to increase the total number of increasing subsequences.

Let's say I have an array of length k, with a certain number of increasing subsequences, say S_k.

I want to add a new element a_{k+1}, and choose its value such that the new number of increasing subsequences is S_{k+1}, which should be S_k plus the number of new subsequences introduced by a_{k+1}.

The number of new subsequences introduced by a_{k+1} is equal to the number of subsets of the first k elements where a_{k+1} is greater than the last element of the subset.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the values of the array in a specific way, say in a non-decreasing order, and see if I can control the number of increasing subsequences.

If the array is strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty subsequence), but including the empty subsequence, it's 2^n.

But X can be up to 10^18, and 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18, so for X up to 10^18, I would need an array of at most 60 elements to represent X as 2^n.

But the problem allows up to 200 elements, so that's fine.

However, X can be any number up to 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, i.e., its binary representation, and construct the array accordingly.

For example, if X is 5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to 4 + 1, I can have two groups in the array: one group that contributes 4 increasing subsequences and another that contributes 1.

Then, by combining these groups in a way that their contributions add up, I can get a total of 5 increasing subsequences.

But I need to ensure that the contributions from different groups are additive, meaning that subsequences from one group do not interfere with subsequences from another group.

To achieve this, I need to arrange the array so that elements from different groups are not comparable, i.e., no element from one group is greater than an element from another group.

Wait, but if I have two groups where one group has all elements less than all elements in the other group, then increasing subsequences can span across both groups, which would multiply their contributions instead of adding them.

That's not what I want.

Alternatively, if I arrange the groups in a way that elements from different groups are equal, then subsequences that include elements from both groups are only allowed if the positions are in order.

But according to the problem, subsequences are considered different based on their positions, even if the elements are the same.

In the example for X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has two 0's and one 1.

The increasing subsequences are:

- []

- [0] (first)

- [0] (third)

- [1]

- [0,1]

So, in this case, the two 0's are considered separate, even though their values are the same.

This suggests that I can use repeated elements in the array to increase the number of increasing subsequences in a controlled manner.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose I have an array with k elements, where some elements are repeated.

I need to calculate the total number of increasing subsequences, considering that subsequences are different if their positions differ, regardless of the values.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider a smaller example.

Take the array [1,2,1].

The increasing subsequences are:

- []

- [1] (first)

- [2]

- [1] (third)

- [1,2]

So, total of 5 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, for [2,2,3,4,2], as in the example for X=13.

This suggests that having repeated elements allows for multiple subsequences with the same values but different positions.

So, perhaps I can think of the array as having "chains" of elements, where each chain is a sequence of elements that are equal, and arranged in such a way that they contribute to the total count independently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the concept of "independent" contributions from different parts of the array.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that each element in the array can be part of multiple increasing subsequences, depending on the elements that come before it.

If I can arrange the array such that certain elements only extend subsequences from previous groups, and others start new subsequences, I might be able to control the total count.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Specifically, for each position i, I can compute the number of increasing subsequences ending at i by summing up the number of increasing subsequences ending at j for all j < i where a[j] < a[i], plus one for the subsequence that consists only of a[i].

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of these dp[i] values.

Given that, perhaps I can think of building the array incrementally, choosing each new element in a way that adds a specific number of new increasing subsequences.

In other words, for each new element, I can choose its value such that it extends a certain number of existing subsequences.

But I need to choose the value carefully to control the total count.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider the binary representation approach again.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each set bit in X, I have a group in the array that contributes 2^k increasing subsequences for some k.

Then, by choosing these groups appropriately and making sure their contributions add up without overlapping, I can achieve the total of X.

To make the contributions additive, I need to ensure that no subsequence is counted in more than one group.

But in practice, this is tricky because subsequences can involve elements from different parts of the array.

Wait, maybe I can arrange the array so that the groups are separated in such a way that subsequences from one group cannot be extended into another group.

For example, if I have groups where each group has elements in a range
