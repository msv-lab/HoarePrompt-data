Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and at the end, I need to have the maximum possible score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to make sure I get it. Take the first example from the problem:

Input:

3

1

2 3

2

1 1 2 1

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

2

2

3

In the first test case, n=1, so I have two numbers: 2 and 3. I have to choose one pair (which is the only pair possible), take the smaller number, which is 2, and that's my score. So, the output is 2.

In the second test case, n=2, and the numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1. I need to make two moves. One way to do it is to pair 1 and 1 first, get the smaller one, which is 1, add it to the score. Then, pair the remaining 1 and 2, get the smaller one, which is 1 again. So, total score is 2.

Another way could be pairing 1 and 2 first, getting 1, and then pairing the two 1's, getting another 1, totaling 2 again. So, it seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score in this case.

In the third test case, n=3, and all numbers are 1's. So, pairing any two will always give me 1, and since I do this three times, the total score is 3.

From these examples, it seems like the score is determined by always picking the smaller number in each pair, and I need to maximize this sum.

Now, I need to think about how to approach this in general. I have 2n numbers, and I need to pair them in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

One idea is to sort the list in ascending order and then pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on. Let's see if that works.

Take the second test case: numbers are 1,1,2,1. Sorting them gives 1,1,1,2. Pairing the first two (1,1) gives 1, and pairing the next two (1,2) gives 1, total score 2. That matches the example.

In the third test case: all 1's. Pairing any way gives 1 each time, total score 3. Again, matches the example.

In the first test case: 2 and 3. Sorting gives 2,3. Pairing them gives 2. Matches the example.

So, in these cases, sorting and pairing the smallest with the next smallest works.

Is this always optimal? Let's think of a case where this might not be optimal.

Suppose I have numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. So, n=2.

Sorting gives: 1,2,3,4.

Pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, and pairing 3 and 4 gives 3, total score 4.

Is there a better way? If I pair 1 and 3, get min(1,3)=1, and pair 2 and 4, get min(2,4)=2, total score 3.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 4, get 1, and pair 2 and 3, get 2, total score 3.

So, the sorting approach gives a higher score of 4.

Another example: numbers 1, 3, 3, 5.

Sorting: 1,3,3,5.

Pairing 1 and 3 gives 1, pairing 3 and 5 gives 3, total 4.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 5 gives 1, pairing 3 and 3 gives 3, total 4.

Same result.

Another example: 2,3,4,5.

Sorting: 2,3,4,5.

Pairing 2 and 3 gives 2, pairing 4 and 5 gives 4, total 6.

Alternatively, pairing 2 and 4 gives 2, pairing 3 and 5 gives 3, total 5.

So again, sorting and pairing smallest with next smallest gives a higher score.

It seems like this approach is optimal.

But why is this so? Let's think about it.

If I sort the numbers in ascending order, and pair them in order, I'm ensuring that the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest possible numbers, which maximizes the minimum in each pair.

Wait, but actually, in each pair, I'm choosing the smaller number, so to maximize the sum of smaller numbers, I should pair smaller numbers with as large numbers as possible.

Wait, but in the sorting approach, I'm pairing smaller with next smaller.

Is there a conflict here?

Wait, no. Because if I pair the smallest with the next smallest, I'm getting the next smallest as the minimum in the pair, which is larger than pairing it with a larger number.

Wait, in the first pair, I pair the smallest with the next smallest, getting the smallest as the minimum.

But in other pairs, the minimum would be higher.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each pair, the minimum is determined by the smaller number in the pair.

To maximize the sum of these minima, I should pair numbers in such a way that the smaller numbers are paired with larger numbers, but in a way that the sum of the smaller ones is maximized.

Wait, but in the sorting approach, by pairing the smallest with the next smallest, I'm ensuring that the smaller numbers are being minimized in their pairs, but overall, the sum is maximized.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of greedy algorithm.

If I sort the array in ascending order, and then pair the first with the second, third with fourth, and so on, then in each pair, the minimum is the first one in the pair.

Since the array is sorted, the first one in each pair is the smallest possible in that pair, but because the array is sorted, these minima are as large as possible.

Wait, maybe that's the key.

By sorting the array in ascending order and pairing them in order, I'm making sure that the minima in each pair are as large as possible.

Let me see.

Take the array sorted: a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

Pair them as (a1, a2), (a3, a4), ..., (a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}).

In each pair, the minimum is a1, a3, a5, ..., a_{2n-1}.

Is this the maximum possible sum?

Wait, but in the earlier example, with 1,2,3,4, pairing (1,2) and (3,4), minima are 1 and 3, sum is 4.

Is there any other pairing that gives a higher sum?

If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), minima are 1 and 2, sum is 3.

Or (1,4) and (2,3), minima are 1 and 2, sum is 3.

So, the sorting approach gives a higher sum.

Another example: 1,3,3,5.

Pairing (1,3) and (3,5), minima are 1 and 3, sum 4.

Pairing (1,5) and (3,3), minima are 1 and 3, sum 4.

Pairing (1,3) and (3,5), same as above.

So, again, sorting approach gives the same sum.

Seems like sorting and pairing in order is optimal.

Let me try to think of a case where it's not optimal.

Suppose I have 1,1,2,2.

Sorting: 1,1,2,2.

Pairing (1,1) and (2,2), minima are 1 and 2, sum 3.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (1,2), minima are 1 and 1, sum 2.

So, sorting approach gives a higher sum.

Another case: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorting: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pairing (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), minima are 1,3,5, sum 9.

Alternative pairing: (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), minima are 1,2,5, sum 8.

Another pairing: (1,5), (2,6), (3,4), minima are 1,2,3, sum 6.

So, again, sorting approach gives the highest sum.

Seems like sorting and pairing in order is indeed optimal.

I think I can conclude that this approach is correct.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

n = input()

final = []

for num in range(int(n)):

s = 0

list2 = []

a = input()

list1 = []

b = input()

list1 = b.split()

for str in list1:

list2.append(int(str))

list2.sort()

for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):

s = s + int(list2[i])

final.append(s)

for fin in final:

print(fin)

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t, from input.

Then, for each test case:

- It reads n, the number of pairs (not used in the rest of the code).

- It reads the list of 2n numbers.

- It converts the list of strings to integers.

- Sorts the list in ascending order.

- Iterates through the list with a step of 2 and sums up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

- Appends the sum to a list called final.

After processing all test cases, it prints each sum in the final list.

Wait a minute, in the code, it reads 'a' and 'b', but 'a' seems to be n, and 'b' is the list of numbers.

But in the code, it reads 'a = input()' and then 'b = input()', where 'b' contains the list of numbers.

Then, it splits 'b' into list1, converts to integers, sorts, and sums every second element starting from index 0.

This matches the sorting approach we discussed earlier.

Therefore, the program seems to be correctly implementing the optimal strategy.

Let me check with one of the examples.

Take the first test case:

n=1

numbers: 2 3

sorted: 2 3

sum of list2[0] = 2

which matches the expected output.

Second test case:

n=2

numbers: 1 1 2 1

sorted: 1,1,1,2

sum of list2[0] and list2[2] = 1 + 1 = 2

which matches the expected output.

Third test case:

n=3

numbers: 1 1 1 1 1 1

sorted: 1,1,1,1,1,1

sum of list2[0], list2[2], list2[4] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

Another thing to check is if there are any edge cases that might break this approach.

For example, when n=1 and the two numbers are the same.

Say, n=1, numbers: 5 5

sorted: 5 5

sum of list2[0] = 5

which is correct.

Another edge case: n=50, maximum n, with maximum values.

As long as the program can handle n=50 and numbers up to 10^7, which should be fine in Python.

Also, multiple test cases up to t=5000.

In terms of performance, since n<=50 and t<=5000, total operations are acceptable for Python.

No performance issues expected.

Also, the code seems to handle the input correctly, reading t, then for each test case, reading n and then the list of 2n numbers.

Therefore, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
