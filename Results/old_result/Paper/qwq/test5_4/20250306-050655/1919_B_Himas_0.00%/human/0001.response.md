Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate these substrings, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-") multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to split the string optimally to minimize the total penalty.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For any substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive, and the penalty will be that sum times the length. If it has more "-" than "+", the sum will be negative, but since we take the absolute value, it's still the magnitude of the sum times the length. If the sum is zero, meaning equal number of "+" and "-", the penalty is zero for that substring.

So, the total penalty is the sum of these penalties for all substrings in the split.

Now, I need to find the way to split the string into substrings such that this total penalty is minimized.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

Only one possible split: [1]

Penalty: |1| * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 1

Example 2:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

One possible split: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])

Each substring has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 5

Another possible split: ([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1])

Penalty: | -5 | * 5 = 25

Which is worse.

So, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty in this case.

Example 3:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

One possible split: ([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])

First substring: sum = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0, penalty = |0| * 4 = 0

Second substring: sum = 1 -1 = 0, penalty = |0| * 2 = 0

Total penalty: 0

Another possible split: ([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])

First substring: sum = 1 -1 +1 = 1, penalty = |1| * 3 = 3

Second substring: sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1, penalty = |-1| * 3 = 3

Total penalty: 6

So, splitting into substrings that sum to zero is better.

Example 4:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

So, a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

One possible split: ([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])

First substring: sum = -2 +7 = 5, penalty = |5| * 9 = 45

Second substring: sum = -1, penalty = |-1| * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 46

Another split: ([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])

First substring: sum = -2, penalty = |-2| * 2 = 4

Second substring: sum = 6 -1 = 5, penalty = |5| * 8 = 40

Total penalty: 44

Better, but maybe there's a better way.

What if I split where the sum changes direction?

Let's see:

Split into ([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])

First: sum = -2, penalty = 4

Second: sum = 7, penalty = 7 * 7 = 49

Third: sum = -1, penalty = 1

Total: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54, which is worse than the previous split.

Wait, perhaps splitting into more parts isn't always better.

Another idea: try to make substrings where the sum is zero.

In this case, for example, if I could split in a way that some substrings sum to zero, that would be ideal since their penalty is zero.

But in this example, it's not possible to split into substrings that sum to zero.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider the entire array as one substring.

In that case, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the fourth example, sum(a) = -2 +7 -1 = 4, n=10, so penalty = |4| * 10 = 40.

Which is better than some of the previous splits.

Wait, but in the second split I had 4 + 40 = 44, which is worse.

Wait, no, in that split, it was (-1, -1), (1,1,1,1,1,1,1), (-1), with penalties 4 + 40 +1 =45, which is worse than the single substring penalty of 40.

Wait, but in the first split I had (-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1), which is sum=-2+7-1=4, penalty=4*10=40.

So, perhaps, sometimes splitting increases the penalty.

Wait, but in the third example, splitting into substrings that sum to zero gives zero penalty.

So, maybe the optimal strategy is to split the array into substrings where each substring sums to zero, if possible.

But in cases where that's not possible, minimize the penalty by minimizing |sum| * length for each substring.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Let’s define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the substring from the beginning up to position i (inclusive).

Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, I can consider all possible splits before position i.

So, for each j from 0 to i, I can split the substring from j+1 to i+1, and add the penalty of that substring to dp[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + penalty(j+1 to i))

With dp[0] = 0.

But I need to compute the penalty for each substring efficiently.

To compute the sum of a substring from j+1 to i, I can precompute the prefix sums.

Let’s define prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[1] = a[0]

prefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix_sum[k] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]

Then, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j+1]

And the length is i - j

So, penalty(j+1 to i) = |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j+1]| * (i - j)

This seems feasible.

But with n up to 5000, and t up to 1000, the time complexity would be O(n^2 * t), which is 5000^2 * 1000 = 25*10^9 operations, which is way too slow.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Let me consider the properties of the penalty function.

Penalty for a substring is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum over all substrings of |sum| * length.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

One idea is to minimize the product of the absolute sum and the length.

This suggests that it's better to have substrings with small sums or short lengths.

But it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of cumulative sums and look for places to split where the cumulative sum is zero.

But that might not always be possible.

Wait, in the third example, where s = "+-+-+-", the optimal split is into two substrings, each with sum zero.

In that case, the total penalty is zero, which is ideal.

So, if I can split the array into substrings where each substring has a sum of zero, the total penalty would be zero.

But in cases where that's not possible, I need to minimize the sum of |sum| * length for each substring.

Is there a way to group the substrings such that their sums are balanced to minimize the penalty?

I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I don't split the array at all, and consider the whole array as one substring.

Then, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the fourth example, sum(a) = 4, n=10, penalty=40.

In the second example, sum(a)=-5, n=5, penalty=25.

But in the second example, splitting into individual elements gives a better penalty of 5.

Similarly, in the third example, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives penalty zero.

So, the optimal strategy seems to be to split the array into substrings where each substring has a sum as close to zero as possible.

Ideally, sum zero, but if not possible, minimize |sum| * length.

Is there a way to achieve this efficiently?

Let me consider that for a substring with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

I need to minimize the sum of |S_i| * L_i for all substrings in the split.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

Is there a mathematical way to model this?

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as minimizing the sum over all possible substrings of |sum of substring| multiplied by the number of times that substring is considered in the split.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array and keep track of the current sum.

Whenever the sum becomes zero, I can split there, as that would give a substring with zero penalty.

In the third example, the sums accumulate as follows:

Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5

s: + - + - + -

a: 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1

prefix_sum: 1 0 1 0 1 0

So, at indices 1,3,5, the prefix sum is zero.

So, I can split at these points.

If I split into substrings where each substring has a sum of zero, the penalty is zero.

That's perfect.

In this case, I can split into ([1,-1], [1,-1], [1,-1]), each with sum zero and penalty zero.

Total penalty: zero.

In the second example, s = "-----", a = [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], prefix_sum = -1,-2,-3,-4,-5.

No point where the sum is zero.

In this case, splitting into individual elements, each with sum -1 and length 1, penalty 1 each, total penalty 5.

Alternatively, splitting into larger substrings would give higher penalties, as seen earlier.

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements is optimal.

In the first example, n=1, s="+", a=[1], sum=1, penalty=1.

No other way to split.

In the fourth example, s="--+++++++-", a=[-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1], prefix_sum = -1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,4.

Possible to split at indices where prefix_sum repeats?

Wait, at index 2, prefix_sum=-1; at index 0, also -1.

So, substring from 1 to 2 (indices 1 and 2), sum = -1 - (-1) = 0.

Similarly, from index 3 to 7, sum=0 to 4, sum=4.

Not zero.

Wait, perhaps looking for cycles in prefix_sum.

But I'm getting side-tracked.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved by splitting the array at points where the prefix_sum repeats.

In the third example, prefix_sum repeats at -1 at indices 0 and 2.

So, substring from 1 to 2 has sum zero.

Similarly, from index 3 to 5 has sum zero.

So, splitting at these points gives substrings with zero sum and zero penalty.

In general, if I can find substrings where the prefix_sum repeats, those substrings have sum zero, which is ideal.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty split corresponds to splitting at points where the prefix_sum repeats.

But in the fourth example, prefix_sum is -1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,4.

So, prefix_sum=-1 repeats at index 0 and 2.

Substring from 1 to 2 has sum zero, penalty zero.

If I split there, I get substrings [a[0], a[1]], [a[2], a[3], a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7], a[8], a[9]]

Sum of first substring: -1 + -1 = -2, penalty | -2 | * 2 = 4

Sum of second substring: 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 + -1 = 6 -1 =5, penalty |5| *8 =40

Total penalty: 4 +40 =44

But earlier, I saw that without splitting, just taking the whole array, sum=4, penalty=4*10=40, which is better than 44.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output for n=10 is 4, not 40.

Wait, let me check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

5

1

+

5

-----

6

+-+-+-

10

--+++++++-

20

+---++++-+++++---++-

Sample Output:

1

5

0

4

4

Wait, for n=10, s=--+++++++-, output is 4.

But according to my earlier calculation, if I split at prefix_sum repeats, I get 4 +40=44, which is worse than taking the whole array, which would be 40.

But the sample output is 4, which is less than 40.

So, perhaps there's a better way to split.

Wait, maybe I need to split at more points to minimize the penalty.

Let me try to split the array into more substrings.

For n=10, s=--+++++++-

a = [-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

prefix_sum = [0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Looking at the prefix_sum, it repeats at prefix_sum[-1] at indices 2 and 0.

So, substring from 1 to 2: sum zero, penalty zero.

Then, from 3 to 9: sum from index 3 to 9 is prefix_sum[10] - prefix_sum[3] =4 -0=4, length 7, penalty 4*7=28.

And the last substring from 10: a[9], sum=-1, penalty=1.

Total penalty: 0 +28 +1=29, which is better than 44 but still worse than 40.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, so there must be a better way to split.

Wait, maybe splitting into more parts where the sum is smaller.

For example, split at every point where prefix_sum repeats.

In this case, prefix_sum=-1 at indices 0 and 2.

So, split into [0:1], [1:3], [3:10]

But earlier, that gave us 4 +40=44.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider overlapping substrings or something.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, instead of trying to split into substrings with sum zero, I can aim to minimize |sum| * length for each substring.

One way to do this is to make substrings as short as possible, i.e., split into individual elements.

In that case, for each substring of length 1, penalty is |a_i| *1 =1 for all i.

So, total penalty is n.

In the second example, n=5, all "-", so penalty=5, which matches the sample output.

In the first example, n=1, "+", penalty=1, matches the sample output.

In the third example, n=6, "+-+-+-", splitting into individual elements would give penalty=6, but in the sample output it's 0, which is better.

So, splitting into individual elements isn't always the best strategy.

In the fourth example, n=10, splitting into individual elements would give penalty=10, but the sample output is 4, which is much better.

So, there must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can group pluses and minuses in a way that minimizes |sum| * length.

For example, group all pluses together and all minuses together.

In the fourth example, group the pluses and minuses accordingly.

Let's see:

s = --+++++++-

So, a = [-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

If I split into ( [--], [+++++++], [-] ), i.e., three substrings.

First substring: sum=-2, length=2, penalty=2*2=4

Second substring: sum=7, length=7, penalty=7*7=49

Third substring: sum=-1, length=1, penalty=1

Total penalty: 4 +49 +1=54, which is worse than splitting into individual elements.

Wait, perhaps that's not the way to go.

Another idea: try to balance the sums so that |sum| is minimized for each substring.

But it's not clear.

Let me consider the dynamic programming approach again, but try to optimize it.

With n=5000 and t=1000, O(n^2 * t) is too slow, as mentioned earlier.

I need a way to optimize this.

Is there a way to find the optimal split without considering all possible splits?

Let me consider that the minimal penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into runs of pluses and minuses, but adjusting the splits to minimize the penalty.

Wait, perhaps I can merge runs in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

But I need a clearer strategy.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

Sample Input 1:

1

+

Output:1

Only one element, can't split further, penalty=1.

Sample Input 2:

5

-----

a = [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]

Optimal split: individual elements, penalty=5.

Sample Input 3:

6

+-+-+-

a = [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1]

Optimal split: ([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]), penalty=0+0=0.

Sample Input 4:

10

--+++++++-

a = [-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

Optimal penalty:4

Sample Input 5:

20

+---++++-+++++---++-

Optimal penalty:4

Looking at sample input 4, optimal penalty is 4.

How can that be achieved?

If I split into ([--], [+++++++], [-]), penalty=4+49+1=54, which is worse.

If I split into ([--+++++++], [-]), penalty=|6|*9 + |-1|*1=54 +1=55.

Worse.

If I split into ([--+++++++] [-]), same as above.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can split into ([--+++++++] and [-]), but that gives 4+1=5.

Wait, but the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps there's a better split.

Wait, maybe split into ([--++++++], [-]).

Sum of first substring: -2 +7=5, penalty=5*8=40.

Second substring: -1, penalty=1.

Total:41, still worse.

Wait, maybe I need to split differently.

Wait, perhaps split into ([--], [+++++++-]).

First substring: sum=-2, penalty=2*2=4.

Second substring: sum=6-1=5, penalty=5*7=35.

Total:39, better, but still not 4.

Wait, the sample output is 4, so there must be a better split.

Perhaps split into ([--++++++-], []), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe split into more parts.

Wait, perhaps split into ([--], [++++++], [+-]).

First: sum=-2, penalty=4.

Second: sum=6, penalty=6*6=36.

Third: sum=1-1=0, penalty=0.

Total:4+36+0=40.

Still not 4.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the optimal split is ([--++++++-], [-]), sum= -2+7-1=4, penalty=4*9=36 + |-1|*1=1, total 37.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps the optimal split is into substrings where the sum is minimized in a different way.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimal penalty is achieved by having substrings with sum as close to zero as possible.

In the fourth example, to get a total penalty of 4, perhaps split into ([--], [+++++++], [-]), but as above, that gives 4+35=39, which is still not 4.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is |sum| * length for the whole array, but that would be |4|*10=40, which is still not 4.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is achieved by splitting into substrings where the sum is minimized in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is |sum| + length for each substring.

Wait, no, it's |sum| * length.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty can be achieved by having substrings with sum zero, but in the fourth example, that's not possible.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is |total_sum|.

But in the fourth example, |4| is 4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, is that possible?

If I take the whole array as one substring, penalty=|4|*10=40.

But the sample output is 4.

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is |sum| for all substrings, but multiplied by their lengths.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of |sum| * length is minimized.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to |P - M|, where P is the number of pluses and M is the number of minuses.

In the fourth example, P=7, M=3, |7-3|=4, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second example, P=0, M=5, |0-5|=5, matches the sample output.

In the first example, P=1, M=0, |1-0|=1, matches.

In the third example, P=3, M=3, |3-3|=0, matches.

In the fifth example, P=12, M=8, |12-8|=4, matches.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is simply |P - M|, where P is the number of pluses and M is the number of minuses.

Let me verify this.

In the fourth example, P=7, M=3, |7-3|=4, which matches the sample output.

In the second example, P=0, M=5, |0-5|=5.

In the first example, P=1, M=0, |1-0|=1.

In the third example, P=3, M=3, |3-3|=0.

In the fifth example, P=12, M=8, |12-8|=4.

All match the sample outputs.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is simply |P - M|.

But wait, earlier I thought that if I take the whole array as one substring, the penalty is |sum| * n, which is |P - M| * n, which is different from |P - M|.

But according to this, the minimal penalty is |P - M|.

If that's the case, then the optimal way is to split the array in a way that the total penalty is |P - M|.

But how?

In the fourth example, |P - M| =4, but if I split into substrings with sum zero wherever possible, and have one substring with sum equal to |P - M|, and adjust the lengths accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is |P - M|, regardless of n.

But in the first example, n=1, |P - M|=1, penalty=1.

In the second example, n=5, |P - M|=5, penalty=5.

In the third example, n=6, |P - M|=0, penalty=0.

In the fourth example, n=10, |P - M|=4, penalty=4.

In the fifth example, n=20, |P - M|=4, penalty=4.

So, it seems that in all cases, the minimal penalty is |P - M|.

But how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps there is a way to split the array such that the sum of |sum| * length for all substrings is equal to |P - M|.

How?

Let me consider that in each substring, the sum is either positive, negative, or zero.

If I can arrange the substrings such that only one substring has a sum equal to P - M, and all others have sum zero, then the total penalty would be |P - M| * length of that substring.

But in the fourth example, if I have one substring with sum=4 and length=4, penalty=16, which is not matching the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the length.

If I have one substring with sum=4 and length=1, penalty=4, and other substrings with sum zero and penalty zero.

That would give total penalty=4, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is |P - M|, achieved by having one substring with sum=P - M and length=1, and other substrings with sum zero.

But how is that possible?

If I have one substring of length 1 with sum equal to P - M, and the rest with sum zero.

Wait, in the fourth example, n=10, P=7, M=3, sum=P - M=4.

If I can have one substring of length 1 with sum=4, and the rest with sum zero.

But in reality, in the array a=[-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1], how can I have a substring of length 1 with sum=4?

That's not possible, because no single element has sum=4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the minimal penalty is |P - M|, and it can be achieved by considering the entire array as one substring, but adjusting the splits to minimize the penalty.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical proof for this.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is indeed |P - M|, and see if I can find a way to achieve that.

In the fourth example, |P - M|=4.

If I can find a way to split the array such that the total penalty is 4, it must be by having one substring with sum=4 and length=1, which isn't possible directly.

Alternatively, perhaps by having multiple substrings with sums that, when multiplied by their lengths and added up, give 4.

But I need to find a general way to achieve this.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of grouping elements to cancel each other out as much as possible.

For example, in the third example, I can group pluses and minuses to cancel each other, resulting in sum zero.

In the fourth example, there are more pluses than minuses, so the minimal sum is |P - M|=4.

And the minimal penalty is achieved by having substrings that sum up to this minimal sum in the most optimal way.

But I still need a clear strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is |P - M|, and see if I can construct a split that achieves this.

For the fourth example, P=7, M=3, |P - M|=4.

If I can find a way to have substrings that sum up to this minimal value with minimal penalty.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is |P - M|, and it can be achieved by splitting the array into substrings where each substring has sum either +1 or -1, and adjusting their lengths accordingly.

But I need to think of a general approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal penalty is |P - M|, and it can be achieved by having one substring with sum=P - M and length=1, but as we saw, that's not always possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal penalty is |P - M|, and it can be achieved by having substrings where the sum is maximized in a way that minimizes the product |sum| * length.

In other words, having substrings with larger sums and smaller lengths is better than having substrings with smaller sums and larger lengths.

So, to minimize |sum| * length, it's better to have substrings with larger sums and smaller lengths.

Wait, but in the fourth example, having a substring with sum=4 and length=1 gives penalty=4, which matches the sample output.

But in reality, no single element has sum=4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of a substring can be adjusted by including multiple elements, but in a way that the product |sum| * length is minimized.

This is still confusing.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the sum of a substring, S, and its length, L.

The penalty is |S| * L.

I need to minimize the sum of |S_i| * L_i over all substrings in the split.

Is there a way to relate this to the total sum and the lengths?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total sum is P - M, and the total length is n.

But I need to split the array in a way that minimizes the sum of |S_i| * L_i.

I need to
