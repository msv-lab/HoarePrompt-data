Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate a_i, and they're sorted in ascending order. The distance between any two cities x and y is just the absolute difference between their coordinates, |a_x - a_y|.

For each city, there's a concept of the "closest city." For a given city i, its closest city is the one where the distance to it is not greater than the distance to any other city. And according to the problem, this closest city is unique for each city. So, no ties in distances.

Now, I can travel between cities in two ways:

1. Travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the exact distance |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

I need to process m queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from city x to city y.

First, I need to understand how to efficiently compute the minimum cost for each query. Since directly traveling from x to y costs |a_x - a_y|, and traveling via closest cities costs 1 coin per step, I need to find a path that minimizes the total cost.

Let me think about how the "closest city" concept can be used to form some sort of graph or tree structure that I can traverse.

Given that each city has a unique closest city, this forms a mapping from each city to another city. So, it's like a function f(i) = j, where j is the closest city to i.

This mapping can be used to build a graph where each city points to its closest city, and possibly other connections based on direct travels.

Wait, but since the closest city is unique, this mapping is deterministic.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with their respective distance costs.

Then, for each query, I need to find the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

However, with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building such a graph explicitly is impossible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost without explicitly building the graph.

Let me consider the properties of the "closest city" mapping.

Suppose I have city i, and its closest city is j. Then, moving from i to j costs 1 coin.

Similarly, from j, I can move to its closest city, and so on.

So, by repeatedly moving to the closest city, I can traverse through the cities in a certain path.

But I need to consider that I can also make direct jumps to any city for a cost equal to their distance.

I need to find a way to combine these options to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps I can think in terms of distances and how moving to closest cities affects the overall distance to the target.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city reduces the distance in some way, but since closest cities are determined based on current positions, I need to see how this plays out.

Wait, maybe I can precompute some sort of distance or cost from each city to all other cities, but that seems too broad.

Let me consider the example provided:

Cities: [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8)

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15)

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 5 (20): closest is city 4 (15)

In the first query, going from city 1 to city 4:

- Go from 1 to 2 (cost 1), then from 2 to 3 (cost 1), then from 3 to 4 (cost 1). Total cost 3.

Alternatively, going directly from 1 to 4 would cost |0 - 15| = 15, which is worse.

In the second query, from city 1 to city 5:

- Option 1: Go from 1 to 2 (1), 2 to 3 (1), 3 to 4 (1), 4 to 5 (5). Total 8.

- Option 2: Go directly from 1 to 5, cost |0 - 20| = 20, which is worse.

So, the strategy seems to be to move via closest cities until you're close enough to the target, then possibly make a direct jump.

But how to formalize this?

I recall that in some graph problems, particularly those involving distances and special movement options, we can model the problem using distances and try to find a way to minimize the cost based on given operations.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as moving in the number line, where moving to the closest city is a way to make a "step" towards the target, and direct jumps allow me to make larger moves.

Let me consider that the closest city to a given city is the nearest one in terms of distance, so moving to the closest city is like making a step towards the target.

But in the example, moving from city 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, etc., seems like moving step by step towards the target.

But in some cases, it might be better to make a direct jump if it saves coins.

Wait, in the first query, moving from city 1 to city 4:

- Via closest cities: 1->2->3->4, cost 3.

- Directly: 1->4, cost 15.

So, clearly, step by step is better.

In the second query, from city 1 to city 5:

- Via closest cities: 1->2->3->4->5, cost 4.

- But the output is 8, which suggests that sometimes it's better to make a direct jump at some point.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

- From 1 to 4: 3 coins.

- From 4 to 5: 5 coins, total 8.

So, total cost is 3 + 5 = 8.

But why not go directly from 1 to 5, which would cost 20, which is worse than 8.

So, the strategy is to move via closest cities until you reach a city from which a direct jump to the target is cheaper.

Wait, but in this case, from city 4, going to city 5 costs |15-20|=5, which is better than going to city 3 (which would cost 1).

So, perhaps the strategy is to move towards the target via closest cities until you can make a direct jump that is cheaper than continuing to move via closest cities.

But I need a general way to compute this.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have two cities, x and y.

I can either:

1. Go directly from x to y, paying |a_x - a_y|.

2. Move to the closest city of x, paying 1 coin, and then continue from there.

3. Combine multiple moves via closest cities and possibly direct jumps.

I need to find the minimum cost path from x to y using these operations.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, but with a special cost structure.

Given the constraints (n and m up to 1e5), I need an O(n log n) or O(n) per test case solution.

Let me consider precomputing some distances or cumulative costs.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the cost to reach any city from the endpoints or from certain reference points.

Wait, let's consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the target in the smallest steps, paying 1 coin per step.

While moving directly allows me to pay the distance in coins.

So, perhaps it's optimal to move via closest cities until the remaining distance is smaller than the direct jump cost.

Wait, but I need to think in terms of minimizing the total cost.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities allows me to make progress towards the target at a cost of 1 coin per step, while direct jumps allow me to cover larger distances at a cost equal to that distance.

So, it's beneficial to make direct jumps when the distance is larger than the cost of moving via closest cities.

Wait, but in the example, moving from city 1 to city 4:

- Via closest cities: 3 coins.

- Directly: 15 coins.

So, moving via closest cities is better.

Similarly, from city 1 to city 5:

- Via closest cities to city 4, then directly to city 5: 3 + 5 = 8 coins.

- Directly: 20 coins.

Again, moving via closest cities is better.

Another option: from city 1, move directly to city 3, which costs |0 - 12| = 12 coins, then from city 3 to city 4 costs 1 coin, then from city 4 to city 5 costs 5 coins. Total: 12 + 1 + 5 = 18 coins, which is worse than 8.

So, moving directly to intermediate cities doesn't seem beneficial in this case.

Hence, it seems that moving via closest cities step by step is the optimal strategy in some cases, while making a direct jump at some point can be better in others.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the sequence of cities is sorted on the number line, so I can think of them as being ordered from left to right.

Given that, moving to the closest city is like moving to the neighboring city that is closest.

In the example:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

Wait, city 4's closest city is city 3, which is to the left. City 5's closest city is city 4, which is to the left.

So, it's not always moving to the right.

Hmm.

I need to find a way to model the movement via closest cities and direct jumps.

Maybe I can think in terms of dynamic programming, where dp[i] is the minimum cost to reach city y from city i.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this seems too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities is like moving in a chain, where each step costs 1 coin.

So, if I can find the chain of closest cities from x to y, I can compute the number of steps in that chain, which would be the number of times I move to the closest city.

But this might not be the optimal path, as sometimes making a direct jump can save coins.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with n up to 1e5, building such a graph is impossible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the sequence of cities is sorted, so I can use this property.

Suppose I want to go from city x to city y, where x < y.

I can consider moving to the right via closest cities or make direct jumps.

Similarly, if x > y, I can move to the left.

But I need a way to model this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the distance covered per step when moving via closest cities.

Each time I move to the closest city, I pay 1 coin and cover a certain distance.

So, maybe I can precompute how much distance I cover per step when moving via closest cities.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city the cumulative cost to reach it from the leftmost city via closest cities.

Similarly, compute the cumulative cost from the rightmost city.

Then, for a query from x to y, I can compute the cost from x to the leftmost city via closest cities, plus the cost from the leftmost city to y via closest cities.

But I need to consider that moving via closest cities might not always be the best option.

Wait, maybe I need to compute two cumulative arrays:

1. One for moving from left to right via closest cities, accumulating cost 1 per step.

2. One for moving from right to left via closest cities, accumulating cost 1 per step.

Then, for a query from x to y, I can compute the cost in two ways:

a) Go from x to y via closest cities, either moving left or right.

b) Make a direct jump from x to y.

But I need to consider that moving via closest cities can be a series of 1-coin steps, each step getting me closer to y.

But I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost path.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost as the minimum of:

- The direct distance |a_x - a_y|.

- The number of steps via closest cities from x to y.

But how do I compute the number of steps via closest cities from x to y efficiently?

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, I need an O(1) or O(log n) per query solution.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities forms some sort of path, perhaps a tree or a DAG, where I can precompute distances.

But I need to see the structure of the closest city mappings.

Given that each city has a unique closest city, this forms a mapping that can have cycles or trees.

Wait, but since the cities are on a number line and coordinates are unique and sorted, perhaps the closest city mapping forms a tree-like structure.

If I can model this mapping as a tree, then I can compute the distance between any two nodes in the tree, where each edge has cost 1.

But I need to see if this is the case.

In the example:

Cities: 0,8,12,15,20

Closest mappings:

1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->3, 5->4

So, cities 3 and 4 are connected in a cycle: 3->4->3.

City 5 points to 4, so it's connected to the cycle.

City 2 points to 3, which is in the cycle.

City 1 points to 2.

So, the structure is a tree with a cycle in the middle.

Wait, but in a tree, there should be no cycles.

Actually, since 3 points to 4 and 4 points to 3, it's a cycle.

But the problem states that for each city, the closest city is unique, so there are no ties.

Hence, in this case, cities 3 and 4 are in a cycle.

Similarly, city 5 points to 4.

City 2 points to 3, and city 1 points to 2.

So, the structure is like:

1 -> 2 -> 3 <-> 4 <- 5

This forms a graph with a cycle between 3 and 4.

In this case, moving between cities in the cycle can be done at a cost of 1 per step, but since it's a cycle, you can loop forever.

But in reality, since the cycle is between two cities, moving back and forth doesn't help in progressing towards the target.

Hence, perhaps I should consider the closest city mapping as a parent in a tree, and avoid cycles by choosing a specific direction.

But in this case, there is a cycle, so it's not a tree.

This complicates things.

I need to find a way to handle such cycles.

Wait, maybe I can detect the cycles and handle them separately.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a starting city x and a target city y.

I can consider moving via closest cities towards y, keeping track of the cost.

But I need an efficient way to do this for m queries.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement via closest cities as moving towards the target in steps of varying lengths, each step costing 1 coin.

Then, the minimal cost would be the minimal number of steps needed to reach y from x, where each step is moving to the closest city.

But in the presence of cycles, this might not terminate.

Hence, I need a way to break out of cycles and make direct jumps when necessary.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that for each city, moving to its closest city is like moving to a parent in a tree, except for cycles.

Perhaps I can compute the distance from x to y by considering the path via the "parent" cities, but handle cycles appropriately.

But this seems error-prone.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the target y and compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y.

I need to do this for m queries, so I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some distances or costs in advance.

But with m up to 1e5 and n up to 1e5, I need something efficient.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum of:

- The direct distance |a_x - a_y|.

- The cost of moving via closest cities from x to y.

But computing the cost of moving via closest cities from x to y directly is too slow.

I need a way to compute the minimal cost path that combines both options efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost path from x to y is the shortest path in this graph.

But building such a graph is impossible due to time constraints.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities allows me to traverse the list of cities at a cost of 1 per step, while direct jumps allow me to skip to any city at the cost of their distance.

This is similar to the behavior of BFS, where moving via closest cities is like moving to neighbors with cost 1, and direct jumps are like teleporting to any city with cost equal to their distance.

But again, with n up to 1e5, BFS per query is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum over all possible paths of the sum of the costs of the steps.

Each step is either moving to the closest city (cost 1) or making a direct jump (cost equal to the distance).

I need to find the minimal such sum.

Wait, perhaps I can use some kind of potential function based on the distances.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities allows me to reduce the distance in a step-wise manner, paying 1 coin per step.

While making a direct jump allows me to pay the remaining distance.

Hence, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the minimal distance along any path from x to y, considering both step-wise movements and direct jumps.

This still seems vague.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y by considering the direct jump from x to y, or by moving to the closest city of x and then going to y.

Hence, cost(x, y) = min(|a_x - a_y|, cost(f(x), y) + 1), where f(x) is the closest city to x.

But computing this recursively would be too slow for large n and m.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving via closest cities until I reach a city that is closer to y than x, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities is like moving towards the target in steps, and at some point, making a direct jump to the target.

I need to find the point where making the direct jump is optimal.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y as the minimum over all cities z (including y) of (cost from x to z via closest cities) + |a_z - a_y|.

But this seems too broad and still too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the minimal cost by considering the path via the closest cities as a way to approach y in steps, and at each step, decide whether to continue moving via closest cities or to make a direct jump.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that moving via closest cities is like moving in the direction of the target, paying 1 coin per step, and making a direct jump allows me to cover the remaining distance in one step.

Hence, the minimal cost would be the minimal number of steps via closest cities plus the remaining distance when I decide to make the direct jump.

This sounds similar to the Fibonacci heap's potential function, where you have a combination of different costs.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y by considering the direct distance, or by moving to the closest city and then going to y.

Hence, cost(x, y) = min(|a_x - a_y|, cost(f(x), y) + 1)

But as I said before, this is too slow to compute recursively.

I need a way to compute this in O(1) or O(log n) per query.

Let me consider precomputing some cumulative costs.

Suppose I precompute for each city x, the cost to reach the leftmost city via closest cities, and the cost to reach the rightmost city via closest cities.

Then, for a query from x to y, I can consider going from x to the leftmost city via closest cities, then from the leftmost city to y via closest cities.

But this doesn't seem optimal, as it doesn't take into account the direct distances.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the cumulative cost from one end, say the leftmost city, to all other cities via closest cities.

Similarly, from the rightmost city to all other cities.

Then, for a query from x to y, I can consider going from x to the leftmost city via closest cities, then from the leftmost city to y via closest cities.

Alternatively, from x to the rightmost city and then to y.

But I think there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of two pointers or something related to the sorted nature of the cities.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that since the cities are sorted on a number line, I can consider the problem as moving from position a_x to a_y, with the option to either move directly to any position at cost equal to the distance, or move to the closest city at cost 1.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a path where I can make jumps of varying lengths, paying
