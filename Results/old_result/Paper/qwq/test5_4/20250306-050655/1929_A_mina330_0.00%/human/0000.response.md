Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example to see. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The beauty would be (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Hmm, that's the same as just the difference between the last and first element, because the intermediate differences cancel out in a way. Wait, in this case, it's 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sum. Let's try another one. Take [1, 3, 2]. The beauty would be (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, it's not always just the difference between the last and first element.

Wait a minute, in the first example, [1,2,3], it's 3-1=2. In the second, [1,3,2], it's 2-1=1. Is there a pattern here? It seems like the sum of differences is equal to the last element minus the first element. But in the second example, it's 2 - 1 = 1, which matches the sum. So maybe the beauty is always a_{n} - a_{1}, regardless of how you arrange the middle elements.

But let's verify that. Take [1,3,2]. According to my hypothesis, if I arrange it as [1,2,3], beauty is 3-1=2. But in the example, arranged as [1,3,2], beauty is 1. So arranging it differently changes the beauty. So, the arrangement does matter.

So, to maximize beauty, I need to maximize a_n - a_1. Because beauty seems to be dependent on the difference between the last and the first element, regardless of how the middle elements are arranged.

Wait, but in the second test case, all elements are the same, so no matter how you arrange them, beauty is zero, which makes sense because a_n - a_1 = 0.

In the third test case, [100,54,80,43,90], to maximize a_n - a_1, I should have the smallest a_1 and the largest a_n. So, arrange the array in ascending order: [43,54,80,90,100]. Then beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, [3,4,3,3], to maximize a_n - a_1, arrange as [3,3,3,4]. Then beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which again matches the sample output.

In the fifth test case, [1,2], arranged as [1,2], beauty is 2-1=1, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty, which is equal to a_n - a_1.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3], beauty is 2, which is 3-1. In the second test case, all elements are equal, so beauty is zero. In the third test case, [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100-43=57. In the fourth test case, [3,3,3,4], beauty is 4-3=1. In the fifth test case, [1,2], beauty is 2-1=1.

So, in all these cases, beauty equals a_n - a_1 when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, I should sort the array in ascending order and compute a_n - a_1.

Wait, but looking back at the code provided, it does something different. Let's see.

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a. It sorts a in ascending order. Then, it initializes kq to 0. Then, it loops from i=0 to len(a)//2 -1, and for each i, it adds a[len(a)-i-1] - a[i] to kq. Finally, it prints kq.

So, it's pairing the smallest with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, and summing the differences.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought that sorting in ascending order and taking a_n - a_1 is sufficient. Is there a difference here?

Let me check with an example. Take the first test case: [1,2,3]. Sorted array: [1,2,3]. len(a)//2 = 1 (since n=3), so i from 0 to 0.

a[len(a)-0-1] = a[2] = 3

a[0] = 1

kq = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case: [43,54,80,90,100]. Sorted: [43,54,80,90,100]. len(a)//2 = 2.

So, i from 0 to 1.

First i=0: a[4] - a[0] = 100 - 43 = 57

Second i=1: a[3] - a[1] = 90 - 54 = 36

kq = 57 + 36 = 93, but the sample output is 57. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought beauty was a_n - a_1, which is 100 - 43 = 57, but according to the code, it's summing up multiple differences.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let's recall that beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

So, in the array [1,2,3], beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 2, which is a_n - a_1.

In [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which is a_n - a_1.

Wait, but according to the code, it's doing something else. It's summing a_n - a_1 and a_{n-1} - a_2, etc., depending on how many pairs there are.

But in the sample input, for n=3, it's summing a3 - a1, which is 2, matching the sample output.

For n=5, it's summing a5 - a1 and a4 - a2, which is 100-43=57 and 90-54=36, total 93, but the sample output is 57.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code. Let's look again.

The code does:

for i in range(0, len(a)//2, 1):

kq = kq + a[len(a) - i -1] - a[i]

So, for n=5, len(a)=5, len(a)//2=2.

So, i=0: a[4] - a[0] = 100 - 43 = 57

i=1: a[3] - a[1] = 90 - 54 = 36

kq = 57 + 36 = 93

But the sample output is 57, which is different.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

"the beauty of the array is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n"

So, for array [a1,a2,a3,a4,a5], beauty is (a2-a1) + (a3-a2) + (a4-a3) + (a5-a4) = a5 - a1.

So, it's just the difference between the last and first elements after arrangement.

So, to maximize beauty, we need to maximize a_n - a_1.

Therefore, we should arrange the array such that a1 is as small as possible and a_n is as large as possible.

Hence, sorting the array in ascending order and taking a_n - a1 would give the maximum beauty.

But according to the code, it's summing up multiple pairs: a_n - a1, a_{n-1} - a2, etc., which is unnecessary.

In the sample input, for n=5, it's summing a5 - a1 and a4 - a2, which is 57 + 36 = 93, but the actual beauty should be a5 - a1 = 57.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Let me check with another example.

Take n=4, array [3,4,3,3].

Sorted: [3,3,3,4]

Beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which is a4 - a1 = 4 - 3 =1.

According to the code:

len(a)//2 = 2

i=0: a3 - a0 = 4 - 3 =1

i=1: a2 - a1 = 3 - 3 =0

kq =1 +0=1, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it works.

But for n=5, it doesn't.

Wait, n=5, len(a)//2=2, summing two pairs: a5 - a1 and a4 - a2, which is 57 +36=93, but the correct beauty is 57.

So, the code is incorrect for n=5.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct for even n, but incorrect for odd n.

Wait, no, in n=4, it worked, n=5 didn't.

Wait, but in n=5, the code sums two pairs, but the beauty is only a5 - a1.

So, the code is incorrectly summing additional differences that shouldn't be there.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, let's see for n=5:

Sorted array: [a1,a2,a3,a4,a5]

Beauty: (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + (a4 - a3) + (a5 - a4) = a5 - a1.

But according to the code, it's summing a5 - a1 and a4 - a2, which is extra.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
