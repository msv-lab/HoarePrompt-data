Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th character.

Also, the template can have a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

So, for each position i from 1 to n, depending on whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, there are different constraints on the corresponding characters in a, b, and c.

My task is to find such a template t that satisfies:

- a matches t

- b matches t

- c does not match t

I need to determine for each test case whether such a template exists. If it does, I should print "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let's look at the example provided to understand better.

Example Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Example Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's analyze the first test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

I need to find a template t of length 1 such that:

- a matches t

- b matches t

- c does not match t

Let's think about possible templates:

Option 1: t = "a"

- a matches t: t[0] is lowercase 'a', so a[0] must be 'a' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] is 'a', but b[0] is 'b' ≠ 'a' → does not match. So, b does not match t.

- c matches t: t[0] is 'a', c[0] is 'c' ≠ 'a' → does not match.

This doesn't work because b should match t, but in this case, b does not match t.

Option 2: t = "b"

- a matches t: t[0] is 'b', a[0] is 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches (since t[0] is lowercase, a[0] must be 'b', but it's 'a' → does not match).

- b matches t: t[0] is 'b', b[0] is 'b' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] is 'b', c[0] is 'c' ≠ 'b' → matches.

This doesn't work because a does not match t.

Option 3: t = "c"

- a matches t: t[0] is 'c', a[0] is 'a' ≠ 'c' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] is 'c', b[0] is 'b' ≠ 'c' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] is 'c', c[0] is 'c' → does not match (since t[0] is lowercase, c[0] must be 'c', but according to the condition, if t[i] is lowercase, s_i must be the same as t_i, so c matches t).

Wait, but according to the problem, if t[i] is lowercase, s_i must be the same as t_i. So, if t[0] is 'c' and c[0] is 'c', then c matches t. But in the example, the output is "YES", which suggests that there exists a template where a and b match, but c does not.

Wait, maybe I need to use uppercase in the template.

Option 4: t = "A"

- a matches t: t[0] is 'A' (uppercase), so a[0] must be different from 'a' (lowercase version of 'A'). a[0] is 'a', which is equal to 'a', so does not match.

- b matches t: t[0] is 'A', b[0] is 'b' ≠ 'a' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] is 'A', c[0] is 'c' ≠ 'a' → matches.

This doesn't work because a does not match t.

Option 5: t = "B"

- a matches t: t[0] is 'B', a[0] is 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] is 'B', b[0] is 'b' → does not match (since t[0] is 'B', lowercase version is 'b', and b[0] is 'b', which is equal → does not match).

- c matches t: t[0] is 'B', c[0] is 'c' ≠ 'b' → matches.

This doesn't work because b does not match t.

Option 6: t = "C"

- a matches t: t[0] is 'C', a[0] is 'a' ≠ 'c' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] is 'C', b[0] is 'b' ≠ 'c' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] is 'C', c[0] is 'c' → does not match (since t[0] is 'C', lowercase version is 'c', and c[0] is 'c', which is equal → does not match).

Wait, but according to the problem, if t[i] is uppercase, s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t[i]. So, for t = "C", s_i must not be 'c'. Since c[0] is 'c', it does not match t.

So, a matches t, b matches t, and c does not match t. This seems to satisfy the conditions. So, for the first test case, the answer should be "YES", which matches the example output.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Let's try to find a template t of length 2.

Option 1: t = "AB"

- a matches t: t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), a[0] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → matches.

t[1] = 'B', a[1] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] = 'A', b[0] = 'b' ≠ 'a' → matches.

t[1] = 'B', b[1] = 'b' → does not match (since t[1] is 'B', lowercase is 'b', and b[1] is 'b' → does not match).

- c matches t: t[0] = 'A', c[0] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → matches.

t[1] = 'B', c[1] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

This doesn't work because b does not match t.

Option 2: t = "AA"

- a matches t: t[0] = 'A', a[0] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → does not match.

t[1] = 'A', a[1] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → does not match.

- b matches t: t[0] = 'A', b[0] = 'b' ≠ 'a' → matches.

t[1] = 'A', b[1] = 'b' ≠ 'a' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] = 'A', c[0] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → matches.

t[1] = 'A', c[1] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → matches.

This doesn't work because a does not match t.

Option 3: t = "BB"

- a matches t: t[0] = 'B', a[0] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

t[1] = 'B', a[1] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

- b matches t: t[0] = 'B', b[0] = 'b' → does not match.

t[1] = 'B', b[1] = 'b' → does not match.

- c matches t: t[0] = 'B', c[0] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

t[1] = 'B', c[1] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

This doesn't work because b does not match t.

Option 4: t = "AB"

Already tried, doesn't work.

Option 5: t = "BA"

- a matches t: t[0] = 'B', a[0] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

t[1] = 'A', a[1] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → does not match.

- b matches t: t[0] = 'B', b[0] = 'b' → does not match.

t[1] = 'A', b[1] = 'b' ≠ 'a' → matches.

- c matches t: t[0] = 'B', c[0] = 'a' ≠ 'b' → matches.

t[1] = 'A', c[1] = 'a' ≠ 'a' → does not match.

This doesn't work because a and b do not fully match t.

It seems like no template satisfies the conditions for this test case. Looking at the example output, it's "NO", which matches my conclusion.

Third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

This seems more complex. Let's think about how to approach this.

I need to find a template t of length 10 such that:

- a matches t

- b matches t

- c does not match t

Let's consider position by position.

For each position i from 0 to 9:

- If a[i] == b[i], then in the template, t[i] can be that character in lowercase, or any uppercase character except the one corresponding to a[i] and b[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then t[i] must be uppercase, and not equal to the lowercase of a[i] or b[i].

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Given that a and b both match the template, but c does not.

For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

  - a[i] must be equal to t[i]

  - b[i] must be equal to t[i]

  - c[i] must not be equal to t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

  - a[i] must be different from the lowercase of t[i]

  - b[i] must be different from the lowercase of t[i]

  - c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i]

Wait, no. For c to not match t, at least one position must not satisfy the template constraints.

But it's a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

I need to find a template t such that:

- a matches t

- b matches t

- c does not match t

This means that a and b both satisfy the template constraints, but c does not.

So, for a and b to match t:

- For each position i:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

  - If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

For c to not match t:

- There exists at least one position i where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

  - If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose t such that:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), then c[i] must not be equal to a[i]

  - Or set t[i] to an uppercase letter that is not equal to a[i]

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase is different from both a[i] and b[i]

Then, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

This seems complicated. Maybe I can try to construct such a template step by step.

Let me consider the third test case:

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's list the characters position by position:

Position 0:

a[0] = 'm'

b[0] = 'l'

c[0] = 'a'

Since a[0] != b[0], t[0] must be uppercase, and its lowercase should not be 'm' or 'l'. So, t[0] can be any uppercase letter except 'M' or 'L'. Let's choose 'A'.

So, t[0] = 'A'

Now, for c[0] = 'a', which is equal to the lowercase of t[0], so c does not match t at this position.

Similarly, for a[0] = 'm' != 'a', so a matches t.

b[0] = 'l' != 'a', so b matches t.

So, with t[0] = 'A', a and b match, and c does not match at this position.

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a'

b[1] = 'u'

c[1] = 'd'

Again, a[1] != b[1], so t[1] must be uppercase, not equal to 'A' or 'U'. Let's choose 'B'.

t[1] = 'B'

a[1] = 'a' != 'b', b[1] = 'u' != 'b', c[1] = 'd' == 'b'? No, 'd' != 'b', so c matches t at this position.

Wait, but c needs to not match t at least in one position, which is already satisfied at position 0. So, even if c matches at position 1, as long as it doesn't match at position 0, it's okay.

Position 2:

a[2] = 't'

b[2] = 'c'

c[2] = 'h'

a[2] != b[2], so t[2] must be uppercase, not equal to 'T' or 'C'. Let's choose 'D'.

t[2] = 'D'

a[2] = 't' != 'd', b[2] = 'c' != 'd', c[2] = 'h' != 'd', so c matches t at this position.

Position 3:

a[3] = 'h'

b[3] = 'k'

c[3] = 'o'

a[3] != b[3], so t[3] must be uppercase, not equal to 'H' or 'K'. Let's choose 'E'.

t[3] = 'E'

a[3] = 'h' != 'e', b[3] = 'k' != 'e', c[3] = 'o' != 'e', so c matches t at this position.

Position 4:

a[4] = 'f'

b[4] = 'f'

c[4] = 'c'

Here, a[4] == b[4], so t[4] can be 'f' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'F'.

Option 1: t[4] = 'f'

Then, a[4] == 'f', b[4] == 'f', c[4] == 'c' != 'f' → c does not match t at this position.

But since c already doesn't match t at position 0, it's okay.

Option 2: t[4] = 'G' (uppercase)

Then, a[4] = 'f' != 'g', b[4] = 'f' != 'g', c[4] = 'c' != 'g', so c matches t at this position.

So, choosing t[4] = 'f' would make c not match at position 4, but since c already doesn't match at position 0, either choice is fine.

Let's choose t[4] = 'f'.

Position 5:

a[5] = 'o'

b[5] = 'o'

c[5] = 'o'

a[5] == b[5], so t[5] can be 'o' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'O'.

Option 1: t[5] = 'o'

Then, a[5] == 'o', b[5] == 'o', c[5] == 'o' → c matches t at this position.

Option 2: t[5] = 'P' (uppercase)

Then, a[5] = 'o' != 'p', b[5] = 'o' != 'p', c[5] = 'o' != 'p' → c matches t at this position.

So, either way, c matches at position 5.

Position 6:

a[6] = 'r'

b[6] = 'r'

c[6] = 'd'

a[6] == b[6], so t[6] can be 'r' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'R'.

Option 1: t[6] = 'r'

Then, a[6] == 'r', b[6] == 'r', c[6] == 'd' != 'r' → c does not match at this position.

But c already doesn't match at position 0.

Option 2: t[6] = 'S' (uppercase)

Then, a[6] = 'r' != 's', b[6] = 'r' != 's', c[6] = 'd' != 's' → c matches t at this position.

So, choosing t[6] = 'r' would make c not match at position 6, but again, c already doesn't match at position 0.

Position 7:

a[7] = 'c'

b[7] = 'c'

c[7] = 'e'

a[7] == b[7], so t[7] can be 'c' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'C'.

Option 1: t[7] = 'c'

Then, a[7] == 'c', b[7] == 'c', c[7] == 'e' != 'c' → c does not match at position 7.

Option 2: t[7] = 'D' (uppercase)

Then, a[7] = 'c' != 'd', b[7] = 'c' != 'd', c[7] = 'e' != 'd' → c matches t at this position.

Position 8:

a[8] = 'e'

b[8] = 'e'

c[8] = 'r'

a[8] == b[8], so t[8] can be 'e' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'E'.

Option 1: t[8] = 'e'

Then, a[8] == 'e', b[8] == 'e', c[8] == 'r' != 'e' → c does not match at position 8.

Option 2: t[8] = 'F' (uppercase)

Then, a[8] = 'e' != 'f', b[8] = 'e' != 'f', c[8] = 'r' != 'f' → c matches t at this position.

Position 9:

a[9] = 's'

b[9] = 's'

c[9] = 'r'

a[9] == b[9], so t[9] can be 's' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'S'.

Option 1: t[9] = 's'

Then, a[9] == 's', b[9] == 's', c[9] == 'r' != 's' → c does not match at position 9.

Option 2: t[9] = 'T' (uppercase)

Then, a[9] = 's' != 't', b[9] = 's' != 't', c[9] = 'r' != 't' → c matches t at this position.

So, in summary, for positions where a[i] == b[i], choosing t[i] as the lowercase of that character makes c not match at that position if c[i] != a[i]. But since c already doesn't match at position 0, it's okay.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], choosing an uppercase letter for t[i], not equal to the lowercase of a[i] or b[i], and ensuring that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

In this case, for position 0, c[0] = 'a' == lowercase(t[0]) = 'a', so c does not match t at position 0.

Hence, the template t = "A B D E f o r c e s" (using uppercase letters as chosen earlier) would satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, for this test case, the answer should be "YES", which matches the example output.

Fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Let's try to find a template t of length 3.

Position 0:

a[0] = 'a'

b[0] = 'a'

c[0] = 'a'

Since a[0] == b[0], t[0] can be 'a' (lowercase), or an uppercase letter not equal to 'A'.

Option 1: t[0] = 'a'

Then, a[0] == 'a', b[0] == 'a', c[0] == 'a' → c matches t at position 0.

Option 2: t[0] = 'B' (uppercase)

Then, a[0] = 'a' != 'b', b[0] = 'a' != 'b', c[0] = 'a' != 'b' → c matches t at position 0.

So, in both options, c matches t at position 0.

Position 1:

a[1] = 'c'

b[1] = 'b'

c[1] = 'b'

a[1] != b[1], so t[1] must be uppercase, not equal to 'C' or 'B'. Let's choose 'D'.

t[1] = 'D'

a[1] = 'c' != 'd', b[1] = 'b' != 'd', c[1] = 'b' != 'd' → c matches t at position 1.

Position 2:

a[2] = 'c'

b[2] = 'd'

c[2] = 'c'

a[2] != b[2], so t[2] must be uppercase, not equal to 'C' or 'D'. Let's choose 'E'.

t[2] = 'E'

a[2] = 'c' != 'e', b[2] = 'd' != 'e', c[2] = 'c' != 'e' → c matches t at position 2.

So, with t = "B D E", a and b match t, and c also matches t, which is not what we want.

Alternative approach:

Let's try to make c not match t by setting t[i] in a way that c[i] doesn't satisfy the template.

For position 0:

If I set t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), then a[0] = 'a' != 'a' → matches.

b[0] = 'a' != 'a' → matches.

c[0] = 'a' == 'a' → does not match.

So, with t[0] = 'A', c does not match t at position 0.

Now, for position 1:

Set t[1] = 'D' (uppercase), as before.

a[1] = 'c' != 'd', b[1] = 'b' != 'd', c[1] = 'b' != 'd' → c matches t at position 1.

Position 2:

Set t[2] = 'E' (uppercase).

a[2] = 'c' != 'e', b[2] = 'd' != 'e', c[2] = 'c' != 'e' → c matches t at position 2.

So, overall, with t = "A D E", a and b match t, and c does not match t at position 0.

But according to the example output, it's "NO", which contradicts this conclusion.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no. Looking back, in the fourth test case, the example output is "NO", but according to my reasoning, it should be "YES". Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine the conditions.

For c to not match t, at least one position must not satisfy the template constraints.

In my previous choice, t = "A D E":

- For position 0: t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), so c[0] must not be 'a'. But c[0] is 'a', which violates the condition → c does not match t at position 0.

- Positions 1 and 2: c matches t.

So, overall, c does not match t because of position 0, while a and b match t.

Then, why is the example output "NO"? Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps there's an additional constraint I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string."

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The condition is:

"If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i."

So, if t[i] is uppercase, s_i must not be equal to the lowercase of t[i].

In my previous choice, t[0] = 'A' (uppercase), so c[0] must not be 'a'. But c[0] is 'a', so c does not match t at position 0.

Hence, a and b match t, and c does not match t.

But according to the example output, it's "NO", which suggests that such a template does not exist.

There must be something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a and b both match t, and c does not match t, but there might be conflicting constraints.

Let me consider another template for the fourth test case.

Option 1: t = "A D E"

As above, a and b match t, c does not match t at position 0.

Option 2: t = "B D E"

t[0] = 'B' (uppercase), a[0] = 'a' != 'b', b[0] = 'a' != 'b', c[0] = 'a' != 'b' → c matches t at position 0.

Then, c matches t everywhere, which is not desired.

Option 3: t = "A C E"

t[1] = 'C' (uppercase), but t[1] cannot be 'C' since a[1] = 'c' and t[1] should not be equal to 'C' (uppercase version of 'c').

Wait, no, t[i] can be any uppercase letter except those corresponding to a[i] and b[i].

Wait, in position 1, a[1] = 'c', b[1] = 'b'. So, t[1] cannot be 'C' or 'B' uppercase.

So, t[1] = 'D' is acceptable.

But in option 1, t = "A D E" seems to work.

Yet, the example output is "NO", which suggests that no such template exists.

Perhaps I need to ensure that c does not match t in at least one position, and matches in all other positions.

Wait, no, the condition is that c does not match t, which means that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template constraints.

In the case of t = "A D E", c does not match at position 0, which should be sufficient.

But according to the example output, it's "NO", so maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that c does not match t, but a and b do match t, and there must be no overlap in the positions where c fails to match.

Wait, no, the problem just says that c does not match t, meaning that there is at least one position where c does not satisfy the template constraints, while a and b satisfy all their positions.

Maybe there's a conflict in the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps in some positions, it's impossible to choose t[i] to satisfy all conditions.

Let me consider another approach.

I need to find a template t such that:

- For all i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i]

- For all i, if t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. The condition for c is that it does not match t, meaning that there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Meanwhile, a and b must match t at all positions.

So, I need to choose t such that:

- For each position i:

  - If t[i] is lowercase:

    - a[i] == t[i]

    - b[i] == t[i]

    - c[i] != t[i]

  - If t[i] is uppercase:

    - a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

    - b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

    - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Now, for each position, I can consider the possible choices for t[i]:

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- If a[i] == b
