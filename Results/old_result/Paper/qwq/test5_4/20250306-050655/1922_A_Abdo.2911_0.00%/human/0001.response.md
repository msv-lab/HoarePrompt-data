Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th character.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find such a template t for each test case, and if it exists, print "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to generate a template t based on strings a and b, such that both a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Let's consider each position i from 1 to n.

For each position i, I have the characters a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I make t[i] lowercase, then for both a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i]. Also, for c not to match, c[i] should not be equal to t[i].

If I make t[i] uppercase, then for a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i]. For c not to match, c[i] should be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then for a to match, a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i]. Same for b.

- For c not to match, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, actually, for c not to match, at least one position should not satisfy the condition. So, for t[i] uppercase, if c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i], then c doesn't match at that position.

But I need to ensure that for a and b, if t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] are different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Hmm.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i] != tolower(t[i])

- b[i] != tolower(t[i])

- c[i] == tolower(t[i])

Wait, but for c not to match, it's sufficient if there exists at least one position where the condition fails.

So, in the template, some positions might be lowercase, some uppercase.

For a and b to match the template, they must satisfy the conditions for all positions.

For c not to match, there must be at least one position where the condition fails.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can try to construct the template step by step.

Let me consider each position independently and see what constraints they impose.

For each position i:

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- If I set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), then for a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], which they are.

- For c not to match, c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

So, in this case, if c[i] != a[i], then this position can be used to make c not match.

Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

- If I set t[i] to uppercase, then for a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must be different from tolower(t[i]).

- For c not to match, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

So, in this case, I need to choose an uppercase letter for t[i] such that:

- a[i] != tolower(t[i])

- b[i] != tolower(t[i])

- c[i] == tolower(t[i])

Wait, but c[i] is lowercase, as per the problem statement, since all input strings consist of lowercase letters.

So, t[i] being uppercase, tolower(t[i]) is a lowercase letter.

So, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

In this case, I can set t[i] to the uppercase version of c[i], provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Because if a[i] == c[i], then a[i] == tolower(t[i]), which violates the condition for a to match the template.

Similarly for b[i].

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), and ensure c[i] != a[i].

- Or, set t[i] to an uppercase letter such that a[i] != tolower(t[i]), b[i] != tolower(t[i]), and c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

Wait, but in this case, since a[i] == b[i], setting t[i] to an uppercase letter would require that a[i] != tolower(t[i]), which implies a[i] != b[i], but they are equal, so this seems contradictory.

Wait, no. If a[i] == b[i], and I set t[i] to an uppercase letter such that a[i] != tolower(t[i]), then this is only possible if a[i] != tolower(t[i]).

So, if a[i] == b[i], and I want to set t[i] to uppercase, I need to choose an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from a[i].

But then, for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]), which is different from a[i].

So, in this case, c[i] must be different from a[i].

Wait, but c[i] can be anything, as long as it's equal to tolower(t[i]), which is different from a[i].

So, in this case, as long as c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] to be any uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i], and set t[i] accordingly.

Wait, but in this case, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]), which is different from a[i].

So, c[i] must be different from a[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] to be a[i] (lowercase), or choose an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i].

If c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as a[i] (lowercase), because c would match at that position.

But I can try to choose an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from a[i], and set t[i] to that, provided that c[i] equals tolower(t[i]).

But c[i] == a[i], which is not equal to tolower(t[i]), since tolower(t[i]) != a[i].

Wait, that's contradictory.

So, in this case, if a[i] == b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then I cannot make c not match at this position.

Because:

- If I set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), then c[i] == a[i], so c matches at this position.

- If I set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i], then c[i] == a[i], which is different from tolower(t[i]), so c does not match at this position.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, and tolower(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == a[i], then c[i] != tolower(t[i]), so c matches the template at this position.

Wait, but according to the conditions:

- For t[i] uppercase, c must be different from tolower(t[i]) to match.

- But I need c not to match, so I need c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

Wait, no. Let's recall:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

So, in this case, if I set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not c[i], then c[i] != tolower(t[i]), so c matches the template.

But I need c not to match, so I need c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

But c[i] == a[i], and tolower(t[i]) != a[i], so c[i] != tolower(t[i]), which means c matches the template.

This is problematic.

So, in summary, when a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot make c not match at this position, because:

- If t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i], then c[i] == a[i], so c matches.

- If t[i] is uppercase with tolower(t[i]) != a[i], then c[i] != tolower(t[i]), so c matches.

Thus, in this case, c matches the template at this position, which means I cannot make c not match.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match the template.

Hence, in such cases, the answer should be "NO".

Wait, but perhaps I can make c not match at some other position.

So, it's not sufficient to look at each position independently; I need to ensure that for a and b, they match the template at all positions, and for c, there exists at least one position where it doesn't match.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot make c not match at that position by choosing any template.

Therefore, in such cases, I need to find another position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or where a[i] != b[i], to make c not match.

Wait, but in positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), and since c[i] != a[i], c doesn't match at that position.

Alternatively, I can set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i], and set it such that c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

Wait, but in this case, c[i] != a[i], so if I set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), c[i] != a[i], so c doesn't match at that position.

Alternatively, if I set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i], and set it to be the uppercase version of c[i], provided that c[i] != a[i], which it is, then c[i] == tolower(t[i]), so c doesn't match at that position.

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can choose either option to make c not match at that position.

Similarly, in positions where a[i] != b[i], I need to see if I can make a and b match, and c not match.

Wait, in positions where a[i] != b[i], it's impossible for a and b both to match the template, because:

- For t[i] uppercase, a[i] != tolower(t[i]) and b[i] != tolower(t[i]).

Given that a[i] != b[i], I need to choose t[i] such that tolower(t[i]) is different from both a[i] and b[i].

But c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]) to make c not match.

So, if I can choose t[i] such that tolower(t[i]) != a[i] and tolower(t[i]) != b[i], and c[i] == tolower(t[i]), then c doesn't match at that position.

This is possible only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Because tolower(t[i]) must be different from a[i] and b[i], but c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

Hence, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], I can make a and b match the template, and c not match, only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but if c[i] == a[i], then to make c not match, I need c[i] == tolower(t[i]), which is different from a[i], but c[i] == a[i], which is contradictory.

Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], it's contradictory.

Hence, in positions where a[i] != b[i], I can only make c not match if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match any template that a and b match.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can make c not match at that position.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], I can make c not match only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, my strategy should be:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match, so if there are such positions, I need to ensure that there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], to make c not match at that position.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can make c not match at that position by setting t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), or to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i], and c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], I can make a and b match only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from both a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

Wait, but in positions where a[i] != b[i], to make a and b both match the template, I need to set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from both a[i] and b[i].

And for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

So, I need to choose tolower(t[i]) such that it's different from a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

Hence, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

So, in such positions, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can set t[i] to the uppercase version of c[i], and a and b will match because a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and c will not match because c[i] == c[i].

Wait, no, for t[i] uppercase, c must be different from tolower(t[i]) to match, but I need c not to match, so c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

Hence, in this case, c[i] == c[i], which is true, so c doesn't match at that position.

Yes, that works.

So, to summarize:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to make c not match.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can make c not match at that position.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], I can make c not match only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, my approach should be:

- Identify positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i]. If there are such positions, then I need to have at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], to make c not match at that position.

- If all positions where a[i] == b[i] have a[i] == c[i], and all positions where a[i] != b[i] have c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then it's impossible to make c not match the template while a and b match it.

- Otherwise, it's possible.

Hence, for each test case, I need to check:

- If there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- And, there should be no position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], because in that case, c matches at that position, and I need c to not match at least one position.

Wait, no. I need c to not match at least one position, but it's okay if c matches at other positions, as long as it doesn't match at least one.

But in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], c matches at that position, but I need c to not match at least one position.

Hence, if all positions have a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then c matches the template at all positions, which is not desired.

Hence, to have c not match the template, there must be at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

And, there should be no position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], because in that case, c matches at that position, but I need c to not match at least one position.

Wait, no. I need to ensure that c doesn't match at least one position, but it's okay if c matches at other positions.

Hence, if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can make c not match at that position, while a and b match at all positions.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one such position, and "NO" otherwise.

Wait, but I need to ensure that for a and b to match the template at all positions.

Hence, for positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can make c not match at that position by setting t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), making c[i] != a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i], I cannot make a and b both match the template unless c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, no. For positions where a[i] != b[i], to make both a and b match the template, I need to set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from both a[i] and b[i].

And for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to tolower(t[i]).

Hence, tolower(t[i]) must be different from a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

Hence, c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

So, in such positions, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can set t[i] to the uppercase version of c[i], and a and b will match because a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and c will not match because c[i] == c[i].

Wait, no, for t[i] uppercase, c must be different from tolower(t[i]) to match, but I need c not to match, so c[i] == tolower(t[i]).

Hence, c[i] == c[i], which is true, so c doesn't match at that position.

Yes.

Hence, in positions where a[i] != b[i], I can make c not match only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Hence, in summary:

- If there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i],

- Then, "YES"

- Else, "NO"

Wait, but I need to ensure that for all other positions, a and b match the template.

Hence, for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot make c not match at that position, but I need to make sure that c doesn't match at least one position.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can make c not match at that position by setting t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), making c[i] != a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i], I can only make c not match if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, the condition is that there should be at least one position where either:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Hence, in code, for each test case, I can iterate through the positions and check for these conditions.

If at least one such position exists, print "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me verify this with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Sample Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's check the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

So, position 1: a != b, and c != a and c != b (c != a and c != b).

Hence, "YES"

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Position 1: a != b, and c == a, so c == a, which means c == a, so c == a.

Hence, c == a, which is not different from both a and b.

Position 2: same as position 1.

Hence, no position where a != b and c != a and c != b.

Hence, "NO"

Third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

Need to check positions where:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Compare position by position:

1: m != l, and a != m and a != l -> YES, c != m and c != l

Hence, "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=3

a=acc

b=abd

c=abc

Positions:

1: a == a, c == a -> a == a == c

2: c != a, c == b -> c != a != b, but c == b

3: c != d, c == c -> c == c

So, position 1: a == b == c

Position 2: a != b, but c == b

Hence, c == b, so c == b, which is not different from both a and b.

Position 3: a != b, c == c, which is equal to b, not different from both.

Hence, no position where a != b and c != a and c != b.

Hence, "NO"

This matches the sample output.

Hence, my approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Given Program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

template = []

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

template.append(a[i])

else:

template.append(a[i].upper())

match_a_b = True

for i in range(n):

if template[i].islower():

if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:

match_a_b = False

break

elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():

match_a_b = False

break

match_c = True

for i in range(n):

if template[i].islower():

if c[i] != template[i]:

match_c = False

break

elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():

match_c = False

break

if match_a_b and (not match_c):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Let's analyze this.

First, it constructs a template based on a and b:

- If a[i] == b[i], set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase)

- Else, set t[i] to a[i].upper()

Then, it checks if a and b match this template, and c does not match it.

But according to our earlier analysis, this might not always work, because:

- In positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i
