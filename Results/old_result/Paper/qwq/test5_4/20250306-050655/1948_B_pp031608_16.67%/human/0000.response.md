Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. The goal is to determine if, after performing this operation any number of times, I can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I choose an element that's at least 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original element. So, for example, 10 becomes 1 and 0, 12 becomes 1 and 2, and so on. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

My task is to check if, by applying this operation to some elements in the array, I can achieve a sorted array in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to simulate the process: try to apply the operation to elements where necessary to make the array sorted. But this might be inefficient, especially since the array can have up to 50 elements.

Another approach is to consider the maximum possible splits. That is, what if I split all elements that are at least 10 into their digits? Then, I can check if this fully split array is sorted. If it is, then certainly the original array can be sorted by splitting some or all of these elements.

However, this might not always be the case. Maybe there are scenarios where splitting only some elements is sufficient to achieve sorting, while splitting all possible elements does not lead to a sorted array.

Wait, no. If splitting all elements that are at least 10 into their digits results in a sorted array, then certainly splitting some subset of them could also lead to a sorted array. But the reverse might not be true: there might be cases where splitting only a subset achieves sorting, but splitting all possible elements does not.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's consider the example provided.

In the first test case:

4

12 3 45 67

If I split all possible elements:

- 12 becomes 1 and 2

- 3 remains 3

- 45 becomes 4 and 5

- 67 becomes 6 and 7

So the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which is sorted. So, in this case, splitting all possible elements leads to a sorted array.

In the second test case:

3

12 28 5

If I split all possible elements:

- 12 becomes 1 and 2

- 28 becomes 2 and 8

- 5 remains 5

So the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted.

But the sample output says NO for this case, meaning it's not possible to sort the array by splitting some elements.

In the third test case:

2

0 0

The array is already sorted, so no need to split anything. Output is YES.

From these examples, it seems that if splitting all possible elements leads to a sorted array, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, it's NO.

But wait, is this always true? Let's think of a counterexample where splitting all elements does not lead to a sorted array, but splitting a subset does.

Consider an array: [10, 2]

If I split 10, it becomes [1, 0, 2]

Is this sorted? 1 <= 0 <= 2? No, because 1 > 0. So, it's not sorted.

Alternatively, if I don't split 10, the array is [10, 2], which is not sorted since 10 > 2.

So, in this case, regardless of whether I split 10 or not, the array is not sorted. So, the answer is NO.

Another example: [10, 0]

If I split 10, it becomes [1, 0, 0], which is [1, 0, 0]. Is this sorted? 0 <= 0 <= 1, which is true in non-decreasing order. So, it's sorted.

So, in this case, splitting 10 leads to a sorted array, even though not splitting would give [10, 0], which is not sorted.

Therefore, sometimes splitting is necessary to achieve a sorted array.

Now, considering that splitting an element can only help in making the array sorted if it allows the digits to be placed in a way that resolves inconsistencies in the order.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to consider all possible splits and see if any of them lead to a sorted array.

However, since the array can have up to 50 elements, and each element that is at least 10 can be either split or not, this could lead to an exponential number of possibilities, which is not feasible to check directly.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the positions in the array and see what values can be present after possible splits.

For each position, if the element is less than 10, it remains as is. If it's 10 or more, it can be either kept as is or split into its digits.

So, for each element that is 10 or more, there are two choices: keep it as is or split it into digits.

Then, I need to check if, with some combination of these choices, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the maximum value up to the current position and ensure that the next value is greater than or equal to it.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I iterate through the array and whenever I find two elements where the previous one is larger than the current one, I check if splitting the previous element can resolve this issue.

If the previous element is less than 10, I can't split it, so in that case, it's impossible to sort the array.

If the previous element is 10 or more, I can choose to split it or not.

If I choose not to split it, then I have to accept that the array is not sorted.

If I choose to split it, I need to see if splitting it allows the array to be sorted from that point onward.

This seems a bit involved, but maybe I can implement it recursively with memoization.

However, given time constraints, I need a more efficient solution.

Another idea: since splitting an element can only decrease the value at that position (because digits are always less than or equal to the original number), I can consider the maximum possible value at each position after possible splits.

Wait, actually, splitting an element can introduce smaller values, but the position where these values are inserted remains the same.

Wait, no. When I split an element, I insert its digits in place of the original element, maintaining the same positions.

For example, in [12, 3, 45, 67], splitting 45 results in [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. So, the digits are inserted in the same position as the original element.

Wait, but in terms of indices, it's a bit more complicated because splitting an element increases the length of the array.

This could make it difficult to handle directly.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the final array length after all possible splits.

What's the maximum possible length of the array after splitting? Each element that is split increases the array length by the number of digits minus one.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each element has up to 2 digits, the maximum increase in length isn't too bad.

But still, handling all possible split combinations seems computationally expensive.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that splitting an element allows me to replace it with its digits, which are smaller numbers, potentially helping to make the array sorted.

But, I need to ensure that the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order after all splits.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a possible state of an element (either kept as is or split), and then check if there's a path through these states that results in a sorted array.

This sounds complicated.

Another approach: since the operation can be performed any number of times, I can consider the set of possible values that each position can have after possible splits.

Then, I need to select one possibility for each position such that the entire array is sorted.

This still seems tricky to implement efficiently.

Let me look back at the sample inputs.

In the first sample:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting 12 and 45 and 67, we get [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

In the second sample:

3

12 28 5

After splitting all possible elements, we get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

Is there any way to split a subset of elements to make it sorted? Let's see:

If I split only 12: [1,2,28,5] → 1 <= 2 <= 28 <= 5? No, 28 > 5, not sorted.

If I split only 28: [12,2,8,5] → 12 > 2, not sorted.

If I split both 12 and 28: [1,2,2,8,5] → 1 <= 2 <= 2 <= 8 <= 5? No, 8 > 5.

So, no way to make it sorted.

In the third sample:

2

0 0

Already sorted, so no need to split.

Okay, so in cases where splitting all possible elements leads to a sorted array, the answer is YES. Otherwise, it's NO.

But wait, in the second sample, splitting all possible elements doesn't lead to a sorted array, and neither does splitting any subset, as we've seen.

So, maybe the condition is that if the fully split array is sorted, then YES; else, NO.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Consider the array [10, 2].

Fully split: [1,0,2], which is not sorted (1 > 0), but as we saw earlier, splitting 10 is necessary, and in this case, it's still not sorted.

Another example: [10, 0]

Fully split: [1,0,0], which is sorted (1 >= 0 >= 0).

Wait, in this case, splitting 10 allows the array to be sorted.

So, perhaps I need to check if splitting all possible elements leads to a sorted array, or if there exists some subset of elements to split that results in a sorted array.

But checking all subsets is not efficient.

Is there a way to greedily decide whether to split an element or not as I iterate through the array?

Let's try to think of a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the array from left to right, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far.

If I encounter an element that is smaller than the maximum value so far, I need to decide whether to split it or not.

If the element is less than 10, I can't split it, so if it's smaller than the maximum, the array can't be sorted.

If the element is 10 or more, I can choose to split it or not.

If I choose not to split it, and it's smaller than the maximum, then the array can't be sorted.

If I choose to split it, I need to check if the digits are greater than or equal to the maximum value so far.

Wait, no. If I split it, I insert its digits in place, and I need to ensure that each digit is >= the previous value in the array.

This seems a bit messy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fully split the array, meaning I split all elements that are >=10 into their digits.

Then, I check if this fully split array is sorted.

If it is, then certainly I can achieve a sorted array by splitting all necessary elements.

If it's not, then I need to check if there's a subset of elements to split that would make the array sorted.

But checking all subsets is not efficient.

Is there a way to determine if splitting a subset of elements can lead to a sorted array without checking all possibilities?

Maybe I can consider the fully split array and see if it can be rearranged to be sorted by only choosing to include certain splits.

Wait, but the operation doesn't allow rearranging; it only allows splitting and inserting digits in the same position.

So, the order of elements is preserved; I can't reorder them.

Therefore, I need to ensure that after splitting, the array is sorted in place.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to simulate the splitting process.

I can iterate through the array and whenever I find an element that is larger than the next element, and it's >=10, I can choose to split it and see if that resolves the issue.

I can do this iteratively until the array is sorted or until there are no more improvements.

This sounds similar to a bubble sort-like approach, where I bubble down the elements by splitting them when necessary.

Let me try this with an example.

Take the first sample input:

4

12 3 45 67

Start with [12, 3, 45, 67]

Compare 12 and 3: 12 > 3, so I need to split 12.

Split 12 into [1, 2], so the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

Now, compare 2 and 3: 2 <= 3, good.

Compare 3 and 45: 3 <= 45, good.

Compare 45 and 67: 45 <= 67, good.

So, the array is sorted after splitting 12.

Another example:

3

12 28 5

Start with [12, 28, 5]

Compare 12 and 28: 12 <= 28, good.

Compare 28 and 5: 28 > 5, need to split 28.

Split 28 into [2, 8], so the array becomes [12, 2, 8, 5]

Now, compare 12 and 2: 12 > 2, need to split 12.

Split 12 into [1, 2], so the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

Now, compare 2 and 2: good.

Compare 2 and 8: good.

Compare 8 and 5: 8 > 5, need to split 8.

But 8 is less than 10, can't split it.

So, it's impossible to sort this array.

Third example:

2

0 0

Already sorted, so no need to split.

This seems to work.

So, the approach is:

- Iterate through the array from left to right.

- Whenever you find an element that is larger than the next one, and it's >=10, split it into its digits.

- Repeat this process until the array is sorted or until no more splits can be made.

- If the array is sorted, output YES; else, output NO.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

In the given code, there's a function func_1 that checks if the list is sorted.

The main logic is in the for loop where it iterates through the test cases.

Inside each test case, it reads n and the list a.

Then, it has a for loop that starts from index 1 to len(list1)-1.

It checks if func_1(list1) is not True, meaning the list is not sorted.

Then, it checks if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] > 10.

If both conditions are true, it splits list1[p-1] into its digits and inserts them into the list.

Finally, after processing all elements, it checks if the list is sorted and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Wait, but in the code, it's using list1.pop(p-1) and list1.insert(p-1, a//10) and list1.insert(p, a%10).

This seems to be splitting the number into its tens and units digits and inserting them in place.

However, this might not be sufficient for numbers with more than two digits, but since the problem states that a_i <= 99, it's fine.

But, in the first example, 12 is split into 1 and 2, which is correct.

In the second example, 12 is split into 1 and 2, and 28 is split into 2 and 8.

But, in the code, it's only splitting the number into two digits, which is acceptable since a_i <= 99.

Wait, but in the first example, after splitting 12 into 1 and 2, the array becomes [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

In the second example, after splitting 12 into 1 and 2, and then splitting 28 into 2 and 8, the array becomes [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

So, the code seems to be implementing the logic I described.

But, is this logic sufficient?

In the first example, it works.

In the second example, it correctly identifies that it's not possible to sort the array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted, so it's correct.

Let me think of another example.

Consider [20, 30, 15]

Initially, [20,30,15]

Compare 20 and 30: 20 <= 30, good.

Compare 30 and 15: 30 > 15, need to split 30.

Split 30 into 3 and 0, so the array becomes [20,3,0,15]

Now, compare 20 and 3: 20 > 3, need to split 20.

Split 20 into 2 and 0, so the array becomes [2,0,3,0,15]

Now, check if this is sorted: 2 <= 0 <= 3 <= 0 <= 15?

No, 2 > 0, and 3 > 0, so it's not sorted.

So, the answer should be NO, which is correct.

Another example: [10, 11, 12]

Start with [10,11,12]

Compare 10 and 11: 10 <= 11, good.

Compare 11 and 12: 11 <= 12, good.

So, no need to split anything, output YES.

Another example: [15, 2, 30]

Start with [15,2,30]

Compare 15 and 2: 15 > 2, need to split 15.

Split 15 into 1 and 5, so the array becomes [1,5,2,30]

Now, compare 1 and 5: 1 <= 5, good.

Compare 5 and 2: 5 > 2, need to split 5.

But 5 < 10, can't split it.

So, it's impossible to sort, output NO.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in this approach, it only splits one element at a time and then checks.

But in some cases, splitting one element might require splitting another element afterward.

For example, in [15,2,30], after splitting 15 into 1 and 5, the array becomes [1,5,2,30].

Now, 5 > 2, so I need to split 5, but 5 is less than 10, can't split it.

So, it's impossible to sort.

This seems correct.

Therefore, the logic in the code seems to be correct.

It iterates through the array, and whenever it finds a[i] > a[i+1] and a[i] >=10, it splits a[i] into its digits.

Then, it repeats this process until the array is sorted or no more splits can be made.

Finally, it checks if the array is sorted and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

So, I think the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to delete any integer in the array that is at least 10 and insert its digits back into the array at the same position.

### Approach

1. **Operation Definition**: For any integer in the array that is at least 10, we can choose to split it into its individual digits and insert them back into the array in place of the original integer.
2. **Objective**: Check if, by applying this operation any number of times (possibly zero), the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array.
3. **Method**:
   - Iterate through the array and identify positions where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - If such a position is found and the current element is at least 10, split the element into its digits and insert them back into the array at that position.
   - Repeat this process until the array is sorted or no further splits can be made.
   - Finally, check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    while i < len(list1) - 1:
        if func_1(list1):
            break
        if list1[i] > list1[i + 1]:
            if list1[i] >= 10:
                # Split the number into digits
                a = list1.pop(i)
                for digit in str(a)[::-1]:
                    list1.insert(i, int(digit))
                # Move to the next position after the inserted digits
                i += len(str(a))
            else:
                # Cannot split, so it's impossible to sort
                break
        else:
            i += 1
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases `t`.
- **Test Case Iteration**: For each test case, read the array length `n` and the array `list1`.
- **Sorting Check Loop**:
  - Use a while loop to iterate through the array until it is sorted or no further operations can be performed.
  - If the array is already sorted, break out of the loop.
  - If an element is found that is greater than the next element and is at least 10, split it into
