Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's an integer k, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. 

Specifically:

- l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array (a1 to an).

- r should be a subset of the next n elements of the array (a_{n+1} to a_{2n}).

- The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and I can output any one of them if there are multiple.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, l is any selection of elements from the first n elements, in any order, and similarly for r from the last n elements.

The key condition is that the XOR of elements in l should equal the XOR of elements in r.

Given that, I need to find such l and r, each with exactly 2k elements.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR elements doesn't matter, and XOR-ing an element with itself cancels out to 0.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, divided into two halves, I need to select 2k elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

One approach that comes to mind is to try to pair elements in a way that their XORs match, but that might be too time-consuming, especially given the constraints (n can be up to 50,000 per test case, and t up to 5000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 50,000).

I need an efficient way to find such subsets.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first half and the XOR of all elements in the second half.

Let's denote:

- XOR_l = XOR of all elements in the first n elements.

- XOR_r = XOR of all elements in the second n elements.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, the XOR of all elements in the entire array would be 0, because each number XOR-ed with itself is 0.

Therefore, XOR_l XOR XOR_r = 0, which implies that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me verify:

If each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, once in the first half and once in the second half, then XOR_l would be the XOR of numbers 1 to n, and XOR_r would be the same, so XOR_l = XOR_r.

But actually, no. The problem states that each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in each half. So, it's possible for a number to appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half.

Wait, no, it should be that each number appears exactly once in the first half and once in the second half, because the total is twice and they are divided into two equal parts.

Wait, but the problem says "the array a of length 2n, consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice."

So, each number appears twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in each half.

Wait, but the array is of length 2n, and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, so it's possible for a number to appear twice in the first n elements or twice in the latter n elements.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing myself.

Actually, since the array is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and it's split into two halves of n elements each, it's possible for some numbers to appear twice in one half and not at all in the other half.

Wait, no, that can't be, because each number must appear exactly twice in total.

Wait, no, wait, if n=2, and a=[1,2,2,1], then 1 appears once in the first half and once in the second half, and 2 appears once in each half.

Another example: n=6, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]. Here, 1 appears once in the first half and once in the second half, 2 appears once in each half, and so on.

Wait, but the problem allows for numbers to appear twice in one half or split between halves, but given that each number appears exactly twice in total.

Wait, actually, no, in the example above, each number appears once in each half.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, a=[1,2,2,1], 1 appears once in the first half and once in the second half, and 2 appears once in each half.

In the second test case, n=6, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4], each number from 1 to 6 appears once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, is that always the case?

Wait, the problem says "consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice."

But it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves.

So, it's possible for a number to appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half.

Wait, but in the examples provided, each number appears once in each half.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, a=[1,2,2,1], 1 appears once in the first half and once in the second half, and 2 appears once in each half.

In the second test case, n=6, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4], each number appears once in each half.

In the third test case, n=4, a=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4], each number appears once in each half.

In the fourth test case, n=6, a=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2], each number appears once in each half.

So, perhaps I misread the problem. It seems that in the given examples, each number appears exactly once in each half.

Wait, but the problem doesn't enforce that. It's just that in the examples, it's done that way.

So, I need to consider the general case where a number can appear twice in one half or once in each half.

But, given that, I need to select 2k elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

And it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists.

I need to find an efficient way to do this, considering the constraints.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

If I select a subset l from the first half and a subset r from the second half, and their XORs are equal, then XOR_l = XOR_r.

Which implies that XOR_l XOR XOR_r = 0.

Which means that the XOR of the selected elements in l and r together is 0.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements from each.

This seems tricky.

Another way to look at it is to consider the XOR of all possible subsets of size 2k from each half and find pairs where the XOR values match.

But that's not practical given the size of n.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first half and the second half.

Let me denote:

- XOR_first = XOR of all elements in the first half.

- XOR_second = XOR of all elements in the second half.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, XOR_first XOR XOR_second should be equal to the XOR of the numbers that appear an odd number of times in the first half.

Wait, no, since each number appears exactly twice in total, XOR_first XOR XOR_second should be zero, because every number's two occurrences will cancel out.

Wait, but only if each number appears once in each half.

Wait, no, if a number appears twice in one half and zero times in the other half, then it would contribute its value to XOR_first or XOR_second.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Letâ€™s denote the XOR of all elements in the entire array. Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of all elements is zero, because each number XOR-ed with itself is zero.

Now, the XOR of the first half is XOR_first, and the XOR of the second half is XOR_second.

Since the XOR of the entire array is zero, XOR_first XOR XOR_second = 0, which implies XOR_first = XOR_second.

So, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half.

Given that, I need to find subsets l and r of size 2k each, such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that XOR_first = XOR_second, perhaps I can use this property to find such subsets.

But I'm not sure yet.

Let me consider selecting elements for l and r.

One idea is to select k pairs of elements, where each pair consists of an element from the first half and its corresponding element in the second half.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of matching elements that are the same in both halves.

Since each number appears exactly twice, once in each half, but as per the examples, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, in the examples, some numbers appear once in each half, but according to the problem statement, a number can appear twice in one half.

Wait, no, the problem says "consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice," but doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves.

So, a number can appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half, as long as it appears exactly twice in total.

Given that, I need to find 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

I need to find an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Let me denote:

- For each number i (1 to n), count how many times it appears in the first half and how many times it appears in the second half.

Since each number appears exactly twice in total, if it appears once in the first half, it must appear once in the second half; if it appears twice in the first half, it appears zero times in the second half, but wait, no, the total is twice, so if it appears twice in the first half, it appears zero times in the second half, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that XOR_first = XOR_second.

Wait, if a number appears twice in the first half, its XOR contribution in the first half is zero, and in the second half, it appears zero times, so its XOR contribution in the second half is also zero, so XOR_first and XOR_second are still equal.

Wait, but in this case, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half, which is zero.

Wait, no, if a number appears twice in one half, its XOR contribution is zero in that half, and zero in the other half, so XOR_first = XOR_second.

But I need to find subsets l and r with XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements in such a way that the XOR of l and r are both equal to XOR_first.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements in each subset.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

An alternative approach is to iterate through the array and try to match pairs of elements that have the same value, one from the first half and one from the second half.

But since the problem allows for numbers to appear twice in one half, I need to handle that.

Wait, perhaps I can group the elements into pairs of identical numbers, one from each half.

But again, if a number appears twice in one half, I need to handle that appropriately.

Wait, maybe I should look for differences in the counts of each number in the two halves.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the difference in counts for each number between the two halves and try to balance them in some way.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose k=1.

Then I need to select 2 elements from the first half and 2 elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

One way to do this is to select two identical elements from the first half and two identical elements from the second half, but that might not always be possible.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=1, a=[1,2,2,1].

So, first half: [1,2], second half: [2,1].

Select l=[2,1], r=[2,1], and their XORs are both 3.

Another test case: n=6, k=1, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4].

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3], second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4].

I need to select 2 elements from each half with equal XOR.

In the example, the output is l=[6,4], r=[1,3], and their XORs are both 2.

So, how did they arrive at this?

6 XOR 4 = 6 âŠ• 4 = 2

1 XOR 3 = 1 âŠ• 3 = 2

So, both subsets have XOR 2.

How can I generalize this?

Is there a systematic way to find such subsets?

One idea is to select pairs of elements that have the same XOR value.

But selecting individual pairs might not guarantee that the total XOR of 2k elements is equal in both subsets.

Wait, perhaps I can select k pairs from the first half and k pairs from the second half such that the XOR of the pairs in both subsets is equal.

But this might not be straightforward.

Another idea is to use the fact that XOR is a linear operation, and thus, the problem can be modeled using linear algebra over GF(2).

But given the time constraints, this might be too slow for large n.

Wait, but n can be up to 50,000, and t up to 5000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 50,000, so I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me think about the properties of the XOR operation again.

If I can find a set of elements in the first half and a set in the second half such that their XORs are equal, and the sizes are both 2k, that would suffice.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can look for elements that appear in both halves and pair them accordingly.

But again, handling the counts properly is crucial.

Let me consider tracking the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Let me denote:

- For each number i from 1 to n:

- count_first[i] = number of times i appears in the first half.

- count_second[i] = number of times i appears in the second half.

Given that count_first[i] + count_second[i] = 2 for each i.

Given that, possible values for count_first[i] and count_second[i] are:

- (2,0)

- (1,1)

- (0,2)

Now, I need to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first half and in the second half.

As previously established, XOR_first = XOR_second.

Let me denote this common XOR value as XOR.

Now, if I select a subset l from the first half with XOR_l, then to have XOR_r = XOR_l, I need to select a subset r from the second half with XOR_r = XOR_l.

Given that XOR_second is the XOR of all elements in the second half, the XOR of the elements not selected in r would be XOR_second XOR XOR_r = XOR_second XOR XOR_l.

But since XOR_first = XOR_second, and XOR_l is what I'm trying to match with XOR_r, this might not directly help.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I need to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that, and knowing that XOR_first = XOR_second, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of the elements not selected in each half have the same XOR.

Wait, let's think about it.

If I select l from the first half, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half is XOR_first XOR XOR_l.

Similarly, if I select r from the second half, the XOR of the remaining elements in the second half is XOR_second XOR XOR_r.

Since XOR_first = XOR_second, and I want XOR_l = XOR_r, then XOR_first XOR XOR_l = XOR_second XOR XOR_r.

But since XOR_first = XOR_second and XOR_l = XOR_r, then XOR_first XOR XOR_l = XOR_second XOR XOR_r implies that XOR_l = XOR_r, which is already what I want.

So, this doesn't give me new information.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that I can select any 2k elements from the first half and compute their XOR, then try to find a subset of 2k elements in the second half with the same XOR.

But with n up to 50,000, this is not feasible directly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select 2k elements from each half, perhaps I can pair the elements in some way.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the differences in counts and try to balance them.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and k, followed by the array a of length 2n.

Then it initializes two arrays l and r of size n, presumably to count the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Then it proceeds to count how many times each number appears in the first and second halves.

Then it iterates through the first half and prints numbers that appear twice in the first half, up to 2k elements.

Then it handles the remaining elements if 2k elements are not yet selected.

This seems promising.

Let me try to understand this approach.

So, the program first counts the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Then, it selects numbers that appear twice in the first half and includes both occurrences in l, and corresponding numbers in r.

Wait, but in the first half, if a number appears twice, its XOR contribution is zero, since XOR-ing it with itself gives zero.

Similarly, in the second half, if a number appears twice, its XOR is also zero.

So, selecting pairs that appear twice in one half and zero in the other half might help in balancing the XOR.

Wait, but in the program, it selects numbers that appear twice in the first half and includes both in l, and presumably selects something in r to match the XOR.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2, k=1, a=[1,2,2,1].

First half: [1,2], second half: [2,1].

Frequency counts:

- Number 1: first half: 1, second half:1

- Number 2: first half:1, second half:1

So, no number appears twice in the first half.

But in the program, it seems to select numbers that appear twice in the first half.

In this case, no such numbers, so it might select something else.

Wait, but in the example, it outputs l=[2,1], r=[2,1], which is correct.

But according to the program, it first checks for numbers that appear twice in the first half, which doesn't apply here, so it might do something else.

Wait, in the program, for the first loop, it checks for numbers that appear twice in the first half and prints them.

If no such numbers, it moves to the next part.

But in this example, no number appears twice in the first half, so it might select one number that appears once in the first half and match it with the corresponding number in the second half.

But I need to see the exact logic.

Another example: n=6, k=1, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4].

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3], second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4].

Frequency counts:

- 1: first half:2, second half:1

- 2: first half:2, second half:0

- 3: first half:1, second half:1

- 4: first half:1, second half:1

- 5: first half:0, second half:2

- 6: first half:1, second half:1

Wait, in the first half:

- 1 appears twice

- 2 appears twice

- 3 appears once

- 4 appears once

- 5 appears zero times

- 6 appears once

Second half:

- 1 appears once

- 2 appears zero times

- 3 appears once

- 4 appears once

- 5 appears twice

- 6 appears once

So, in this case, numbers that appear twice in the first half are 1 and 2.

The program would select these and include them in l.

Then, in r, it would select corresponding elements to match the XOR.

In the example output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3], which
