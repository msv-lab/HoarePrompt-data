Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific properties:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the array a.

2. r is a subset of the second n elements of the array a.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, l and r are any collections of 2k elements from the first n and last n elements of a, respectively.

My goal is to select elements such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Let me think about XOR. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. It's associative and commutative, which means the order in which I perform the operations doesn't matter.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, no. Actually, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, but not necessarily once in each half. The problem says: "l is a subset of [a1, a2, … an]" and "r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, … a2n]". So, the first n elements and the last n elements.

I need to choose 2k elements from the first n and 2k elements from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, I need to find a way to select these elements.

Let me consider the properties of XOR. If I have two sets with the same XOR, then the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Let me think differently. Since I need to have l and r with the same XOR, I can think about the XOR of l being equal to the XOR of r.

Which implies that the XOR of l and r together is zero, because XOR is its own inverse.

Wait, no. The XOR of l and r is zero only if l and r have the same XOR, because l XOR r = 0 implies l = r, but in this context, l and r are different sets.

Wait, no, that's not correct. XOR is not about equality of sets, but about the equality of their XOR values.

Let me try to approach this differently.

I need to select 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

One way to ensure this is to select pairs of equal elements, since the XOR of two equal elements is zero.

But the problem allows for any subsets, as long as their XORs are equal.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in each half.

Wait, actually, since the array has 2n elements and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, it's possible that both occurrences of a number are in the first n or both are in the last n.

But according to the problem, it's a single array of 2n elements, consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.

Wait, no, it's guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a.

So, in the array a, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, somewhere in the 2n elements.

But the positions of these two occurrences can be anywhere in the array.

So, in the first n elements, I might have some numbers appearing once or twice, and similarly in the last n elements.

I need to choose a subset of 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, I need to find a way to select these subsets.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first n and the XOR of all elements in the last n.

Let's denote XOR_l as the XOR of the first n elements, and XOR_r as the XOR of the last n elements.

Now, if I select a subset l from the first n with XOR equal to S, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first n would be XOR_l XOR S.

Similarly, if I select a subset r from the last n with XOR equal to S, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the last n would be XOR_r XOR S.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting subsets whose XOR is equal to a specific value.

But I need to select subsets l and r from different parts of the array, and their XORs should be equal.

Another idea: since I need to have l and r with the same XOR, perhaps I can select l arbitrarily from the first n, and then try to select r from the last n such that its XOR matches that of l.

But that might not always be feasible, and finding such subsets efficiently is the challenge.

Given the constraints, t can be up to 5000, and n can be up to 50,000 per test case, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 50,000, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me look at the example to get some intuition.

In the first test case:

n = 2, k = 1

a = [1, 2, 2, 1]

So, first n elements: [1, 2]

Last n elements: [2, 1]

We need to choose 2*1=2 elements from each.

Possible l: [1,2], [2,1]

Possible r: [2,1], [1,2]

XOR of [1,2]: 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR of [2,1]: 2 XOR 1 = 3

So, both pairs have the same XOR.

In the second test case:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First n elements: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Last n elements: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

We need to choose 2 elements from each such that their XORs are equal.

In the sample output, l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

XOR of [6,4]: 6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR of [1,3]: 1 XOR 3 = 2

So, they match.

Another test case:

n = 4, k = 1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First n: [1,2,3,4]

Last n: [1,2,3,4]

Choose l = [1,2], r = [1,2]

XOR of [1,2]: 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR of [1,2]: 1 XOR 2 = 3

Matches.

Last test case:

n = 6, k = 2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First n: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Last n: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Choose l = [5,1,3,3], r = [6,4,2,4]

XOR of l: 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (5 XOR 1) = 4, then 4 XOR 3 = 7, then 7 XOR 3 = 4

XOR of r: 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 4 = 2, then 2 XOR 2 = 0, then 0 XOR 4 = 4

So, both have XOR 4.

So, in all these cases, they choose subsets where the XOR matches.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need a method to select 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient approach.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it behaves with subsets.

One important property is that the XOR of a set of numbers is equal to the XOR of any subset plus the XOR of its complement subset.

Wait, more precisely, in a set S, if you have a subset A, then XOR(S) = XOR(A) XOR XOR(S - A).

Because XOR is its own inverse.

Given that, if I can find subsets l and r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r), then XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, I can think about the frequencies in the first n and last n.

Let me define:

For each number i from 1 to n:

- count_i = how many times i appears in the first n elements.

- Since each i appears exactly twice in the entire array, count_i can be 0, 1, or 2.

- If count_i = 0, both occurrences are in the last n.

- If count_i = 1, one occurrence is in the first n and one in the last n.

- If count_i = 2, both occurrences are in the first n.

Similarly, in the last n, count_i can be 0, 1, or 2, but since total is 2, last_n_count_i = 2 - count_i.

Now, I need to choose a subset l from the first n and r from the last n, each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

I need to find such subsets.

Let me consider different cases based on the count_i.

First, for numbers where count_i = 2, both are in the first n, so they can only be chosen in l.

Similarly, for count_i = 0, both are in the last n, so they can only be chosen in r.

For count_i = 1, one is in the first n and one in the last n.

I need to choose elements from l and r such that their XORs match.

Let me think about the total XOR of all elements in the first n and in the last n.

Let me denote:

XOR_l = XOR of all elements in the first n.

XOR_r = XOR of all elements in the last n.

Now, if I choose a subset l from the first n with XOR S, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first n is XOR_l XOR S.

Similarly, if I choose a subset r from the last n with XOR S, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the last n is XOR_r XOR S.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the difference between XOR_l and XOR_r.

If I can find a subset l from the first n and a subset r from the last n such that XOR(l) = XOR(r), then XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

Which implies that the XOR of the chosen elements in l and r together is zero.

But I need to choose subsets of size exactly 2k each.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Since it's guaranteed that at least one pair exists, I need to find a way to construct such pairs.

Let me consider that for numbers with count_i = 2, choosing both in l will add their XOR, which is zero, since identical elements XOR to zero.

Similarly, for count_i = 0, choosing both in r will add zero to the XOR.

For count_i = 1, choosing the element in the first n for l and the one in the last n for r will add the same value to both XORs.

Wait, that might be a way to balance the XORs.

Let me formalize this.

Let me categorize the numbers based on their count_i:

- Group A: count_i = 0, both in last n.

- Group B: count_i = 1, one in first n, one in last n.

- Group C: count_i = 2, both in first n.

Now, for Group A, I have to choose elements from the last n.

For Group C, I have to choose elements from the first n.

For Group B, I can choose one element to go to l and one to r.

My goal is to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me consider that I can pair elements from Group B, since I have one in l and one in r.

If I choose both elements of a pair from Group B, one in l and one in r, their contributions to XOR(l) and XOR(r) will be the same.

Similarly, for Group A, choosing elements in r, and for Group C, choosing elements in l.

I need to select enough elements to make the total count 2k for l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize selecting pairs from Group B, since choosing both elements (one in l and one in r) ensures that their contributions to XOR(l) and XOR(r) are the same.

Similarly, for Group A, choosing both elements in r adds zero to XOR(r), and for Group C, choosing both in l adds zero to XOR(l).

So, perhaps I can start by selecting as many pairs from Group B as possible, and then fill the remaining spots with pairs from Group A and C.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and r.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements I need to select.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the XOR contributions.

Let me try to come up with an approach.

Step 1: Count the frequency of each number in the first n.

For each number from 1 to n, count how many times it appears in the first n elements.

This will tell me count_i for each i.

Then, for each i:

- If count_i = 2, both are in first n (Group C).

- If count_i = 1, one in first n and one in last n (Group B).

- If count_i = 0, both are in last n (Group A).

Step 2: Calculate the total available pairs from Group B.

Each i in Group B has one element in first n and one in last n.

I can choose to include both in l and r, which would add the same value to both XORs.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and r.

Wait, but each pair from Group B contributes two elements: one to l and one to r.

So, selecting m pairs from Group B would add m elements to l and m elements to r.

Similarly, selecting pairs from Group A would add 2 elements to r, and from Group C would add 2 elements to l.

Wait, but Group A and C have pairs that are both in r and l, respectively.

Wait, no:

- Group A: both elements are in last n, so selecting both would add two elements to r.

- Group C: both elements are in first n, so selecting both would add two elements to l.

- Group B: one element in first n and one in last n, so selecting both would add one element to l and one to r.

But I need to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

So, if I select m pairs from Group B, I add m elements to l and m elements to r.

Then, I need to select (2k - m) elements for l from Group C pairs, and (2k - m) elements for r from Group A pairs.

Wait, but Group C pairs give me two elements for l, and Group A pairs give me two elements for r.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of pairs.

Let me define:

- Let p_B be the number of pairs I select from Group B.

- Let p_C be the number of pairs I select from Group C.

- Let p_A be the number of pairs I select from Group A.

Then:

- Elements added to l: p_B + 2 * p_C.

- Elements added to r: p_B + 2 * p_A.

I need p_B + 2 * p_C = 2k and p_B + 2 * p_A = 2k.

So, p_B + 2 * p_C = p_B + 2 * p_A = 2k.

Which implies that p_B + 2 * p_C = p_B + 2 * p_A.

Subtracting p_B from both sides: 2 * p_C = 2 * p_A => p_C = p_A.

So, p_C = p_A.

Let me denote p = p_C = p_A.

Then, p_B + 2 * p = 2k.

So, p_B = 2k - 2 * p.

Since p_B must be non-negative, 2k - 2 * p >= 0 => p <= k.

Also, p_B must be less than or equal to the number of available Group B pairs.

Similarly, p_C and p_A must be less than or equal to the number of available Group C and A pairs, respectively.

So, I can choose p in a way that satisfies these constraints.

Then, p_B = 2k - 2 * p.

I need to choose p_B pairs from Group B, p_C = p pairs from Group C, and p_A = p pairs from Group A.

This way, l will have p_B + 2 * p_C = (2k - 2 * p) + 2 * p = 2k elements.

Similarly, r will have p_B + 2 * p_A = (2k - 2 * p) + 2 * p = 2k elements.

Now, I need to ensure that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Let me consider the XOR contributions:

- For each pair from Group B: choosing one element for l and one for r adds the same value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r).

- For each pair from Group C: choosing both elements for l adds their XOR to XOR(l). Since both elements are the same, their XOR is zero.

- For each pair from Group A: choosing both elements for r adds their XOR to XOR(r). Since both elements are the same, their XOR is zero.

So, the XOR of l is equal to the sum of the XORs of the Group B elements chosen for l.

Similarly, the XOR of r is equal to the sum of the XORs of the Group B elements chosen for r.

But since for each Group B pair, one element goes to l and one to r, their contributions to XOR(l) and XOR(r) are the same.

Therefore, the total XOR of l and r will be equal.

Hence, this approach should work.

So, the plan is:

1. Count the frequency of each number in the first n elements.

2. Classify the numbers into Group A, B, and C based on their frequencies.

3. Determine the number of pairs to select from Group B, A, and C:

- Choose p pairs from Group A and C (p <= min(number of Group A pairs, number of Group C pairs)).

- Set p_B = 2k - 2 * p.

- Ensure that p_B <= number of Group B pairs.

4. Select p_B pairs from Group B, p pairs from Group A, and p pairs from Group C.

5. Construct l and r accordingly.

This should ensure that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Let's think about how to implement this.

First, I need to count the frequency of each number in the first n elements.

I can create a frequency array of size n.

Then, for each number from 1 to n:

- If frequency[i] == 2, it's in Group C.

- If frequency[i] == 1, it's in Group B.

- If frequency[i] == 0, it's in Group A.

Then, I need to determine p and p_B.

I need to choose p such that p_B = 2k - 2 * p >= 0 and p_B <= number of Group B pairs.

Also, p <= number of Group A pairs and p <= number of Group C pairs.

So, p can be from 0 to min(k, number of Group A pairs, number of Group C pairs).

I need to choose the maximum possible p that satisfies p_B <= number of Group B pairs.

But since p_B = 2k - 2p, and it needs to be <= number of Group B pairs.

So, 2k - 2p <= number of Group B pairs.

Rearranged: 2p >= 2k - number of Group B pairs.

So, p >= ceil((2k - number of Group B pairs)/2).

But p can be at most min(k, number of Group A pairs, number of Group C pairs).

So, I need to choose p in the range:

max(ceil((2k - number of Group B pairs)/2), 0) <= p <= min(k, number of Group A pairs, number of Group C pairs).

And p should be an integer.

Once I choose p, then p_B = 2k - 2p.

Then, I select p_B pairs from Group B, p pairs from Group A, and p pairs from Group C.
