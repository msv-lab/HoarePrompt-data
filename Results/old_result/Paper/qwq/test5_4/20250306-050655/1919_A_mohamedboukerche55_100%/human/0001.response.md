Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets and they take turns making moves according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice and Bob have a certain number of coins in their wallets, let's say a and b respectively. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. Importantly, the wallet cannot have zero coins before removing one coin.

The player who cannot make a valid move loses. So, if a player has no coins in their wallet and cannot swap to get coins, they lose.

I need to determine, for given values of a and b, who will win the game if both play optimally.

Looking at the sample input and output, there are multiple test cases, each with different values of a and b, and the expected output is either "Alice" or "Bob".

First, I need to think about the game mechanics and find a pattern or a formula that can help determine the winner without simulating the entire game, especially since a and b can be up to 10^9, which would make any simulation too slow.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if I can find a pattern.

Test case 1:

a = 1, b = 1

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, she gets b=1 and bob gets a=1. Then she removes 1 coin, so a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap, he removes 1 coin, so a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: Both wallets are empty, so she cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Alternative scenario:

- Alice chooses not to swap. Then a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has to choose not to swap (since a=0, swapping wouldn't help), removes 1 coin, so a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

Test case 2:

a = 1, b = 4

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=4, b=1. She then removes 1 coin, so a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses to swap, a=1, b=3. He removes 1 coin, so a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she chooses not to swap, a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: He has 2 coins. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: She has 0 coins, so she must choose to swap to get b=1. After swapping, a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He removes 1 coin, so a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Alice wins in this case. So maybe my reasoning is incorrect.

Let me try again.

Alternative path:

- Alice chooses to swap, a=4, b=1. Then removes 1 coin, a=3, b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap, a=1, b=3. Removes 1 coin, a=1, b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap, a=0, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap, a=0, b=1.

- Alice chooses to swap, a=0, b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

But sample output says Alice wins. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Bob makes a mistake in choosing to swap when he has 1 coin. Maybe he should choose not to swap.

Let's try that.

- Alice chooses to swap, a=4, b=1. Removes 1 coin, a=3, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap, since swapping would give him a=3 and b=1, which is the same. He removes 1 coin, a=3, b=0.

- Alice's turn: She has 3 coins. She chooses not to swap, a=2, b=0.

- Bob cannot make a move since b=0. Alice wins.

Ah, so in this path, Alice wins. So perhaps the choice of whether to swap or not is crucial.

This suggests that the outcome depends on the parity of the sum of a and b.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

1. 1 1 -> Bob

2. 1 4 -> Alice

3. 5 3 -> Bob

4. 4 5 -> Alice

5. 11 9 -> Bob

6. 83 91 -> Bob

7. 1032 9307 -> Alice

8. 839204 7281 -> Alice

9. 1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

10. 53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at the sums:

1. 2 -> Bob

2. 5 -> Alice

3. 8 -> Bob

4. 9 -> Alice

5. 20 -> Bob

6. 174 -> Bob

7. 1032 + 9307 = 10339 -> Alice

8. 839204 + 7281 = 846485 -> Alice

9. 2000000000 -> Bob

10. 53110 + 2024 = 55134 -> Bob

It seems that when the sum of a and b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Wait, in test case 2, a=1, b=4, sum=5, which is odd, and Alice wins.

In test case 3, a=5, b=3, sum=8, even, Bob wins.

In test case 4, a=4, b=5, sum=9, odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for all the sample inputs.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If a + b is even, Bob wins.

- If a + b is odd, Alice wins.

This seems too simple. Is there a flaw in this reasoning?

Let me check with another test case.

Suppose a=2, b=2.

Sum is 4, even. According to this, Bob wins.

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: She has 2 coins. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=2, b=2. She removes 1 coin, a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: He has 2 coins. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap, a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she chooses not to swap, a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He chooses not to swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins, which matches the rule.

Another test case: a=2, b=3, sum=5, odd. According to the rule, Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=3.

- She chooses to swap: a=3, b=2. Removes 1 coin, a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=2.

- She chooses not to swap: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She chooses to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Wait, according to my rule, Alice should win, but in this simulation, Bob wins.

Hmm, maybe my rule is wrong.

Alternative simulation:

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=3.

- He chooses to swap: a=3, b=1.

- Removes 1 coin: a=2, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1.

- She chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She chooses to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins, which contradicts the rule.

Wait, perhaps the rule is more nuanced.

Let me think in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the Sprague-Grundy theorem might apply.

But this seems complicated for the time being. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the number of moves possible.

Each move consists of removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty.

So, the total number of moves possible is a + b.

Since Alice starts, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins; if even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

Wait, but in the first test case, a=1, b=1, total moves=2, which is even, so Bob wins, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a=1, b=4, total moves=5, which is odd, so Alice wins, matching the sample output.

In the third test case, a=5, b=3, total moves=8, even, Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4, b=5, total moves=9, odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold.

So, the winner depends on the parity of a + b.

If a + b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This seems to be the pattern.

Let me verify with the earlier conflicting test case: a=2, b=3, sum=5, odd, Alice wins, which matched in the simulation if done correctly.

Earlier simulations seemed to indicate Bob wins, but perhaps I made a mistake in simulation.

Let me try again:

- Alice starts with a=2, b=3.

- She chooses to swap: a=3, b=2. Removes 1 coin, a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=2.

- She chooses not to swap: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She chooses to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Wait, according to this, Bob wins, but according to the parity rule, Alice should win since a + b = 5, which is odd.

There's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the XOR of a and b, as in Nim games.

But in Nim, the XOR of pile sizes determines the winner.

Here, since each player can choose to swap or not, it might be more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on the difference between a and b.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that swapping allows the player to choose which pile to deplete.

In standard Nim games, the number of coins corresponds to heap sizes, and players can remove coins from one heap per turn.

But here, players can choose to swap heaps and then remove one coin from their current heap.

This added swapping complexity might alter the game's outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps swapping allows the player to mirror the opponent's move.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Given the pattern in the sample inputs and outputs, it seems that the parity of a + b determines the winner.

Given that, perhaps the initial program is correct.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

s = input()

a = int(list(s.split())[0])

b = int(list(s.split())[1])

if (a + b) % 2 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

This program checks if the sum of a and b is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, "Alice".

Given that in all sample test cases, this seems to hold, perhaps this is the correct approach.

But in my earlier simulation with a=2, b=3, according to this program, Alice should win, but in my simulation, Bob won.

Wait, perhaps my simulation was incorrect.

Let me try simulating again.

Alternative simulation for a=2, b=3:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=3.

- She chooses not to swap: a=1, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=3.

- He chooses to swap: a=3, b=1.

- Removes 1 coin: a=2, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1.

- She chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She chooses to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

This contradicts the parity rule.

Wait, but according to the sample outputs, when a + b is odd, Alice wins, but in this simulation, Bob wins.

So perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, in the sample input and output, for a=1, b=4 (sum=5, odd), Alice wins, and for a=2, b=3 (sum=5, odd), according to the program, Alice should win, but in my simulation, Bob wins.

This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my simulation.

Let me try another simulation for a=2, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=3.

- She chooses to swap: a=3, b=2.

- Removes 1 coin: a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=2.

- She chooses not to swap: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She chooses to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1.

- He chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move. Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins, which contradicts the program's output for a + b odd.

This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex than just the parity of a + b.

Perhaps I need to consider the binary representations or some other property.

Alternatively, maybe the program is correct and my simulation is wrong.

Wait, in the sample input, a=1, b=4 (sum=5, odd), Alice wins, and a=2, b=3 (sum=5, odd), according to the program, Alice should win, but in my simulation, Bob wins.

This inconsistency suggests that either the program is incorrect or my simulation is flawed.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps swapping allows Alice to manipulate the game in a way that the sum's parity isn't the only deciding factor.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical proof for the sum's parity determining the winner.

Given that the program seems to pass the sample inputs, and the explanation provided in the problem statement's note also seems to suggest that the sum's parity is the deciding factor, perhaps the program is correct.

In that case, despite my simulation suggesting otherwise for a=2, b=3, perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the steps.

Therefore, I should conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
