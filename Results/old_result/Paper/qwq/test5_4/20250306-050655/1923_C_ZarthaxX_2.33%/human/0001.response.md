Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, which is defined based on whether you can find another array B that meets certain conditions compared to array A. The conditions are:

1. The sum of elements in A should be equal to the sum of elements in B.

2. Every element in A should be different from the corresponding element in B.

3. Every element in B should be greater than zero.

And I'm given an array C, which is of length N, and each element in C is greater than zero. Then, there are Q queries, each asking whether a subarray from index L to R in C is "good" based on the above definition.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good." So, for a subarray C[L...R], I need to check if there exists an array B of the same length such that:

- Sum of B equals sum of C[L...R].

- Every B[i] is different from C[i].

- Every B[i] > 0.

I need to process multiple test cases, each with its own N, Q, array C, and Q queries.

Looking at the constraints:

- T (number of test cases) can be up to 10^4.

- N and Q can be up to 3*10^5 each.

- The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5, and the same for Q.

This suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(N + Q) time complexity or something close, because T can be up to 10^4, and N and Q up to 3*10^5 per test case, but with the sum over all test cases being limited.

Alright, so the key is to find an efficient way to answer whether a subarray is "good" or not.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions for a subarray to be "good."

Given a subarray C[L...R], I need to find another array B of the same length such that:

- Sum of B equals sum of C[L...R].

- For every index in B, B[i] != C[i].

- For every index, B[i] > 0.

So, essentially, for each element in C[L...R], I need to choose a B[i] that's different from C[i] and positive, and the sum of all B[i] should equal the sum of C[L...R].

Hmm, interesting.

Let me think about what this implies.

First, since B[i] has to be positive and different from C[i], if C[i] is 1, then B[i] can be any positive integer except 1. So, B[i] can be 2, 3, 4, etc.

If C[i] is greater than 1, then B[i] can be any positive integer except C[i].

The goal is to choose B[i] for each i in such a way that the sum remains the same as the sum of C[L...R].

Wait a minute, so the sum should remain the same, but each B[i] is different from C[i].

This sounds a bit like a problem where you have to adjust each element by some value, but ensure that the total sum doesn't change.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for B.

Since B[i] has to be positive and different from C[i], the minimal B[i] would be:

- If C[i] == 1, then B[i] >= 2.

- If C[i] > 1, then B[i] >= 1, but not equal to C[i].

Wait, no. B[i] has to be positive and different from C[i].

So, for C[i] == 1, B[i] >= 2.

For C[i] > 1, B[i] >= 1, but B[i] != C[i].

But to minimize the sum of B, I would choose B[i] as small as possible, given these constraints.

So, for each C[i]:

- If C[i] == 1, choose B[i] = 2.

- If C[i] > 1, choose B[i] = 1 if possible, otherwise the next smallest integer greater than 1 that's not equal to C[i].

Wait, but to minimize the sum, I should choose the smallest possible B[i] that is different from C[i] and positive.

So, for C[i] == 1, B[i] = 2.

For C[i] > 1, B[i] = 1, since 1 is positive and different from C[i] (since C[i] > 1).

Wait, but C[i] > 1, so B[i] can be 1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, the minimal sum of B would be sum of minimal B[i] for each i.

That is:

Minimal B[i]:

- If C[i] == 1, B[i] = 2.

- If C[i] > 1, B[i] = 1.

If the sum of minimal B[i] equals the sum of C[L...R], then it's possible to choose such a B.

But, there might be cases where even choosing the minimal B[i], the sum is less than or equal to the sum of C[L...R].

Wait, but in this case, since we are choosing minimal B[i], if their sum equals the sum of C[L...R], then it's possible.

If the sum of minimal B[i] is less than the sum of C[L...R], then perhaps it's still possible by choosing larger B[i], but ensuring that the sum matches.

Wait, but the problem is to have the sum equal to the sum of C[L...R].

So, if the sum of minimal B[i] is less than the sum of C[L...R], then perhaps I can increase some B[i] to make the total sum equal to sum of C[L...R].

But, I need to ensure that B[i] != C[i] for all i.

Wait, but if I choose B[i] = minimal B[i] for all i, and their sum is less than sum of C[L...R], then perhaps I can increase some B[i] (while keeping B[i] != C[i]) to make up the difference.

But, I need to make sure that I can do this without violating B[i] != C[i].

Let me think about this.

Suppose I calculate the sum of minimal B[i]:

sum_min_B = sum of (2 if C[i] == 1 else 1) for i in [L, R]

If sum_min_B == sum_C, then it's possible to choose B[i] as the minimal B[i], and their sum matches.

If sum_min_B < sum_C, then I need to increase some B[i] to make the sum equal to sum_C.

But, when increasing B[i], I need to make sure that B[i] != C[i].

Given that minimal B[i] is already different from C[i], and I'm increasing B[i], as long as I don't set B[i] equal to C[i], it should be fine.

So, for example, if C[i] == 1, minimal B[i] = 2. To increase B[i], I can set it to 3,4,5,... as long as it's not 1.

If C[i] > 1, minimal B[i] = 1. To increase B[i], I can set it to 2,3,4,... as long as it's not C[i].

So, in this case, as long as sum_min_B <= sum_C, it should be possible to adjust some B[i] to make the sum equal to sum_C.

Wait, but there might be a constraint on how much I can increase B[i].

Wait, no, since B[i] can be arbitrarily large, as long as it's positive and not equal to C[i], I can set it to sum_C - (sum of other B[i]).

But, I need to ensure that B[i] > 0 and B[i] != C[i].

Wait, but if I have sum_min_B <= sum_C, then I can adjust the B[i] to make the sum equal to sum_C.

Hence, the condition for the subarray to be "good" is sum_min_B <= sum_C.

But, there might be some edge cases where this doesn't hold.

Wait, let's consider an example.

Take the example from the problem:

Test case:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Answers:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's see for each query:

Query 1: L=1, R=5, subarray: 1,2,1,4,5

sum_C = 1+2+1+4+5 = 13

sum_min_B:

For C[i]=1: B[i]=2

For C[i]=2: B[i]=1

For C[i]=1: B[i]=2

For C[i]=4: B[i]=1

For C[i]=5: B[i]=1

sum_min_B = 2+1+2+1+1 = 7

7 <= 13, so sum_min_B <= sum_C, hence YES.

Query 2: L=4, R=4, subarray: 4

sum_C = 4

sum_min_B = 1 (since C[i]=4, B[i]=1)

1 <= 4, so should be YES, but the answer is NO. Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hmm, so there's something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, in this case, sum_min_B =1 <= sum_C=4, but the answer is NO.

So, my condition is not sufficient.

There must be something else to consider.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to consider the number of ones in the subarray.

Wait, in the second query, subarray is just [4], sum_C=4, sum_min_B=1.

But, I can set B[i]=1, which is different from C[i]=4, and sum is 1, which is less than 4.

But, I need sum to be equal to 4.

So, I need to increase B[i] from 1 to make the sum equal to 4.

But, in this case, I can set B[i]=4+1=5, but wait, B[i] can't be equal to C[i], which is 4.

Wait, no, C[i]=4, so B[i] can be any positive integer except 4.

So, I can set B[i]=5, which is different from 4, and sum is 5, which is greater than 4.

But, I need sum to be exactly 4.

Wait, but I only have one element in the subarray.

So, I need B[i]=4, but B[i] can't be equal to C[i]=4.

So, I can't set B[i] to 4, but I need the sum to be 4.

But, B[i] can't be 4, so it's impossible.

Hence, NO.

Ah, I see.

So, in this case, since there's only one element, and C[i]=4, B[i] can't be 4, so no matter what B[i] I choose (as long as it's not 4 and positive), the sum can't be equal to 4.

Hence, NO.

So, in general, for a subarray with only one element, it's impossible unless C[i] is such that there exists a B[i] != C[i] and B[i] > 0, and sum is equal to C[i].

But, in this specific case, C[i]=4, B[i] can't be 4, so can't have B[i]=4, hence NO.

Wait, but if C[i]=1, and subarray has only one element, then sum_C=1, sum_min_B=2, which is greater than sum_C, so can't make sum equal to 1.

Hence, NO.

Wait, but in this case, sum_min_B=2 > sum_C=1, so it's impossible to have sum_B =1 when minimal possible sum_B=2.

Hence, NO.

So, in general, for subarrays with only one element, it's impossible because either sum_min_B > sum_C or B[i] can't be equal to C[i].

Hence, the condition I had earlier is not sufficient.

I need to consider the length of the subarray as well.

Specifically, for subarrays of length 1, it's impossible because:

- If C[i] ==1, sum_min_B=2 > sum_C=1, impossible.

- If C[i] >1, B[i] can't be equal to C[i], so can't set B[i]=C[i], hence can't make sum_B = sum_C.

Hence, for subarrays of length 1, it's always NO.

Wait, but in the example, for L=3,R=4, subarray:1,4

sum_C=5

sum_min_B=2+1=3

3 <=5, so YES.

For L=1,R=3:1,2,1

sum_C=4

sum_min_B=2+1+2=5 >4, so NO.

Wait, but in this case, sum_min_B > sum_C, which contradicts my earlier thought that sum_min_B <= sum_C is the condition.

Wait, in the first query, sum_min_B=7 <= sum_C=13, YES.

Second query, sum_min_B=1 < sum_C=4, but NO.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the difference between sum_C and sum_min_B.

Wait, in the first query, sum_C - sum_min_B =13-7=6.

In the second query, sum_C - sum_min_B=4-1=3.

But, in the second query, since the subarray length is 1, it's impossible to adjust B[i] to make sum_B=4, as B[i] can't be equal to C[i].

Hence, perhaps for subarrays of length 1, it's always NO.

For subarrays of length >=2, it's possible if sum_min_B <= sum_C.

Wait, but in the third query, L=3,R=4: subarray 1,4

sum_C=5

sum_min_B=2+1=3

3 <=5, so YES.

In the fourth query, L=1,R=3:1,2,1

sum_C=4

sum_min_B=2+1+2=5 >4, so NO.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, for subarrays of length >=2, it's possible if sum_min_B <= sum_C.

But in the third query, sum_min_B=3 <= sum_C=5, YES.

In the fourth query, sum_min_B=5 > sum_C=4, NO.

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

- If the subarray length is 1, NO.

- If the subarray length >=2, and sum_min_B <= sum_C, then YES, else NO.

This seems to align with the example.

Wait, but in the second query, L=4,R=4: subarray 4

sum_C=4

sum_min_B=1 < sum_C=4, but answer is NO.

Hence, for length 1, it's always NO, regardless of sum_min_B and sum_C.

For length >=2, it's YES if sum_min_B <= sum_C, else NO.

Hence, the condition is:

- If R-L+1 ==1, NO.

- Else, if sum_min_B <= sum_C, YES, else NO.

Wait, but in the fourth query, L=1,R=3: length=3 >=2, sum_min_B=5 > sum_C=4, so NO.

Third query, L=3,R=4: length=2, sum_min_B=3 <= sum_C=5, YES.

First query, L=1,R=5: length=5 >=2, sum_min_B=7 <= sum_C=13, YES.

Second query, L=4,R=4: length=1, NO.

Hence, this seems consistent.

Hence, the condition is:

- If the subarray length is 1, always NO.

- Else, if sum_min_B <= sum_C, YES, else NO.

Where sum_min_B is sum of (2 if C[i]==1 else 1) for i in [L,R].

And sum_C is sum of C[i] for i in [L,R].

Hence, to implement this efficiently, I need to compute sum_C and sum_min_B for each query [L,R].

Given that N and Q can be up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute these sums for arbitrary subarrays.

Hence, I can precompute prefix sums for sum_C and sum_min_B.

Let me define:

- prefix_sum_C[i] = sum of C[1 to i]

- prefix_sum_min_B[i] = sum of minimal B[1 to i]

Then, for a query [L,R]:

sum_C = prefix_sum_C[R] - prefix_sum_C[L-1]

sum_min_B = prefix_sum_min_B[R] - prefix_sum_min_B[L-1]

Then, check:

- If (R-L+1)==1, NO

- Else if sum_min_B <= sum_C, YES

- Else, NO

This should be efficient enough, as precomputing the prefix sums takes O(N), and answering each query takes O(1).

Given that T can be up to 10^4, but the sum of N and Q over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, this should be acceptable.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the program:

def func_1():

(n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))

nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]

sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]

for i in range(1, n + 1):

ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)

sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1

for _ in range(q):

(l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))

if l == r:

print('NO')

continue

onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]

sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]

if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it defines ones[] and sum[] as prefix arrays.

ones[i] counts the number of 1's in nums[1 to i]

sum[i] seems to be sum of (nums[j] -1) for j in 1 to i.

Wait, sum[i] = sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] -1

Hence, sum[i] is prefix sum of (nums[j] -1) from j=1 to i.

Then, for each query [L,R]:

- If L==R, print 'NO'

- Else:

- onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l-1] // number of 1's in [L,R]

- sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l-1] // sum of (nums[j]-1) for j in [L,R]

- Then, check if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange

Wait, let's simplify that:

2 * onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Because 2*ones - ones = ones.

So, it's checking if onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sumInRange

But, sumInRange is sum of (nums[j] -1) for j in [L,R]

Hence, sumInRange = sum of nums[j] - sum of 1's in [L,R]

Wait, sum of 1's in [L,R] is (r - l +1)

Hence, sumInRange = sum_C - (r - l +1)

Wait, no.

Wait, sumInRange = sum of (nums[j] -1) for j in [L,R]

Which is sum_C - (r - l +1)

Hence, the condition is:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

Which simplifies to:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

=> onesInRange + 2*(r - l +1) <= sum_C

But, onesInRange is the number of 1's in [L,R]

And sum_C is the sum of nums[L,R]

Wait, is this equivalent to sum_min_B <= sum_C?

Wait, sum_min_B is sum of (2 if nums[j]==1 else 1) for j in [L,R]

Hence, sum_min_B = 2*onesInRange + (r - l +1 - onesInRange) = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Which matches the left-hand side of the condition.

And sum_C is sum of nums[j] for j in [L,R]

Hence, the condition is sum_min_B <= sum_C, which is what I derived earlier.

Hence, this seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if sum_min_B <= sumInRange, where sumInRange = sum_C - (r - l +1)

Wait, hold on.

sumInRange = sum_C - (r - l +1)

sum_min_B = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Hence, the condition is:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

Which simplifies to:

onesInRange + 2*(r - l +1) <= sum_C

But earlier, I thought sum_min_B = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Wait, no, actually, sum_min_B = 2*onesInRange + (r - l +1 - onesInRange) = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Yes, that's correct.

Hence, the condition in the code is equivalent to sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

But, according to my earlier reasoning, it should be sum_min_B <= sum_C.

Hence, there seems to be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me recast the condition.

sum_min_B = onesInRange*2 + (r - l +1 - onesInRange)*1 = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

sum_C = sum of nums[j] for j in [L,R]

sumInRange = sum_C - (r - l +1)

Hence, the condition in the code is:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

Which is equivalent to:

sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

But, according to my earlier reasoning, it should be sum_min_B <= sum_C

Hence, the condition in the code seems off.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Wait, perhaps the prefix_sum_min_B is defined differently.

Wait, in the code, sum[i] = sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] -1

Hence, sum[i] is the prefix sum of (nums[j] -1) for j in 1 to i

Hence, sum[r] - sum[l-1] = sum of (nums[j] -1) for j in l to r

Which is sum_C - (r - l +1)

Hence, sumInRange = sum_C - (r - l +1)

Then, sum_min_B = onesInRange*2 + (r - l +1 - onesInRange)*1 = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

Hence, the condition in the code is:

sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

But, according to my earlier reasoning, it should be sum_min_B <= sum_C

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to think about it.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sum_min_B.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

Wait, but according to my earlier thought process, it should be sum_min_B <= sum_C

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the example, in the first query:

sum_min_B =7 <= sum_C=13, which is sum_C - (5) =13-5=8

Wait, sumInRange=13-5=8

Hence, 7 <=8, which is true, and answer is YES.

In the third query:

sum_min_B=3 <= sum_C=5 -2=3, which is 3<=3, YES.

In the fourth query:

sum_min_B=5 <= sum_C=4 -3=1, which is 5<=1, which is false, NO.

Hence, it seems consistent with the answers.

Wait, in the third query, sum_C=5, r-l+1=2, sum_C -2=3, sum_min_B=3 <=3, YES.

In the fourth query, sum_C=4, r-l+1=3, sum_C -3=1, sum_min_B=5 >1, NO.

Hence, it seems that the condition sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1) is equivalent to sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1), which seems to be working for the example.

But, is this the correct condition?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that sum_min_B is the minimal sum of B[i], where B[i] is 2 if C[i]==1, else 1.

But, in reality, B[i] can be greater than that, as long as B[i] != C[i] and B[i]>0.

Hence, to make sum_B equal to sum_C, I need sum_B = sum_C.

Given that sum_B >= sum_min_B, and sum_B can be increased by increasing some B[i] beyond their minimal values, as long as sum_min_B <= sum_C.

But, in the code, it's checking sum_min_B <= sum_C - (r - l +1)

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look
