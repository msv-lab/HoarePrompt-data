Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a game where I'm at point 0 on a straight line, and there are n monsters at different positions, each with some health. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 per bullet. After I shoot, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all living monsters move one step closer to me. If any monster reaches me (point 0), I lose. The question is whether I can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, targeting any monster any number of times, as long as the total doesn't exceed k.

2. Monsters with health <= 0 die.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

The goal is to ensure that no monster reaches me before I can eliminate them all.

Looking at the input:

- t test cases.

- For each test case:

- n (number of monsters) and k (maximum bullets I can shoot per second).

- List of a_i (health of each monster).

- List of x_i (positions of monsters), all unique, x_i != 0, and sorted in increasing order.

Constraints:

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5.

- Time and space constraints suggest an efficient algorithm is needed.

Output:

- For each test case, print "YES" if I can kill all monsters before any reaches me, else "NO".

Looking at the example:

Test case 1:

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

Possible steps:

- Second 1: Shoot 1 bullet at monster 1 (health 1 at x=-1), and 1 bullet at monster 3 (health 3 at x=3). After shooting, monster 1 dies (health 0), monsters 2 and 3 move to x=1 and x=2.

- Second 2: Shoot 2 bullets at monster 2 (health 2 at x=1). After shooting, monster 2 dies (health 0), monster 3 moves to x=1.

- Second 3: Shoot 2 bullets at monster 3 (health 2 at x=1). After shooting, monster 3 dies (health 0).

So, all monsters are eliminated in 3 seconds without any reaching me.

Test case 2:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,1]

x=[-1,1]

- Second 1: Shoot 1 bullet at either monster. Suppose I shoot monster 1 (health 1 at x=-1), it dies. Monster 2 moves to x=0 and kills me.

- Alternatively, if I shoot monster 2, it dies, and monster 1 moves to x=0 and kills me.

So, no matter what, I lose.

From this, I need a strategy to decide which monsters to shoot when to maximize the chance of eliminating them all before any reaches me.

Initial thoughts:

- Monsters closer to me are more threatening because they require fewer steps to reach me.

- However, monsters with higher health need more bullets over time.

- I have to balance between shooting high-health monsters and shooting monsters that are close to me.

- Since I can shoot up to k bullets per second, I need to manage the total bullets used over time.

- The time available to eliminate a monster is related to its distance from me.

- For a monster at position x, it will take |x| seconds to reach me.

- So, for a monster at x, I have |x| seconds to eliminate it.

- If a monster has health h, and I can shoot up to k bullets per second, then I need at least ceil(h/k) seconds to eliminate it.

- But since I can distribute bullets among monsters each second, it's more complex.

- I need to ensure that for each monster, the total bullets I shoot at it over the time it's alive is at least its health.

- Also, I need to consider the movement of monsters over time.

A key insight:

- The time available to eliminate a monster is equal to its initial distance from me (in terms of steps).

- So, for a monster at position x, I have |x| steps to eliminate it.

- I need to allocate enough bullets to it over those |x| steps.

- The problem is to distribute the bullets over time such that the total bullets allocated to each monster is at least its health, and the bullets allocated each second do not exceed k.

- This sounds like a scheduling problem where each monster has a deadline (its distance) and a required amount of bullets (its health).

An approach:

- Sort the monsters based on their distance from me, i.e., |x_i|, in ascending order.

- This is because monsters that are closer have stricter deadlines.

- Then, iterate through the monsters in this order, accumulating the total health that needs to be eliminated by a certain time.

- Keep track of the total bullets used up to each time step, ensuring that at no point does the cumulative bullets exceed k * time.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the maximum bullets required per second.

Alternative approach:

- Consider that each monster requires a certain amount of bullets spread over a certain number of seconds.

- The bullets allocated to a monster cannot be more than k per second.

- But since I can allocate bullets to multiple monsters each second, I need to distribute the k bullets optimally.

This seems complicated.

Another thought:

- Suppose I consider the monsters in order of their distance, from smallest to largest.

- For each monster, I have a certain number of seconds to eliminate it, equal to its distance.

- I need to allocate its required health bullets within those seconds.

- But I also need to consider that while allocating bullets to one monster, I might also be allocating bullets to others who have overlapping time frames.

This seems like a classic scheduling problem, possibly similar to scheduling tasks with deadlines.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

In the first test case:

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

Sorted by |x|: monster 1 at x=-1, monster 2 at x=2, monster 3 at x=3.

- Monster 1: health=1, time=1 second.

- Need to allocate 1 bullet in 1 second.

- Monster 2: health=2, time=2 seconds.

- Need to allocate 2 bullets in 2 seconds.

- Monster 3: health=3, time=3 seconds.

- Need to allocate 3 bullets in 3 seconds.

Total bullets needed over time:

- Second 1: allocate 1 to monster 1, and 1 to monster 2 and/or 3.

- Second 2: allocate 1 to monster 2 and/or monster 3.

- Second 3: allocate 1 to monster 3.

Total bullets used each second:

- Second 1: 2 bullets (within k=2).

- Second 2: 1 bullet.

- Second 3: 1 bullet.

All monsters are eliminated in time.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,1]

x=[-1,1]

Sorted by |x|: monster 1 at x=-1, monster 2 at x=1.

- Monster 1: health=1, time=1 second.

- Need to allocate 1 bullet in 1 second.

- Monster 2: health=1, time=1 second.

- Need to allocate 1 bullet in 1 second.

But k=1, so in the first second, I can only shoot 1 bullet.

- If I shoot monster 1, it dies, but monster 2 moves to x=0 and kills me.

- If I shoot monster 2, it dies, but monster 1 moves to x=0 and kills me.

Hence, "NO".

From this, it seems that just allocating the required bullets within their time frames isn't sufficient; there's an interaction between the monsters' deadlines.

A better approach:

- Sort the monsters by their distance from me, i.e., |x_i| in ascending order.

- For each monster, calculate the time available to eliminate it, which is |x_i|.

- The total health that needs to be eliminated by time t is the sum of healths of all monsters with |x_i| <= t.

- At each time step t, the maximum number of bullets I can use is k.

- So, I need to ensure that the cumulative health of monsters with |x_i| <= t is less than or equal to k * t.

Wait, but that might not capture the exact requirement.

Wait, actually, for each time t, the sum of healths of monsters that have |x_i| <= t must be less than or equal to k * t.

Because by time t, all monsters with |x_i| <= t must have been eliminated, and to eliminate them, I need to have shot at least their total health in the first t seconds.

But I have to consider that some monsters may require more bullets than others, and I have to distribute the k bullets per second accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to checking if the total health of monsters up to time t is less than or equal to k * t.

Let me verify this with the first sample input:

t=3

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

Sorted by |x|: monster 1 (x=-1, h=1), monster 2 (x=2, h=2), monster 3 (x=3, h=3)

At t=1:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=1: monster 1 (h=1)

- Total health: 1

- k * t = 2 *1 =2

- 1 <=2, okay.

At t=2:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=2: monster 1 (h=1), monster 2 (h=2)

- Total health: 1+2=3

- k * t =2*2=4

- 3<=4, okay.

At t=3:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=3: monster 1 (h=1), monster 2 (h=2), monster 3 (h=3)

- Total health: 1+2+3=6

- k * t =2*3=6

- 6<=6, okay.

Hence, "YES".

In the second sample input:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,1]

x=[-1,1]

Sorted by |x|: monster 1 (x=-1, h=1), monster 2 (x=1, h=1)

At t=1:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=1: monster 1 and monster 2

- Total health:1+1=2

- k * t=1*1=1

- 2 >1, not okay.

Hence, "NO".

This seems to hold.

So, the approach is:

- Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

- Iterate through the sorted list, keeping a running sum of health.

- For each time t (from 1 to the maximum |x_i|), check if the cumulative health up to that time is less than or equal to k * t.

- If at any time the cumulative health exceeds k * t, it's "NO".

- If for all t, cumulative health <= k * t, it's "YES".

This seems efficient, with O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for the iteration per test case.

Let me verify this with another test case.

Test case 3:

n=4, k=10

a=[3,4,2,5]

x=[-3,-2,1,3]

Sorted by |x|: monster 2 (x=-2, h=4), monster 3 (x=1, h=2), monster 1 (x=-3, h=3), monster 4 (x=3, h=5)

At t=1:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=1: monster 3 (h=2)

- Cumulative health:2

- k*t=10*1=10

- 2<=10, okay.

At t=2:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=2: monster 2 (h=4), monster 3 (h=2)

- Cumulative health:4+2=6

- k*t=20

- 6<=20, okay.

At t=3:

- Monsters with |x_i| <=3: monster 2 (h=4), monster 3 (h=2), monster 1 (h=3), monster 4 (h=5)

- Cumulative health:4+2+3+5=14

- k*t=30

- 14<=30, okay.

Hence, "YES".

Test case 4:

n=5, k=3

a=[2,1,3,2,5]

x=[-3,-2,3,4,5]

Sorted by |x|: monster 2 (x=-2, h=1), monster 5 (x=3, h=5), monster 3 (x=3, h=3), monster 4 (x=4, h=2), monster 1 (x=-3, h=2)

Wait, x is sorted in increasing order, and we need to sort by |x|.

Given x=[-3,-2,3,4,5], sorted by |x|: -2,3,-3,4,5

So, positions in order: x=-2 (h=1), x=3 (h=5), x=-3 (h=2), x=4 (h=2), x=5 (h=5)

At t=1:

- No monsters with |x_i|=1, so cumulative health=0

- k*t=3*1=3

- 0<=3, okay.

At t=2:

- Monsters with |x_i|<=2: x=-2 (h=1)

- Cumulative health:1

- k*t=6

- 1<=6, okay.

At t=3:

- Monsters with |x_i|<=3: x=-2 (h=1), x=3 (h=5), x=-3 (h=2)

- Cumulative health:1+5+2=8

- k*t=9

- 8<=9, okay.

At t=4:

- Monsters with |x_i|<=4: x=-2 (h=1), x=3 (h=5), x=-3 (h=2), x=4 (h=2)

- Cumulative health:1+5+2+2=10

- k*t=12

- 10<=12, okay.

At t=5:

- All monsters: cumulative health=1+5+2+2+5=15

- k*t=15

- 15<=15, okay.

Hence, "YES".

Test case 5:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,2]

x=[1,2]

Sorted by |x|: x=1 (h=1), x=2 (h=2)

At t=1:

- Monsters with |x_i|<=1: x=1 (h=1)

- Cumulative health:1

- k*t=1*1=1

- 1<=1, okay.

At t=2:

- Monsters with |x_i|<=2: x=1 (h=1), x=2 (h=2)

- Cumulative health:1+2=3

- k*t=1*2=2

- 3>2, not okay.

Hence, "NO".

This seems consistent with the sample outputs.

Edge cases to consider:

- All monsters are at the same distance.

- For example, n=3, k=3, a=[1,1,1], x=[-1,-1,-1]

- At t=1:

- Cumulative health:1+1+1=3

- k*t=3*1=3

- 3<=3, okay.

- So, "YES".

- Another case: n=1, k=1, a=[1], x=[1]

- At t=1:

- Cumulative health:1

- k*t=1*1=1

- 1<=1, okay.

- So, "YES".

- Case where k is very large: k >= sum of all a_i

- In this case, it's always "YES", since I can shoot all bullets in one second.

- Case where k is small: k < sum of a_i / max(|x_i|)

- Need to check if the cumulative health up to each t is <= k*t.

Potential optimization:

- Since the positions are sorted and x_i != 0, and -n <= x_i <=n, we can efficiently sort by |x_i|.

- Use a list to store monsters sorted by |x_i|.

- Iterate through this list, keeping a running sum of health and checking against k*t.

Possible error-prone parts:

- Handling negative positions correctly when sorting by |x_i|.

- Ensuring that t starts from 1 and increments correctly.

- Correctly calculating k*t for each step.

- Managing large inputs efficiently, given the constraints.

- Making sure that the sum of health doesn't cause integer overflow, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.

Implementing this:

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the list of a_i and x_i.

- Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable to keep track of cumulative health.

- Iterate through the sorted monsters, for each monster at time t = |x_i|:

- Add its health to the cumulative health.

- Check if cumulative health <= k * t.

- If at any point cumulative health > k * t, set success to False and break.

- After processing all monsters, print "YES" if success, else "NO".

Potential improvements:

- Since positions are sorted in increasing order and x_i != 0, we can create a list of (|x_i|, a_i) and sort it by |x_i|.

- But since x_i are unique and sorted, we can create a list of (|x_i|, a_i), sort it, and proceed.

- However, to optimize, we can iterate through x_i in order, calculate |x_i|, and since positions are sorted, |x_i| are either increasing or decreasing in magnitude, depending on the sign.

Wait, but positions are given in increasing order, and x_i != 0.

So, positions can be negative or positive, but sorted in increasing order.

To sort by |x_i|, we can create a list of (|x_i|, a_i), sort it by the first element, and then proceed.

Implementing this logic should solve the problem efficiently.

Hence, the given program seems correct based on this reasoning.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches our character in a game scenario involving health-depletion and movement of monsters towards the player.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are positioned at point 0 on a straight line.
   - There are `n` monsters, each with health `a_i` and initial position `x_i`.
   - Each second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets at any monsters, reducing their health by 1 per bullet.
   - After shooting, any monster with health ≤ 0 dies.
   - Remaining monsters move one step closer to us.
   - If any monster reaches us (point 0), we lose.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Each monster has a deadline (time to reach us), which is the absolute value of its position `|x_i|`.
   - We need to ensure that the cumulative health of all monsters that can reach us by time `t` can be eliminated within `t` seconds, given that we can shoot up to `k` bullets per second.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Sort the Monsters:** Arrange the monsters based on their distance from us (`|x_i|`) in ascending order.
   - **Check Cumulative Health:** Iterate through the sorted list and for each time step `t` (equal to `|x_i|`), accumulate the health of monsters up to that time and ensure it does not exceed `k * t`.

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of monsters.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the monsters' data.

## Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        healths = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        positions = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_health = 0
        success = True
        max_t = 0
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            t = abs(position)
            total_health += health
            if total_health > k * t:
                success = False
                break
            max_t = t
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum bullets per second).
   - Read the health and positions of the monsters.
   - Sort the monsters based on their distance from us (`|x_i|`).

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - Maintain a running total of the health of monsters that can reach us by each time step `t`.
   - Ensure that the cumulative health up to time `t` does not exceed `k * t`.
   - If at any point the cumulative health exceeds `k * t`, it's impossible to eliminate all monsters in time, and we print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES".

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether it's possible to eliminate all monsters before any reach us, by leveraging sorting and cumulative sum checks.
