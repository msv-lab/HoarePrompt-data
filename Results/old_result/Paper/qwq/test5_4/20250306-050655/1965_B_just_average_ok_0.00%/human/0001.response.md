Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers, with at most 25 elements, that satisfies two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there must be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], some subsequences would be [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where:

- No combination of its elements sums to k.

- Every other integer from 1 to n (except k) can be obtained by summing some subsequence of the sequence.

Moreover, the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element is a non-negative integer, up to 10^9.

First, I need to think about how to construct such a sequence.

I recall that with a set of powers of 2, I can represent any integer as a sum of some subset of those powers. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15 by choosing appropriate subsets.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the possibility of making k, while still being able to make all other values from 1 to n.

This seems tricky. Let's think about it step by step.

Let's consider using powers of 2 up to a certain point, but maybe exclude or modify some to prevent k from being formed.

Wait, in the example where n=2 and k=2, the output is [1], which makes sense because:

- There's no subsequence that sums to 2.

- There is a subsequence (which is [1]) that sums to 1.

Another example is n=6 and k=1, with output [2,3,4,5,6]. Here:

- No subsequence sums to 1.

- Subsequences can sum to 2 through 6.

This seems to suggest that if k=1, perhaps starting from 2 upwards is a way to go. But in general, for any k, I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider the properties needed.

First, the sequence should allow forming all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

Second, it should be impossible to form the sum k.

Given that, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of the sums it can generate.

I recall that with a set of numbers, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, where m is the number of elements. Each subset has a unique sum, assuming all elements are distinct and positive.

Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with non-negative integers, so zeros are allowed, but assuming zeros don't contribute to the sum, perhaps I can ignore them.

Wait, but the problem says non-negative integers, including zero, but likely, including zeros wouldn't help much, so probably best to avoid them.

So, assuming all elements are positive integers.

Now, with m elements, the number of non-empty subsets is 2^m - 1, each with a unique sum if the elements are distinct.

But in this problem, we don't have to ensure all subsets have unique sums, just that the sums cover all integers from 1 to n except k.

Moreover, we need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Given that, perhaps I can start with a base sequence that allows forming all sums from 1 to some value, and then modify it to exclude the possibility of forming k.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n, except for k.

How can I ensure that k cannot be formed?

One idea is to have the sequence such that the only way to form k is by including a specific element, and then exclude that element.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me think about the binary representation.

If I have the sequence as powers of 2, like [1,2,4,8,...], then any number can be formed uniquely by selecting the appropriate subset.

But in this case, I need to exclude the sum k, while still being able to form all other sums from 1 to n.

So, perhaps I can modify the sequence of powers of 2 by removing or adding elements in a way that k cannot be formed.

Wait, but if I remove an element, that would prevent forming some sums.

Wait, maybe I need to be more creative.

Another idea: construct the sequence such that the sums it can form are all numbers except k.

This seems too broad, so perhaps I need to look for a specific construction.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be constructing the sequence in a specific way.

Let's try to understand the given program.

The function func reads the input, and for each test case, it reads n and k.

Then, it initializes nums as [1<<i for i in range(24)], which is equivalent to [1,2,4,8,...,1<<23], which are the first 24 powers of 2.

Then, it calculates idx such that k >= 1<<idx, and sets idx to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k.

Then, it appends k - nums[idx] to nums, appends k+1 and k + nums[idx] +1 to nums, and removes 1<<idx from nums.

Finally, it prints the length of nums and the elements of nums.

Wait, let's see an example to understand this.

Take n=9 and k=3.

So, nums initially is [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384,32768,65536,131072,262144,524288,1048576,2097152,4194304,8388608].

Wait, but it's [1<<i for i in range(24)], so 24 elements: from 1 to 1<<23=8388608.

Then, idx is calculated such that k >=1<<idx.

k=3, which is >=1<<1 (which is 2), and >=1<<0 (1), so idx=1.

Wait, no, it's while k >=1<<idx: idx+=1.

So, starting with idx=0.

k=3 >=1<<0=1: idx=1.

k=3 >=1<<1=2: idx=2.

k=3 <1<<2=4, so idx=2-1=1.

So, idx=1.

Then, nums.append(k - nums[idx])=3 - 2=1.

Wait, but nums already has 1.

Then, nums.append(k+1)=4.

And nums.append(k + nums[idx]+1)=3 + 2 +1=6.

Then, nums.remove(1<<idx)=remove 2.

So, nums are [1,4,6,4,8,16,... up to 1<<23].

Wait, but it's appending 1,4,6, and removing 2.

But in the example output for n=9 and k=3, it's [7,1,4,1], which is different from what this program is doing.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the example, for n=9 and k=3, the output is [7,1,4,1], which sums can form all numbers from 1 to 9 except 3.

How does the program's output relate to this?

Wait, according to the program, it would do:

nums = [1,2,4,8,... up to 1<<23].

Then, idx=1 (since k=3 >=1<<1=2, but <1<<2=4), so idx=1.

Then, append k - nums[idx]=3-2=1.

Append k+1=4.

Append k + nums[idx]+1=3+2+1=6.

Remove 1<<idx=2.

So, nums become [1,4,6,4,8,16,... up to 1<<23].

But in the sample output, it's [7,1,4,1], which is different.

Wait, perhaps the program is doing something different.

Wait, maybe it's selecting only some of these numbers, but in the code provided, it's printing all of nums, which would be 25 elements, but in the sample output, it's only 4 elements.

Wait, looking back at the code:

nums = [1<<i for i in range(24)]

idx = 0

while k >= 1<<idx:

idx +=1

idx -=1

nums.append(k - nums[idx])

nums.append(k +1)

nums.append(k + nums[idx] +1)

nums.remove(1<<idx)

print(len(nums))

print(*nums)

Wait, in this code, nums starts with 24 elements, then appends three more, and removes one, so it has 26 elements, but in the sample output, it's only 4 elements.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the sequence is supposed to be a specific subset, not the entire list.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is being pruned or selected in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is intended to be the minimal set that can generate all sums except k.

Given that, maybe the program is trying to construct such a set.

But in the sample input, for n=9 and k=3, the output is [7,1,4,1], which seems to be a carefully chosen set.

Let's see what sums can be formed from [7,1,4,1]:

Subsets and their sums:

- []: 0

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1]:1

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [7,1]:8 (same as above)

- [1,4]:5

- [1,1]:2

- [7,1,4]:12

- [7,1,1]:8

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So, the possible sums are: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13.

We need to cover all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, it's missing 3,9,10.

But according to the problem, it's only required to cover sums from 1 to n except k, which is 9 except 3.

So, sums from 1 to 9, excluding 3, are present: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Wait, but in the above, 9 and 10 are missing.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the sample output or in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that multiple 1's can be chosen in subsets.

Wait, but in subsets, elements are either included or not, regardless of multiplicity.

Wait, no, in subsets, if there are multiple identical elements, their sum is the count times the element.

Wait, in the subset [1,1], the sum is 2.

But if I select one 1, sum is 1; if I select both, sum is 2.

So, in terms of sums, having multiple identical elements allows for multiples of that element in the sum.

But in this case, since we have non-negative integers, duplicates can be used to form multiples.

But in this specific example, [7,1,4,1], the possible sums are:

- 0

- 1

- 4

- 7

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+7=8

- 4+1=5 (already have 5)

- 4+7=11

- 1+1+4=6

- 1+1+7=8

- 1+4+7=12

- 1+1+4+7=13

So, sums: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13.

But for n=9 and k=3, we need sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

From above, 9 is missing.

Is there a way to form 9 with this sequence?

Wait, perhaps I missed it.

Wait, 7+1+1=9.

Yes, 7 + 1 + 1 = 9.

So, sums are: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

Perfect, so 9 is included.

I must have missed that earlier.

So, the sequence [7,1,4,1] can form sums from 0 to 13, excluding 3,10,12,13, etc., but for the required range up to 9, it covers everything except 3.

Now, back to the program.

The program seems to be constructing a sequence by starting with the first 24 powers of 2, then adjusting based on k.

But in the sample input, for n=9 and k=3, it would output 25 elements, but the sample output has only 4 elements.

So, perhaps the program is different from what's provided, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to output a different sequence, but in reality, it's outputting the modified list of powers of 2.

But in the sample output, it's showing [7,1,4,1], which doesn't match the program's output as per my earlier analysis.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to be different.

Wait, perhaps the program is not correct.

Wait, but the problem says to determine if the given program is correct.

So, perhaps I need to analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

Given that, I need to see if the program, as written, correctly generates a sequence that satisfies the two conditions for any n and k within the constraints.

Looking back at the program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]

idx = 0

while k >= 1 << idx:

idx +=1

idx -=1

nums.append(k - nums[idx])

nums.append(k +1)

nums.append(k + nums[idx] +1)

nums.remove(1 << idx)

print(len(nums))

print(*nums)

So, for each test case, it reads n and k, then creates nums as the first 24 powers of 2, from 1 to 1<<23.

Then, it finds the largest idx such that k >=1<<idx.

It sets idx to that value.

Then, it appends k - nums[idx], k+1, and k + nums[idx] +1 to nums, and removes 1<<idx from nums.

Finally, it prints the length of nums and the elements of nums.

Now, nums starts with 24 elements, appends 3 more, and removes one, so it has 26 elements.

But in the sample output, it's only 4 elements.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the sequence is intended to be a subset of these numbers, but in the code, it's printing all of nums.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect because it's printing 26 numbers, but the problem allows up to 25 elements.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's only 4 elements.

So, perhaps the program is different, or perhaps I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is intended to be only certain elements, but in the code, it's printing all of nums.

Wait, maybe I need to select a subset of nums that satisfies the conditions.

But in the code provided, it's printing all of nums after modification.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is intended to be different.

Wait, perhaps the program is a correct solution, but my analysis is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set of numbers that can generate all sums except k.

One way to approach this is to have a set that can generate all sums up to n, except for k.

Given that, perhaps I can start with a minimal set that can generate all sums up to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

Wait, but how?

One idea is to use a greedy approach: start with the smallest numbers and add them to the sequence until adding the next number would allow forming k.

Then, skip k and continue.

But I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of binary representation.

Wait, in the program, it's starting with the first 24 powers of 2, which can generate any sum up to 1<<24 -1.

But that's way larger than n, which is up to 10^6.

So, perhaps it's overkill.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 25 elements, and powers of 2 up to 1<<23 are sufficient for n up to 10^6.

Wait, 1<<20 is 1,048,576, which is larger than 10^6, so using powers of 2 up to 20 would suffice.

But in the program, it's using up to 1<<23.

Anyway, perhaps it's safe to use more.

Now, to exclude the sum k, while still being able to form all other sums up to n.

One idea is to remove the element that is essential for forming k, and replace it with other elements that allow forming the other sums.

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can partition the sums into those that include a particular element and those that don't.

For example, if I have an element a in the sequence, sums that include a are a plus any sum of the remaining elements, and sums that exclude a are just the sums of the remaining elements.

So, if I remove a, I lose all sums that include a.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, while all other sums can.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider specific examples.

Take n=2, k=2.

Output: [1]

- Can form 1, cannot form 2.

Good.

n=6, k=1.

Output: [2,3,4,5,6]

- Cannot form 1, can form 2 through 6.

Good.

n=8, k=8.

Output: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Can form 1 through 7 by selecting different combinations of 1's, cannot form 8.

Wait, but with seven 1's, you can form sums from 0 to 7.

But k=8 is beyond n=8, but according to the problem, n is at least 2 and k is between 1 and n.

Wait, in this case, n=8, k=8.

So, need to be able to form sums from 1 to 8 except 8.

With seven 1's, you can form up to 7, which is less than 8.

So, perhaps this is acceptable because you cannot form 8.

But perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, in the sample output, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form sums from 0 to 7, missing 8, which is k.

So, it's acceptable.

n=9, k=3.

Output: [7,1,4,1]

- Can form sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

As seen earlier.

n=10, k=7.

Output: [1,2,8,3]

- Can form sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

Let's verify:

Subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

But we need sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

So, missing 7, which is acceptable.

Now, looking back at the program, it's constructing nums in a specific way, but in the sample outputs, different sequences are provided.

So, perhaps the program is not matching the sample outputs, which might indicate it's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct, but the sample outputs are just examples of possible solutions, not necessarily what the program would output.

But the task is to determine if the given program is correct.

So, perhaps I need to analyze the program's logic to see if it always produces a valid sequence.

Looking back at the program:

- Start with nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<23], 24 elements.

- Find the largest idx where k >=1<<idx.

- Append k - nums[idx], k+1, and k + nums[idx] +1 to nums.

- Remove 1<<idx from nums.

- Print the length of nums (which is 26) and the elements.

Wait, but in the sample outputs, the sequence has only 4 elements.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps after these operations, some elements are selected to form the final sequence.

But in the code, it's printing all of nums, which would be 26 elements, but the problem allows up to 25 elements.

Wait, but in the sample outputs, it's only 4 elements.

So, perhaps the program is different from what's provided.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to select a subset of nums that satisfies the conditions.

But in the code, it's printing all of nums after the modifications.

This seems inconsistent with the sample outputs.

Therefore, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the program to select only the necessary elements.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct, and I'm misanalyzing it.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider that with the modified nums, some subsets can form the required sums.

But given that the sample outputs show sequences with few elements, while the program outputs 26 elements, it seems inconsistent.

Moreover, the problem allows up to 25 elements, and the program outputs 26 elements, which exceeds the limit.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
