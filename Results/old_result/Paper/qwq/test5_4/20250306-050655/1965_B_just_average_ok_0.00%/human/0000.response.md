Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that satisfies two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

First, I recall that with a set of powers of 2, I can represent any sum uniquely because of the binary representation of numbers. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15 by selecting a subset.

But in this problem, I need to exclude some sums. Specifically, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, while still being able to make all other sums from 1 to n.

One approach could be to start with a set that can make all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

Let me consider using powers of 2 up to some limit. For example, if I take [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], I can make any sum that is a combination of these powers.

But I need to ensure that no combination sums to k. So, perhaps I can remove certain elements or add elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums up to n can be formed.

Wait, the standard set of powers of 2 up to 2^m where 2^m <= n can represent all sums from 1 to 2^(m+1)-1 - 1, but I might need to adjust it based on k.

Alternatively, maybe I can include k+1 in the sequence, so that any subsequence that could sum to k would need to include k+1, but that would make the sum larger than k. But I need to think carefully.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

In the first test case, n=2 and k=2. The output is a sequence of size 1 with [1]. So, subsequences can sum to 1, but not to 2, which matches the requirement.

In the second test case, n=6 and k=1. The output is a sequence of size 5 with [2,3,4,5,6]. So, all sums from 2 to 6 are possible, and none sum to 1.

In the third test case, n=8 and k=8. The output is a sequence of size 7 with seven 1's. So, sums from 1 to 7 are possible, and sum to 8 is not possible.

In the fourth test case, n=9 and k=3. The output is [7,1,4,1]. Let's see the possible sums:

- Subsequences:

[7]: 7

[1]: 1

[4]: 4

[1]: 1

[7,1]: 8

[7,4]: 11

[7,1]: 8 (same as above)

[1,4]: 5

[1,1]: 2

[7,1,4]: 12

[7,1,1]: 9

[1,4,1]: 6

[7,1,4,1]: 13

So, possible sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13. Missing sums are 3,10. But according to the problem, for v from 1 to n=9, excluding k=3, there should be a subsequence summing to v. So, sums from 1 to 9 except 3 should be possible, which seems to hold here.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=10 and k=7. The output is [1,2,8,3]. Let's check the possible sums:

- Subsequences:

[1]:1

[2]:2

[8]:8

[3]:3

[1,2]:3

[1,8]:9

[1,3]:4

[2,8]:10

[2,3]:5

[8,3]:11

[1,2,8]:11

[1,2,3]:6

[1,8,3]:12

[2,8,3]:13

[1,2,8,3]:14

So, possible sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Missing sums are 7 and some higher sums, but since n=10, we only care up to 10. So, sums from 1 to 10 except 7 should be possible, which holds here.

From these examples, it seems that the sequence can be constructed in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums up to n can be formed.

Now, back to the problem. I need to find a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every v from 1 to n except k, there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence.

One idea is to use a combination of small numbers to cover the smaller sums and larger numbers to cover the larger sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But this seems vague. Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be formed.

For example, if I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n, and then I remove or adjust some elements so that k cannot be formed.

But I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

Alternatively, maybe I can include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing which elements to include.

Let me consider the properties of the sequence.

First, since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the maximum n is 10^6, I need to make sure that with 25 elements, I can cover all sums up to 10^6 except one specific sum k.

Given that 25 elements can potentially cover a huge range of sums, especially if the elements are large enough.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider the approach used in the sample inputs.

In the first test case, n=2 and k=2, the sequence is [1]. This can form sum=1, and not 2.

In the second test case, n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6]. This can form sums from 2 to 6, but not 1.

In the third test case, n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

In the fourth test case, n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can form sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

In the fifth test case, n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which can form sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these, I can see that different strategies are used for different cases.

In the first and second test cases, they used sequences that simply don't include k.

In the third test case, they used multiple 1's to cover sums up to 7.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, they used a mix of small and large numbers to cover the required sums.

But I need a general approach that works for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

If I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sum problem comes to mind.

The subset sum problem is NP-complete, but since n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient approach.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, perhaps I can find a way to represent the required sums efficiently.

I recall that with a set of 25 elements, each up to 10^9, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover sums up to 10^6.

But generating all possible subsets is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a smarter way to construct the sequence.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I take the first m powers of 2, I can represent any sum up to 2^m - 1.

For example, with [1,2,4,8], I can represent sums from 1 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum k.

So, perhaps I can take the powers of 2 up to some point, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But simply removing the element that corresponds to the binary digit of k might not work, because k could be a sum of multiple elements.

Wait, in binary representation, each sum corresponds uniquely to a subset.

So, if I have [1,2,4,8], each sum from 1 to 15 corresponds to a unique subset.

If I want to exclude sum k=5, which is 1+4, I could remove the 4, but then I can't make sums that require 4.

Alternatively, I could include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but other sums can.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

But ensuring that all other sums can be formed is challenging.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and carefully choose elements to cover the required sums.

Wait, another idea: if I include elements that cover all sums except k, I can think in terms of the minimal number of elements needed to cover sums up to n, and then adjust for k.

But minimal number of elements isn't necessarily the goal; rather, I have a limit of 25 elements.

Let me consider that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, each up to 10^9.

If I choose elements that are large enough, I can cover large sums efficiently.

For example, if I have elements like [1,2,4,8,16,...], I can cover sums up to 2^25 -1, which is over 33 million, which is more than n=10^6.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

So, perhaps starting with powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjusting for k.

Wait, in the reference program, it seems to use powers of 2 up to 24 bits, and then adds some specific elements based on k.

Let me look at the reference program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]

idx = 0

while k >= 1 << idx:

idx += 1

idx -= 1

nums.append(k - nums[idx])

nums.append(k + 1)

nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)

nums.remove(1 << idx)

print(len(nums))

print(*nums)

So, it starts with nums as the first 24 powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,...,8388608]

Then, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k, say 2^idx.

Then, it appends k - 2^idx to nums, and also appends k + 1 and k + 2^idx + 1 to nums.

Finally, it removes 2^idx from nums.

Then, it prints the length of nums and the elements of nums.

I need to verify if this approach works.

Let me try with the first test case: n=2, k=2.

So, nums starts as [1,2,4,...,8388608]

k=2, which is equal to 2^1.

So, idx=1.

Then, append k - 2^1 = 0 to nums.

Append k +1 =3 and k + 2^1 +1=4 to nums.

Then, remove 2^1=2 from nums.

So, nums becomes [1,4,8,...,8388608,0,3,4]

But in the sample output, it's just [1], so this seems different.

Wait, perhaps it's simplifying the sequence.

But in this case, with nums containing 1 and 0, and other larger numbers, but the sample output is just [1].

So, maybe the reference program is overcomplicating it for some cases.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 25 elements, and the reference program is using 24 powers of 2 plus 3 additional elements, so 27 elements, but it removes one, so 26 elements, which is still over the limit of 25.

Wait, 24 powers plus 3 more, minus one, is 26 elements, which is over 25.

So, perhaps it needs adjustment.

But according to the problem, m should be at most 25.

Maybe in some cases, it's within 25, but in others, it's not.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2 and k=2, the reference program would have nums as [1,4,8,...,8388608,0,3,4], removing 2.

But the sample output is [1], which is a much simpler sequence.

So, perhaps the reference program is not optimal and includes unnecessary elements.

I need to verify if the reference program's approach is correct.

Let me consider the principles behind it.

The idea seems to be:

- Start with powers of 2 up to 2^23 (since i ranges from 0 to 23 in [1 << i for i in range(24)]).

- Find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k, say 2^idx.

- Append k - 2^idx to the sequence.

- Append k +1 and k + 2^idx +1 to the sequence.

- Remove 2^idx from the sequence.

Then, output the sequence.

I need to check if this sequence satisfies the conditions.

First, check if there's no subsequence that sums to k.

Second, check if for every v from 1 to n, except k, there's a subsequence that sums to v.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=6 and k=1.

According to the reference program:

nums = [1,2,4,...,8388608]

k=1, which is equal to 2^0.

So, idx=0.

Append k - 2^0 = 0 to nums.

Append k +1=2 and k + 2^0 +1=2 to nums.

Then, remove 2^0=1 from nums.

So, nums becomes [2,4,8,...,8388608,0,2,2]

But in the sample output, it's [2,3,4,5,6], which is different.

So, again, the reference program is generating a different sequence.

In this case, with n=6 and k=1, the sample output is [2,3,4,5,6], which can form sums from 2 to 6, and not 1, which is correct.

But the reference program is generating a sequence that includes 0 and multiple 2's, which seems inefficient.

Wait, including 0 in the sequence allows for summing to v by including or excluding 0, but since 0 doesn't change the sum, it's redundant.

So, perhaps the reference program needs to handle the case when k - 2^idx is 0 carefully.

Moreover, in the reference program, it's appending k +1 and k + 2^idx +1, which in this case would be 2 and 2, so duplicates.

And then removing 1.

But the sample output is [2,3,4,5,6], which is much simpler.

So, perhaps the reference program is not optimal.

Let me consider another approach.

I recall that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, I can think of it as generating all sums from 1 to n, and then modifying the sequence to exclude the sum k.

But generating all sums from 1 to n requires at least log2(n) elements, but with up to 25 elements, it's feasible.

Wait, actually, with 25 elements, each up to 10^9, it's possible to cover a very large range of sums.

But ensuring that k cannot be formed is the tricky part.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate sums from 1 to n, then adjust to exclude k.

But finding a minimal set is not necessary since m can be up to 25.

Alternatively, include elements that cover the required sums except k.

One possible way is to include elements that can generate all sums except k by carefully choosing which elements to include.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then remove an element that is necessary to form k.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, include elements such that the only way to form k is by including a specific element, and then exclude that element.

But I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed without that element.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence where the sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that any subset that sums to k is impossible due to the absence of certain elements or the presence of others.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Use a combination of small elements to cover the smaller sums and larger elements to cover the larger sums, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that with up to 25 elements, I can cover a wide range of sums by including elements that are powers of 2, which allow for unique binary representations.

But I need to modify this to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, and include other elements to cover the remaining sums.

Let me try this idea with an example.

Suppose n=9 and k=3.

The binary representation of 3 is 11 in binary.

The highest set bit is 2 (2^1).

So, if I exclude 2 from the sequence, and include other elements to cover the sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

But if I exclude 2, how do I cover sums like 3?

Wait, in this case, 3 cannot be formed without 2, but in the sample output, they used [7,1,4,1], which can form 3 as 1+1+1, but in this case, they have only one 1, so it's [7,1,4,1], which has two 1's.

Wait, in the sample output for n=9 and k=3, it's [7,1,4,1], which has two 1's.

With these, sums like 3 can be formed as 1+1+1.

So, even if I exclude a particular element, I can still form sums in different ways.

This suggests that there might be multiple ways to form the same sum using different combinations of elements.

So, perhaps excluding one element isn't the right approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that the subset that would sum to k is impossible due to the absence of a critical element.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I have elements that are all greater than k, then no subsequence can sum to k.

But in that case, I can't form any sum less than the smallest element.

But in the problem, v can be as small as 1, so if k >1, and I have elements all greater than 1, I can't form 1.

But in the sample input where n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which can't form 1, but can form all other sums from 2 to 6.

So, in that case, it's acceptable because k=1 is excluded, and all other sums from 2 to 6 are possible.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

So, in this case, multiple 1's are used to cover sums up to 7.

In the fourth test case, n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can form sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, with this sequence, 3 cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which can form sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

So, perhaps the approach is to include elements that cover all sums except k, by carefully choosing which elements to include.

But I need a general method to construct such a sequence for any n and k.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude the sum k.

One way to do this is to remove an element that is necessary to form the sum k.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can split the sequence into two parts: one that covers sums up to k-1 and another that covers sums from k+1 to n.

So, I need to ensure that sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n are possible, but sum k is not possible.

So, perhaps I can have two separate subsets: one for sums up to k-1 and another for sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that these subsets don't combine in a way that allows sum k to be formed.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to ensure that for every v from 1 to n except k, there exists at least one subsequence that sums to v.

And for v=k, no subsequence sums to
