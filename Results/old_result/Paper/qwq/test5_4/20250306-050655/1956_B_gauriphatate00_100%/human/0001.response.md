Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, alternately, starting with me. Each time I play a card, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, I get a point. The same goes for Nene.

Nene is really smart and always plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she tries to minimize my points. So, I need to figure out, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, assuming Nene plays to both maximize her score and minimize mine.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. There are 2n turns in total, with me and Nene alternating turns, starting with me. So, I take turn 1, Nene takes turn 2, I take turn 3, and so on, until all cards are played.

Each turn, the player selects one of their cards, looks at the number, and checks if that number is already on the table. If it is, they get a point. Then, they place their card on the table.

Importantly, all cards on the table are visible to both players at all times. So, when deciding which card to play, both players can see what's already been played.

Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and, in case of ties in that aspect, to minimize my points. So, I need to anticipate her moves based on this strategy.

Given that, I need to find out the best possible score I can achieve, given that Nene is also playing very smartly against me.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1, 1, 2, 3

So, Nene's cards must be 2, 3, 4, 4.

The explanation shows a possible sequence of plays:

1. I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

2. Nene plays one of her 4's. Table: [1, 4]

3. I play my other 1. Now, there's already a 1 on the table, so I get 1 point. Table: [1, 4, 1]

4. Nene plays her other 4. There's already a 4 on the table, so she gets 1 point. Table: [1, 4, 1, 4]

5. I play my 2. Table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2]

6. Nene plays her 2. There's already a 2 on the table, so she gets another point. Table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2]

7. I play my 3. Table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3]

8. Nene plays her 3. There's already a 3 on the table, so she gets another point. Table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3]

So, in the end, I have 1 point, and Nene has 3 points.

The problem says that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

I need to generalize this to any n and any distribution of my cards.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider that Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine, in that order.

So, she will play in a way that first ensures she gets as many points as possible, and among those options, she chooses the one that minimizes my points.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game, where I need to find the optimal strategy against a对手 who is also playing optimally.

But game theory can be complex, especially since the game has multiple turns.

Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the properties of the game.

Each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

I have some numbers in my hand, and Nene has the rest.

When I play a card, I get a point if its pair is already on the table.

Similarly for Nene.

Wait, no. I get a point if any card with the same number is already on the table, regardless of whether it's the pair or not.

But since each number appears exactly twice, "the pair" is the only other card with the same number.

So, for each number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene, or both with me, or both with Nene.

Wait, no. The problem says that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire deck of 2n cards.

Me and Nene each have n cards.

So, for each number from 1 to n, there are two cards with that number, and these two cards are distributed between me and Nene in some way.

So, for each number, it's possible that:

- I have both cards

- I have one card and Nene has one card

- Nene has both cards

But the problem states that in the input, each number appears at most twice in my hand, which makes sense because each number has exactly two cards in total.

Given that, I need to find out, based on which numbers I have both cards or only one card, how many points I can get.

Wait, maybe that's the key.

If I have both cards of a certain number, then I can potentially get a point from playing the second one, provided that Nene doesn't play her card in between.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, I need to think about how Nene's plays affect my potential points.

Let me consider that.

Suppose that for a certain number, I have both cards.

If I play one card first, and then the other later, I can get a point from the second one, provided that Nene doesn't play her cards in a way to interfere.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to think about this.

Let me think in terms of the number of pairs.

For each number, there are two cards.

If I have both cards, then I can potentially get one point from playing the second one, if the first one is already on the table.

If I have one card and Nene has the other, then I can get a point only if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

If Nene has both cards, then I cannot get any points from that number.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

Because for each such number, I can play one card first, and then the second one to get a point.

But wait, Nene might play in a way to interfere with that.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose I have both cards of a number.

If I play one card, and then later play the second one, I can get a point from the second one, provided that Nene doesn't play her cards in between in a way to mess with me.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points, and among those, minimizes my points.

So, in the case where I have both cards of a number, can I guarantee getting a point from that?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have both cards of number x.

If I play one card early in the game, and then play the second one later, I can get a point from the second one, provided that Nene doesn't play her cards in a way to interfere.

But Nene might play her cards in a way to maximize her points, which might involve playing cards that give her points or prevent me from getting points.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the ordering of plays.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me consider the concept of "conflict" between my cards and Nene's cards.

For each number, if I have both cards, then I can potentially get one point from that number.

If I have one card and Nene has one card, then I can get a point only if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points, so she might play her card at a time that maximizes her points, which might not necessarily be the best time for me to get a point.

Moreover, Nene is trying to minimize my points in case of ties in her points.

So, perhaps for the numbers where I have both cards, I can get a point, and for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, it's uncertain, and I need to see how Nene plays.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of "pairs" I have.

If I have both cards of a number, that's a pair that I can potentially use to get a point.

If I have one card and Nene has the other, then it's not a pair that I can control fully.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

Because for those, I can play one card first, and then the second one to get a point.

For the numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, whether I can get a point depends on the ordering of plays, and since Nene is trying to minimize my points, she might play her card in a way that minimizes my opportunities.

So, perhaps for those, I can't count on getting a point.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

Let me check this against the example.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Therefore, I have both cards of number 1, and only one card of 2 and 3.

According to my hypothesis, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards, which is 1 (number 1).

And in the example, it's 1, which matches.

In the second test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have two 8's, two 5's, one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2.

Therefore, I have both cards of 8 and 5.

So, according to my hypothesis, maximum points I can get is 2.

And in the example, it's 2.

In the third test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have one 7, one 1, two 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6.

Therefore, I have both cards of 4.

So, according to my hypothesis, maximum points I can get is 1.

And in the example, it's 1.

In the fourth test case:

n = 3

My cards: 1,2,3

So, I have one of each.

Therefore, I have no numbers where I have both cards.

So, maximum points I can get is 0.

And in the example, it's 0.

In the fifth test case:

n = 1

My cards: 1

So, I have one 1, and Nene has the other 1.

So, I have no numbers where I have both cards.

Therefore, maximum points I can get is 0.

And in the example, it's 0.

So, in all the examples, my hypothesis matches the correct answer.

Therefore, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

But is this always true?

Let me try to think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2

My cards: 1,2

Nene's cards: 1,2

So, for both numbers, I have one card and Nene has one card.

According to my hypothesis, I have no numbers where I have both cards, so maximum points I can get is 0.

Is that correct?

Let's simulate the game.

Possible sequences:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

   Nene plays 1, gets a point because 1 is already on the table, table: [1,1]

   I play 2, table: [1,1,2]

   Nene plays 2, gets a point because 2 is already on the table, table: [1,1,2,2]

   So, I get 0 points, Nene gets 2 points.

Another sequence:

1. I play 2, table: [2]

   Nene plays 1, table: [2,1]

   I play 1, get a point because 1 is already on the table, table: [2,1,1]

   Nene plays 2, get a point because 2 is already on the table, table: [2,1,1,2]

   So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the first sequence, she gets 2 points and I get 0.

In the second sequence, she gets 1 point and I get 1 point.

Since Nene is trying to maximize her points first, she would choose the first sequence where she gets 2 points and I get 0.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is 0.

So, in this case, my hypothesis holds.

Another test case:

n=2

My cards: 1,1

Nene's cards: 2,2

So, I have both cards of 1, Nene has both cards of 2.

According to my hypothesis, I have both cards of 1, so maximum points I can get is 1.

Is that correct?

Possible sequences:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

   Nene plays 2, table: [1,2]

   I play 1, get a point because 1 is already on the table, table: [1,2,1]

   Nene plays 2, get a point because 2 is already on the table, table: [1,2,1,2]

   So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Another sequence:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

   Nene plays 2, table: [1,2]

   I play 1, get a point, table: [1,2,1]

   Nene plays 2, get a point, table: [1,2,1,2]

   Still, I get 1 point.

It seems that no matter what Nene does, if I have both cards of a number, I can get a point from the second card.

Therefore, in this case, my hypothesis holds.

Another test case:

n=3

My cards: 1,1,2

Nene's cards: 2,3,3

So, I have both cards of 1, and one card of 2.

Nene has one card of 2 and both cards of 3.

According to my hypothesis, I have both cards of 1, so maximum points I can get is 1.

Let's simulate:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

   Nene plays 2, table: [1,2]

   I play 1, get a point because 1 is already on the table, table: [1,2,1]

   Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3]

   I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2]

   Nene plays 3, get a point because 3 is already on the table, table: [1,2,1,3,2,3]

   So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Another sequence:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

   Nene plays 3, table: [1,3]

   I play 1, get a point, table: [1,3,1]

   Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,2]

   I play 2, get a point because 2 is already on the table, table: [1,3,1,2,2]

   Nene plays 3, get a point, table: [1,3,1,2,2,3]

   So, I get 1 point from the second 1, and 1 point from the second 2, total 2 points.

But according to my hypothesis, I should only get 1 point, since I have only one pair (both 1's).

But in this sequence, I got 2 points.

Wait, but Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the second sequence, she gets only 1 point, while in the first sequence, she gets 1 point as well.

So, perhaps Nene would choose the first sequence where I get only 1 point.

Wait, in both sequences, Nene gets 1 point.

But in the second sequence, I get 2 points, which is higher than in the first sequence.

But Nene is trying to minimize my points in case her points are the same.

So, she would choose the first sequence where I get only 1 point.

Therefore, in the optimal play, I can get only 1 point.

Hence, my hypothesis still holds.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my thinking.

Even in cases where it seems possible to get more points, Nene can play in a way to prevent that, as long as her points are maximized and my points are minimized.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is indeed equal to the number of numbers for which I have both cards.

Hence, the function `func_1` in the given program is correct.

It counts the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand, which corresponds to the number of pairs I have, and returns that as the maximum points I can get.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
