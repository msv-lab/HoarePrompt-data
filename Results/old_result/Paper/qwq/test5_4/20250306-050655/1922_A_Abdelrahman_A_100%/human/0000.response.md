Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at position i, then the string must have exactly that letter at position i. If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, then the string must have a different lowercase letter at that position.

So, for example, if t has 'a' at position i, then s must also have 'a' at position i. If t has 'A' at position i, then s can have any letter except 'a' at position i.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template t. That means, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Additionally, c should not match the template t. That means there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to find a template t that satisfies these conditions.

Let me consider the constraints:

- n can be from 1 to 20.

- Strings a, b, c consist only of lowercase Latin letters.

- Template t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Given that n is small (up to 20), I might be able to iterate through possible templates, but the number of possible templates is 52^n, which is too large for n=20.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let's think about each position independently.

For each position i, I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, then:

- a[i] must equal t[i].

- b[i] must equal t[i].

- c[i] must not equal t[i].

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then:

- a[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- b[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i].

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so its lowercase version is the corresponding lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i], the conditions are:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

And for lowercase t[i]:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

So, for each position i, I have two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

But there are constraints based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to choose for each position whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase in such a way that:

- For all positions where t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], c[i] != t[i].

- For all positions where t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

I need to find if there exists such a template t.

Let me think about the possibilities for each position.

Consider position i.

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

Then:

- a[i] must equal t[i].

- b[i] must equal t[i].

- c[i] must not equal t[i].

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] must equal b[i], because both must equal t[i].

- c[i] must not equal a[i] (since c[i] != t[i]).

So, if a[i] != b[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

Similarly, if a[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

Then:

- a[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- b[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i].

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- b[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i].

- c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i].

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the corresponding lowercase letter.

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is just the lowercase letter.

But in this case, t[i] is uppercase, and I need to ensure that a[i] and b[i] are not equal to lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] is equal to lowercase(t[i]).

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is determined by t[i].

Wait, but I need to choose t[i], so I can choose which uppercase letter it is.

But actually, t[i] is an uppercase letter, and its lowercase version is just the lowercase letter.

But in this problem, all input strings are lowercase, so c[i] is lowercase.

So, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'A', then lowercase(t[i]) is 'a', so a[i] != 'a', b[i] != 'a', and c[i] == 'a'.

Similarly, if I choose t[i] to be 'B', lowercase(t[i]) is 'b', so a[i] != 'b', b[i] != 'b', and c[i] == 'b'.

So, for each position, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Where 'x' is the lowercase of 'X'.

So, for each position, I can choose t[i] to be an uppercase letter 'X', and set 'x' accordingly.

But I need to choose the same 'x' for all positions where t[i] is uppercase 'X'.

Wait, no. Actually, for each position, I can choose independently which uppercase letter to use for t[i].

But that might complicate things, because the template t is a single string.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that t can have a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

For positions where t[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

For positions where t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position, I have two choices, subject to these constraints.

I need to find if there's a way to assign, for each position, whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, such that all these conditions are satisfied.

Let me think about it position by position.

For each position i, I can consider the possible choices independently and see if there's a combination that works across all positions.

Wait, but the template t is a single string, so the choices for each position are independent in terms of how they affect the matching conditions.

Wait, but actually, they are independent because the template t is constructed position by position, and the conditions for each position are local to that position.

So, perhaps I can handle each position separately.

Wait, but the overall template t has to satisfy all positions simultaneously.

But since the choices for each position are independent, I can make choices for each position and ensure that the overall template satisfies all the conditions.

So, for each position, I can determine if it's possible to choose t[i] to be lowercase or uppercase in a way that satisfies the conditions for a, b, and c.

Then, if for every position, at least one of the choices satisfies the conditions, and there exists a combination where c does not match the template, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But I need to ensure that c does not match the template, while a and b do.

Wait, but I need to ensure that there exists at least one position where c does not match the template, while a and b match it.

Because if c matches the template in all positions, then it matches the template.

Wait, no. The problem says that c does not match the template, which means that there is at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

But, to make sure that c does not match the template, it's enough that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition, while a and b satisfy the conditions in all positions.

Wait, actually, the problem says that a and b match the template, while c does not.

But "c does not match the template" means that c does not satisfy at least one position's condition.

But to ensure that c does not match the template, while a and b do, I need to make sure that:

- For all positions, a and b satisfy their conditions.

- There exists at least one position where c does not satisfy its condition.

So, I need to find a template t such that:

- For all i, a matches t at position i.

- For all i, b matches t at position i.

- There exists at least one i where c does not match t at position i.

Given that, I can proceed as follows:

For each position i:

- Determine the possible choices for t[i] (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfy a and b.

- Then, ensure that for at least one position, c does not match t.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for a and b, all positions satisfy the conditions, and for c, at least one position does not satisfy the condition.

So, perhaps I can find for each position, what are the possible choices for t[i] that make a and b match, and then ensure that for at least one position, c does not match.

But I need to make sure that for a and b, all positions satisfy their conditions, and for c, at least one position does not satisfy its condition.

Let me formalize this.

For each position i:

- Let's define the possible choices for t[i] that make a and b match.

- Then, for each such choice, see if c does not match at that position.

- Finally, ensure that there exists at least one position where c does not match, while a and b match at all positions.

So, for position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to the lowercase of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i].

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is just the lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i], lowercase(t[i]) is the corresponding lowercase letter.

Given that, for uppercase t[i]:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is determined.

So, for uppercase t[i], I need to choose which uppercase letter to use, and its lowercase version must match c[i].

So, if I choose t[i] = 'X', then lowercase(t[i]) = 'x', so c[i] must be 'x', and a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x'.

Similarly, if I choose t[i] = 'Y', then lowercase(t[i]) = 'y', so c[i] must be 'y', and a[i] and b[i] must not be 'y'.

Wait, but t[i] is an uppercase letter, and its lowercase version is unique.

So, for uppercase t[i], the lowercase version is fixed based on t[i].

But I need c[i] to be equal to lowercase(t[i]), and a[i] and b[i] not equal to lowercase(t[i]).

So, for uppercase t[i], c[i] must be equal to lowercase(t[i]), and a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to lowercase(t[i]).

Given that, for each position, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then c[i] determines the lowercase version of t[i], which in turn determines t[i].

So, for example, if c[i] = 'x', then t[i] must be 'X'.

Similarly, if c[i] = 'y', then t[i] must be 'Y'.

But also, a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to 'x' in this case.

So, for uppercase t[i]:

- t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

Similarly, for lowercase t[i]:

- t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

So, for each position i, I have two options:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase:

- t[i] == c[i].upper()

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is c[i].

So, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

But c[i] is lowercase, so t[i] = c[i].upper().

But also, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but c[i] is lowercase, and t[i] is uppercase, with lowercase version c[i].

Wait, no, t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is c[i].

So, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

But in Python, c[i].upper() gives the uppercase version of c[i].

So, t[i] = c[i].upper().

Then, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, for uppercase t[i]:

- t[i] = c[i].upper()

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

And for lowercase t[i]:

- t[i] = a[i] (which must equal b[i])

- c[i] != a[i]

So, for each position i, I have to choose between these two options.

Now, I need to ensure that for all positions, a and b match t, and that there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, I can iterate through each position and see what choices are possible.

If for some position, neither option is possible, then it's impossible to find such a template.

Otherwise, if for all positions, at least one option is possible, and there exists at least one position where c does not match t, then it's possible.

But I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t, while a and b match t in all positions.

So, even if for some positions, both options are possible, I need to make sure that in at least one position, c does not match t.

Wait, but if I choose t[i] in such a way that c does not match t at some position, that's sufficient.

But, if for all positions, c matches t, then it's not acceptable.

Wait, no. If c matches t in all positions, then c matches the template, which is not what I want.

I want c to not match the template, which means that there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, I need to choose t[i] for each position such that:

- a and b match t in all positions.

- c does not match t in at least one position.

So, I can choose t[i] for each position based on the rules above, and ensure that in at least one position, c does not match t.

Wait, but in the lowercase choice, c[i] != t[i], which means c does not match t at that position.

In the uppercase choice, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c matches t at that position.

Wait, no. In the uppercase choice, t[i] is uppercase, and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c matches t at that position because the condition for uppercase is that c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, but in the problem statement, "the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't hold for at least one i".

So, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition.

So, in our case, to have c not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] != lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. The problem says "the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't hold for at least one i".

But the condition is that for all i, the corresponding condition holds.

So, for c to not match the template, there exists at least one i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. The problem says:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c must have c[i] == t[i] to match, otherwise it doesn't match.

- If t[i] is uppercase, c must have c[i] != lowercase(t[i]) to match, otherwise it doesn't match.

But actually, for c to not match the template, at least one of these conditions fails.

So, for c to not match the template, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in other words, c fails to match at that position.

So, in our case, we need to choose t[i] for each position such that:

- For all positions, a and b match t.

- There exists at least one position where c does not match t.

Given that, I can proceed as follows:

For each position i:

- Determine if it's possible to choose t[i] as lowercase or uppercase, based on a and b.

- If choosing t[i] as lowercase is possible, then c[i] != t[i], which means c does not match at that position.

- If choosing t[i] as uppercase is possible, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c matches at that position.

So, to have c not match the template, I need to choose at least one position where t[i] is lowercase, and c[i] != t[i].

But, I also need to ensure that for all positions, a and b match t.

So, in summary:

- For positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase: t[i] == a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != t[i].

- For positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase: t[i] == c[i].upper(), and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but in the uppercase choice, t[i] is uppercase, and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is c[i] == c[i], which is always true.

But also, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, for uppercase choice:

- t[i] = c[i].upper()

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

For lowercase choice:

- t[i] = a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

So, for each position, I can choose either lowercase or uppercase, provided the conditions are met.

Now, to have c not match the template, I need to choose at least one position where t[i] is lowercase, hence c[i] != t[i].

But, I can also choose some positions where t[i] is uppercase, in which case c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at that position.

So, as long as there is at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], then c does not match the template.

Otherwise, if all positions are uppercase, then c matches the template, which is not what I want.

So, I need to ensure that not all positions are chosen as uppercase.

Therefore, I need to check two things:

1. For each position, at least one of the choices (lowercase or uppercase) is possible based on a, b, c.

2. There exists at least one position where the lowercase choice is possible.

Because if I can choose at least one position to be lowercase, then I can set t[i] to a[i] (which equals b[i]), and c[i] != a[i], ensuring that c does not match at that position.

Additionally, for positions where I choose uppercase, I need to ensure that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, in summary:

- For positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

- For positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

And I need to choose at least one position to be lowercase.

So, to find if such a template exists, I need to:

- Find all positions where both lowercase and uppercase choices are possible.

- Ensure that there is at least one position where the lowercase choice is possible.

If that's the case, then I can choose that position to be lowercase and the rest to be uppercase, ensuring that c does not match the template due to the lowercase position.

Wait, but I need to ensure that for all positions, a and b match t.

So, for positions where
