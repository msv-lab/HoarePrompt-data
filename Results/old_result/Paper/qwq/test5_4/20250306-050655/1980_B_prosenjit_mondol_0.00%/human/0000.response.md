Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f, and he's going to throw all the cubes on the table. After that, he arranges them in non-increasing order based on their values. If two cubes have the same value, their order can be anything. Then, he removes the first k cubes from this ordered list. The question is whether his favorite cube is removed or not.

Okay, so I need to determine, for each test case, whether the favorite cube is definitely removed, definitely not removed, or it could go either way.

First, I need to understand the process clearly. He throws the cubes, so their order is random, and each cube shows a value a_i. Then, he sorts them in non-increasing order. So, the list is sorted descendingly, with possible ties.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. So, the cubes that are removed are the top k cubes in this sorted list.

Now, I need to find out if the favorite cube, which originally was at position f, is among these removed cubes.

But here's the thing: after throwing, the cubes are in a random order, so the value that the favorite cube shows is a_f, but its position in the sorted list depends on the values of all the cubes.

Wait, no. Actually, after throwing, the cubes are in a random order, but the problem says "the i-th cube showed the value a_i." So, a_i is the value shown by the cube that was originally at position i.

Then, he arranges them in non-increasing order based on their values. So, the sorted list is a_i sorted descendingly.

Wait, but the problem says: "After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order."

So, the sorting is based on the values a_i, descending. If there are ties, their relative order is unspecified.

Then, he removes the first k cubes from this sorted list.

Now, I need to determine whether the favorite cube, which has value a_f, is among these first k cubes or not.

But because of the ties, its position in the sorted list isn't fully determined if there are cubes with the same value.

So, I need to consider the possible positions of the favorite cube given its value and the values of the other cubes.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should sort the list a in descending order. Let's call this sorted list s.

Then, in the sorted list s, the first k elements are removed.

I need to find out if the favorite cube, with value a_f, is among these first k elements or not.

But since there can be ties, its position isn't fixed.

So, I need to find the range of possible positions for the favorite cube based on its value.

Let's think about how sorting works with duplicates.

In a descending sort, all cubes with value greater than a_f will be before a_f, and all with value less than a_f will be after.

Cubes with the same value as a_f can be in any order relative to each other.

So, the favorite cube could be in any position among the cubes with the same value.

Now, to determine if it's removed, I need to see if its position is within the first k.

If all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k, then it's definitely removed ("YES").

If none of its possible positions are within the first k, then it's definitely not removed ("NO").

If some of its possible positions are within the first k and some are not, then it's "MAYBE".

So, I need to find the range of possible positions for the favorite cube.

First, find the number of cubes with value greater than a_f. Let's call this count g.

Then, find the number of cubes with value equal to a_f. Let's call this count e.

So, in the sorted list, the cubes with value greater than a_f come first, then the cubes with value equal to a_f, and then the cubes with value less than a_f.

Since the cubes with equal values can be in any order, the favorite cube can be in any of the e positions among the cubes with value a_f.

So, the possible positions of the favorite cube are from g to g + e - 1.

Remember that the sorting is 0-based, and the first k cubes are from position 0 to k-1.

So, if the highest possible position of the favorite cube (g + e - 1) is less than k, then it's always removed ("YES").

If the lowest possible position of the favorite cube (g) is greater than or equal to k, then it's never removed ("NO").

Otherwise, if some of its possible positions are less than k and some are greater or equal to k, then it's "MAYBE".

Wait, but I need to be careful with the indexing.

Let me formalize this.

Let's sort the list a in descending order, and let's find:

- g: number of cubes with value > a_f

- e: number of cubes with value == a_f

So, in the sorted list, the positions of cubes with value == a_f are from position g to g + e - 1.

Now, the first k cubes are from position 0 to k - 1.

So,

- If g + e - 1 < k, then all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k, so it's always removed ("YES").

- If g >= k, then all possible positions of the favorite cube are beyond the first k, so it's never removed ("NO").

- Otherwise, some positions are within the first k and some are not, so it's "MAYBE".

Wait, but I think there's a confusion here.

Let me take an example to verify.

Take the first example from the input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5, f=2 (favorite cube is the second one, which has value 3), k=2.

So, a = [4,3,3,2,3]

Sort descending: [4,3,3,3,2]

Now, remove the first k=2 cubes: [4,3]

So, in this case, the favorite cube (original position 2, value 3) is in position 1 in the sorted list, which is removed.

But the problem says "the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed" and "the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed."

Wait, but in the sorted list [4,3,3,3,2], the favorite cube is in position 1 (0-based), which is removed.

But according to the problem, it could be in position 2 or 3 if there are ties.

Wait, but in this specific sorting, since there are multiple 3's, their order is unspecified.

So, possible sorted lists are:

- [4,3,3,3,2]

- [4,3,3,3,2]

- etc., with the 3's permuted among themselves.

But in all cases, the favorite cube, which is one of the 3's, is in positions 1,2,3 in the sorted list.

Given k=2, positions 0 and 1 are removed.

So, if the favorite cube is in position 1, it's removed; if in position 2, it's not removed.

Hence, it's "MAYBE".

But according to the sample output, for this input, it's "MAYBE", which matches.

Another sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 3: [5,4,3]

Favorite cube is the fifth one, which has value 5, is in position 0 in sorted list, which is removed. So, "YES".

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 2: [5,4]

Favorite cube is 5, in position 0, which is removed. "NO" is not correct; wait, but according to the sample output, it's "NO". Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, no, the sample output for this input is "NO", but according to my reasoning, it should be "YES". Wait, maybe I need to check the exact sequence.

Wait, let's look at the sample input again.

Wait, the sample input is:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

So, n=5, f=5 (favorite cube is the fifth one, which has value 3), k=2.

Wait, no, wait, a = [5,2,4,1,3], so favorite cube is the fifth one, which has value 3.

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 2: [5,4]

Favorite cube is 3, which is in position 2, which is not removed.

Hence, "NO".

Wait, but in this case, since there are no other cubes with value 3, its position is fixed at position 2, which is not removed (k=2, remove positions 0 and 1).

Hence, "NO".

Another sample input:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 5: [5,4,3,2,1]

Favorite cube is 3, which is in position 2, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 4: [5,4,3,2]

Favorite cube is 5, which is in position 0, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

Sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Remove first 5: [5,4,3,2,1]

Favorite cube is 5, which is in position 0, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

Sort descending: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

Remove first 3: [3,3,2]

Favorite cube is the fifth one, which has value 2.

So, its possible positions are positions 2 and 3 (0-based).

If it's in position 2, it's removed; if in position 3, it's not removed.

Hence, "MAYBE".

Another sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Sort descending: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Remove first 1: [1]

Favorite cube is the first one, which has value 1, which is in position 0, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

Sort descending: [42]

Remove first 1: [42]

Favorite cube is the first one, which has value 42, which is in position 0, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

Sort descending: [2,2,2,1,1]

Remove first 3: [2,2,2]

Favorite cube is the second one, which has value 2, which is in position 1, which is removed.

But since all cubes with value 2 are in the first 3, it's always removed.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "YES", which matches.

Another sample input:

2 1 1

2 1

Sort descending: [2,1]

Remove first 1: [2]

Favorite cube is the first one, which has value 2, which is in position 0, which is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another sample input:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Sort descending: [3,3,3,2,2]

Remove first 1: [3]

Favorite cube is the third one, which has value 2, which is in position 3, which is not removed.

Hence, "NO".

Okay, so my reasoning seems consistent with the sample outputs.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems a bit off.

First, it's using 0-based indexing, which is fine.

It gets n, f, k, then adjusts f and k to 0-based.

Then, it reads the list a.

It stores x = a[f], which is the value of the favorite cube.

Then, it sorts a in reverse order.

Now, it checks:

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems to have a mistake.

Let's think about what this is doing.

After sorting in descending order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, that means all cubes with value >= a[k] are removed, and since x < a[k], it's not removed.

Wait, no.

Wait, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, that means x is less than the smallest of the k removed cubes, so x is not among the removed ones.

Hence, "NO".

If a[k] < x, that means x is greater than the largest of the k removed cubes, so x is among the removed ones.

Hence, "YES".

If a[k] == x, then x is equal to the smallest of the k removed cubes, and whether it's removed depends on its position.

In this case, it checks if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x.

Wait, k == n - 1 means that k is the last position.

But since k is 0-based, k == n - 1 is the last position.

If k == n - 1 and a[k] == x, then the last cube is removed, which is x, so "YES".

Else, if a[k - 1] < x, that means the cube before k is smaller than x, so all x's are at position k and above, so "YES".

Else, "MAYBE".

Wait, but I need to verify this.

Let's consider the range of possible positions for the favorite cube when a[k] == x.

The favorite cube has value x.

The number of cubes with value > x is g.

The number of cubes with value == x is e.

So, the positions of the favorite cube can be from g to g + e - 1.

Now, k is the last removed position.

If g + e - 1 < k, then all positions of x are removed.

Wait, but in the code, if a[k] == x, and k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x, then "YES", else "MAYBE".

Wait, maybe this needs some adjustment.

Let me think differently.

In the sorted list, positions 0 to k-1 are removed.

If the favorite cube is in any of these positions, it's removed.

Given that a[k] == x, and a[k - 1] < x, that means that all x's are in positions >= k.

But wait, a[k] == x and a[k - 1] > x would mean that there are cubes with value > x in positions before k.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of cubes with value > x and == x.

Let me denote:

- g: number of cubes with value > x

- e: number of cubes with value == x

Then, in the sorted list, the positions of cubes with value == x are from g to g + e - 1.

Now, the first k cubes are removed, which are positions 0 to k - 1.

If g + e - 1 < k, then all positions of x are removed, so "YES".

If g >= k, then all positions of x are not removed, so "NO".

Else, some positions of x are removed and some are not, so "MAYBE".

Hence, the correct logic should be:

if g + e - 1 < k:

print('YES')

elif g >= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

Now, in the provided code:

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to achieve the same thing differently.

Let me see.

If a[k] > x, that means x is below the removed cubes, so not removed ("NO").

If a[k] < x, that means x is above the removed cubes, so removed ("YES").

If a[k] == x, then it depends.

In this case, if k == n - 1, meaning that k is the last position, and a[k] == x, then x is removed.

Or, if a[k - 1] < x, meaning that the cube just before k is smaller than x, so all x's are at position k and above, so "YES".

Else, "MAYBE".

Wait, but this seems to correspond to the logic I described earlier.

Wait, maybe I need to verify with an example.

Take the first sample input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5, f=2 (0-based index 1), k=2 (0-based index 1)

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

x = a[1] = 3

Sort a descending: [4,3,3,3,2]

a[k] = a[1] = 3

a[k] == x = 3

Now, check if k == n - 1 (1 == 4? No), and a[k - 1] = a[0] = 4 > 3, so not "YES" unless a[k - 1] < x.

Since a[k - 1] > x, it's "MAYBE".

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

n=5, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=3 (0-based index 2)

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

x = a[4] = 5

Sort a descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[2] = 3 < x = 5, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

n=5, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=2 (0-based index 1)

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

x = a[4] = 3

Sort a descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[1] = 4 > x = 3, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

n=5, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=4 (0-based index 3)

a = [1,2,5,4,3]

x = a[4] = 3

Sort a descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[3] = 2 < x = 3, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

n=5, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=3 (0-based index 2)

a = [3,1,2,4,5]

x = a[4] = 5

Sort a descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[2] = 3 < x = 5, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

n=5, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=4 (0-based index 3)

a = [4,3,2,1,5]

x = a[4] = 5

Sort a descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[3] = 2 < x = 5, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

n=6, f=4 (0-based index 4), k=2 (0-based index 1)

a = [1,2,3,1,2,3]

x = a[4] = 2

Sort a descending: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

a[k] = a[1] = 3 > x = 2, so "NO"

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, k=3 (0-based index 2)

So, a[k] = a[2] = 2 == x = 2

Then, check if k == n - 1 (2 == 5? No), and a[k - 1] = a[1] = 3 > 2, so not "YES", hence "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

n=10, f=0 (0-based index 0), k=0 (0-based index -1? Wait, k -=1 makes k=0)

Wait, k -=1 makes k=0, which is 0-based index.

a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

x = a[0] = 1

Sort a descending: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

a[k] = a[0] =1 == x=1

Then, k != n-1 (0 != 9), and a[k-1] = a[-1] which is not defined.

Wait, a[k-1] for k=0, k-1=-1, which is the last element, a[-1]=1 == x=1, so not "YES", hence "MAYBE"

But according to the sample output, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, but in this case, all cubes have value 1, so the favorite cube could be in any position from 0 to 9.

Removing the first k=1 cubes: position 0.

So, if the favorite cube is in position 0, it's removed; otherwise, not.

Hence, "MAYBE".

So, the code seems to handle this case correctly.

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

n=1, f=0, k=0

a = [42]

x = a[0] =42

Sort a descending: [42]

a[k] = a[0]=42 == x=42

Then, k != n-1 (0 != 0? Yes, for n=1, k=0 == n-1=0)

So, "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

n=5, f=1 (0-based index 1), k=2 (0-based index 1)

a = [2,2,1,1,2]

x = a[1]=2

Sort a descending: [2,2,2,1,1]

a[k] = a[1]=2 == x=2

Then, k != n-1 (1 != 4), and a[k-1]=a[0]=2 == x=2, so not "YES", hence "MAYBE"

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "YES".

Wait, there might be a mistake here.

Wait, in this case, g = number of cubes with value > x=2, which is 0.

e = number of cubes with value == x=2, which is 3.

So, positions of x are from 0 to 2.

k=2
