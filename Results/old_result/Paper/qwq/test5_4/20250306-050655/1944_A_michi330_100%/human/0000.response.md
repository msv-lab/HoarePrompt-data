Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n islands, numbered from 1 to n, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? The total number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense because that's the number of edges in a complete graph.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy up to k bridges, and the goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach from island 1 after destroying some bridges.

I need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can still visit, including island 1, after Dominater optimally destroys up to k bridges.

First, I need to understand what "optimally" means in this context. Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so they should destroy bridges in such a way that they maximize the isolation of island 1.

In graph terms, I think this means Dominater wants to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying at most k bridges.

Given that the graph is initially complete, meaning there are multiple paths between any two islands, Dominater needs to carefully choose which bridges to destroy to isolate island 1 as much as possible.

Let me think about a small example to get a better understanding.

Take n=2, k=0.

If k=0, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can reach island 2 from island 1. So, the number of islands Everule can visit is 2.

If n=2, k=1.

There's only one bridge between island 1 and island 2. If Dominater destroys that bridge, Everule can't reach island 2, so only island 1 is accessible. So, the number is 1.

Another example: n=4, k=1.

Initially, there are 6 bridges (since 4 choose 2 is 6). If Dominater destroys one bridge, say the one between island 1 and island 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3 or island 4. So, Everule can still reach all 4 islands.

Wait, in the problem's note, it says for n=4 and k=1, the output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands despite one bridge being destroyed.

So, in general, it seems that unless Dominater can disconnect island 1 from the rest of the islands, Everule can still reach all islands.

But in a complete graph, to disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1.

Wait, island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands, so there are n-1 bridges directly connected to island 1.

If Dominater destroys all of these n-1 bridges, then Everule can't reach any other island, so only island 1 is accessible.

If Dominater destroys fewer than n-1 bridges, there will still be at least one direct bridge from island 1 to another island, and since the graph is complete, there are multiple paths to reach any island.

Wait, but in the complete graph, even if some bridges are destroyed, as long as there is at least one bridge connected to island 1, there will be a path to every other island, because you can go through other islands.

Wait, is that true? Let's see.

Suppose n=4, k=2.

Islands: 1,2,3,4.

If Dominater destroys bridges between 1-2 and 1-3, then Everule can still reach island 2 via island 4, since 1-4 is still there, and 4-2 is there.

So, even destroying two bridges connected to island 1 doesn't isolate island 1, because there are alternative paths.

Wait, but in this case, to isolate island 1 completely, Dominater needs to destroy all n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, and Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, then there are still some bridges connected to island 1, and since the graph is complete, there are multiple paths to reach any other island.

Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, if k < n-1

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for n=5 and k=10, the output is 1.

Wait, n=5, n-1=4.

If k=10, which is more than 4, but according to my earlier logic, Dominater only needs to destroy 4 bridges to isolate island 1.

But in this case, k=10 is way more than 4, so yes, isolating island 1 is possible.

Wait, but in n=5, total bridges are 10.

If k=10, Dominater can destroy all bridges, making island 1 isolated.

If k=9, Dominater can destroy 9 bridges, but there's still one bridge left, so Everule can still reach at least one other island through that bridge, and from there, reach all other islands because the graph is complete.

Wait, but if Dominater destroys all but one bridge connected to island 1, Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, no, if Dominater destroys all bridges except one connected to island 1, Everule can reach all islands via that one connection.

But if Dominater destroys all bridges in the graph, then Everule can only stay on island 1.

Wait, but in n=5, k=10, which is the total number of bridges, so Dominater can destroy all bridges, isolating island 1.

In n=5, k=3, the output is 5.

So, k=3 < 4=n-1, so Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but in n=4, k=4, output is 1.

Wait, n=4, total bridges are 6.

If k=4, Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

But to isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy only 3 bridges.

So, even if Dominater destroys 4 bridges, as long as there is at least one bridge connected to island 1, Everule can reach all islands.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

But according to my earlier logic, Dominater needs to destroy only 3 bridges to isolate island 1.

So, why is k=4 also giving 1?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in n=4, k=4, Dominater can destroy all bridges except one, but then Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but the output is 1, meaning only island 1 is accessible.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in n=4, k=4, total bridges are 6.

If Dominater destroys 4 bridges, leaving 2 bridges intact.

If those 2 bridges include at least one bridge connected to island 1, then Everule can still reach all islands.

But in this case, the output is 1, meaning Dominater can isolate island 1.

Wait, perhaps Dominater can choose to destroy bridges in such a way that island 1 is isolated, even if k < n-1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=4, total bridges are 6.

If Dominater destroys 4 bridges, they can choose to destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, and one additional bridge.

By destroying all 3 bridges connected to island 1, island 1 is isolated.

So, Everule can only visit island 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

But in n=4, k=1, the output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Because destroying only one bridge doesn't isolate island 1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, Everule can still reach all islands, because Dominater can destroy 3 bridges, but if they don't all target island 1's connections, Everule can still find paths.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, Dominater can destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

But according to the problem's example, for n=4, k=1, output is 4; for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is that Dominater can destroy up to k bridges, but not necessarily all of them.

So, Dominater will choose to destroy bridges in such a way that minimizes the number of islands Everule can reach, without exceeding k bridges destroyed.

In the case of n=4, k=4, Dominater can choose to destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, and still have 1 bridge left to destroy, but it's already achieved the goal.

So, Everule can only visit island 1.

In n=4, k=1, Dominater can destroy only 1 bridge, but that's not enough to isolate island 1, so Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges, which is enough to isolate island 1 by destroying all its connections.

But in the problem's example, for n=5 and k=3, the output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps in n=5, k=3, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 by destroying only 3 bridges, because island 1 has 4 connections, so destroying 3 bridges only leaves one connection still intact, allowing Everule to reach all islands through that connection.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, Dominater can destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, the output isn't provided in the example.

Wait, in the example provided:

Input:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

Output:

2

1

4

1

5

1

So, for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

For n=4, k=1, output is 4.

For n=5, k=3, output is 5.

So, in n=5, k=3, Everule can still reach all islands.

But in n=4, k=3, if Dominater destroys all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, then the output should be 1.

But it's not in the example, perhaps because k=3 is less than the total bridges in n=4.

Wait, n=4 has 6 bridges.

If k=3, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges.

If they destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

But according to the problem's example, for n=4, k=3, the output isn't provided, so maybe in this case, Everule can still reach all islands if Dominater doesn't target all bridges connected to island 1.

Wait, but Dominater is smart and will choose to destroy bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

So, for n=4, k=3, Dominater can choose to destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, so output should be 1.

But in the problem's example, for n=5, k=3, output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, in n=5, island 1 has 4 connections.

If Dominater destroys 3 of them, one connection remains, allowing Everule to reach all islands through that remaining connection.

Hence, output is 5.

Similarly, in n=4, k=3, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges, which are all connected to island 1, isolating it.

Hence, output should be 1.

But in the problem's example, for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier thought process.

Wait, maybe the key is that in a complete graph, to isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, and Everule can reach all islands.

But in n=4, k=3, n-1=3, so k >= n-1, output should be 1.

But in n=4, k=3 is not present in the example.

In n=4, k=4, output is 1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, according to this logic, output should be 1.

But in n=5, k=3, n-1=4, k=3 < 4, so output is 5.

That seems consistent.

Hence, the general rule is:

- If k >= n-1, output is 1

- Else, output is n

Wait, but in n=5, k=10, which is more than n-1=4, output is 1.

And in n=5, k=3, which is less than n-1=4, output is 5.

Similarly, in n=4, k=4, which is equal to n-1=3, but in this case, n=4, n-1=3, but k=4 >=3, so output is 1.

Wait, but k=4 is greater than n-1=3.

Wait, but in n=4, total bridges are 6.

So, k=4 >= n-1=3, so output is 1.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Therefore, the program should check if k >= n-1:

- If yes, print 1

- Else, print n

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

This seems to match exactly with the logic I just derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{1 or }n} \]

**Code**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit given that Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges in a fully connected graph of \( n \) islands.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have \( n \) islands, all initially connected via bridges in a complete graph fashion.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can visit any island connected via these bridges.

2. **Dominater's Action:**
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges with the goal of minimizing the number of islands Everule can visit.
   
3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To isolate Everule on island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1.
   - Island 1 is connected to \( n-1 \) other islands directly.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, thus isolating it. Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still visit all islands via the remaining bridges.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the values of \( n \) (number of islands) and \( k \) (maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy).

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n-1 \), print 1 (only island 1 is accessible).
   - If \( k \) is less than \( n-1 \), print \( n \) (all islands are accessible).

This approach ensures that we handle each test case efficiently, determining the correct output based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( n-1 \).
