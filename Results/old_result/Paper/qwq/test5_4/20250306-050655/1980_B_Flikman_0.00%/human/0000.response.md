Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a certain value. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order, meaning from largest to smallest values. If two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order relative to each other.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

First, I need to understand what "non-increasing order" means. It means that the cubes are sorted such that the largest values come first, and then decreasing. So, the first cube after sorting is the one with the highest value, the second is next highest, and so on.

Now, the favorite cube could be anywhere in this sorted list. If it's among the first k cubes, it gets removed. Otherwise, it stays.

But there's a twist: when there are cubes with the same value, their order relative to each other is arbitrary. That means that if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, we don't know exactly where the favorite cube will end up in the sorted list.

So, my task is to determine, given the values of the cubes and the position of the favorite one, whether the favorite cube will be removed (YES), will not be removed (NO), or it's possible in some scenarios it gets removed and in others it doesn't (MAYBE).

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to analyze the sorted order. Since the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the highest values are first.

I need to find out where the favorite cube could be positioned after sorting.

Let's consider the favorite cube's value. Let's denote it as v_f = a[f-1], since the cubes are 1-indexed but in programming, arrays are 0-indexed.

Now, in the sorted list, all cubes with values greater than v_f will come before those with value v_f. The cubes with value v_f can be in any order among themselves.

So, the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list depends on:

1. How many cubes have values greater than v_f.

2. How many cubes have values equal to v_f.

Let's say there are g cubes with values greater than v_f.

Then, in the sorted list, these g cubes will be first, followed by the cubes with value v_f.

Since the cubes with value v_f can be in any order among themselves, the favorite cube could be anywhere within the first (g + s) positions, where s is the number of cubes with value equal to v_f.

Now, Dmitry removes the first k cubes.

So, the favorite cube will be removed if it is among the first k cubes.

Given that it can be in any position from g+1 to g+s in the sorted list, we need to see if this range overlaps with the first k positions.

Let's consider different cases:

1. If g >= k, then the first k cubes are all cubes with values greater than v_f. Since the favorite cube has value v_f, it's not among these k cubes. So, it's not removed. Answer: NO.

Wait, no. If g >= k, that means there are at least k cubes with values greater than v_f, so the first k cubes are all greater than v_f, and the favorite cube is among the remaining cubes. So, it's not removed. But wait, the problem says "the first k cubes are removed." So, if g >= k, then the favorite cube is not among the first k cubes, so it's not removed. So, answer: NO.

2. If g + s <= k, that means the first g cubes are those with values greater than v_f, and the next s cubes are those with value v_f. If g + s <= k, then all cubes with value v_f are among the first k cubes and will be removed. So, the favorite cube is definitely removed. Answer: YES.

3. If g < k and g + s > k, that means some of the cubes with value v_f are among the first k cubes, and some are not. Since their order among themselves is arbitrary, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not. So, answer: MAYBE.

Wait, let's verify this.

- g is the number of cubes with value > v_f.

- s is the number of cubes with value == v_f.

- k is the number of cubes to remove.

- If g >= k, then only cubes with value > v_f are removed, so favorite cube is not removed. Answer: NO.

- If g + s <= k, then all cubes with value >= v_f are removed, including the favorite cube. Answer: YES.

- If g < k and g + s > k, then some cubes with value == v_f are removed, and some are not, depending on their order. So, the favorite cube may or may not be removed. Answer: MAYBE.

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, in the code provided, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases, since the first input is t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, f, k.

- Read the list a of n integers.

- Determine the favorite cube's value: favorite_value = a[f-1] (since lists are 0-indexed in Python).

- Count how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube: same_value_count.

- Count how many cubes have values greater than the favorite cube: greater_count.

Then, it seems to implement the logic I described:

- If greater_count >= k, print 'NO'. Wait, according to my earlier reasoning, if g >= k, then the favorite cube is not removed, so 'NO'. But according to the code, it's 'YES'. That seems incorrect.

Wait, let's look at the code again:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        favorite_value = a[f - 1]

        same_value_count = 0

        for value in a:

            if value == favorite_value:

                same_value_count += 1

        greater_count = 0

        for value in a:

            if value > favorite_value:

                greater_count += 1

        if greater_count >= k:

            print('YES')

        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

            print('NO')

        else:

            print('MAYBE')

```

Wait a minute, in the code:

- If greater_count >= k, print 'YES'.

- Elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k, print 'NO'.

- Else, print 'MAYBE'.

But according to my earlier reasoning:

- If g >= k, print 'NO'.

- Elif g + s <= k, print 'YES'.

- Else, print 'MAYBE'.

So, the 'YES' and 'NO' are swapped in the code compared to my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the logic.

Let me re-examine.

If g >= k, that means there are at least k cubes with values greater than v_f. So, the first k cubes are all greater than v_f, and the favorite cube is not among them. So, it's not removed. So, 'NO'.

If g + s <= k, that means there are g cubes with values greater than v_f and s cubes with values equal to v_f. So, total cubes with value >= v_f is g + s. If this is <= k, then all of them are removed, including the favorite cube. So, 'YES'.

If g < k and g + s > k, then some of the cubes with value == v_f are removed, and some are not, so 'MAYBE'.

Therefore, the code has the 'YES' and 'NO' cases swapped.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

But according to my corrected reasoning:

- If g >= k: 'NO'

- Elif g + s <= k: 'YES'

- Else: 'MAYBE'

So, the code has 'YES' and 'NO' swapped.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

But perhaps I need to double-check this.

Let me take an example from the provided sample input and output.

Take the first test case:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

favorite_value = a[1] = 3

greater_count = number of cubes with value >3: only 4, so g=1

same_value_count = number of cubes with value=3: three cubes, s=3

Now, g=1, k=2

Since g=1 < k=2, and g + s =1 + 3=4 > k=2

So, according to the logic, it should be 'MAYBE'

And in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Now, according to the code:

if g >=k: 1 >=2? No

elif g + s <=k: 1 + 3 <=2? 4 <=2? No

else: 'MAYBE'

Which matches.

Another test case:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

favorite_value = a[4]=5

g = number of cubes with value >5: none, g=0

s = number of cubes with value=5: only one, s=1

If g=0 < k=3, and g+s=1 <=k=3?

Wait, g + s =1 <=k=3, so according to the logic, it should be 'YES'

But according to the code:

if g >=k: 0 >=3? No

elif g + s <=k: 1 <=3? Yes, so 'NO'

But according to my logic, it should be 'YES'

Wait, contradiction here.

So, perhaps my logic was wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine.

If g + s <=k, then all cubes with value >= v_f are removed, including the favorite cube, so 'YES' it's removed.

But according to the code, it's printing 'NO' in this case.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the sample input, for this case, the output is "YES", but according to the code, it would print 'NO', which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I think the code has the 'YES' and 'NO' cases swapped.

It should be:

if g + s <=k:

print('YES')

elif g >=k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

But in the code, it's:

if g >=k:

print('YES')

elif g + s <=k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

So, it's swapping 'YES' and 'NO'.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed when he arranges the cubes in non-increasing order and removes the first k cubes.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - Read the number of test cases, t.
   - For each test case, read the values of n (number of cubes), f (index of the favorite cube), and k (number of cubes to remove).
   - Read the list of cube values, a.

2. **Determine Favorite Cube's Value**:
   - Identify the value of the favorite cube using its index, f.

3. **Count Relevant Cubes**:
   - Count the number of cubes that have a value greater than the favorite cube (greater_count).
   - Count the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube (same_value_count).

4. **Decide the Outcome**:
   - **If the number of cubes with greater values is greater than or equal to k**: 
     - The favorite cube is not among the first k cubes removed. Hence, print 'NO'.
   - **If the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to k**:
     - All cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube are removed. Hence, print 'YES'.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - The favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on its position among cubes with the same value. Hence, print 'MAYBE'.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        same_value_count = 0
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        greater_count = 0
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        if greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count >= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the inputs for t, n, f, k, and the list a.

2. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - Extract the value of the favorite cube from the list a.

3. **Counting**:
   - Calculate the counts of cubes with values greater than and equal to the favorite cube.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Use the counts to decide whether the favorite cube is definitely removed ('YES'), not removed ('NO'), or it's uncertain ('MAYBE') based on the given conditions.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the fate of the favorite cube in each test case by considering the sorting and removal process effectively.
