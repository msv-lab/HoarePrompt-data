Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any number that is two digits or more, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original number. This can be done repeatedly.

So, the question is whether, by splitting some of the numbers into their digits, I can arrange the array so that it's sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about what this means. Each number in the array can either stay as it is (if it's less than 10) or be split into its digits. My goal is to have the sequence of these numbers or digits in non-decreasing order.

I need to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and see if there's at least one way where the array becomes sorted.

This seems a bit tricky because there could be multiple choices for splitting or not splitting numbers, and I have to check if any of those choices lead to a sorted array.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting the first element, 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says to split the first element, but according to the operation, I can only split elements that are at least 10. So, 12 is at least 10, so I can split it into [1, 2]. So, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is indeed sorted.

Another example:

Input:

3

12 28 5

After trying to split 12 and 28, it doesn't lead to a sorted array.

Third example:

Input:

2

0 0

It's already sorted.

So, I need to find a way to determine if splitting some of the numbers can lead to a sorted array.

One approach that comes to mind is to iterate through the array and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If not, check if splitting the current element or the next element can make them in order.

But this seems a bit too simplistic, as there might be cases where splitting multiple elements is necessary.

Let me think differently. Suppose I consider each number as a potential candidate for splitting, and I split all numbers that are greater than or equal to 10, then check if the resulting array is sorted.

But that might not be efficient, because splitting all such numbers could lead to a very long array, and it's not necessary to split all of them.

I need a smarter way to decide which numbers to split.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as building a sequence where each position can be either the original number (if it's less than 10) or its digits (if it's greater than or equal to 10).

So, for each position, I have a choice: if the number is less than 10, I have to keep it as is. If it's 10 or more, I can choose to keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Then, I need to see if there's a combination of these choices that leads to a sorted array.

This sounds like a problem that could be solved with backtracking: try splitting or not splitting each number and see if the resulting array is sorted.

However, with n up to 50, and each element possibly being split into up to 2 digits, the number of possibilities could be quite large. Maybe backtracking is not efficient enough.

Let me see if there's a better way.

Another idea: since splitting a number into digits always results in smaller or equal values, I can consider the maximum possible value for each position, which would be the number itself if it's less than 10, or the digits if it's 10 or more.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the sequence is non-decreasing.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value I've seen so far, and ensure that each subsequent element is greater than or equal to that maximum.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the first example again:

[12, 3, 45, 67]

If I split 12 into [1, 2], then the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

Alternatively, if I don't split 12, but split 45 into [4, 5], then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, splitting only 12 works, but splitting only 45 doesn't.

If I split both 12 and 45, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is sorted.

So, there are multiple ways to split, and I need to find at least one that results in a sorted array.

This seems complicated to handle with a simple iteration.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers.

Each number that is split contributes its digits to the array in order.

So, the relative order of the digits within a number is preserved.

Also, the positions of the digits are inserted where the original number was.

So, the digits of a number are contiguous in the array after splitting.

I need to ensure that the sequence of these digits, possibly mixed with other numbers that are not split, is non-decreasing.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can model this as inserting the digits of each number in place and checking if there's a way to choose which numbers to split such that the resulting array is sorted.

But again, with n up to 50, and each number potentially split into up to 2 digits, the number of possibilities is large.

Wait, but maybe I can think of it differently.

Suppose I consider the array as a stream of digits, where each number is either taken as a whole (if not split) or split into its digits.

I need to arrange these digits in such a way that the sequence is non-decreasing.

But I need to maintain the relative order of the digits within each number.

This seems complex.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I iterate through the array from left to right, and at each step, I consider the current element.

If the current element is less than the previous element, I need to decide whether splitting the previous element or the current element can make the sequence non-decreasing.

Wait, but it's not just about the immediate previous element; it's about the entire sequence up to that point.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, the function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the array) and the array `arr`.

It initializes a variable `ans` to `True`.

Then, it iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.

If it finds such a case, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the digits followed by `arr[i]` are sorted.

If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

Otherwise, it replaces `arr[i-1]` with the first digit of the split digits.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

Wait, but in the explanation, for the first example, [12, 3, 45, 67], it splits 12 into [1, 2], resulting in [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

But according to the reference solution, it starts from the end and checks if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.

In this case, starting from i=3 (0-based index), arr[3]=67 and arr[2]=45; 67 >= 45, so no issue.

Then i=2, arr[2]=45 and arr[1]=3; 45 > 3, which violates the order.

So, it would split arr[1]=3, but 3 is less than 10, so it can't be split.

Hence, it would set ans to False.

But according to the problem, it's possible to split arr[0]=12 into [1,2], resulting in [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Maybe the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the reference solution.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

In this case, for i=2 (since m=4, i from 3 to 1):

arr[2]=67, arr[1]=3; 67 < 3 is False.

Then i=1: arr[1]=3, arr[0]=12; 3 < 12 is True.

So, it splits arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and appends arr[1]=3, so nums=[1,2,3].

It checks if [1,2,3] == sorted([1,2,3]), which is True, so it sets arr[0]=1 and continues.

Now, the array becomes [1, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

So, it should print 'YES'.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, when i=1, arr[1]=3 < arr[0]=12, so it splits arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and checks [1,2,3], which is sorted, so it sets arr[0]=1.

Then, the array becomes [1, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

Hence, it should print 'YES'.

So, in this case, the reference solution works correctly.

Let me check the second example:

Input:

3

12 28 5

Following the reference solution:

First, i=2: arr[2]=5 < arr[1]=28 is False.

Then i=1: arr[1]=28 < arr[0]=12 is True.

So, it splits arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and appends arr[1]=28, so nums=[1,2,28].

It checks if [1,2,28] == sorted([1,2,28]), which is [1,2,28], so it's True.

Then, it sets arr[0]=1.

Now, the array is [1, 28, 5].

Is [1,28,5] sorted? No, because 28 > 5.

So, it should set ans to False.

But according to the problem, it's not possible to make it sorted, so 'NO' is correct.

Hence, in this case, the reference solution works correctly.

Third example:

Input:

2

0 0

No need to split anything, as it's already sorted.

Hence, 'YES'.

So, for the given examples, the reference solution seems correct.

Now, I need to verify if this solution is generally correct.

Let's try to understand the logic.

The solution iterates from the end to the beginning.

Whenever it finds arr[i] < arr[i-1], it splits arr[i-1] into its digits and appends arr[i].

Then, it checks if this sequence of digits is sorted.

If it is, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit and continues.

Otherwise, it sets ans to False and breaks.

The idea seems to be that if splitting a number and inserting its digits allows the sequence to be sorted, then it proceeds by updating the array accordingly.

However, I'm not entirely sure if this covers all possible cases.

Let me think of a potential counterexample.

Suppose the array is [23, 2, 34].

According to the reference solution:

Start with i=2: arr[2]=34 < arr[1]=2 is False.

Then i=1: arr[1]=2 < arr[0]=23 is True.

So, split arr[0]=23 into [2,3], append arr[1]=2, so nums=[2,3,2].

Check if [2,3,2] == sorted([2,3,2]), which is [2,2,3]. They are not equal, so set ans to False and print 'NO'.

But wait, is there a way to make this array sorted?

If we split both 23 and 34:

Split 23 into [2,3], and 34 into [3,4], so the array becomes [2,3,3,4], which is sorted.

However, the reference solution doesn't consider splitting both elements; it only considers splitting the current element being checked.

Hence, in this case, the reference solution would incorrectly output 'NO', while actually, it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting both elements.

This suggests that the reference solution is incomplete and may not cover all possible ways of splitting.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't consider all possible combinations of splitting elements.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by optionally splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their individual digits. The challenge is to explore all possible ways of splitting these numbers and check if any of these ways result in a sorted array.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We can split numbers >= 10 into their digits.
   - We need to check if we can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing these splits.

2. **Insight**:
   - Splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with a list of its digits.
   - We need to check all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting numbers >= 10.

3. **Efficient Solution**:
   - Use a stack to simulate the array, allowing us to consider splitting numbers and maintaining the order.
   - Iterate through the array and for each number, consider whether to split it or keep it as is, ensuring the sequence remains non-decreasing.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Use a stack to build the array in a non-decreasing manner.
   - For each number in the array:
     - If the number is less than 10, treat it as a single element.
     - If the number is >= 10, consider both options: splitting it into digits or keeping it as is.
     - Ensure that the sequence remains non-decreasing after each insertion.

## Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            # Option 1: Keep the number as is
            if stack and num < stack[-1]:
                continue  # Cannot keep as is, try splitting
            stack.append(num)
            if not is_sorted(stack):
                stack.pop()
                # Option 2: Split the number into digits
                for digit in digits:
                    if stack and digit < stack[-1]:
                        return False
                    stack.append(digit)
        else:
            if stack and num < stack[-1]:
                return False
            stack.append(num)
    return is_sorted(stack)

def is_sorted(stack):
    return all(stack[i] <= stack[i + 1] for i in range(len(stack) - 1))

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **can_be_sorted function**:
   - Uses a stack to build the array while maintaining non-decreasing order.
   - For each number:
     - If the number is >= 10, consider both keeping it as is and splitting it into digits.
     - Ensure the sequence remains non-decreasing after each insertion.
   
2. **is_sorted function**:
   - Checks if the stack is in non-decreasing order.

3. **main function**:
   - Reads input and processes each test case.
   - Determines if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers as needed and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

This approach ensures that we explore the necessary options to split numbers and maintain the array in a sorted order efficiently.
