Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the answer is finite. Also, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have the number of constraints n, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to collect all the constraints of each type.

- For type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum among these x because k needs to be greater than or equal to all of them.

- For type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum among these x because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them.

- For type 3 (k != x), I need to exclude these specific x values from the possible k.

So, the possible k should be in the range [max_type1, min_type2], excluding the values listed in type 3.

Given that, the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints would be the number of integers in that range minus the number of type 3 constraints where x is within that range.

Wait, but type 3 constraints could be outside the range [max_type1, min_type2], but since k has to be within that range, only the type 3 constraints that fall within that range need to be considered.

So, first, find max_type1 and min_type2.

Then, the number of possible k is min_type2 - max_type1 + 1, minus the number of type 3 constraints where x is in [max_type1, min_type2].

But, I need to make sure that min_type2 is greater than or equal to max_type1, otherwise, there are no possible k.

Also, need to handle the equality conditions properly.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Read the number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, the number of constraints.

b. Read n lines of constraints, each with a and x.

c. Collect all type 1 constraints and find the maximum x among them (let's call it low).

d. Collect all type 2 constraints and find the minimum x among them (let's call it high).

e. Collect all type 3 constraints in a list.

f. If low > high, then there are no possible k.

g. Else, calculate the number of integers k in [low, high], excluding the x's in type 3 that are in this range.

3. Output the result for each test case.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Read t.

- Loop t times.

- In each iteration, read n.

- Then read n lines of constraints.

- Categorize them into type 1, type 2, and type 3.

- Find low as the maximum of type 1's x.

- Find high as the minimum of type 2's x.

- Collect type 3's x in a list.

- Check if low <= high.

- If not, output 0.

- Else, calculate the number of integers in [low, high], which is high - low + 1.

- Then, subtract the number of type 3 x's that are in [low, high].

- Output the result.

I need to be careful with the boundaries and make sure that I handle the exclusions correctly.

Also, since n can be up to 100 and t up to 500, efficiency shouldn't be a problem.

Let me look at the example to verify this logic.

First test case:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, type 1: x=3, so low=3

Type 2: x=10, so high=10

Type 3: x=1 and x=5

Since low=3 <= high=10, number of k in [3,10] is 8.

But exclude x=1 (not in range) and x=5 (in range), so subtract 1.

So, 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

Type 1: x=5, low=5

Type 2: x=4, high=4

Since low=5 > high=4, no possible k, output 0.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Type 1: x=2, x=7, x=3 → max is 7

Type 2: x=100, x=98 → min is 98

So low=7, high=98

Number of k in [7,98] is 92.

Type 3: x=6,7,100,44,99

But only x=6,7,44,99 are in [7,98]. Wait:

x=6: 7 <= 6 <=98? No, 6 < 7, so not in range.

x=7: is in range.

x=100: 100 >98, so not in range.

x=44: 7 <=44<=98, yes.

x=99: 99>98, no.

So, only x=7 and x=44 are in the range to be excluded.

So, 92 - 2 = 90, matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

6

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

Type 1: x=5, x=9 → max is 9

Type 2: x=10, x=2 → min is 2

low=9, high=2

9 > 2, so no possible k, output 0.

Fifth test case:

5

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

Type 1: x=1, low=1

Type 2: x=2, high=2

Type 3: x=1, x=2, x=3

Number of k in [1,2]: 2

Exclude x=1 and x=2, both in range.

So, 2 - 2 = 0, matches sample output.

Sixth test case:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Type 1: x=10000, x=100000000 → max is 100000000

Type 2: x=900000000, high=900000000

Type 3: x=500000000, x=10000, x=900000001

low=100000000, high=900000000

Number of k in [100000000,900000000]: 900000000 -100000000 +1=800000001

Type 3 x's in range: x=500000000, x=10000 (10000 <100000000, so not in range), x=900000001 (>900000000, not in range). So only x=500000000 is in range.

So, 800000001 -1=800000000, matches sample output.

Okay, my logic seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

print(num)

Hmm, let's analyze this.

It seems the program is trying to do something similar, but there are some issues.

First, it separates the constraints into three lists: big for type 1, less for type 2, and no for type 3.

Then, it initializes num to 0.

Then, it loops from max(big) to min(less)-1.

Wait, the problem is to count the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints, but this program seems to be trying to find the smallest k that satisfies all constraints, and then printing that k.

But the problem asks for the count of such k's, not the smallest k itself.

Looking closer:

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

So, it's iterating from max(big) to min(less)-1, and setting num to the first i that's not in no.

Then, it prints num.

But in the problem, we need to count all such i's, not just find the smallest one.

Moreover, in the sample input and output, the outputs are counts like 7, 0, 90, etc., not the values of k.

So, this program is incorrect because it's finding the smallest k that satisfies the constraints (if any), but not counting the total number of such k's.

Wait, in the code, num is set to i if i not in no, and then breaks out of the loop, so it's essentially finding the smallest k that satisfies all constraints, not counting all possible k's.

But the problem requires counting the number of such k's.

Therefore, this program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
