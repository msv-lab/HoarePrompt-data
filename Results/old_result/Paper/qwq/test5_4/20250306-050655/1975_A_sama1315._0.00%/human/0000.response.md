Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform a specific operation any number of times to try to sort the array in non-decreasing order. The operation allows her to split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swap these two parts. So, for example, if the array is [3,1,4,1,5], she can choose to split it into [3,1] and [4,1,5], and then swap them to get [4,1,5,3,1]. She can do this operation as many times as she wants, including zero times.

My task is to determine, for multiple test cases, whether it's possible to sort the given array in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation more deeply. When we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and swap them, it's essentially a rotation of the array. For example, if we have an array [a, b, c, d], and we split it into [a, b] and [c, d], swapping them gives [c, d, a, b]. If we do this operation again, splitting into [c] and [d, a, b], swapping gives [d, a, b, c], and so on.

So, this operation allows us to rotate the array in steps that are not just single elements but any prefix and suffix pair. Importantly, multiple rotations can be performed, and we need to see if, through a series of such rotations, we can sort the array.

Wait a minute, rotation reminds me of circular shifts. In fact, any number of rotations can be achieved by repeated circular shifts. But in this problem, the rotation is not just by one position but by any prefix and suffix split.

Let me think about this differently. If I can perform any number of these splits and swaps, it's like I can rearrange the array in any way that's a rotation of the original array. But is that all? Or can I achieve more permutations than just rotations?

Let's consider an example. Take the array [3,1,4,1,5].

- First rotation: split into [3,1] and [4,1,5], swap to get [4,1,5,3,1].

- Second rotation: split into [4,1,5] and [3,1], swap to get [3,1,4,1,5], which is back to the original.

So, in this case, only two states: the original and the once-swapped version.

Let me try another split. Split into [3,1,4] and [1,5], swap to get [1,5,3,1,4].

- Then, split into [1] and [5,3,1,4], swap to get [5,3,1,4,1].

- Another split into [5,3,1] and [4,1], swap to get [4,1,5,3,1].

- Split into [4,1] and [5,3,1], swap to get [5,3,1,4,1].

It seems like I'm bouncing between different states, but I'm not sure if I can reach a sorted array.

Let me consider the second test case from the example:

Input:

5

7 9 2 2 3

Output:

Yes

In the note, it explains that:

- First, split into x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3], swap to get [9,2,2,3,7].

- Then, split into x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7], swap to get [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, in this case, two operations are enough to sort the array.

Another test case:

Input:

3

1 2 3

Output:

Yes

This is already sorted, so no operation is needed.

And the first test case:

Input:

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

Output:

No

According to the example, it's not possible to sort this array using the given operations.

From these examples, I need to find a general way to determine if any sequence of operations can sort the array.

Let me think about what sequences of operations can achieve.

Each operation is a split into a prefix and a suffix, followed by a swap. This is equivalent to a circular shift by the length of the prefix.

For example, splitting into [a, b] and [c, d, e] and swapping gives [c, d, e, a, b], which is a circular shift by 2 positions.

Wait, but in the first operation, the split points can be chosen freely each time, not just shifting by a fixed number of positions.

Wait, actually, it's more general than just circular shifts. Because each operation allows choosing any prefix and suffix, as long as they cover the whole array.

Wait, actually, prefix and suffix must cover the whole array, meaning that the split point is determined by the length of the prefix.

So, for an array of length n, possible split points are after the first k elements, where k can be from 0 to n.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts."

A prefix is the first k elements, and the suffix is the remaining n - k elements.

So, for each k from 0 to n, we can split the array into the first k elements and the last n - k elements, and swap them.

This operation is equivalent to a circular shift by k positions.

Wait, no. If we split into x = first k elements and y = last n - k elements, and then set a := y + x, that's equivalent to rotating the array by k positions.

For example, with n=5 and k=1:

Split into [a] and [b,c,d,e], swap to get [b,c,d,e,a].

With k=2:

Split into [a,b] and [c,d,e], swap to get [c,d,e,a,b].

And so on.

So, each operation corresponds to a specific circular shift by k positions, for any k from 0 to n.

Now, the problem allows performing this operation any number of times, including zero.

So, the question is, can we reach a sorted version of the array by performing any sequence of circular shifts by any number of positions?

Wait, but circular shifts don't necessarily help in sorting the array. For example, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], no matter how many times we circularly shift it, we might not be able to make it sorted.

But in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], by choosing k=1 and k=0, we can sort it as shown in the example.

So, I need to find a way to determine if the array can be sorted by performing circular shifts by any number of positions.

Wait, but in the first test case, it's impossible to sort it by any sequence of circular shifts.

I need to find a general method to decide this.

Let me consider that performing these operations allows us to rearrange the array in any way that is a rotation of the original array.

But, in reality, each operation is a specific type of rotation, and multiple operations can be composed.

Wait, but rotations are cyclic permutations, and composing rotations corresponds to another rotation.

In group theory, the set of rotations forms a cyclic group.

So, in this context, performing multiple rotations is equivalent to a single rotation by the net number of positions shifted.

But in this problem, each operation allows choosing any k for the rotation, not just rotating by one position repeatedly.

Wait, actually, each operation allows choosing any k from 0 to n, and performing a rotation by k positions.

So, it's not just composing rotations by a fixed amount, but choosing any k each time.

This seems more powerful than just regular circular shifts.

Wait, but is it? If I can perform any rotation by any k, then I can generate any cyclic permutation.

But in this problem, I can choose different k for each operation, and perform them in sequence.

So, the question is, what permutations of the array can be achieved by performing sequences of these rotations?

In group theory, the set of all rotations forms the cyclic group of order n.

But in this problem, since we can choose any k for each rotation, it's like generating the entire symmetric group.

Wait, but that might not be the case, because choosing different k for each rotation might not generate all permutations.

Wait, actually, in the symmetric group S_n, not all permutations can be achieved by rotations.

Only cyclic permutations can be achieved by rotations.

But in this problem, since we can choose different k for each rotation, it's possible to generate more permutations.

Wait, but is it possible to generate all permutations of the array?

Probably not, because rotations preserve certain properties, like the cyclic order.

But in this problem, we need to check if we can reach a sorted version of the array through these operations.

So, perhaps I need to check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3] can be sorted to [2,2,3,7,9], which is a rotation of the original array.

Similarly, in the third test case, [1,2,3] is already sorted.

In the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4] cannot be sorted by rotations.

Wait, but in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3] can be sorted by performing two rotations: first rotate by 1 position to get [9,2,2,3,7], then rotate by 1 again to get [2,2,3,7,9].

Wait, but [2,2,3,7,9] is a rotation of the original array.

So, perhaps the condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But let's check that.

In the second test case, sorted array is [2,2,3,7,9], which is a rotation of [7,9,2,2,3].

In the third test case, [1,2,3] is already sorted and is a rotation of itself.

In the first test case, sorted array would be [1,1,4,4,5], which is not a rotation of [1,1,4,5,1,4].

Wait, but the first test case has n=6, so [1,1,4,5,1,4], and sorted would be [1,1,4,4,5,1], which is not a rotation of the original array.

So, perhaps the condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But in the second test case, [2,2,3,7,9] is a rotation of [7,9,2,2,3].

Yes, that seems to hold.

But in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4] cannot be rotated to [1,1,4,4,5,1], because rotations preserve the order of elements cyclically, but in this case, the number of each element must match in the rotation.

Wait, but in the first test case, the sorted array [1,1,4,4,5,1] has three 1's, two 4's, and one 5, while the original array has two 1's, two 4's, and one 5.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, n=6, array is [1,1,4,5,1,4], so total elements: three 1's, two 4's, one 5.

Sorted array would be [1,1,1,4,4,5].

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts."

It's important to note that the split must satisfy a = x + y, meaning that x and y are contiguous parts of the array.

So, x is the prefix, y is the suffix, and a = x + y.

Then, swapping them gives y + x.

So, for example, with a = [3,1,4,1,5], x = [3,1], y = [4,1,5], so a = x + y = [3,1,4,1,5], and swapping gives y + x = [4,1,5,3,1].

Another example: x = [3,1,4], y = [1,5], a = [3,1,4,1,5], swapping gives [1,5,3,1,4].

Wait, but in the first operation, we choose x and y such that a = x + y, then set a := y + x.

So, it's indeed a rotation by the length of x.

In the first operation, choosing x of length k, rotates the array by k positions.

Then, performing another operation chooses another x of some length m, and rotates the array by m positions.

But, wait, rotating by m positions from the current state.

So, overall, performing multiple rotations corresponds to a net rotation by the sum of the individual rotations modulo n.

Wait, but in group theory, the composition of rotations is another rotation.

So, no matter how many rotations you perform, the net effect is equivalent to a single rotation by some amount.

Therefore, the array after any sequence of operations will be a rotation of the original array.

So, to sort the array, the sorted version must be a rotation of the original array.

But in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3] can be rotated to [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

In the third test case, [1,2,3] is already sorted.

In the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4] cannot be rotated to [1,1,1,4,4,5], because rotating preserves the cyclic order but not the counts of elements in each position.

Wait, but in the first test case, the sorted array [1,1,1,4,4,5] is not a rotation of the original array [1,1,4,5,1,4], because in any rotation, the number of 1's in a row changes.

Wait, but in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3] can be rotated to [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, perhaps the condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4] has sorted version [1,1,1,4,4,5], which is not a rotation of the original array.

Hence, it's impossible to sort it by rotations.

Similarly, in the second test case, the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

So, perhaps the general condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But let me verify this.

Suppose the array is [3,1,2]. Its sorted version is [1,2,3]. Is [1,2,3] a rotation of [3,1,2]? Yes, because rotating [3,1,2] by 1 position to the left gives [1,2,3].

So, in this case, it's possible to sort it by one rotation.

Another example: [4,5,1,2,3]. Sorted is [1,2,3,4,5], which is a rotation of the original array.

So, it seems that if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array, then it's possible to sort it by performing rotations.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

But wait, in the first test case, the sorted array is not a rotation of the original array, hence it's impossible to sort it.

So, perhaps the condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But let's think about the frequency of elements.

In the first test case, the sorted array has three 1's, two 4's, and one 5, while the original array has two 1's, two 4's, and one 5.

Wait, no, in the first test case, n=6, array is [1,1,4,5,1,4], so total elements: three 1's, two 4's, one 5.

Sorted array would be [1,1,1,4,4,5].

But in the original array, it's [1,1,4,5,1,4].

So, the sorted array is not a rotation of the original array because the counts don't match in a cyclic manner.

Wait, but in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], sorted is [2,2,3,7,9], which is a rotation of the original array.

So, perhaps the condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But to confirm, let's consider another example.

Suppose the array is [3,4,5,1,2]. Sorted is [1,2,3,4,5], which is a rotation of the original array.

Hence, it should be possible to sort it by rotations.

Another example: [2,3,4,5,1]. Sorted is [1,2,3,4,5], which is a rotation of the original array.

So, seems consistent.

But wait, in the first test case, the sorted array is not a rotation of the original array because the counts don't match properly.

So, perhaps the general condition is that the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But how do I check if one array is a rotation of another?

One way is to check if the sorted array is a substring of the original array concatenated twice.

For example, if I concatenate the original array with itself, then if the sorted array is a substring of it, then it's a rotation.

For example, for [7,9,2,2,3], concatenated twice is [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3].

Sorted array is [2,2,3,7,9], which is a substring of the concatenated array.

Similarly, for [1,1,4,5,1,4], concatenated twice is [1,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,4,5,1,4].

Sorted array is [1,1,1,4,4,5], which is not a substring of the concatenated array.

Hence, it's not a rotation.

So, this seems like a viable method.

Hence, in func_1, I need to check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But in func_1, it seems to check if the array is already sorted, and if not, returns 'No'.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform the operation any number of times, including zero.

So, if the array is already sorted, we can return 'Yes'.

Otherwise, we need to check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

Hence, func_1 should be modified to check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But in the given program, func_1 seems to check if the array is already sorted, and if not, returns 'No'.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform operations to sort the array.

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Wait, let's look at func_1:

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

This seems confusing.

It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, returns 'Yes'.

Otherwise, if there is any arr[i] > arr[i + 1], it returns 'No', else 'Yes'.

Wait, but if the array is not sorted, but can be sorted by rotations, it should return 'Yes'.

But according to this function, if the array is not sorted and has at least one arr[i] > arr[i + 1], it returns 'No'.

Otherwise, if the array is not sorted but has no arr[i] > arr[i + 1], which is impossible unless the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.

Wait, no, if the array has elements equal, it's possible to have arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for all i, but not strictly increasing.

Wait, but according to the problem, we need to sort in non-decreasing order.

Hence, if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, return 'Yes'.

If it's not sorted, but can be sorted by rotations, return 'Yes'.

Otherwise, 'No'.

But according to func_1, if the array is not sorted, and has any arr[i] > arr[i + 1], it returns 'No', which is correct for cases where it cannot be sorted by rotations.

But, in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], which is not sorted, but can be sorted by rotations, so it should return 'Yes'.

But according to func_1, since there is arr[0] =7 <9, but 9>2, so it has arr[i] > arr[i + 1], hence returns 'No', which is incorrect.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the example, the output for the second test case is 'Yes', so perhaps there's something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, in func_1, it seems to return 'No' if there is any arr[i] > arr[i + 1], which is not correct, because even if there is arr[i] > arr[i + 1], it might still be possible to sort by rotations.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But according to the sample output, the second test case should be 'Yes', but according to func_1, it would return 'No', which is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

But perhaps I misread func_1.

Let's look at func_1 again:

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

Wait, the second return statement has 'No' if any arr[i] > arr[i + 1], else 'Yes'.

But, if the array is not sorted, but can be sorted by rotations, it should return 'Yes'.

But in this function, if the array is not sorted, and has arr[i] > arr[i + 1], it returns 'No', which is incorrect for cases like the second test case.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
