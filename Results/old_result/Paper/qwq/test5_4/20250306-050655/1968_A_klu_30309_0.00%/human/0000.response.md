Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. So, I need to find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is as large as possible.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to pick y (where y < x) such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximized.

Let me think about this. Since y is less than x, the possible values for y range from 1 to x-1.

One straightforward approach would be to iterate through all possible y values, calculate y + GCD(x, y) for each, and pick the y that gives the maximum sum. However, since x can be up to 1000 and there are up to 1000 test cases, this might not be the most efficient way, but given the constraints, it should be manageable.

But maybe there's a smarter way to find y without checking every possible value.

Let's consider some examples to see if there's a pattern or a better approach.

Take x = 10.

Possible y values are from 1 to 9.

Let's compute y + GCD(x, y) for each:

- y=1: 1 + GCD(10,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + GCD(10,2)=2+2=4

- y=3: 3 + GCD(10,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + GCD(10,4)=4+2=6

- y=5: 5 + GCD(10,5)=5+5=10

- y=6: 6 + GCD(10,6)=6+2=8

- y=7: 7 + GCD(10,7)=7+1=8

- y=8: 8 + GCD(10,8)=8+2=10

- y=9: 9 + GCD(10,9)=9+1=10

So, the maximum sum is 10, which is achieved by y=5, y=8, and y=9.

According to the problem, any of these y values is acceptable since it says "if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any."

In the example output for x=10, it shows y=5. So, that's one possible answer.

Looking at this, y=5 is a divisor of x=10, and in fact, y=5 is x/2. Similarly, y=8 is not a divisor of 10, but y=5 is.

Wait, y=5 is a divisor of 10, and y=8 is not, but y=8 still gives a high sum because y is large.

Let me think about this again.

Another example: x=7.

Possible y values: 1 to 6.

- y=1: 1 + GCD(7,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + GCD(7,2)=2+1=3

- y=3: 3 + GCD(7,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + GCD(7,4)=4+1=5

- y=5: 5 + GCD(7,5)=5+1=6

- y=6: 6 + GCD(7,6)=6+1=7

So, the maximum is 7, achieved by y=6.

In this case, y=6 is not a divisor of 7, but since y is close to x, the sum is maximized.

Wait, but GCD(7,6)=1, so y + GCD(x,y) = 6 + 1 = 7.

Another example: x=21.

Possible y up to 20.

Looking at y=18:

GCD(21,18)=3, so 18 + 3 = 21.

y=20: GCD(21,20)=1, so 20 + 1 = 21.

y=18 is less than x=21, and both y=18 and y=20 give the same sum of 21.

In the example output, y=18 is chosen.

Again, y=18 is a divisor of 21 multiplied by some factor.

Wait, 18 is 21 - 3, and 3 is a divisor of 21.

Hmm.

Another example: x=100.

y=98:

GCD(100,98)=2, so 98 + 2 = 100.

y=99:

GCD(100,99)=1, so 99 + 1 = 100.

Both give the same sum.

In the example output, y=98 is chosen.

Similarly, y=98 is x - 2, and 2 is a divisor of 100.

Wait, 2 is a divisor of 100, and y=98 is x - 2.

Similarly, for x=6, y=3: GCD(6,3)=3, so 3 + 3 = 6.

y=4: GCD(6,4)=2, so 4 + 2 = 6.

y=5: GCD(6,5)=1, so 5 + 1 = 6.

All give the same sum.

In the example output, y=3 is chosen.

So, in general, it seems that choosing y such that y is a multiple of a divisor of x, and y is close to x, maximizes the sum.

But perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider that y + GCD(x,y) is maximized.

I can think of it as y + d, where d = GCD(x,y).

Since d divides both x and y, and y < x, I can express y in terms of d.

Let’s say d = GCD(x,y).

Then, y is a multiple of d, so y = k * d, where k is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

Since y < x, k * d < x.

Also, since d divides x, x = m * d, where m is an integer greater than k.

So, x = m * d, y = k * d, with m > k >= 1.

Then, y + d = k * d + d = (k + 1) * d.

To maximize y + d, I need to maximize (k + 1) * d, given that k * d < m * d.

But m = x / d.

Wait, x = m * d.

So m = x / d.

And y = k * d, with k < m.

So, y + d = (k + 1) * d.

Given that k < m, and m = x / d.

I need to maximize (k + 1) * d, with k < m.

To maximize this, I can consider two factors: d and k.

Since k < m, the maximum k is m - 1.

So, y = (m - 1) * d.

Then, y + d = (m - 1) * d + d = m * d = x.

Wait, but y < x, so y + d <= x.

But in many cases, y + d can be equal to x.

Wait, in the earlier examples, for x=10, y=5 gives y + d = 5 + 5 = 10.

x=7, y=6 gives y + d = 6 + 1 = 7.

x=21, y=18 gives y + d = 18 + 3 = 21.

x=100, y=98 gives y + d = 98 + 2 = 100.

So, in these cases, y + d = x.

Is this always possible?

Let's see for x=2.

Possible y=1.

GCD(2,1)=1.

y + d = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, y + d = x.

Similarly, for x=6, y=3 gives y + d = 3 + 3 = 6.

y=4 gives y + d = 4 + 2 = 6.

y=5 gives y + d = 5 + 1 = 6.

So, in all cases, y + d = x.

Is this always true?

Let’s see for x=3.

Possible y=1 and y=2.

y=1: y + d = 1 + 1 = 2.

y=2: y + d = 2 + 1 = 3.

So, maximum is y=2, y + d = 3.

Similarly, for x=4.

y=2: y + d = 2 + 2 = 4.

y=3: y + d = 3 + 1 = 4.

y=1: y + d = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, maximum is y=2 or y=3.

Wait, y=3 also gives y + d = 4.

So, for x=4, both y=2 and y=3 give y + d = 4.

Similarly, for x=5.

y=4: y + d = 4 + 1 = 5.

y=3: y + d = 3 + 1 = 4.

y=2: y + d = 2 + 1 = 3.

y=1: y + d = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, maximum is y=4.

Again, y + d = x.

Seems like in all these cases, the maximum y + d equals x.

Is this always the case?

Let me think about x=8.

Possible y values:

y=4: GCD(8,4)=4 -> y + d = 4 + 4 = 8.

y=6: GCD(8,6)=2 -> y + d = 6 + 2 = 8.

y=7: GCD(8,7)=1 -> y + d = 7 + 1 = 8.

y=3: GCD(8,3)=1 -> y + d = 3 + 1 = 4.

So, again, the maximum y + d is 8, which equals x.

Similarly, for x=9.

y=6: GCD(9,6)=3 -> y + d = 6 + 3 = 9.

y=7: GCD(9,7)=1 -> y + d = 7 + 1 = 8.

y=8: GCD(9,8)=1 -> y + d = 8 + 1 = 9.

y=3: GCD(9,3)=3 -> y + d = 3 + 3 = 6.

So, maximum is y=6 or y=8.

Again, y + d = x.

Wait, but for x=2, y=1 gives y + d = 2.

So, seems like for any x, there exists y such that y + d = x, where d = GCD(x,y).

How?

Let’s see.

If y + d = x, and d divides both x and y, then d divides x - y.

Because d divides x and d divides y, so d divides x - y.

But x - y = d, since y + d = x.

So, x - y = d.

Therefore, d = x - y.

But d also divides y, because d divides y.

So, d divides y and d divides x - y.

This is consistent.

So, if I set y such that y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, then y + d = (x - d) + d = x.

So, y + d = x.

And since y < x, y = x - d, with d being a divisor of x.

So, for any divisor d of x, setting y = x - d will give y + d = x.

And since y < x, x - d < x, which implies d > 0.

Since d is a divisor of x, d >=1.

So, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x and d >=1.

Therefore, to maximize y + d, which is x, I can choose any y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

But the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

So, in practice, I can choose the largest possible y that satisfies y + d = x.

Wait, but y + d = x, and y = x - d.

So, for any divisor d of x, y = x - d is a possible choice.

To maximize y, I need to minimize d, because y = x - d.

The smallest d is 1.

So, y = x - 1.

But, in some cases, y = x - 1 might not be the best choice because there could be larger y with higher d.

Wait, but since y + d is always x, as long as y = x - d and d divides x, then all such y will give y + d = x.

So, any y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will give y + d = x.

Hence, any such y is acceptable.

In the example, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which corresponds to d=5.

Similarly, y=8 corresponds to d=2, and y=9 corresponds to d=1.

All give y + d =10.

So, the problem allows any of these y values.

Hence, in the implementation, I can choose any y that satisfies y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

But perhaps there is a preference for certain y over others.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func_1(x):

"""Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Args:

x: The given integer.

Returns:

The optimal y.

"""

max_val =1

for y in range(x -1,1,-1):

if x % y ==0:

if 2 * y >=x:

return y

max_val =y

return max_val

So, this function iterates y from x-1 down to 2.

It checks if x % y == 0, meaning y is a divisor of x.

If y is a divisor and 2*y >= x, it returns y immediately.

Otherwise, it sets max_val to y.

After the loop, it returns max_val.

Wait, but in the loop, it sets max_val to y for each y that x % y == 0.

So, it seems like it's keeping track of the largest y that is a divisor of x.

But with the condition that if 2*y >= x, it returns y immediately.

I need to understand why.

Let’s see for x=10.

y=9: x%9=1, not zero, so skip.

y=8: x%8=2, not zero, so skip.

y=7: x%7=3, not zero, so skip.

y=6: x%6=4, not zero, so skip.

y=5: x%5=0, so it's a divisor.

Then, 2*5=10, which is equal to x, so 2*y >=x is true, so it returns y=5.

Similarly, for x=7.

y=6: x%6=1, not zero, skip.

y=5: x%5=2, not zero, skip.

y=4: x%4=3, not zero, skip.

y=3: x%3=1, not zero, skip.

y=2: x%2=1, not zero, skip.

y=1: not reached, since range is from x-1 to 1, stepping by -1.

So, max_val remains 1.

But according to the example, for x=7, y=6 is chosen.

Wait, but y=6 is not a divisor of 7.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the code, it only considers y where x % y == 0, i.e., y is a divisor of x.

But in the example, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is not a divisor.

But according to our earlier reasoning, y=6 gives y + d =7, which is the maximum.

But according to the code, it only considers y that are divisors of x.

Hence, for x=7, no y divides 7 except y=1, but y=1 would give y + d=2.

But in the example, y=6 is chosen, which is not a divisor.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem allows any y where y < x, not necessarily a divisor.

But the code only considers y that are divisors of x.

Hence, it might miss some y that are not divisors but still give the maximum y + d.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, y + d = x, regardless of whether y is a divisor or not, as long as y = x - d and d divides x.

But in the code, it only considers y that are divisors of x, which means y divides x.

But in the example, y=6 does not divide 7, but it still gives y + d =7.

So, the code seems to be incomplete or incorrect.

Perhaps I need to adjust the code to consider all y < x, not just divisors.

Let me think again.

Given that y + d = x for some d that divides x, and y = x - d.

So, y doesn't have to divide x, but d does.

Hence, y can be any x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

So, y doesn't need to divide x.

Hence, the code is incorrect in only considering y that divide x.

I need to generate y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

So, for x=7, d can be 1 or 7.

But y must be less than x, so y = x - d < x.

For d=1, y=6.

For d=7, y=0, which is less than 1, so invalid.

Hence, y=6 is the only valid y in this case.

Similarly, for x=10, d can be 1,2,5,10.

y = x - d:

- d=1, y=9

- d=2, y=8

- d=5, y=5

- d=10, y=0 (invalid)

Hence, possible y values are 9,8,5.

All of these give y + d =10.

So, why does the code return y=5 for x=10?

Because it iterates y from x-1=9 down to 2.

It checks if x % y ==0.

For y=9, x=10 %9=1, not zero.

For y=8, x=10%8=2, not zero.

For y=5, x=10%5=0, so it's a divisor.

Then, 2*y=10 >=x=10, so it returns y=5.

But according to the earlier reasoning, y=9 is also acceptable, since y=9 gives y + d=10, where d=1.

But in the code, it only considers y that are divisors of x.

Hence, it misses y=9.

But according to the problem, y=9 is acceptable.

Hence, the code is incomplete.

It should consider all y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

So, to fix the code, I need to find all d that divide x, then set y = x - d.

Then, among these y, choose any one.

Since any y that is x - d, where d divides x, will give y + d =x.

Hence, to implement this, I can find all divisors d of x, then set y = x - d.

But since the problem allows any such y, I can choose the one with the largest y, which corresponds to the smallest d.

The smallest d is 1.

Hence, y = x -1.

So, in the code, I can simply set y = x -1.

But in the example for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which corresponds to d=5.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 corresponds to d=1.

So, perhaps there is a preference for larger d.

Wait, but y = x - d, so larger d gives smaller y.

Wait, no, larger d gives smaller y.

Wait, y = x - d.

So, smaller d gives larger y.

Hence, to maximize y, I should choose the smallest d.

Smallest d is 1.

Hence, y = x -1.

But in the example for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is not y=x-1.

Hence, perhaps there is a different preference.

Looking back at the code, it seems to prefer y where 2*y >=x.

If such a y is found, it returns it immediately.

Otherwise, it returns the largest y that is a divisor of x.

Wait, but y being a divisor of x corresponds to d being a divisor of x.

Wait, no, y being a divisor of x is not necessarily related to d.

Wait, d = GCD(x,y).

If y divides x, then GCD(x,y)=y.

Hence, y + d = y + y =2*y.

So, in this case, y + d =2*y.

But in general, y + d = y + GCD(x,y).

But in the code, it checks if 2*y >=x.

Wait, perhaps the condition 2*y >=x is to ensure that y + d >=x.

But y + d can be equal to x, as in the earlier examples.

Wait, but y + d = x only if d = x - y.

But d divides x.

Hence, d = x - y divides x.

So, x - y divides x.

Hence, y = x - d, where d divides x.

So, in the code, it's iterating y from x-1 down to 2.

For each y, it checks if x % y ==0.

If x % y ==0, it checks if 2*y >=x.

If so, it returns y.

Otherwise, it sets max_val =y.

Hence, it seems to prefer y that are divisors of x and have
