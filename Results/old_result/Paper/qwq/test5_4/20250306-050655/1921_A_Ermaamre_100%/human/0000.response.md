Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the corners of a square in random order, and I need to find the area of the square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that alignment.

Given four points, I need to determine the area of the square they form. Since it's a square, all sides should be equal, and the angles should be right angles. But because it's guaranteed to be a square, I don't need to verify these properties; I just need to compute the area.

The area of a square is simply the square of the length of its side. So, if I can find the length of one side, I can square it to get the area.

Now, how do I find the length of a side? Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the length of a side can be found by looking at the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of adjacent points.

But the points are given in random order, so I need a way to find the side length without having to figure out which points are adjacent.

Wait a minute, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points will have some specific properties. Let's think about that.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, there should be two distinct x-coordinates and two distinct y-coordinates. Each x-coordinate should pair with each y-coordinate to form the four corners of the square.

So, if I have four points, and I collect their x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately, I should see that there are exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

Then, the side lengths can be found by calculating the difference between the two unique x-values or the two unique y-values.

Wait, actually, no. Let's think about it. If I have two unique x-values, say x1 and x2, and two unique y-values, y1 and y2, then the points should be (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), and (x2, y2).

The side lengths would be the difference between x2 and x1, or between y2 and y1, depending on whether we're looking at the horizontal or vertical sides.

But since it's a square, the horizontal and vertical side lengths should be equal, right? Wait, no. Actually, in a square, the horizontal and vertical sides are equal, but in this problem, since the square can be rotated only by multiples of 90 degrees due to the sides being parallel to the axes, the horizontal and vertical side lengths should indeed be equal.

So, the difference between the two unique x-values should equal the difference between the two unique y-values.

But the problem states that the square has positive area, so the x-values and y-values are distinct.

Given that, I can proceed as follows:

- Collect all x-coordinates and find the minimum and maximum x-values.

- Collect all y-coordinates and find the minimum and maximum y-values.

- The side length of the square should be equal to either (max_x - min_x) or (max_y - min_y), and since it's a square, these two differences should be equal.

Wait, but the problem says the square has positive area, and it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square, so (max_x - min_x) should equal (max_y - min_y), and both should be greater than zero.

Therefore, I can compute the side length as (max_x - min_x), and the area as (max_x - min_x)^2.

Let me check this with the example input provided.

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

So, x-coordinates: 1, 4, 1, 4 → min_x = 1, max_x = 4 → side length = 4 - 1 = 3 → area = 9

y-coordinates: 2, 5, 5, 2 → min_y = 2, max_y = 5 → side length = 5 - 2 = 3 → area = 9

Which matches the first output: 9

Second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-coordinates: -1, 1, 1, -1 → min_x = -1, max_x = 1 → side length = 2 → area = 4

y-coordinates: 1, -1, 1, -1 → min_y = -1, max_y = 1 → side length = 2 → area = 4

Which matches the second output: 4

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-coordinates: 45, 45, 17, 17 → min_x = 17, max_x = 45 → side length = 28 → area = 784

y-coordinates: 11, 39, 11, 39 → min_y = 11, max_y = 39 → side length = 28 → area = 784

Which matches the third output: 784

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]

x = [p[0] for p in a]

dx = max(x) - min(x)

print(dx * dx)

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads four lines of input, each containing two integers (x and y coordinates). It collects all x-coordinates into a list, finds the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, and prints the square of that difference.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, the side length should be (max_x - min_x), and since it's a square, (max_y - min_y) should be equal to (max_x - min_x). But the program doesn't check this; it just assumes it's true.

Given that the problem guarantees the points form a valid square with positive area, we can assume that (max_x - min_x) equals (max_y - min_y), so it's safe to just compute (max_x - min_x)^2.

Additionally, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed to be a valid square, so we don't need to handle cases where it's not a square or sides are not parallel to the axes.

Therefore, the provided program seems correct.

Wait, but to be thorough, let's consider if there are any edge cases that might break this approach.

Edge case 1: All points have the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate.

But the problem states that the square has positive area, so all points are distinct, and since it's a square, the x-coordinates and y-coordinates should have exactly two unique values each.

Edge case 2: The square is degenerate, but the problem says it's guaranteed to have positive area, so we can ignore degenerate cases.

Edge case 3: The coordinates are negative or zero.

But the problem allows coordinates from -1000 to 1000, including zero.

Given that, and since the program correctly computes (max_x - min_x)^2, which should equal the area of the square, I think the program is correct.

Another way to think about it: in a square with sides parallel to the axes, the width and height are equal, so the area is width * height = width^2 = height^2. Since width = (max_x - min_x) and height = (max_y - min_y), and for a square, width = height, so area = width^2.

Therefore, computing (max_x - min_x)^2 is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
