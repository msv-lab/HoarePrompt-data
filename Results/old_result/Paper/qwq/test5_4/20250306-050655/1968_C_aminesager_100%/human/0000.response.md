Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that each a_i is between 1 and 10^9, and for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.

First, I need to understand what this means. Modulo operation has some properties that I should keep in mind. For any a_i and a_{i-1}, a_i mod a_{i-1} equals x_i, which means that a_i is equal to some multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i. Mathematically, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer.

My goal is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions for all i from 2 to n. Also, a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

Output:

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

So, for the first test case, n=4 and x=[2,4,1], and the corresponding a is [3,5,4,9]. Let's verify this:

a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which matches x_2=2

a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 = 4, which matches x_3=4

a_4 mod a_3 = 9 mod 4 = 1, which matches x_4=1

Great, it works.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such an array a for any given n and x.

Let me try to find a pattern or a way to build a step by step.

Starting from a_1, which can be any value between 1 and 10^9, but it might affect the values of a_2 to a_n.

Given that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, I can express a_i as a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer.

My aim is to choose a_1 and then determine a_2, a_3, ..., a_n based on this.

But I need to ensure that all a_i are within 1 to 10^9.

One approach could be to set a_1 to a certain value and then compute subsequent a_i based on the x_i and the previous a_{i-1}.

Let me consider setting a_1 to a value greater than x_2, because a_2 mod a_1 = x_2, and if a_1 > x_2, then a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2, and I can choose k such that a_2 is within 1 to 10^9.

Wait, but a_1 can be any value between 1 and 10^9, and same for a_2.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set a_1 to a value, then a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2.

To keep a_2 within 1 to 10^9, I need to choose k appropriately.

Similarly, a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3, and so on.

This seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking at the first test case, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Let's see:

a_2 = 5 = k*3 + 2 => k=1, since 1*3 + 2 = 5

a_3 = 4 = m*5 + 4 => m=0, since 0*5 + 4 = 4

a_4 = 9 = p*4 + 1 => p=2, since 2*4 + 1 = 9

This seems to work.

Another approach: maybe set a_1 to a certain value, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, let's try that.

For the first test case:

a_1=3

a_2=3 + 2=5

a_3=5 + 4=9

a_4=9 + 1=10

But then:

a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, correct.

a_3 mod a_2 = 9 mod 5 = 4, correct.

a_4 mod a_3 = 10 mod 9 = 1, correct.

Wait, but in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10. Hmm.

But still, if I set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, it seems to satisfy the condition.

Let me check with the second test case:

n=3, x=[1,1]

Set a_1=2

a_2=2 + 1=3

a_3=3 + 1=4

Check:

3 mod 2 = 1, correct.

4 mod 3 = 1, correct.

Matches the example's output of 2 5 11, but 2 3 4 also works.

So multiple solutions are possible.

Another test case:

n=6, x=[4,2,5,1,2]

Set a_1=5

a_2=5 + 4=9

a_3=9 + 2=11

a_4=11 + 5=16

a_5=16 + 1=17

a_6=17 + 2=19

Check:

9 mod 5 = 4, correct.

11 mod 9 = 2, correct.

16 mod 11 = 5, correct.

17 mod 16 = 1, correct.

19 mod 17 = 2, correct.

But the example output is 5 14 16 5 11 24. So multiple solutions exist.

This seems promising. So, a general approach could be to set a_1 to any value between 1 and 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, because (a_{i-1} + x_i) mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

This seems to always hold, as long as a_{i-1} + x_i does not exceed 10^9.

But in the constraints, n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500.

If a_1 is 1, then a_2 = 1 + x_2, a_3 = 1 + x_2 + x_3, and so on, up to a_n = 1 + x_2 + ... + x_n.

If x_i are up to 500, and n is up to 500, then the maximum a_n could be 1 + 500*(n-1), which for n=500 is 1 + 500*499 = 1 + 249500 = 249501, which is less than 10^9.

So, this approach should work, as all a_i would be within 1 to 10^9.

But in the first test case, they chose a_1=3, and then a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9, which is different from a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=7, a_4=8 if we follow a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

So, their solution is different, but both are valid.

Hence, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to be a valid approach, and it's simple to implement.

Let me see if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Suppose n=2, x=[500]

Set a_1=1, a_2=1 + 500=501.

Check: 501 mod 1 = 0, but x_2=500, which is not equal to 0.

Wait, this is a problem.

So, my approach fails here.

Wait, why?

Because 501 mod 1 = 0, but x_2=500.

So, a_2 mod a_1 should be x_2, which is 500.

But 501 mod 1 = 0, which is not equal to 500.

Hence, my approach doesn't work in this case.

So, what's the issue?

The issue is that when a_{i-1}=1, a_i mod 1 is always 0, which cannot be equal to x_i unless x_i=0.

But in the problem, x_i can be from 1 to 500, so x_i could be 500, which is not 0.

Hence, if a_{i-1}=1, and x_i=500, it's impossible to have a_i mod 1 = 500, because a_i mod 1 is always 0.

Therefore, setting a_1=1 is problematic if x_2 != 0.

So, I need to choose a_1 appropriately.

In this case, if a_1=501, then a_2=501 + 500=1001, and 1001 mod 501=1001 - 501*1=500, which matches x_2=500.

So, in this case, setting a_1 to be greater than x_2 works.

Similarly, in the first test case, a_1=3, a_2=5, 5 mod 3=2, which matches x_2=2.

So, perhaps setting a_1 to be greater than x_2 is a safe choice.

Wait, but in the second test case, a_1=2, a_2=3, 3 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1.

Similarly, a_3=4, 4 mod 3=1, which matches x_3=1.

So, setting a_1 > x_2 seems to work.

But in the edge case where x_2 >= a_1, it fails, as in the n=2, x=[500] case with a_1=1.

Hence, to make it work, I need to ensure that a_1 > x_2.

But a_1 can be at most 10^9.

Given that x_i <= 500, setting a_1 = x_2 + 1 would suffice, as long as x_2 < 10^9.

But x_2 can be up to 500, so a_1 can be up to 501, which is fine.

Wait, but in the edge case where x_2=500, a_1=501, a_2=501 + 500=1001, which is still less than 10^9.

And 1001 mod 501=500, which is correct.

So, setting a_1 = x_2 + 1 seems to work.

But in the first test case, they set a_1=3 for x_2=2, which is x_2 + 1=3, which works.

In the second test case, x_2=1, a_1=2=x_2 + 1=2, which works.

In the third test case, x_2=4, a_1=5= x_2 + 1=5, which works.

So, setting a_1 = x_2 + 1 seems to be a safe choice.

Let me try this in the edge case:

n=2, x=[500], set a_1=501, a_2=501 + 500=1001, 1001 mod 501=500, which matches x_2=500.

Seems good.

Another edge case: n=2, x=[1], set a_1=2, a_2=3, 3 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1.

Good.

Another edge case: n=2, x=[0], but x_i >=1 as per the problem, so x_i=1.

Wait, the problem says 1 <= x_i <=500, so x_i cannot be 0.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "1 <= x_i <=500", so x_i is at least 1.

Hence, setting a_1 = x_2 +1 is always greater than x_2, and a_1 >=2.

Then, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, which ensures a_i > x_i, so a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

This seems to work.

Let me see if there's any n where this fails.

Suppose n=3, x=[1,1], set a_1=2, a_2=3, a_3=4, as before.

3 mod 2=1, 4 mod 3=1, correct.

Another case: n=3, x=[2,3], set a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=8.

5 mod 3=2, 8 mod 5=3, correct.

Seems consistent.

Hence, I can conclude that setting a_1 = x_2 +1, and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n is a valid approach to generate the array a that satisfies the given conditions.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t = t - 1

n = int(input())

line = input('')

T = list(map(int, line.split()))

a = [1000]

for i in range(1, n):

a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])

result = ' '.join(map(str, a))

print(result)

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and the array x_2 to x_n.

It initializes a with [1000], which seems arbitrary. Shouldn't it be set based on x_2?

Wait, according to my earlier reasoning, a_1 should be set to x_2 +1.

But in the program, a_1 is set to 1000, regardless of x_2.

Is this always correct?

Well, if x_2 <= 999, then a_1=1000 > x_2, which is fine.

But if x_2 >=1000, then a_1=1000 < x_2, which would cause a_2 =1000 + x_2, and a_2 mod 1000 =x_2, but if a_1 < x_2, then a_2 mod a_1 = x_2, which only holds if a_2 = k*a_1 + x_2, with k>=1.

But in this case, a_2 = a_1 + x_2, which would mean a_2 mod a_1 = x_2, provided that x_2 < a_1.

But if x_2 >= a_1, then a_2 mod a_1 = x_2 - a_1 * floor(x_2 / a_1), which may not equal x_2.

Hence, setting a_1=1000 may not work if x_2 >=1000.

But according to the problem constraints, x_i <=500, so x_2 <=500.

Hence, a_1=1000 > x_2 always holds, since x_2 <=500.

Therefore, a_1=1000 is always greater than x_2, which is fine.

Hence, in this specific case, since x_2 <=500 and a_1=1000 > x_2, it works.

But it's not the most general approach, as if x_2 could be up to 10^9, this would fail when x_2 >=1000.

But given x_i <=500, it's safe.

However, to make it more robust, it's better to set a_1 = x_2 +1, to generalize the solution.

But in this specific problem, since x_i <=500, setting a_1=1000 is safe.

Now, in the loop, it appends a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 1 to n-1.

So, a = [1000, 1000 + x_2, 1000 + x_2 + x_3, ..., 1000 + x_2 + ... + x_n].

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, x=[2,4,1], so a should be [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007].

But in the example output, it's [3,5,4,9], which is different.

But both are valid solutions, as multiple solutions exist.

Hence, the program's approach is valid as long as it produces one possible a that satisfies the conditions.

Given that, and considering the constraints, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's check if a_i stay within 1 to 10^9.

Given a_1=1000, and x_i <=500, and n<=500, the maximum a_n =1000 + 500*(n-1).

For n=500, a_n=1000 + 500*499=1000 + 249500=250500, which is less than 10^9.

Hence, all a_i are within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
