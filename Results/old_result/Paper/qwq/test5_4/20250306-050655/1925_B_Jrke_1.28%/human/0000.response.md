Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Jay created a problem of difficulty x and wants to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash is worried that this might make the contest unbalanced, so he decides to break this problem into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of these difficulties should be equal to x.

Now, the coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of all the sub-problems. Yash wants to choose the difficulties of these sub-problems in such a way that this balance is maximized.

Okay, so I need to find the maximum possible GCD for a set of n positive integers that sum up to x.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if all the sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of some number d, then d is a possible GCD. And we need to find the largest such d.

So, the problem reduces to finding the largest d such that:

1. d divides x (since the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties is x).

2. We can split x into n parts, each being a multiple of d, and each part being at least d (since difficulties are positive integers).

Wait, if each difficulty is a multiple of d, and there are n such difficulties summing up to x, then x must be divisible by d. Also, since each difficulty is at least d, the sum of n difficulties is at least n*d. Therefore, x must be at least n*d.

So, for d to be a possible GCD, two conditions must hold:

- d divides x.

- n*d <= x.

Therefore, the maximum possible d is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to floor(x/n).

Wait, but in the code provided, it's calculating k = x // n, which is floor(x/n). Then, it's trying to find the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k.

Let me look at the code step by step.

The function func() is defined, which reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, reads x and n.

It calculates k = x // n.

If k == 1, it prints 1 and continues to the next test case.

Otherwise, it initializes ans = 1.

Then, it loops through i from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x ** 0.5) + 1 in steps of 2.

Wait, this seems a bit off. Let's see.

First, it's checking if k == 1. If so, it prints 1. That makes sense because if k = floor(x/n) = 1, then the maximum possible d is 1, since d <= k and d divides x.

Then, for k > 1, it tries to find a larger d.

In the loop, it starts from 1 plus something based on whether x is even, and increments by 2 each time up to the square root of x.

This seems like an attempt to find divisors of x efficiently.

Wait, but why start from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)? That means if x is even, start from 2, else start from 1, and increment by 2 each time.

This seems inefficient because it's skipping even numbers if x is odd, but x could have even divisors even if it's odd (except 2).

Wait, no, if x is odd, it can't have even divisors except 1, but 1 is already considered.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If x is odd, its divisors are all odd, so starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 is fine. If x is even, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2 would cover all even divisors, but it might miss d=1, but since d=1 is already the minimum, it's okay.

But actually, in the code, it's initializing ans = 1, so it's already considering d=1.

Now, in the loop, for each i in the specified range, if x % i == 0, it means i is a divisor of x.

Then, it considers l = [ans], and if i <= k, appends i to l, and if x//i <= k, appends x//i to l.

Then, sets ans to the maximum of l.

This seems like an attempt to find the largest divisor of x that is <= k.

Wait, but x//i is also a divisor of x, and it's greater than or equal to i, since i <= sqrt(x).

So, by considering both i and x//i, it's covering all possible divisors.

And then, it takes the maximum of these that are <= k.

So, overall, it's trying to find the largest divisor of x that is <= k = floor(x/n).

That makes sense.

But is this the most efficient way?

Well, for t up to 10^3 and x up to 10^8, and n up to x, this should be efficient enough, since for each test case, it's looping up to sqrt(x), which is up to 10^4, so total time should be acceptable.

Now, let's verify with the example given.

First test case: x=10, n=3.

k = 10 // 3 = 3.

Possible d <= 3 that divides 10: 1 and 5. But 5 > 3, so only 1.

But in the explanation, it says that d=2 is possible with difficulties 4,2,4.

Wait, but 2 divides 10, and 3*2 = 6 <= 10.

So, d=2 should be acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that x - d*(n-1) >= d, because each of the n-1 problems can have difficulty d, and the last one gets the remaining difficulty.

So, x - d*(n-1) >= d, which simplifies to x - d*n + d >= d, which is x - d*n >= 0, which is d <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

So, in the first example, x=10, n=3, floor(10/3)=3.

Possible d <= 3 that divides 10: 1 and 2.

Wait, 5 is a divisor of 10, but 5 > 3, so it's invalid.

So, d=2 is valid, as 2 divides 10 and 3*2 =6 <=10.

Similarly, d=1 is also valid.

So, the maximum d is 2, which matches the example.

In the second example, x=5, n=5.

k = 5//5 =1.

So, only d=1 is possible.

In the third example, x=420, n=69.

k = 420//69 = 6.

So, d <=6 and d divides 420.

Divisors of 420 up to 6: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, d=6 is the maximum.

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be correct.

Wait, but in the code, it has:

for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

This seems a bit peculiar.

If x is even, it starts from 2, else from 1, and increments by 2 each time.

This will miss d=2 when x is odd.

But when x is odd, 2 is not a divisor anyway, except when x is even.

Wait, 2 can't divide an odd number, so it's fine.

But, for example, if x=10 (even), it starts from 2, and goes up by 2: 2,4,6,8,...

But sqrt(10) is about 3.16, so int(x**0.5)+1 is 4.

So, it loops through i=2,4.

For i=2, x%2==0, so l=[ans=1], i=2 <=k=3, x//i=5 <=k=3? 5>3, so only append 2.

So, ans=max(1,2)=2.

Then i=4, x%4==0, l=[2], i=4 <=k=3? No, x//4=2 <=3? Yes, so append 2.

So, ans=max(2,2)=2.

Then, prints 2.

Which is correct.

Another test case: x=5, n=5.

k=1.

Prints 1.

Third test case: x=420, n=69.

k=420//69=6.

Find divisors of 420 up to 6.

Divisors up to 6:1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, ans=6.

Which is correct.

Seems like the code works.

But is there a better way?

Well, perhaps, but this seems efficient enough.

So, I would say the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
