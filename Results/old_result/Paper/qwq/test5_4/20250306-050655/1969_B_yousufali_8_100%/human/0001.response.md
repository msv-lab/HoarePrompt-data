Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. Like, '000111' is sorted, but '101010' is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring. That means picking a part of the string, say from position l to r, and shifting it cyclically. For example, if I have '1010', and I pick the substring from position 2 to 3, which is '01', shifting it cyclically would make it '10', so the whole string becomes '1100'. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I chose, which in this case is 2.

I can do this operation any number of times, and I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. It means that all '0's are on the left, and all '1's are on the right. So, in the example '10', I need to turn it into '01'. The operation allowed is to choose a substring and perform a cyclic shift, paying a cost equal to the length of that substring.

In the first test case, '10', I can choose the entire string and perform one cyclic shift to get '01', with a cost of 2. That matches the sample output.

In the second test case, '0000', it's already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

The third test case, '11000', seems a bit more complicated. According to the sample output, the total cost is 9, which corresponds to three operations, each costing 3.

I need to find a general way to calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to identify positions where the string is not sorted. That is, positions where a '1' appears after a '0'. Because in a sorted string, all '0's come before '1's.

So, I need to count the number of '1's that are after some '0's and figure out how to shift them to the end with minimal cost.

Wait, but the operation allows me to perform cyclic shifts on any substring, not just adjacent elements. That gives me more flexibility.

Maybe I can model this as inversion counts or something similar.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have a string like '101011'.

I need to move the '0's to the left and '1's to the right.

One way to think about it is to count how many '1's are there before each '0', because each of those '1's would need to be shifted past that '0' at some point.

Wait, but the operation is on substrings, not individual characters.

Let me see.

If I have a '0' that comes after a '1', I need to find a way to move that '0' to the left past the '1'.

One way to do that is to select a substring that includes the '1' and the '0', and perform a cyclic shift to move the '0' to the left.

For example, in '10', selecting the whole string and shifting once moves the '0' to the front.

In '11000', I can select the first three characters '110' and shift to get '01100', then select the next three '110' again to get '00110', and finally '00011'.

Each operation costs 3, totaling 9, which matches the sample.

So, it seems like selecting substrings that cover a '0' and the '1's before it, and shifting to move the '0' to the left, is a possible strategy.

But I need to find the minimum total cost.

Is there a better way?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to move all '0's to the front.

Each '0' that is after some '1's needs to be moved past those '1's.

Each such move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the '0' and the '1's before it, and performing a cyclic shift.

The cost is the length of the substring.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps, instead of moving one '0' at a time, I can move multiple '0's in one operation by selecting a larger substring.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have a string s of length n.

I need to transform s into a string where all '0's are before '1's.

I can perform operations where each operation is selecting a substring s[l..r] and performing a cyclic shift, with cost r - l + 1.

I need to find the sequence of operations with the minimal total cost.

This seems similar to sorting algorithms, but with a different cost model.

In standard sorting, the cost is usually in terms of comparisons or swaps, but here the cost is based on the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find an efficient way to calculate the minimal cost.

Let me consider the positions of '1's and '0's.

Suppose I have a prefix of the string with some '1's, and then '0's start appearing.

Each '0' that appears after some '1's needs to be moved past those '1's.

Each such move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the '0' and the '1's before it and performing a cyclic shift.

But this seems inefficient.

Is there a better way to group movements?

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of inversion counts.

In sorting, an inversion is when a larger element appears before a smaller element.

Here, an inversion would be a '1' appearing before a '0'.

Each such inversion needs to be corrected.

If I can find the number of inversions, perhaps I can relate it to the minimal cost.

But I'm not sure how to map inversions to the cost of operations.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string from left to right.

I can keep track of the number of '1's I've seen so far.

Whenever I encounter a '0', I need to move it past all the '1's I've seen so far.

Each such move would cost the number of '1's plus one (the '0' itself).

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try with the first test case: '10'.

I have one '1', then a '0'.

So, the number of '1's before the '0' is 1.

To move this '0' past the '1', I can select the substring '10' and perform one cyclic shift, costing 2, which is 1 ('1') + 1 ('0').

This matches the first sample.

Another sample: '11000'.

Number of '1's before the first '0': 2.

So, to move the first '0' past two '1's, it would cost 2 + 1 = 3.

Similarly, the next '0' has two '1's before it, so another 3.

The last '0' has two '1's before it, so another 3.

Total cost: 9.

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but is this always minimal?

Let me check another sample: '101011'.

Number of '1's before the first '0':1 (only the first '1').

So, cost: 1 + 1 = 2.

Next '0' has two '1's before it: cost 2 + 1 = 3.

Total cost: 5.

Which matches the sample.

Last sample: '01101001'.

Let's see:

Iterate through the string:

Position 1: '0' - no '1's before it - cost 0.

Position 2: '1' - one '0' before it, but we don't need to move '1's.

Position 3: '1' - two '0's before it, but again, we don't move '1's.

Position 4: '0' - two '1's before it - cost 2 + 1 = 3.

Position 5: '1' - three '0's and two '1's before it - but we don't move '1's.

Position 6: '0' - three '1's before it - cost 3 + 1 = 4.

Position 7: '0' - three '1's before it - cost 3 + 1 = 4.

Position 8: '1' - five '0's and three '1's before it - don't move '1's.

So, total cost: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.

Which matches the sample.

So, it seems that for each '0' that appears after some '1's, the cost to move it past the '1's is equal to the number of '1's before it plus one (the '0' itself).

And the total minimal cost is the sum of these individual costs.

This seems to be a consistent approach that matches all the sample inputs.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

- Initialize a counter for the number of '1's seen so far.

- Initialize a variable to keep track of the total cost.

- Iterate through the string from left to right.

- For each character:

- If it's '1', increment the '1's counter.

- If it's '0', add the current '1's counter plus one to the total cost.

- After iterating through the string, the total cost is the minimum cost required.

This seems efficient, as it only requires a single pass through the string.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

if __name__ == '__main__':

    func_2()

def func_1():

    s = input()

    n = 0

    ans = 0

    for i in range(len(s)):

        if s[i] == '1':

            n += 1

        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:

            ans += n + 1

    print(ans)

def func_2():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        func_1()

```

This seems to implement exactly what I just described.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the string, iterates through it, counts the number of '1's, and whenever it encounters a '0', it adds the number of '1's plus one to the total cost.

This matches my reasoning.

Therefore, I believe this program is correct.
