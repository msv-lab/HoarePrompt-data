Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only consists of 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I can do this operation as many times as I want, and I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. In this case, all 0s should be before all 1s. So, in the example "10", which is not sorted, I can perform a cyclic shift on the entire string to get "01", which is sorted, and the cost is 2, which matches the first test case.

Another example is "0000", which is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

In the third example, "11000", the target is "00011". To achieve this, the solution provided does three operations, each costing 3, for a total of 9.

I need to find a general way to calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to read multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

In `func_1()`, it reads the input string `s`, initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0. Then, it iterates through each character in the string. If the character is '1', it increments `n`. If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

Wait, let's see if this makes sense.

Take the first test case: "10"

- Initialize n=0, ans=0

- First character '1': n=1

- Second character '0': since n=1, ans += 1 + 1 = 2

- Total cost is 2, which matches the expected output.

Second test case: "0000"

- n=0

- Iterate through each '0':

- Since n=0, no addition to ans

- Total cost is 0, correct.

Third test case: "11000"

- n=0

- First '1': n=1

- Second '1': n=2

- Third '0': n=2 != 0, ans += 2 + 1 = 3

- Fourth '0': n=2 != 0, ans += 2 + 1 = 3 (total ans=6)

- Fifth '0': n=2 != 0, ans += 2 + 1 = 3 (total ans=9)

- Matches the expected output of 9.

Another test case: "101011"

- n=0, ans=0

- '1': n=1

- '0': n=1 !=0, ans +=1+1=2

- '1': n=2

- '0': n=2 !=0, ans +=2+1=3 (total ans=5)

- '1': n=3

- '1': n=4

- Total ans=5, which matches the expected output.

One more: "01101001"

- n=0

- '0': n=0

- '1': n=1

- '1': n=2

- '0': n=2 !=0, ans +=2+1=3

- '1': n=3

- '0': n=3 !=0, ans +=3+1=4 (total ans=7)

- '0': n=3 !=0, ans +=3+1=4 (total ans=11)

- '1': n=4

- Total ans=11, matches expected output.

So, it seems like this approach is working for the given test cases. But I need to understand why this works.

Let's try to understand the logic behind `func_1()`.

It seems to count the number of '1's encountered before any '0's. For each '0' after the first '1', it adds the number of '1's seen so far plus one to the total cost.

Wait, why is that?

Maybe thinking in terms of inversions or the number of swaps needed to sort the string.

In a sorted string, all '0's are before '1's. So, any '1' before a '0' is out of place.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front, costing the length of the substring.

I need to find the minimum cost to rearrange the string so that all '0's are before '1's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about moving all '1's after all '0's, and the cost is related to the positions of '1's and '0's.

Wait, perhaps it's about counting the number of '1's that are before '0's and considering the cost to move them.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a '0' at position i and a '1' at position j where i > j. To fix this, I need to move the '0' before the '1'.

One way to do this is to perform a cyclic shift on the substring from j to i.

For example, in "10", I can shift the entire string to get "01", costing 2.

In "11000", I can shift "110" to "011", then "01100" to "00110", and finally "00110" to "00011", each shift costing 3, total 9.

So, it seems like for each '0' that is before some '1's, I need to shift it past those '1's, and the cost is related to the number of '1's it needs to pass.

Wait, in the code, for each '0' after the first '1', it adds n + 1 to the total cost, where n is the number of '1's seen so far.

In the first test case, "10":

- n=1 (one '1' before the '0'), ans +=1+1=2

In "11000":

- n=2 for the first '0', ans +=2+1=3

- n=2 for the second '0', ans +=3+1=4 (total 6)

- n=2 for the third '0', ans +=3+1=4 (total 9)

Wait, but in the explanation, it did three shifts of length 3, totaling 9.

So, perhaps the cost is correctly calculated.

Wait, but in "101011":

- n=1 for the first '0': ans +=1+1=2

- n=2 for the second '0': ans +=2+1=3 (total 5)

- No more '0's

- Matches the expected output of 5.

And in "01101001":

- n=0 for the first '0': no addition

- n=1 for the first '0': no addition (since n=0)

- Then '1's: n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4

- Second '0': n=3, ans +=3+1=4

- Third '0': n=3, ans +=3+1=4 (total 8)

- But the expected output is 11.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, it seemed to be 11, but according to this, it's 8.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the initial description, for "01101001", it's t=5, test case 5, output is 11.

But according to the code:

- n=0

- '0': n=0

- '1': n=1

- '1': n=2

- '0': n=2 !=0, ans +=2+1=3

- '1': n=3

- '0': n=3 !=0, ans +=3+1=4 (total 7)

- '0': n=3 !=0, ans +=3+1=4 (total 11)

- '1': n=4

- Total ans=11, matches expected output.

Okay, so the code seems correct for this test case as well.

But I need to understand why this formula works.

Let's think about what each cyclic shift can achieve.

A cyclic shift on a substring moves the last character of that substring to the front.

So, if I have "110", shifting it once gives "011".

Cost is 3.

Similarly, for "11000", shifting "110" gives "01100", then shifting "0110" gives "00110", and shifting "0011" gives "00011".

Total cost is 3+4+4=11, but in the explanation, it's 3 shifts of length 3, totaling 9.

Wait, maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the sorted string, and the goal is to find the minimum possible total cost.

In the third test case, the explanation shows three shifts of length 3, costing 9, but according to my earlier calculation, if I shift different substrings, I get a total of 11.

So, perhaps 9 is the minimum possible cost.

But according to the code, it's outputting 9 for that test case, but in my simulation, I got 11.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back at the third test case:

- Initial: "11000"

- Shift "110" to "01100", cost=3

- Shift "0110" to "00110", cost=4, total=7

- Shift "0011" to "00011", cost=4, total=11

But the explanation says three shifts of length 3, costing 9.

Wait, perhaps shifting different substrings leads to different total costs.

So, the strategy in the explanation is:

- Shift "110" to "01100", cost=3

- Shift "110" to "01100", but wait, that's the same as the first shift.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let's think differently.

Perhaps, for each '0' that is not in its correct position (i.e., any '0' that is after some '1's), I need to calculate the cost to move it past all the '1's before it.

In the code, for each '0' after the first '1', it adds n + 1 to the total cost, where n is the number of '1's before it.

Wait, why n + 1?

Shouldn't it be just n, the number of '1's it needs to pass?

Wait, maybe the +1 accounts for the '0' itself in the substring.

Wait, perhaps it's considering shifting a substring that includes the '0' and all '1's before it.

For example, in "110", n=2, '0' is encountered, so ans +=2+1=3.

Similarly, in "11000", first '0' : n=2, ans +=3; second '0': n=2, ans +=3; third '0': n=2, ans +=3; total 9, which matches the explanation.

So, for each '0' that is not in its correct position, it costs (number of '1's before it) +1.

Why is that?

Maybe because to move a '0' past all the '1's before it, I need to select a substring that includes all those '1's and the '0', and perform a cyclic shift.

The length of that substring would be n (number of '1's) +1 ('0'), so the cost is n+1.

By performing this shift, the '0' moves to the front of the substring, effectively passing all the '1's.

So, for each '0' that is not in its correct position, I need to pay n+1 to move it past all the '1's before it.

Is this the minimum cost?

Wait, in the third test case, "11000", there are three '0's that are not in their correct positions.

According to this, total cost is 3*(2+1)=9, which matches the explanation.

In "101011", there are two '0's that are not in their correct positions.

First '0' has n=1, so ans +=1+1=2; second '0' has n=2, so ans +=2+1=3; total 5, which matches the expected output.

In "01101001", there are four '0's that are not in their correct positions.

First '0' has n=0, so no addition; second '0' has n=3, ans +=3+1=4; third '0' has n=3, ans +=3+1=4; fourth '0' has n=3, ans +=3+1=4; total 12, but the expected output is 11.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, it was 11, but according to this, it's 12.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting n.

Wait, in "01101001":

- Initialize n=0

- '0': n=0

- '1': n=1

- '1': n=2

- '0': n=2, ans +=2+1=3

- '1': n=3

- '0': n=3, ans +=3+1=4 (total 7)

- '0': n=3, ans +=3+1=4 (total 11)

- '1': n=4

- Total ans=11, which matches the expected output.

So, perhaps my earlier mistake was counting n incorrectly.

Therefore, the formula seems to be working correctly.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{9}
