Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign appears every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign appears, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But the tribe waits for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one. So, if the first sign occurs in year x, they start waiting for the second sign from year x+1 onwards.

My goal is to find out in which year the nth sign will occur, given that all signs must occur sequentially.

Let me think about this step by step. Suppose I have the first sign that occurs every a_1 years. The possible years for the first sign are a_1, 2*a_1, 3*a_1, etc. Let's say the first sign occurs in year a_1. Then, for the second sign, which occurs every a_2 years, I need to find the smallest year greater than a_1 where the second sign occurs, and so on, up to the nth sign.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that once a sign occurs, the next sign starts waiting immediately after that year. So, for each sign, I need to find the smallest year that is greater than the year the previous sign occurred and is a multiple of its own a_i.

This sounds like for each sign, I need to calculate the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the year the previous sign occurred.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- year_1: the year the first sign occurs, which is a_1.

- year_2: the smallest year greater than year_1 that is a multiple of a_2.

- year_3: the smallest year greater than year_2 that is a multiple of a_3.

- ...

- year_n: the smallest year greater than year_{n-1} that is a multiple of a_n.

So, I need to find year_n.

To find the smallest year greater than some year_x that is a multiple of a_i, I can use the formula:

year = ((year_x // a_i) + 1) * a_i

This formula finds the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than year_x.

Let me test this formula with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 6

a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]

Start with year_1 = 3 (since the first sign occurs at year 3).

Now, find year_2: smallest year > 3 that is a multiple of 2.

Using the formula: ((3 // 2) + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4.

So, year_2 = 4.

Next, year_3: smallest year > 4 that is a multiple of 4.

((4 // 4) + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 8.

year_3 = 8.

Year_4: smallest year > 8 that is a multiple of 5.

((8 // 5) + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10.

year_4 = 10.

Year_5: smallest year > 10 that is a multiple of 9.

((10 // 9) + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18.

year_5 = 18.

Year_6: smallest year > 18 that is a multiple of 18.

((18 // 18) + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 36.

year_6 = 36.

So, according to this, the nth sign occurs in year 36, which matches the first output in the example.

Let’s check another example.

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Start with year_1 = 1.

Year_2: smallest year > 1 that is a multiple of 2.

((1 // 2) + 1) * 2 = (0 + 1) * 2 = 2.

year_2 = 2.

Year_3: smallest year > 2 that is a multiple of 3.

((2 // 3) + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3.

year_3 = 3.

Year_4: smallest year > 3 that is a multiple of 4.

((3 // 4) + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4.

year_4 = 4.

Year_5: smallest year > 4 that is a multiple of 5.

((4 // 5) + 1) * 5 = (0 + 1) * 5 = 5.

year_5 = 5.

So, the nth sign occurs in year 5, which matches the second output in the example.

Another test case:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

year_1 = 1.

year_2: smallest year > 1 that is a multiple of 1: ((1 // 1) + 1) * 1 = (1 + 1) * 1 = 2.

year_3: smallest year > 2 that is a multiple of 1: ((2 // 1) + 1) * 1 = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3.

year_4: smallest year > 3 that is a multiple of 1: ((3 // 1) + 1) * 1 = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4.

year_5: smallest year > 4 that is a multiple of 1: ((4 // 1) + 1) * 1 = (4 + 1) * 1 = 5.

So, year_5 = 5, which matches the third output in the example.

Last test case:

n = 6

a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]

year_1 = 50.

year_2: smallest year > 50 that is a multiple of 30.

((50 // 30) + 1) * 30 = (1 + 1) * 30 = 60.

year_2 = 60.

year_3: smallest year > 60 that is a multiple of 711.

((60 // 711) + 1) * 711 = (0 + 1) * 711 = 711.

year_3 = 711.

year_4: smallest year > 711 that is a multiple of 200.

((711 // 200) + 1) * 200 = (3 + 1) * 200 = 800.

year_4 = 800.

year_5: smallest year > 800 that is a multiple of 503.

((800 // 503) + 1) * 503 = (1 + 1) * 503 = 1006.

year_5 = 1006.

year_6: smallest year > 1006 that is a multiple of 1006.

((1006 // 1006) + 1) * 1006 = (1 + 1) * 1006 = 2012.

year_6 = 2012.

Which matches the fourth output in the example.

So, this approach seems correct based on the examples.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of a_i's.

It initializes start_year to 0.

Then, for each a_i in the list, it updates start_year to be the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than start_year.

This is done using the formula: start_year = (start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i

Finally, it prints the start_year after processing all a_i's.

Comparing this to my earlier reasoning, it seems correct.

However, I need to make sure that starting from start_year = 0 is appropriate.

In the first test case, a_1 = 3, so the first sign occurs at year 3, which is correct.

But if a_1 = 1, starting from 0 would make the first sign occur at year 1, which seems correct.

Wait, in the third test case, a = [1,1,1,1,1], starting from 0, then:

start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (0 + 1) * 1 = 1

Then, for the second sign: (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (1 + 1) * 1 = 2

Third sign: (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3

Fourth sign: (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4

Fifth sign: (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (4 + 1) * 1 = 5

Which matches the example.

Another test case:

n = 1

a = [10]

start_year = (0 // 10 + 1) * 10 = (0 + 1) * 10 = 10

So, the nth sign occurs in year 10, which seems correct.

Wait, but what if n=1 and a=[1]? start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (0 + 1) * 1 = 1

Which is correct, as the first sign occurs in year 1.

Another case: n=2, a=[2,3]

start_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2

Then, start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

So, the second sign occurs in year 3.

Is this correct?

According to the logic, after the first sign at year 2, we wait for the second sign in years greater than 2 that are multiples of 3, which is year 3. Yes, correct.

Another case: n=3, a=[2,4,6]

start_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2

Then, (2 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4

Then, (4 // 6 + 1) * 6 = (0 + 1) * 6 = 6

So, the third sign occurs in year 6.

Is this correct?

First sign at year 2, then wait for second sign in years >2 that are multiples of 4, which is year 4. Then wait for third sign in years >4 that are multiples of 6, which is year 6. Yes, correct.

Seems like the program is correctly implementing the logic I derived.

Edge cases:

- n=1, a=[1]: start_year = 1, which is correct.

- n=1, a=[1000000]: start_year = 1000000, which is correct.

- n=100, all a_i=1: start_year = 100, which seems correct, as each sign occurs every year, so the nth sign occurs in year n.

- n=100, a_i=10^6: start_year = 100 * 10^6 = 10^8, but since a_i can be up to 10^6 and n up to 100, start_year can be up to 10^8, which should be fine in terms of integer limits in Python.

Time constraints:

- t <= 1000, n <= 100, so total operations are acceptable.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
