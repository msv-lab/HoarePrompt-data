Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. I can perform an operation any number of times where I choose k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I perform this operation, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

But it's not that simple because I have to choose k cards with the same number each time. So, if I have multiple groups of the same numbers, I can perform operations on each group separately.

Let me think about the first example given:

Input:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

And the corresponding output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

Let's look at the first test case:

n = 5, k = 3

nums = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]

So, I have five cards: four 4's and one 1.

I can perform the operation if I have three cards with the same number. Here, I have four 4's, so I can perform the operation on three of them, replacing them with two cards of any number.

Let's say I choose to replace three 4's with two 4's. Now, I have:

Two original 4's + two new 4's + one 1, so total of five cards.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. In the explanation, they show a different sequence.

Wait, no, in the operation, I choose k cards with the same number and replace them with k-1 cards of any number.

So, starting with [4,1,1,4,4], I can choose three 4's and replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's.

So, now I have [4,4,1,1]. That's four cards.

Then, I can choose two 4's and replace them with one card, say a 4.

Now, I have [4,1,1]. That's three cards.

Then, I can choose two 1's and replace them with one card, say a 1.

Now, I have [4,1]. That's two cards.

And I can't perform any more operations because I don't have k=3 cards with the same number.

So, the minimum is two cards.

Another sequence might lead to fewer cards, but in this case, it's two.

Looking at the output, it's 2, which matches.

Second test case:

n=1, k=10

nums=[7]

Here, n < k, so I can't perform any operations. So, the minimum number of cards is 1.

Third test case:

n=7, k=2

nums=[4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

Here, k=2, so I can perform operations on any pair of cards with the same number.

Looking at the numbers: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3

We have two 2's and the rest are unique.

So, I can perform the operation on the two 2's, replacing them with one card of any number, say a 2.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,2,3], which is six cards.

I don't have any pairs left, so I can't perform any more operations.

Wait, but the output is 1, which suggests that there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card, say a 4.

Then, I have [4,1,100,5,4,3], which has two 4's.

Now, I can perform the operation on the two 4's, replacing them with one card, say a 4.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,3], which are five cards.

Still not matching the output of 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card, say a 1.

Then, I have [4,1,100,5,1,3], which has two 1's.

Now, I can perform the operation on the two 1's, replacing them with one card, say a 1.

Now, I have [4,100,5,1,3], which are five cards.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card, say a new number not present before.

But I don't see how to get down to one card.

Wait, maybe it's not possible to get below five cards in this case.

But the output says 1, which suggests that it's possible to reduce to one card.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Wait, let's look back at the input.

Wait, the input is:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

So, the second test case is:

n=1, k=10

nums=[7]

Which outputs 1, which makes sense.

The third test case is:

n=7, k=2

nums=[4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

Which outputs 1.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, with k=2, I can perform operations on any pair of cards with the same number.

In this case, I only have two 2's.

So, I can perform the operation on the two 2's, replacing them with one card of any number.

Say, I replace them with a 2.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,2,3].

Now, I don't have any pairs left, so I can't perform any more operations.

That leaves me with six cards, but the output is 1, which suggests that there's a way to reduce to one card.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card of a different number.

Say, replace them with one 4.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,4,3], which has two 4's.

Now, I can perform the operation on the two 4's, replacing them with one 4.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,3], which are five cards.

Still not one.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card, say a 1.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,1,3], which has two 1's.

Then, perform the operation on the two 1's, replacing them with one 1.

Now, I have [4,100,5,1,3], which are five cards.

Still not one.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card, say a 100.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,100,3], which has two 100's.

Then, perform the operation on the two 100's, replacing them with one 100.

Now, I have [4,100,5,3], which are four cards.

Still not one.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operation allows choosing k cards with the same number and replacing them with k-1 cards of any numbers, but I can choose what numbers to assign to those k-1 cards.

So, maybe I can use this to my advantage.

Wait, in the third test case, n=7, k=2.

Wait, perhaps I can chain operations in a certain way to reduce to one card.

But I'm not seeing it right now.

Let's look at the fourth test case:

n=10, k=4

nums=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

So, ten 1's.

I can perform operations on any four 1's, replacing them with three 1's.

So, starting with ten 1's.

Perform operation: choose four 1's, replace with three 1's. Now, I have (10 - 4) + 3 = 9 cards.

Repeat: choose four 1's, replace with three 1's. Now, 9 - 4 + 3 = 8 cards.

Repeat again: 8 - 4 + 3 = 7 cards.

Repeat: 7 - 4 + 3 = 6 cards.

Repeat: 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 cards.

Repeat: 5 - 4 + 3 = 4 cards.

Repeat: 4 - 4 + 3 = 3 cards.

Now, I can't perform any more operations because I need at least four cards with the same number.

So, the minimum is 3 cards.

Which matches the output.

Fifth test case:

n=5, k=2

nums=[3,8,1,48,7]

Here, all numbers are unique, so I can't perform any operations.

So, the minimum is 5 cards, which matches the output.

Sixth test case:

n=6, k=2

nums=[10,20,30,10,20,40]

Here, I have two 10's and two 20's.

First, perform operation on two 10's, replace them with one 10.

Now, I have [10,20,30,20,40].

Then, perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, I have [10,20,30,40], which are four cards.

But the output is 1, which suggests that there's a way to reduce to one card.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 20.

Then, I have [20,20,30,20,40].

Now, I have three 20's.

Perform operation on any two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, I have [20,30,20,40], which are four cards.

Still not one.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different cards to replace.

Alternatively, perhaps I can replace the two 10's with one 30.

Then, I have [30,20,30,20,40], which has two 30's.

Then, perform operation on the two 30's, replace them with one 30.

Now, I have [30,20,20,40].

Then, perform operation on the two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, I have [30,20,40], which are three cards.

Still not one.

Seems like I can't get to one card in this test case, but the output is 1.

Wait, maybe I misread the output.

Wait, the output for the sixth test case is 1, but according to my reasoning, it seems like I can't get below three cards.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's check the operations again.

Starting with [10,20,30,10,20,40].

Perform operation on two 10's, replace them with one 10.

Now, [10,20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [10,20,30,40].

No more pairs, so can't perform any more operations.

Minimum is four cards, but output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 20.

Then, [20,20,30,20,40].

Now, I have three 20's.

Perform operation on any two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,30,40].

No more pairs, so can't perform any more operations.

Still three cards.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 40.

Then, [40,20,30,20,40].

Now, I have two 40's.

Perform operation on two 40's, replace them with one 40.

Now, [40,20,30,20].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [40,20,30].

No more pairs, so can't perform any more operations.

Still three cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different cards to replace.

Alternatively, maybe I can replace the two 10's with one 30.

Then, [30,20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on two 30's, replace them with one 30.

Now, [30,20,20,40].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [30,20,40].

Still three cards.

I'm not seeing a way to get down to one card, but the output is 1.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the new cards I introduce can be used in future operations.

But in this case, it doesn't seem possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the output or my understanding.

Wait, looking back at the output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

So, for the sixth test case, n=6, k=2, nums=[10,20,30,10,20,40], output is 1.

But according to my reasoning, it's not possible to get to one card.

Wait, maybe I can do something like this:

Start with [10,20,30,10,20,40].

Perform operation on two 10's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on three 20's, replace them with two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only choose two cards at a time.

Wait, perhaps I misread the operation.

The operation is: choose k cards with the same number and replace them with k-1 cards of any number.

So, for k=2, choose two cards with the same number and replace them with one card of any number.

So, in [10,20,30,10,20,40], choose two 10's and replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,20,30,20,40].

Now, choose any two 20's and replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,30,20,40].

Choose the two 20's and replace them with one 20.

Now, [20,30,40].

No more pairs, can't perform any more operations.

Still three cards.

But the output is 1, which suggests that there's a way to get to one card, but I can't see how.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the output or my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 30.

Then, [30,20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on two 30's, replace them with one 30.

Now, [30,20,20,40].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [30,20,40].

No pairs left.

Still three cards.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 40.

Then, [40,20,30,20,40].

Perform operation on two 40's, replace them with one 40.

Now, [40,20,30,20].

Perform operation on two 20's, replace them with one 20.

Now, [40,20,30].

No pairs left.

Still three cards.

I'm stuck at three cards, but the output is 1.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 10's with one 20 and one 30.

Wait, no, the operation says replace k cards with k-1 cards of any number.

So, for k=2, I can replace two cards with one card of any number.

I can't choose to replace them with two different cards; it's k-1 cards, which is one card.

So, in this case, it's one card.

I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged)."

So, for k=2, I choose two cards with the same number and replace them with one card of any number.

So, it's one card, but I can choose its number.

In the sixth test case, it seems impossible to get to one card, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to reduce the cards by choosing different groups.

Wait, maybe I need to look for a general strategy.

Let me try to think of a general approach.

I need to minimize the number of cards by performing operations that reduce the number of cards by one each time (since I replace k cards with k-1 cards).

But I can only perform the operation if I have k cards with the same number.

So, the number of operations I can perform is limited by the number of groups of k cards with the same number.

Wait, more precisely, the maximum number of operations I can perform is floor(freq[i]/k) for each frequency freq[i] of number i.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because operations can create new cards.

Wait, in the operation, I can choose to replace k cards with the same number with k-1 cards of any number.

The key is that the new cards can have any number, including those already present.

So, I can potentially create new groups that allow for more operations.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to minimize the number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is n - m, where m is the minimum number of cards left.

But I need to consider the constraints: I can only perform an operation if I have k cards with the same number.

So, I need to find the maximum number of operations I can perform, and then the minimum number of cards left would be n - (number of operations).

But determining the maximum number of operations is not straightforward because operations can create new cards with any numbers, which might allow for more operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a graph or use some greedy approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula based on frequencies.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

For each number, if its frequency is >= k, I can perform floor(freq[i]/k) operations on it, each reducing the frequency by k and adding k-1 new cards.

But the new cards can have any number, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as reducing the frequency of each number by k and adding k-1 cards to a pool that can be assigned any number.

But I need to maximize the operations, which would minimize the final number of cards.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one, provided I have k cards with the same number.

But since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can potentially create new groups for further operations.

This seems complex.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample outputs.

First test case: n=5, k=3, output=2

Second: n=1, k=10, output=1

Third: n=7, k=2, output=1

Fourth: n=10, k=4, output=3

Fifth: n
