Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid of squares, each being either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations on the grid where I select two squares of the same color, and then all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners get changed to that color.

The question is, can I make the entire grid have squares of the same color—either all 'W' or all 'B'—by performing any number of these operations?

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero.

I need to figure out if, given any initial configuration of the grid, I can turn the entire grid into a single color.

Let me think about some examples to get a feel for this.

Example 1:

2 1

W

B

Output: NO

So, a 2x1 grid with the first square 'W' and the second 'B'. It's impossible to change anything because any operation requires two squares of the same color. Here, there are no two squares of the same color, so no operations can be performed. Hence, it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

Example 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Output: YES

This is a more complex grid, and apparently, it's possible to make all squares the same color after some operations.

Example 3:

1 1

W

Output: YES

A single square is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

Example 4:

2 2

BB

BB

Output: YES

All squares are already 'B', so it's already uniform.

Example 5:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Output: YES

This grid alternates colors in a checkerboard pattern. I need to see if I can make it uniform.

Example 6:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

Output: NO

This is a 4x2 grid:

Row 1: B B

Row 2: B B

Row 3: W W

Row 4: W W

I need to see if I can make all squares the same color.

Example 7:

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

Output: YES

Another complex grid that can be made uniform.

Example 8:

1 5

WBBWB

Output: NO

A single row with mixed colors: W B B W B

Apparently, it's impossible to make this uniform.

From these examples, I need to find a general rule or approach to determine if a given grid can be made uniform with the allowed operations.

Let me try to find a pattern or condition that allows the grid to become uniform.

First, if the grid is already uniform, the answer is YES.

If the grid is not uniform, I need to see if I can use the operations to make it uniform.

Each operation allows me to select two squares of the same color and set the entire rectangle between them to that color.

This operation is essentially painting a rectangular area with a single color, provided the two corner squares are already that color.

I need to think about how these operations can be chained or combined to affect larger areas of the grid.

One key observation might be that if there exists a path of squares of the same color connecting two squares, then I can potentially operate on the rectangle between them.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of connected components of squares of the same color.

If I have a connected component of 'W's, I can potentially operate on rectangles within that component to affect larger areas.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the grid as a graph, where each square is a node, and edges connect adjacent squares of the same color.

Then, connected components would be groups of squares of the same color that are connected to each other.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire grid and see if I can find a way to make all squares 'W' or all 'B'.

Let me consider that I want to make the entire grid 'W'.

To do that, I need to ensure that all 'B's can be flipped to 'W's through a series of operations.

Similarly, if I choose to make the entire grid 'B', I need to flip all 'W's to 'B's.

I need to decide which color to aim for, or see if it's possible for either color.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if both 'W's and 'B's can form connected components that cover the entire grid, then it's possible.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the examples:

In Example 1:

2x1 grid:

W

B

No two squares of the same color, so no operations can be performed. Hence, NO.

In Example 3:

1x1 grid:

W

Already uniform, so YES.

In Example 4:

2x2 grid:

B B

B B

Already uniform, so YES.

In Example 5:

3x4 grid:

B W B W

W B W B

B W B W

A checkerboard pattern. It's alternating 'B' and 'W', so it's impossible to make it uniform. But according to the example, the output is YES. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to make it uniform.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Wait, let's look back.

Example 5:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Output: YES

Hmm, but intuitively, it seems like it shouldn't be possible because it's a perfect checkerboard.

Wait, maybe there's a trick.

Wait, perhaps if I select two 'B's that are diagonally opposite, I can flip a rectangle.

But let's see.

Take positions (1,1) and (3,4), both 'B's.

Then, the rectangle from (1,1) to (3,4) would cover the entire grid and set everything to 'B'.

But in this grid, there are 'W's in between.

Wait, but according to the operation, all squares in the rectangle between the two selected squares would be set to the color of those squares.

So, if I select (1,1) and (3,4), both 'B's, then all squares in the grid would be set to 'B'.

But in the grid, there are 'W's in positions like (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), etc.

Would this operation set all those to 'B'?

Yes, because the rectangle defined by (1,1) and (3,4) includes all squares in the grid.

So, after this operation, the entire grid would be 'B's.

But in the example, it's said to be YES, meaning it's possible to make the grid uniform.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that in the fifth example, it can be done in two operations.

Wait, maybe I misread the grid.

Wait, in the fifth example:

3 4

B W B W

W B W B

B W B W

Output: YES

According to the operation, if I select (1,1) and (3,4), both 'B's, then set the entire grid to 'B's.

But in the explanation, it says it can be done in two operations, first selecting (2,1) and (1,4) to make a 2x4 rectangle white, and then selecting (2,1) and (3,4) to make a 2x4 rectangle white again.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the operations.

Wait, the operation sets all squares in the rectangle to the color of the selected squares.

So, if I select two 'B's, the rectangle between them becomes 'B's.

Similarly, if I select two 'W's, the rectangle between them becomes 'W's.

In the fifth example, by selecting (1,1) and (3,4), both 'B's, the entire grid would become 'B's.

So, it seems like it can be done in one operation.

But the explanation says it's done in two operations, making everything white.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that operations can be performed multiple times, and possibly with different color choices.

But in this case, selecting two 'B's would set the entire grid to 'B's.

Alternatively, selecting two 'W's would set a rectangle of 'W's.

But in this grid, there are 'W's and 'B's arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

Wait, perhaps the explanation is for a different grid.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the example outputs.

Wait, in the example outputs, for the fifth test case, it's "YES", meaning it's possible to make the grid uniform.

So, despite the checkerboard pattern, it seems possible.

But according to the operation, selecting (1,1) and (3,4), both 'B's, sets the entire grid to 'B's in one operation.

So, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, maybe I was wrong in thinking that it's impossible.

So, perhaps the general approach is that if there exists at least one color that connects from one side of the grid to the opposite side, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to make the entire grid 'W'.

To do that, I need to ensure that all 'B's can be flipped to 'W's through operations.

Similarly, if I want to make it all 'B's, I need to flip all 'W's to 'B's.

But how do the operations allow me to flip squares?

Each operation allows me to select two squares of the same color and flip the entire rectangle between them to that color.

So, if I have two 'W's, I can flip the rectangle between them to 'W's.

Similarly for 'B's.

This seems like I can grow areas of the same color by selecting corners of that color and flipping the rectangles between them.

But I need to see if I can grow these areas to cover the entire grid.

Perhaps I need to find connected components where squares of the same color are connected, either directly or through some path, and see if I can connect the entire grid through such operations.

Wait, maybe I should consider the grid in terms of regions of the same color and see if these regions can be merged through operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph connectivity, where edges exist between squares of the same color that are adjacent, and see if the graph is connected for one color.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider some smaller grids to see if I can find a pattern.

Consider a 2x2 grid:

Case 1:

W W

W W

Already uniform, so YES.

Case 2:

W W

W B

I can select (1,1) and (2,2), both 'W's, and set the entire grid to 'W's.

So, YES.

Case 3:

W B

B W

This is similar to the checkerboard.

If I try to select two 'W's, but there is only one 'W' in each corner.

Wait, positions (1,1) and (2,2) are 'W's.

If I select these two, the rectangle between them is the entire grid, so the entire grid becomes 'W's.

So, in one operation, it becomes uniform.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but in the earlier 3x4 checkerboard grid, it was also possible to make it uniform by selecting appropriate corners.

So, perhaps in general, it's possible unless there is a separation that prevents connecting squares of the same color.

Wait, perhaps if the grid has disjoint regions of 'W's and 'B's that cannot be connected through operations, then it's impossible.

But in the 2x2 grid with positions (1,1) and (2,2) as 'W's and (1,2) and (2,1) as 'B's, selecting (1,1) and (2,2) connects them and sets the entire grid to 'W's.

Similarly, in the 3x4 grid, selecting appropriate corners can set the entire grid to one color.

Wait, maybe the only time it's impossible is when there are 'W's and 'B's separated in such a way that no operation can connect them to form a uniform grid.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the properties of the operations.

Each operation allows me to select two squares of the same color and set the entire rectangle between them to that color.

This means that once I select two squares of the same color, I can effectively merge the areas between them to that color.

So, if I have two 'W's that are diagonally opposite in a rectangle of mixed colors, I can set the entire rectangle to 'W's.

This suggests that if I can find a way to select two squares of the same color such that their rectangle covers the entire grid, then I can make the entire grid that color.

In the 2x2 grid with positions (1,1) and (2,2) as 'W's, selecting these two squares allows me to set the entire grid to 'W's.

Similarly, in the 3x4 grid, selecting appropriate 'W's or 'B's can cover the entire grid.

But in some cases, it might not be possible.

For example, consider a grid where 'W's are only in the top row and 'B's are in the bottom row, with no 'W's in the bottom row or 'B's in the top row.

In such a case, selecting two 'W's in the top row can set the entire top row to 'W's, and selecting two 'B's in the bottom row can set the entire bottom row to 'B's, but I cannot make the entire grid 'W's or 'B's because there's no operation that can change the bottom row to 'W's or the top row to 'B's.

Wait, but in that case, if I select two 'W's in the top row and set the entire top row to 'W's, and then select two 'B's in the bottom row and set the entire bottom row to 'B's, but I still have 'W's and 'B's in different rows.

I need to make the entire grid uniform.

So, in that case, it's impossible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that if the top and bottom rows have different colors and there's no way to connect them through operations, then it's impossible.

Wait, but in the examples, there are cases where it's possible even if the top and bottom rows have different colors.

Wait, in the second example, the grid is 6x6 with mixed colors, and it's possible to make it uniform.

So, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of the grid.

Suppose I have a grid where all 'W's are connected in a way that they can be operated on to cover the entire grid, or similarly for 'B's.

Then, it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But I need a more concrete condition.

Let me consider the grid in terms of its rows and columns.

If I can find a way to make all rows or all columns have the same color, then I can make the entire grid uniform.

Wait, perhaps if all rows are the same, or all columns are the same, then it's easier.

But in the checkerboard pattern, rows and columns alternate colors.

Wait, maybe I need to check if there exists a majority color that can be expanded to cover the entire grid.

But that seems vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If all squares are already the same color, then YES.

- If there exists a way to select two squares of the same color such that their rectangle covers the entire grid, then YES.

- Otherwise, check if there are multiple operations that can be combined to cover the entire grid with one color.

But this seems too vague and not directly implementable.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I try to make the entire grid 'W's.

To do that, I need to ensure that all 'B's can be flipped to 'W's through operations.

Similarly, to make the entire grid 'B's, I need to flip all 'W's to 'B's.

But how do operations allow flipping of 'B's to 'W's or vice versa?

Wait, operations only allow me to set a rectangle to the color of the selected squares.

So, I cannot change squares of one color to another unless they are within a rectangle defined by two squares of the same color.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the grid in terms of the positions of 'W's and 'B's and see if I can find a sequence of operations that gradually expands the area of one color until it covers the entire grid.

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider the properties of the operations again.

Each operation sets a rectangle defined by two squares of the same color to that color.

This means that I can effectively merge areas of the same color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares.

So, if I have two 'W's in different areas, by selecting them, I can connect their areas through the rectangle between them.

This suggests that I can grow the area of 'W's by selecting pairs of 'W's that are in different regions.

Similarly for 'B's.

So, perhaps if I can connect all 'W's through a series of operations, I can make the entire grid 'W's.

Similarly for 'B's.

Hence, if either all 'W's or all 'B's are connected through operations, then it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But I need to define what "connected through operations" means.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are squares of the same color, and edges exist between squares that can be selected together in an operation, meaning they are of the same color.

But this seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the convexity of the regions.

Wait, perhaps if the region of one color is convex, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

But convexity might not be the right term here.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a grid where all 'W's form a single connected region, and all 'B's form another connected region.

Then, by selecting two 'W's that are at opposite ends of their region, I can set a large rectangle to 'W's, potentially covering some 'B's.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the grid in terms of the minimum and maximum coordinates of 'W's and 'B's.

If the 'W's span from row r1 to r2 and columns c1 to c2, and similarly for 'B's, then perhaps if their spans overlap, it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the minimal and maximal row and column indices for 'W's and 'B's.

- If the 'W's span from row min_rW to max_rW and columns min_cW to max_cW, and similarly for 'B's, then if there is an overlap in these spans, it might be possible to make the grid uniform.

But I need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps if one color spans the entire grid in rows or columns, it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

For example, if all rows have at least one 'W', and 'W's appear in all columns, then perhaps I can select 'W's from opposite corners and set the entire grid to 'W's.

But in the checkerboard pattern, 'W's and 'B's are interleaved in such a way that their spans overlap completely, but in that case, it's still possible to make the entire grid uniform in one operation.

Wait, but in the fifth example, which is a checkerboard, it's possible to make it uniform by selecting appropriate 'W's or 'B's.

So, perhaps my earlier thought was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's always possible to make the grid uniform, except in specific cases where the grid is divided into separate regions that cannot be connected through operations.

But in the first example, a 2x1 grid with 'W' and 'B', it's impossible because there are no two squares of the same color to perform an operation.

So, in that case, it's impossible.

Similarly, in the sixth example:

4x2 grid:

BB

BB

WW

WW

Output: NO

In this grid, the top two rows are 'B's and the bottom two are 'W's.

If I try to make the entire grid 'B's, I can select two 'B's from the top rows and set the top two rows to 'B's, but the bottom two rows are 'W's, and there are no 'B's in the bottom rows to connect to.

Similarly, if I try to make the entire grid 'W's, I can select two 'W's from the bottom rows and set the bottom two rows to 'W's, but the top rows are 'B's, which cannot be changed to 'W's because there are no 'W's in the top rows to perform operations.

Hence, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform in this case.

So, perhaps the condition is that if there exists a color that spans the entire grid in such a way that its regions can be connected through operations, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But I need a more concrete condition.

Let me consider the following hypothesis:

- If there exists a color that appears in both the first and last rows or in both the first and last columns, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

But let's test this hypothesis with the examples.

First example:

2x1 grid:

W

B

First row has 'W', last row has 'B'.

According to the hypothesis, since 'W' is in the first row and 'B' is in the last row, and they are different, it should be impossible, which matches the output NO.

Second example:

6x6 grid with mixed colors.

Presumably, both 'W's and 'B's appear in multiple rows and columns, so it should be possible, which matches the output YES.

Third example:

1x1 grid:

W

Already uniform, so YES.

Fourth example:

2x2 grid:

B B

B B

Already uniform, so YES.

Fifth example:

3x4 grid:

B W B W

W B W B

B W B W

According to the hypothesis, 'B's are in the first and third rows, and 'W's are in the second row.

So, 'B's are in both the first and last rows, which should make it possible to make the entire grid 'B's.

Hence, YES, which matches the output.

Sixth example:

4x2 grid:

B B

B B

W W

W W

'B's are in the first two rows, 'W's in the last two rows.

So, 'B's are in the first row but not the last row, and 'W's are in the last row but not the first row.

According to the hypothesis, it should be impossible to make the entire grid uniform, which matches the output NO.

Seventh example:

4x4 grid:

W W B W

B B W B

W W B B

B B B B

'B's are in all rows and columns, so according to the hypothesis, it's possible to make the entire grid 'B's, which matches the output YES.

Eighth example:

1x5 grid:

W B B W B

'B's are in columns 2,3,4,5, and 'W's in columns 1 and 3.

So, 'B's are in both the first and last columns (considering it's a single row), but 'W's are also in the first and last columns.

But according to the output, it's NO.

Hmm, so my hypothesis seems to fail here.

In the eighth example, both 'W's and 'B's are in the first and last columns, but it's still NO.

Wait, perhaps the condition is more strict.

Maybe if there exists a color that appears in both the first and last rows AND in both the first and last columns, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

In the eighth example, it's a 1x5 grid:

W B B W B

There's only one row, so "first and last rows" are the same.

'B's are in columns 2,3,4,5, and 'W's are in columns 1 and 3.

So, 'B's are in columns 2 to 5, which includes the first and last columns.

'W's are in columns 1 and 3, which also include the first and last columns (column 1 and column 5 has 'B').

But according to the output, it's NO.

So, my hypothesis is still flawed.

Perhaps I need to adjust it.

Wait, maybe the condition should be:

- If there exists a color that appears in both the first and last rows OR in both the first and last columns, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

In the eighth example, 'W's are in columns 1 and 3, which includes the first column but not the last column (column 5 is 'B').

Wait, column 1 has 'W', column 5 has 'B'.

So, 'W's are in the first column but not the last column.

'B's are in the last column but not the first column.

Hence, neither 'W's nor 'B's are in both the first and last columns.

Hence, according to this modified hypothesis, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform, which matches the output NO.

In the sixth example, 'B's are in the first two rows and 'W's in the last two rows.

'B's are in the first row but not the last row, 'W's are in the last row but not the first row.

Hence, neither color is in both the first and last rows.

Hence, impossible, which matches the output NO.

In the fifth example, 'B's are in the first and third rows, which includes the first and last rows (since there are three rows).

Hence, possible, which matches the output YES.

In the second example, with a 6x6 grid, presumably both 'W's and 'B's are in multiple rows and columns, so it's possible, which matches the output YES.

In the first example, 2x1 grid:

W

B

'W' is in the first row, 'B' is in the last row, but they are different colors.

Wait, according to this condition, since 'W' is in the first row and 'B' is in the last row, and they are different colors, perhaps it's impossible.

Wait, but according to the earlier thought, if different colors are in the first and last rows, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe I need to refine the condition.

Perhaps the correct condition is:

- If the first and last rows contain the same color, and the first and last columns contain the same color, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the fifth example, the first and last rows have different colors, yet it's possible.

Wait, in the fifth example:

3x4 grid:

B W B W

W B W B

B W B W

First row: B W B W

Last row: B W B W

So, the first and last rows have the same pattern, but they are not uniformly one color.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if a color appears in both the first and last rows, and also in both the first and last columns, then it's possible.

But in this grid, 'B's are in both the first and last rows, and also in both the first and last columns.

Similarly, 'W's are in both the first and last rows and columns.

Hence, it's possible to make the entire grid 'B's or 'W's.

But in practice, selecting appropriate corners can make the entire grid uniform.

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

- If there exists a color that appears in both the first and last rows and also in both the first and last columns, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

But in the first example:

2x1 grid:

W

B

First row: W

Last row: B

Different colors, so it's impossible.

Second example: 6x6 grid with mixed colors, presumably both 'W's and 'B's are in the first and last rows and columns, so it's possible.

Third example: 1x1 grid: W, already uniform, so YES.

Fourth example: 2x2 grid: B B

B B

Already uniform, so YES.

Fifth example: 3x4 grid with 'B's and 'W's in both first and last rows and columns, so possible.

Sixth example: 4x2 grid:

B B

B B

W W

W W

'B's are in the first two rows, 'W's in the last two rows.

'B's are not in the last rows, 'W's not in the first rows.

Hence, impossible.

Seventh example: 4x4 grid with 'B's and 'W's in both first and last rows and columns, so possible.

Eighth example: 1x5 grid: W B B W B

'W's are in the first and third columns, 'B's are in the second, fourth, and fifth columns.

So, 'W's are in the first column but not the last column, 'B's are in the last column but not the first column.

Hence, neither color is in both the first and last columns, so impossible.

This seems to align with the outputs in the examples.

Hence, I can formulate the condition as:

- For a grid to be made uniform:

- There must exist at least one color that appears in both the first and last rows and also in both the first and last columns.

- If such a color exists, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

- If no such color exists, then it's impossible.

This seems to be a consistent condition that matches all the examples provided.

Hence, I can implement this condition in my code.

Now, to implement this, I need to check for each color ('W' and 'B'):

- Whether that color appears in both the first and last rows.

- Whether that color appears in both the first and last columns.

If for at least one color, both these conditions are satisfied, then output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let's verify this condition with the examples.

First example:

2x1 grid:

W

B

First row: W

Last row: B

First column: W and B

Last column: W and B (since it's a 1-column
