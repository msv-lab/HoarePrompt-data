Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from the list of m and arrange them in any order to form his array c. The goal is to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of Petya's array a and Vasya's array c.

Okay, so the problem is to select and arrange n integers from m to maximize the sum of absolute differences with another array a of size n.

First, I need to understand what makes the difference |a_i - c_i| large. The difference is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, ideally, for each a_i, I want to choose the c_j that is either the largest possible or the smallest possible, depending on whether a_i is closer to the lower or upper end of the c values.

But since I have to choose n elements from m and arrange them, I need to select which c's to pick and in what order to pair them with a's to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

One approach is to sort both arrays and pair the elements in a way that maximizes the differences. Let's think about sorting.

If I sort array a in ascending order and array c in descending order, then pairing the smallest a with the largest c, the second smallest a with the second largest c, and so on, should give me the maximum possible differences.

Wait, is that correct? Let's consider an example.

Suppose a = [1, 2, 3] and c = [6, 5, 4]. If I pair 1 with 6, 2 with 5, and 3 with 4, the differences are |1-6|=5, |2-5|=3, |3-4|=1, summing to 9.

If I pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5, and 3 with 6, differences are |1-4|=3, |2-5|=3, |3-6|=3, summing to 9.

Wait, same sum. Another pairing: 1 with 5, 2 with 4, 3 with 6: |1-5|=4, |2-4|=2, |3-6|=3, sum to 9.

So in this case, all pairings give the same sum. Is that always the case?

Let's try another example. a = [1, 2, 3], c = [1, 2, 3]. Pairing same with same: |1-1|=0, |2-2|=0, |3-3|=0, sum 0.

Pairing 1 with 3, 2 with 2, 3 with 1: |1-3|=2, |2-2|=0, |3-1|=2, sum 4.

Pairing 1 with 2, 2 with 3, 3 with 1: |1-2|=1, |2-3|=1, |3-1|=2, sum 4.

Pairing 1 with 3, 2 with 1, 3 with 2: |1-3|=2, |2-1|=1, |3-2|=1, sum 4.

So in this case, the maximum sum is 4, achieved by some pairings but not all.

Wait, according to the problem, m >= n, and we can choose any n from m and arrange them in any order.

So, in this case, m = 3, n = 3, c = [1,2,3], a = [1,2,3].

To maximize the sum, we need to pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible from a_i.

In this case, pairing 1 with 3, 2 with 1, and 3 with 2 gives sum |1-3| + |2-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which seems maximal.

But is there a better way? If c has duplicates, but in this case, c has unique elements.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "arrange them in a certain order", meaning that we can permute the chosen c's in any order.

So, the key is to select n elements from c and arrange them in an order that maximizes the sum of absolute differences with a.

Now, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, we need to pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible from a_i.

But since we can choose and arrange any n c's, we need to select c's that allow such pairings.

This sounds like we need to select c's that are spread out to cover the extremes.

Wait, maybe it's better to sort a and sort c in reverse order and pair them.

Wait, in the first example, a = [6,1,2,4], c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], n=4, m=6.

Sorting a: [1,2,4,6]

Sorting c in reverse: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pairing 1 with 7: |1-7|=6

2 with 5: |2-5|=3

4 with 3: |4-3|=1

6 with 3: |6-3|=3

Total sum: 6+3+1+3=13

But in the sample input, it says the output is 16. So, something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, maybe I need to select which c's to choose and in what order.

In the first example, the explanation says Vasya can create (1,5,7,2), which corresponds to |6-1|=5, |1-5|=4, |2-7|=5, |4-2|=2, total 16.

But according to my previous approach, sorting a as [1,2,4,6] and c as [7,5,3,3,2,1], pairing [1 with 7, 2 with 5, 4 with 3, 6 with 3] gives sum 13, which is less than 16.

So, my approach is not optimal here.

Hmm, maybe I need a different strategy.

Let's consider that for each a_i, I want to pair it with the largest possible c_j that hasn't been paired yet, or the smallest possible c_j, depending on which one gives a larger difference.

But that sounds like a greedy approach, and it might not work.

Wait, perhaps I should sort a and sort c, and then pair the smallest a with the smallest c, and the largest a with the largest c, and so on, alternating.

Wait, but that might not maximize the differences.

Wait, maybe I need to consider all possible pairings and select the one that gives the maximum sum, but that's not efficient.

Given the constraints, n and m can be up to 2*10^5, so I need an efficient algorithm, O(n log n) or O(m log m) time.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort array a and sort array c.

Then, for each a_i, I can choose the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|.

But since I have to choose n distinct c_j's, I need to select a set of c's that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_j| for some arrangement.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can consider the maximum possible sum, which would be the sum of the maximum possible differences for each a_i.

But I need to ensure that the c's are distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some kind of matching or assignment problem algorithm, but that's too slow for these constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and sort c in reverse order and pair them directly.

In the first example, a sorted is [1,2,4,6], c sorted in reverse is [7,5,3,3,2,1].

Pairing [1,7]: |1-7|=6

[2,5]: |2-5|=3

[4,3]: |4-3|=1

[6,3]: |6-3|=3

Sum: 6+3+1+3=13, but the sample output is 16.

So, this approach doesn't give the maximum.

Wait, in the sample explanation, they chose [1,5,7,2], which is not in any sorted order.

Wait, perhaps I need to select the c's in such a way that for each a_i, I choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, without regarding the order.

But I need to choose n distinct c's.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix the c's that I'm going to choose, and then arrange them in a way that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given that, to maximize the sum, I should pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible from a_i.

So, for each a_i, I have to choose a c_j that hasn't been paired yet, and maximize |a_i - c_j|.

This sounds like a greedy approach, but implementing it directly would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

So, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and sort c, and then decide which c's to pick in a way that maximizes the differences.

But earlier attempts didn't give the correct result.

Wait, maybe I need to consider both ends of c, the smallest and the largest, and pair them with a's accordingly.

Let me try that.

Sort a in ascending order.

Sort c in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, I can choose either the smallest available c_j or the largest available c_j, whichever gives a larger difference.

I can maintain two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of c, and for each a_i, choose the one that gives the larger difference.

Wait, but I need to choose n c's, and arrange them in any order.

So, perhaps I can sort a, and then for each a_i, choose the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, ensuring that each c_j is used only once.

But again, this seems like an assignment problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a, sorted in ascending order.

Then, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I should arrange c in such a way that c_i is as far away as possible from a_i.

So, if a is sorted ascending, c should be sorted in a way that c_i are either all larger or all smaller than a_i, as much as possible.

But c can be arranged in any order, so I can arrange c in descending order and pair the smallest a with the largest c, and so on.

Wait, in the first example, that gave me 13, but the sample output is 16.

So, maybe that's not the best arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I need to select which c's to choose in addition to arranging them.

In the sample explanation, they chose [1,5,7,2], which is not sorted in any particular order.

Wait, maybe selecting c's in such a way that for each a_i, I choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, without regarding the order.

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in ascending order.

- Then, for each a_i, I can choose either c[j] where j is the smallest unused c, or the largest unused c, whichever gives a larger difference.

- I can keep two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of c, and for each a_i, choose the one that gives the larger difference.

- This way, I can select n c's and arrange them accordingly.

Let me try this with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6], sorted a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [1,2,3,3,5,7], sorted c = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize pointers: left = 0, right = 5

For a[0]=1:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=7

|1-1|=0, |1-7|=6 → choose c[right]=7, difference=6

Now, right=4

For a[1]=2:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=5

|2-1|=1, |2-5|=3 → choose c[right]=5, difference=3

Now, right=3

For a[2]=4:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=3

|4-1|=3, |4-3|=1 → choose c[left]=1, difference=3

Now, left=1

For a[3]=6:

Choose between c[left]=2 and c[right]=3

|6-2|=4, |6-3|=3 → choose c[left]=2, difference=4

Total sum: 6+3+3+4=16, which matches the sample.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the approach is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in ascending order.

- Maintain two pointers, left and right, pointing to the smallest and largest elements in c that haven't been chosen yet.

- For each a_i (in sorted order), choose between c[left] and c[right], picking the one that gives the larger difference |a_i - c[left]| vs |a_i - c[right]|.

- Add that difference to the total sum and move the corresponding pointer.

- Repeat until all a_i are paired.

This should give the maximum possible sum of differences.

Let me verify this with another sample.

Second test case:

n=3, m=4

a = [1,1,1]

c = [1,1,1,1]

Sort a: [1,1,1]

Sort c: [1,1,1,1]

left=0, right=3

For a[0]=1:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[3]=1

|1-1|=0 in both cases → choose either, sum +=0

For a[1]=1:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[3]=1

|1-1|=0 → sum +=0

For a[2]=1:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[3]=1

|1-1|=0 → sum +=0

Total sum: 0, which matches the sample.

Another test case:

n=5, m=5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

c = [1,2,3,4,5]

Sort a: [1,2,3,4,5]

Sort c: [1,2,3,4,5]

left=0, right=4

For a[0]=1:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[4]=5

|1-1|=0, |1-5|=4 → choose c[4]=5, sum +=4

For a[1]=2:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[3]=4

|2-1|=1, |2-4|=2 → choose c[3]=4, sum +=2

For a[2]=3:

Choose between c[0]=1 and c[2]=3

|3-1|=2, |3-3|=0 → choose c[0]=1, sum +=2

For a[3]=4:

Choose between c[1]=2 and c[2]=3

|4-2|=2, |4-3|=1 → choose c[1]=2, sum +=2

For a[4]=5:

Choose between c[1]=2 and c[2]=3

Wait, after previous steps, c left are c[1]=2 and c[2]=3.

But in previous steps, I chose c[0]=1, c[1]=2, c[3]=4, c[4]=5.

Wait, I think I need to keep track of used c's.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove the chosen c from the list.

Let me try again.

Sort a: [1,2,3,4,5]

Sort c: [1,2,3,4,5]

left=0, right=4

For a[0]=1:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=5

|1-1|=0, |1-5|=4 → choose c[right]=5, sum +=4

Now, c[left]=1, c[right]=4

For a[1]=2:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=4

|2-1|=1, |2-4|=2 → choose c[right]=4, sum +=2

Now, c[left]=1, c[right]=3

For a[2]=3:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=3

|3-1|=2, |3-3|=0 → choose c[left]=1, sum +=2

Now, c[left]=2, c[right]=3

For a[3]=4:

Choose between c[left]=2 and c[right]=3

|4-2|=2, |4-3|=1 → choose c[left]=2, sum +=2

Now, c[left]=3, which is used.

For a[4]=5:

Only c[left]=3 left

|5-3|=2, sum +=2

Total sum: 4+2+2+2+2=12, which matches the sample.

Good.

So, the algorithm seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this correctly.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

c = list(map(int, input().split()))

if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):

print(0)

continue

a.sort()

c.sort(reverse=True)

if len(a) == 1:

print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))

continue

(i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])

if t2 > t1:

j += 1

else:

i += 1

ans += max(t1, t2)

print(ans)

First, the code checks if all elements in a and c are the same, in which case the difference sum is 0, which makes sense.

Then, it sorts a in ascending order and c in descending order.

For the case when n=1, it calculates the maximum difference between a[0] and the maximum or minimum of c, which is correct.

For general n, it initializes i=0, j=1, ans=0.

Then, for each k from 0 to n-1, it calculates t1 = |a[i] - c[i]| and t2 = |a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j]|, compares them, and increments i or j based on which is larger, adding the maximum of t1 and t2 to ans.

Wait, this seems different from the approach I described.

In my approach, I have two pointers, left and right, and for each a_i, I choose between c[left] and c[right], whichever gives the larger difference, and move the corresponding pointer.

But in this code, it's calculating t1 and t2 in a different way.

Let me try to understand.

It's using i as left pointer starting from 0, and j as right pointer starting from 1.

Wait, j starts from 1, but in my approach, right starts from m-1.

This seems inconsistent.

Let me try with the first sample input.

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted c in descending order = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

i=0, j=1, ans=0

For k=0:

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]| = |1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1=3]-c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

Since t2=5 < t1=6, so i +=1, ans +=6 → ans=6, i=1, j=1

For k=1:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-1=3]-c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

t2=5 > t1=3, so j +=1, ans +=5 → ans=11, i=1, j=2

For k=2:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]|=|2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-2=2]-c[6-2=4]|=|4-3|=1

t2=1 < t1=3, so i +=1, ans +=3 → ans=14, i=2, j=2

For k=3:

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]|=|4-3|=1

t2 = |a[4-2=2]-c[6-2=4]|=|4-3|=1

t1=1, t2=1, so since t2 <= t1, i +=1, ans +=1 → ans=15

But according to the sample, it should be 16.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Let's see:

sorted a = [1,2,4,6]

sorted c descending = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

For k=0:

i=0, j=1

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]| = |1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1=3]-c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

t2 < t1, so i +=1 → i=1, ans +=6 → ans=6

For k=1:

i=1, j=1

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a
