Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he bakes n buns that he wants to sell. Normally, each bun costs a coins, but he's running a promotion to attract customers. The promotion works like this: he chooses some integer k, which can be between 0 and the minimum of n and b. For the first k buns sold, each bun has a modified price: the i-th bun costs (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. So, if he chooses k=0, he sells all n buns at the usual price of a coins each. That's straightforward. If he chooses k=1, he sells the first bun at b coins, and the remaining (n-1) buns at a coins each. If k=2, the first bun is sold at b coins, the second at (b-1) coins, and the remaining (n-2) buns at a coins each. This pattern continues up to k=min(n, b), where the first k buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from b down to (b - k + 1), and the rest at a coins each.

The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the prices of all buns sold.

I need to consider multiple test cases, each with different values of n, a, and b.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider the possible values of k and find the one that gives the maximum total profit.

But since n and b can be up to 10^9, and there are up to 10^4 test cases, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible k values for each test case.

So, I need to find a way to compute the maximum profit in constant time for each test case.

Let me try to formulate the total profit for a given k.

Total profit P(k) = sum of prices of the first k buns + sum of prices of the remaining (n - k) buns.

The first k buns are sold at prices: b, (b-1), (b-2), ..., (b - k + 1).

So, the sum of these prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from b down to (b - k + 1).

The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term).

So, sum of first k buns = (k / 2) * (b + (b - k + 1)) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1)

The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each, so their total price is a * (n - k).

Therefore, total profit P(k) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + a * (n - k)

I need to maximize P(k) over k from 0 to min(n, b).

I need to find the value of k that maximizes P(k).

Let me consider P(k) as a function of k and see if I can find its maximum.

P(k) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + a * (n - k)

Let's expand this:

P(k) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + a * (n - k)

= (k * 2b - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k

= (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k

= (2b*k)/2 - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

= b*k - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

= a*n + (b - a)*k - (k^2)/2 + k/2

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, I can think about when it's beneficial to choose a larger k.

Let's consider the difference in profit when increasing k by 1.

Let's compute P(k+1) - P(k):

P(k+1) = ( (k+1)/2 ) * (2b - (k+1) + 1) + a*(n - (k+1))

= ( (k+1)/2 ) * (2b - k) + a*(n - k - 1)

Now, P(k+1) - P(k) = [ ( (k+1)/2 ) * (2b - k) + a*(n - k - 1) ] - [ (k/2) * (2b - k + 1) + a*(n - k) ]

Let's simplify this:

= ( (k+1)/2 )*(2b - k) - (k/2)*(2b - k + 1) + a*(n - k - 1) - a*(n - k)

= ( (k+1)*(2b - k) - k*(2b - k + 1) ) / 2 + a*(-1)

= ( (2b(k+1) - k(k+1)) - (2b*k - k*(k - 1) + k) ) / 2 - a

= ( 2b*k + 2b - k^2 - k - 2b*k + k^2 - k ) / 2 - a

= (2b - 2k) / 2 - a

= (b - k) - a

= b - k - a

So, P(k+1) - P(k) = b - k - a

This tells me that the profit increases when P(k+1) - P(k) > 0, which is when b - k - a > 0, or k < b - a.

When k >= b - a, P(k+1) - P(k) <= 0, meaning the profit starts decreasing or stays the same.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at the largest k where k < b - a, or at k = b - a if b - a <= min(n, b).

Wait, let's think carefully.

If k < b - a, P(k+1) - P(k) > 0, so profit increases.

If k = b - a, P(k+1) - P(k) = b - (b - a) - a = b - b + a - a = 0, so profit stays the same.

If k > b - a, P(k+1) - P(k) < 0, so profit decreases.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at k = b - a, since beyond that, the profit starts decreasing.

But k cannot exceed min(n, b), so I need to take k = min(b - a, min(n, b)).

Wait, b - a could be negative, zero, or positive.

If b - a < 0, then k cannot be negative, so k = 0.

If b - a >= min(n, b), then k = min(n, b).

So, to generalize:

k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n, b))

But min(n, b) is already the upper limit for k, so k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n, b))

Alternatively, since b - a could be negative, and k cannot be negative, I should set k to be the minimum of (b - a) and min(n, b), but clamped at least to 0.

So, k = max(0, min(b - a, min(n, b)))

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, the profit starts decreasing after k = b - a, so even if min(n, b) is larger than b - a, I should still take k = b - a.

But b - a could be larger than min(n, b), so I need to cap it at min(n, b).

Wait, no, from the difference P(k+1) - P(k) = b - k - a.

Set P(k+1) - P(k) <= 0 when k >= b - a.

So, the maximum is at k = b - a, but only if k <= min(n, b).

But b - a could be larger than min(n, b), so k = min(b - a, min(n, b))

And k cannot be negative, so k = max(0, min(b - a, min(n, b)))

Yes, that seems correct.

Let me test this with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

4 4 5

n=4, a=4, b=5

k = min(max(0, 5 - 4), min(4,5)) = min(1,4) =1

So, k=1

Total profit = (5 + (5 -1 +1))/2 *1 + (4-1)*4 = (5)/1 + 3*4 = 5 + 12 = 17

Which matches the sample output.

Second sample input:

5 5 9

n=5, a=5, b=9

k = min(max(0,9-5), min(5,9)) = min(4,5) =4

Total profit = (9 + (9-4+1))/2 *4 + (5-4)*5 = (9+6)/2 *4 +1*5 = 15*2 +5 =30 +5=35

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 35 for this case.

Wait, no:

(9 +6)/2 *4 +1*5 = (15)/2 *4 +5 =7.5*4 +5 =30 +5=35

Yes, matches the sample.

Wait, but (9 +6)/2 =7.5, and 7.5*4=30, plus 5 is 35.

But in programming, with integers, I need to ensure that the division is integer division, but in the calculation, I need to handle it carefully to avoid fractional values.

Wait, in the code provided, it's using integer division:

(b + (b - k +1)) //2 *k + (n -k)*a

In Python 3, // is integer division.

But in this case, (9 +6)//2 =15//2=7, then 7*4=28 +5=33, which is not matching the sample output of 35.

Wait, there must be a mistake in the formula.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says for k=5, which is min(n,b)=5, but according to my formula, k=min(4,5)=4.

Wait, but in the sample, it's choosing k=5, which is min(n,b)=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the choice of k.

Wait, in the second sample input, n=5, a=5, b=9.

According to the earlier analysis, k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n, b)) = min(4,5)=4

But in the sample explanation, it chooses k=5, and gets 9+8+7+6+5=35.

So, why is that?

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, if k=5, then total profit=(9 + (9-5+1))/2 *5 + (5-5)*5=(9+5)/2 *5 +0=7*5=35

Which matches the sample.

But according to my earlier formula, k=min(max(0,b-a), min(n,b))=min(4,5)=4

But in the sample, k=5 achieves higher profit.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Let me recast the problem.

I need to maximize P(k) = sum of first k buns at modified prices + sum of remaining (n - k) buns at price a.

Sum of first k buns is sum from i=1 to k of (b - i +1) = sum from i=1 to k of (b - i +1) = k*b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k*b - k(k+1)/2 + k = k*b - k(k+1)/2 + k

Simplify: k*b - k(k+1)/2 + k = k*(b +1 - (k+1)/2)

Wait, perhaps better to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Sum = (k/2)*(first term + last term) = (k/2)*(b + (b - k +1)) = (k/2)*(2b - k +1)

So, P(k) = (k/2)*(2b - k +1) + a*(n -k)

I need to maximize P(k) over k from 0 to min(n,b)

Now, to find the k that maximizes P(k), I can consider P(k) as a quadratic function in terms of k.

P(k) = (k/2)*(2b - k +1) + a*(n -k) = (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k = (-k^2/2 + (2b +1)/2 *k) + a*n - a*k

Let's combine like terms:

P(k) = -k^2/2 + (2b +1)/2 *k + a*n - a*k = -k^2/2 + [(2b +1)/2 - a]*k + a*n

This is a quadratic function in k: P(k) = A*k^2 + B*k + C, where A=-1/2, B=(2b +1)/2 - a, C=a*n

The maximum of a quadratic function occurs at k = -B/(2*A)

So, k_max = -B/(2*A) = [ -( (2b +1)/2 - a ) ] / (2*(-1/2)) = [ - (2b +1)/2 + a ] / (-1) = (2b +1)/2 - a

So, k_max = (2b +1)/2 - a

But k must be an integer between 0 and min(n,b)

So, I need to choose k as the closest integer to k_max, but within the limits.

But since k must be an integer, I need to choose k floor(k_max) or ceil(k_max), whichever is within the bounds.

Wait, but k must be <= min(n,b), and >=0

So, I should compute k_max = floor((2b +1)/2 - a)

But need to ensure k_max >=0 and <= min(n,b)

Wait, but (2b +1)/2 - a may not be an integer, so I need to choose the integer k that is closest to k_max, but within the bounds.

Alternatively, since P(k) is a quadratic function with A=-1/2 <0, it's a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum is at the vertex, which is at k = (2b +1)/2 - a

But since k must be an integer, I should choose the integer k closest to this value, but within the allowed range.

So, compute k_max = round((2b +1)/2 - a)

Then, set k = max(0, min(k_max, min(n,b)))

Then, compute P(k)

Wait, but in the sample input 7 5 11, according to this:

k_max = floor((2*11 +1)/2 -5) = floor(23/2 -5) = floor(11.5 -5) = floor(6.5)=6

min(n,b)=5, so k=5

P(5)=(5/2)*(2*11 -5 +1)+5*(5-5)= (2.5)*(22 -5 +1)=2.5*18=45

Which matches the sample output of 45.

In the second sample input, 5 5 9

k_max= floor((18 +1)/2 -5)=floor(19/2 -5)=floor(9.5 -5)=floor(4.5)=4

But in the sample explanation, k=5 gives a higher profit.

Wait, according to my formula, k=4 would give:

P(4)=(4/2)*(18 -4 +1)+5*(5-4)=2*15 +5*1=30+5=35

P(5)=(5/2)*(18 -5 +1)+5*(5-5)=2.5*14 +0=35+0=35

So, both k=4 and k=5 give 35, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says it's optimal to choose k=5.

So, perhaps in cases where k_max is an integer, and k_max < min(n,b), but P(k_max) == P(k_max +1), then k can be either.

In such cases, choosing k=min(n,b) is also optimal.

So, in general, I can choose k = min(floor((2b +1)/2 - a), min(n,b))

But need to ensure k >=0.

So, k = max(0, min(floor((2b +1)/2 - a), min(n,b)))

Then, compute P(k)

But in programming, to avoid floating points, I can compute floor((2b +1)/2 - a)

But need to handle it carefully.

Alternatively, since P(k) is quadratic, and I have the difference P(k+1) - P(k) = b - k - a

As earlier derived.

Then, P(k+1) - P(k) >0 when k < b - a

Equals 0 when k = b - a

Less than 0 when k > b - a

So, the maximum is at k = b - a, but only if b - a <= min(n,b)

Else, it's at k = min(n,b)

Wait, in the second sample input, b - a =9 -5=4, which is less than min(n,b)=5

So, k=4, and P(4)=35

But P(5)=35 as well.

So, in cases where k = b - a < min(n,b), and P(k) == P(k+1), then choosing k = min(n,b) is also optimal.

So, in general, k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n,b))

Wait, but in this case, k=4 and k=5 both give 35.

So, choosing k=4 or k=5 is equally good.

So, to maximize profit, I can choose k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n,b))

But in the first sample input, n=4, a=4, b=5

k = min(max(0,5-4), min(4,5))=min(1,4)=1

P(1)=(1/2)*(10 -1 +1)+3*4=5 +12=17

Which matches the sample.

Third sample input:10 10 5

k = min(max(0,5-10), min(10,5))=min(0,5)=0

P(0)=0 +10*10=100

Which matches the sample.

Fourth sample:5 5 11

k = min(max(0,11-5),5)=min(6,5)=5

P(5)=35, which matches the sample.

Wait, but earlier calculation for n=5, a=5, b=9, k=4 or k=5 both give 35.

So, in the code, it's using k = min(n, b - a)

Then, P(k) = (b + (b - k +1))//2 *k + (n -k)*a

In the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

k = min(n, b - a)

if b <= a:

print(a * n)

else:

print((b + (b - k +1)) //2 *k + (n -k)*a)



Wait, in the code, k = min(n, b - a)

But in my earlier analysis, it should be k = min(max(0, b - a), min(n, b))

But in the code, it's min(n, b - a), but in the function, it's min(n, b - a), but in the explanation, it's min(n, b)

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

In the code, for the first sample input:

n=4, a=4, b=5

k = min(4,5-4)=min(4,1)=1

P(1)=(5 + (5 -1 +1))//2 *1 + (4-1)*4=(5+5)//2 *1 +3*4=5 +12=17

Which matches.

Second sample:

n=5, a=5, b=9

k = min(5,9-5)=min(5,4)=4

P(4)=(9 + (9 -4 +1))//2 *4 + (5-4)*5=(9+6)//2 *4 +5=7*4 +5=28+5=33

But sample output is 35.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

According to the sample, output should be 35, but according to this calculation, it's 33.

Wait, perhaps the floor division is causing an issue.

(9 +6)//2=15//2=7, then 7*4=28 +5=33

But the correct sum for k=4 should be 9+8+7+6=30, plus 5 from the remaining bun, total 35.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's giving 33.

So, there's an error in the formula or in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula for the sum of the first k buns.

Sum of first k buns: b + (b-1) + ... + (b - k +1)

Which is (k/2)*(2b - k +1)

But in integer division, it should be handled carefully.

Maybe I need to compute it as (k * (2*b - k +1)) // 2 to avoid floating points.

In the code, it's (b + (b - k +1)) //2 *k

Which is equivalent to ( (b + (b - k +1)) //2 ) * k

Which is ((2b - k +1) //2) *k

But (2b - k +1) //2 might not be equal to (2b - k +1)/2 when it's not integer.

Wait, in Python, for integers, (2b - k +1)//2 is equal to floor((2b -k +1)/2)

But in the correct formula, sum of first k terms is k*(first + last)/2

Which is k*(b + (b -k +1))/2

Which is k*(2b -k +1)/2

To perform integer division, it's better to compute (k*(2b -k +1))//2

But in the code, it's ((b + (b - k +1)) //2) *k

Which is ((2b -k +1)//2) *k

Which is equal to floor((2b -k +1)/2) *k

But in the earlier calculation, for n=5, a=5, b=9, k=4

(2*9 -4 +1)=18 -4 +1=15

15//2=7

7*4=28

Then, (n -k)*a=(5-4)*5=1*5=5

Total=28+5=33

But correct sum for k=4 should be 9+8+7+6=30, plus 5 from the remaining bun, total 35.

So, there's a discrepancy of 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (k*(2b -k +1))//2

But in this case, k=4, 2b=18, -k= -4, +1=1, total 15

15//2=7, 7*4=28

But the correct sum is 30.

So, the formula is not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to account for the correct sum.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the sum of the first k buns as the sum of an arithmetic series, which is (k/2)*(first + last), but ensuring that it's correctly computed with integer division.

Wait, in Python, when using integers, // operator performs floor division.

So, (k*(2*b -k +1))//2 should give the correct sum.

Wait, for k=4, b=9:

(4*(18 -4 +1))//2=(4*15)//2=60//2=30

Which is correct.

But in the code, it's ((b + (b - k +1))//2)*k =((9 + (9 -4 +1))//2)*4=((9+6)//2)*4=15//2*4=7*4=28

So, it's giving 28 instead of 30.

Hence, the formula in the code is incorrect.

It should be (k*(2*b -k +1))//2 + (n -k)*a

Instead of ((b + (b -k +1))//2)*k + (n -k)*a

So, the code has a mistake in the formula.

Wait, but in the code, it's written as ((b + (b -k +1))//2)*k + (n -k)*a

Which is equivalent to ((2*b -k +1)//2)*k + (n -k)*a

But the correct formula should be (k*(2*b -k +1))//2 + (n -k)*a

Which is not necessarily equal to ((2*b -k +1)//2)*k + (n -k)*a

Because (k*(2*b -k +1))//2 might not be equal to ((2*b -k +1)//2)*k due to integer division.

In the first case, (k*(2*b -k +1))//2, the division is applied after multiplying k by (2*b -k +1), which is the correct way to compute the sum of the arithmetic series.

In the second case, ((2*b -k +1)//2)*k, the division is applied to (2*b -k +1), then multiplied by k, which can lead to loss of information due to floor division.

Hence, the code has a mistake in the formula.

In the earlier calculation, for n=5, a=5, b=9, k=4:

Correct sum: (4*(18 -4 +1))//2 + (5-4)*5=(4*15)//2 +1*5=60//2 +5=30+5=35

But in the code's formula: ((9 + (9 -4 +1))//2)*4 + (5-4)*5=((9+6)//2)*4 +5=15//2*4 +5=7*4 +5=28+5=33

Which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
