Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of 'a' burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of 'b' burles. The goal is to find out the minimum amount of money Maxim needs to spend to get exactly n yogurds.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, indicated by the integer 't', which tells us how many scenarios we need to evaluate. For each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b.

- n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.

- a is the regular price of one yogurt.

- b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

My task is to calculate the minimum cost for each test case and output it.

Let me think about how to approach this problem.

Option 1: Buy all yogurts individually at price 'a' each.

Total cost would be: n * a

Option 2: Buy as many pairs as possible at price 'b' per pair, and buy the remaining yogurts individually at price 'a'.

To maximize the use of the promotion, I should buy as many pairs as possible, and then buy any remaining yogurt individually.

Let's consider that:

- The number of pairs Maxim can buy is: n // 2

- The number of individual yogurts left is: n % 2

So, the total cost would be: (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

Now, I need to compare this with the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

The minimum cost would be the smaller of these two options.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the given code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

d = c / 2

if a * b < a * d:

print(a * b)

else:

print(round(a * d))

Hmm, there are a few issues here.

First, in the function, the variables are being assigned as (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split()), but according to the problem, the inputs are n, a, b.

Wait, no. Looking again, in the problem description, the first line is t, which is the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there is a line with n, a, b.

But in the code, it's reading n as the number of test cases, and then for each i in range(n), it's reading a, b, c. But according to the problem, it should be reading n, a, b for each test case.

Also, it's dividing c by 2 and comparing a * b with a * d, which doesn't make much sense in this context.

Wait, let's try to understand.

In the code:

- n is the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- It reads three integers: a, b, c

- d = c / 2

- If a * b < a * d, print a * b, else print round(a * d)

But according to the problem:

- For each test case, it's n, a, b.

- n is the number of yogurts, a is the price per yogurt, b is the price for two yogurts.

So, there's a mismatch here.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the code. Maybe it's supposed to be (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split()), not (a, b, c).

Looking back, in the problem description, it's n, a, b, but in the code, it's a, b, c.

This might be a mistake.

Assuming that (n, a, b) are being read as (a, b, c), so effectively:

- n = a

- a = b

- b = c

That would be confusing. Better to rename the variables for clarity.

But to assess the correctness, I need to see if the logic is sound, regardless of variable names.

Let's proceed with the assumption that n is the number of yogurts, a is the price per yogurt, and b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

Now, in the code, it's calculating d = c / 2, which would be the price per yogurt if buying in pairs.

Then, it's comparing a * b with a * d.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, no. If d = c / 2, and c is the promotional price for two yogurts, then d is the average price per yogurt in the promotion.

But then, a * b would be the total cost if buying all yogurts individually at price a.

Wait, no. In the code, a is actually n, a is b, and b is c, based on the problem description.

This is confusing. Let's try to standardize the variable names.

Let's assume:

- n is the number of yogurts.

- a is the regular price per yogurt.

- b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

Then, in the code, (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split()), but according to the problem, it should be (n, a, b).

So, perhaps it's a mistake in variable assignment.

Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to calculate the minimum cost correctly, but it's obfuscated.

Let's try to understand the logic.

The code calculates d = c / 2, which would be the average cost per yogurt in the promotion.

Then, it compares a * b with a * d.

But a is actually n in this case, which is the number of yogurts.

Wait, hold on.

If (a, b, c) correspond to (n, a, b) in the problem, then:

- a is n

- b is a

- c is b

So, d = c / 2 = promotional price per yogurt.

Then, a * b = n * a, which is the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

a * d = n * (b / 2), which would be the cost if buying all yogurts at the promotional price per yogurt.

But this doesn't make sense because the promotion is for pairs of yogurts, not necessarily for all yogurts.

Moreover, if n is odd, you can't buy all yogurts in pairs.

So, this approach seems flawed.

A better approach would be:

1. Calculate the number of pairs that can be bought: n // 2

2. Calculate the cost for these pairs: (n // 2) * b

3. Calculate the number of remaining yogurts: n % 2

4. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurts: (n % 2) * a

5. Total cost using promotion: (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

6. Calculate the cost of buying all yogurts individually: n * a

7. The minimum of these two costs is the answer.

Now, looking back at the code, it seems to be trying to compare the total individual cost with the cost using the promotion, but it's doing it incorrectly.

Specifically, it's calculating d = c / 2, which is the promotional price per yogurt, and then comparing a * b with a * d.

But a is actually n, b is a, and c is b, based on the problem.

So, a * b would be n * a, which is the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

a * d would be n * (b / 2), which doesn't make sense because you can't buy all yogurts at the promotional price per yogurt; the promotion is only for pairs.

Furthermore, if n is odd, you can't buy all yogurts in pairs.

Hence, the logic in the code is flawed.

Let me consider an example from the problem:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Expected Output:

9

14

15

20

Let's apply the correct approach:

1. For n=2, a=5, b=9:

- Pairs: 1

- Cost: 1 * 9 + 0 * 5 = 9

- Individual cost: 2 * 5 = 10

- Minimum: 9

2. For n=3, a=5, b=9:

- Pairs: 1

- Cost: 1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14

- Individual cost: 3 * 5 = 15

- Minimum: 14

3. For n=3, a=5, b=11:

- Pairs: 1

- Cost: 1 * 11 + 1 * 5 = 16

- But according to the note, it's better to buy three yogurts for 15 burles, which suggests that the promotion might be misapplied here.

Wait, in this case, buying two yogurts for 11 and one for 5 would cost 16, but buying all three individually would cost 15, which is less. But according to the note, it's better to buy three yogurts for 15 burles, meaning that perhaps there's an implicit assumption that buying in pairs is not the only promotion, but there might be a better deal for more yogurts. However, based on the problem statement, there is only the promotion for two yogurts.

Wait, but in the note, it says "buy three yogurts for 15 burles", but according to our calculation, buying two for 11 and one for 5 would be 16, which is higher than buying three individually for 15. So, in this case, buying all three individually is cheaper than using the promotion for two and buying one individually.

Hence, the minimum cost is 15.

4. For n=4, a=5, b=11:

- Pairs: 2

- Cost: 2 * 11 + 0 * 5 = 22

- Individual cost: 4 * 5 = 20

- Minimum: 20

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 20, which aligns with our calculation.

So, in the third test case, even though buying two for 11 and one for 5 would cost 16, buying all three individually for 15 is cheaper, so the minimum is 15.

Hence, the correct approach seems to be:

- Calculate the cost using as many promotions as possible plus individual for the remainder.

- Calculate the cost of buying all individually.

- Choose the minimum of these two.

In the third test case, buying two for 11 and one for 5 gives 16, but buying all three individually gives 15, which is better.

So, the code should reflect this logic.

Now, looking back at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

d = c / 2

if a * b < a * d:

print(a * b)

else:

print(round(a * d))

Given that a is n, b is a, and c is b, then a * b is n * a, which is the cost of buying all individually.

a * d is n * (b / 2), which is not a valid cost because you can't buy all yogurts at the promotional price per yogurt; you can only buy them in pairs at price b.

Hence, this comparison is incorrect.

Moreover, in the code, it's printing round(a * d) in one case, which would round the cost, but costs should be integers, and we need to ensure that we're calculating the exact cost based on the promotions.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
