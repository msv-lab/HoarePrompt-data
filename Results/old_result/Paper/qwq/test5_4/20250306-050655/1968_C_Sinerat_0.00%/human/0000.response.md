Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions. The problem says that if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can return any one of them.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

3 5 4 9

Let's verify this:

a_1 = 3

a_2 = 5

a_3 = 4

a_4 = 9

Now, check x_2 = 2:

5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

x_3 = 4:

4 % 5 = 4, which matches.

x_4 = 1:

9 % 4 = 1, which matches.

So, this a array is valid.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output:

2 5 11

Check:

a_1 = 2

a_2 = 5

a_3 = 11

x_2 = 1:

5 % 2 = 1, correct.

x_3 = 1:

11 % 5 = 1, correct.

Okay, so the outputs given are correct.

Now, how to approach generating such an a array?

I need to choose a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

I need to ensure that a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

One way to approach this is to choose a_1 arbitrarily within the range, and then choose each subsequent a_i such that a_i â‰¡ x_i (mod a_{i-1}).

But, I need to make sure that a_i is greater than or equal to x_i, because if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, provided a_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, actually, in general, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which means that a_i can be expressed as k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >= 0.

But, since a_i should be between 1 and 10^9, I need to choose k such that k * a_{i-1} + x_i is within this range.

Also, a_i should be greater than or equal to x_i, because if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, so if x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i could be x_i. Otherwise, a_i should be k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some k.

Wait, more precisely:

- If a_{i-1} > x_i, then a_i can be x_i, since x_i < a_{i-1} implies x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

- If a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i, specifically a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 1.

So, in general, a_i can be x_i if x_i < a_{i-1}, or a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for k >= 1.

To make things simple, I can choose a_i to be a_{i-1} + x_i, which would satisfy a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, assuming a_{i-1} > 0.

Let me check this:

Suppose a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Then, a_i % a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}.

If x_i < a_{i-1}, this equals x_i, which is correct.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i % a_{i-1} is x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}, but in this case, since a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i >= 2 * a_{i-1}, which might not be optimal, but it should still satisfy the condition.

Wait, but I need a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, and if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i % a_{i-1} is x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}, which is the remainder.

But, if I set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, then a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}, which should be equal to x_i if x_i < a_{i-1}, otherwise it's x_i - a_{i-1} * floor(x_i / a_{i-1}).

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Actually, to satisfy a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, I can set a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

I need to choose k such that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

If I choose k = 0, then a_i = x_i, which is fine if x_i >= a_{i-1}, but actually, if x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i = x_i is acceptable, but if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, no. If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be such that a_i - x_i is divisible by a_{i-1}, and a_i >= x_i.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 1.

To make things simple, I can choose k = 1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This should work as long as a_i does not exceed 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 500 and x_i up to 500, the maximum a_i would be a_{i-1} + 500, starting from a_1.

If a_1 is 1, then a_2 = 1 + x_1, a_3 = a_2 + x_2, and so on.

In the worst case, a_i could be up to 1 + 500*(n-1), which for n=500 is 1 + 500*499 = 1 + 249500 = 249501, which is less than 10^9, so it's safe.

Therefore, choosing a_1 = 1 and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} for i from 2 to n should work.

But in the example, they chose a_1 = 3, and then a_2 = 5, a_3 = 4, a_4 = 9, which also works.

But according to my approach, if I choose a_1 = 1, then a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3, a_3 = 3 + 4 = 7, a_4 = 7 + 1 = 8, which would be 1, 3, 7, 8.

Let's check if this satisfies the conditions:

x_2 = 2: 3 % 1 = 0, which is not equal to 2.

Oh, wait, that doesn't work because 3 % 1 = 0, not 2.

So, my approach is flawed here.

I need to choose a_1 such that 3 % a_1 = 2.

Wait, in the first test case, a_1 = 3, a_2 = 5, a_3 = 4, a_4 = 9, and x = [2,4,1].

Wait, a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2 = 2.

a_3 % a_2 = 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3 = 4.

a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4 = 1.

So, in this case, a_1 = 3.

But in my earlier approach, if I set a_1 = 1, then a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3, but 3 % 1 = 0, which is not equal to 2.

So, my approach doesn't work in this case.

I need a better way to choose a_1.

Maybe I should choose a_1 to be greater than x_2.

Because if a_1 > x_2, then a_2 can be k * a_1 + x_2 for some k.

But I need to minimize a_2.

Wait, perhaps I can set a_1 to be x_2 + 1, or something like that.

Wait, let's think differently.

Given x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, I need to find a_1 to a_n such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i for i from 2 to n.

One way is to start from a_1 and then choose a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k >= 1, then choose a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3 for some integer m >= 1, and so on.

But this could lead to very large numbers quickly.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

They chose a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Now, 5 % 3 = 2, 4 % 5 = 4, 9 % 4 = 1.

This works.

Another possible a array could be a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=8, a_4=10.

Check:

4 % 2 = 0, which is not equal to x_2=2.

So, that doesn't work.

Another try: a_1=4, a_2=6, a_3=10, a_4=11.

6 % 4 = 2, 10 % 6 = 4, 11 % 10 = 1.

This works.

So, multiple a arrays can satisfy the conditions.

Now, how to choose a_1.

Looking at the first test case, a_1=3 works, a_1=4 works, but a_1=2 doesn't work because a_2=5 % 2=1, which is not x_2=2.

Wait, no, in my earlier attempt, a_2 should be k*a_1 + x_2.

If a_1=2, x_2=2, then a_2 could be 2*2 + 2=6, then 6 % 2=0, which is not 2.

Alternatively, a_2 could be 1*2 + 2=4, then 4 % 2=0, still not 2.

So, a_1=2 doesn't work in this case.

But a_1=3 works with a_2=5, which is 1*3 + 2=5, and 5 % 3=2, which works.

Similarly, a_1=4 works with a_2=6, but 6 % 4=2, which is correct, but earlier I thought a_2 should be k*a_1 + x_2, but in this case, a_2=6=1*4+2, which works.

Wait, but in the first test case, a_1=3, a_2=5=1*3+2, a_3=4=0*5+4, a_4=9=1*4+1.

So, it's possible to have k=0 for some steps.

But in the problem statement, it's not specified that k has to be >=1, only that a_i >=1.

So, k can be 0 as long as a_i >=1.

But in the first test case, a_3=4=0*5+4, which is fine because 4 % 5=4.

So, k can be 0.

Therefore, in general, for each i from 2 to n, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >=0.

Now, to make things simple, perhaps I can choose k=1 for all i, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see if this works for the first test case.

a_1=3, a_2=3+2=5, a_3=5+4=9, a_4=9+1=10.

Now, check:

5 % 3=2, 9 % 5=4, 10 % 9=1.

Which matches x=[2,4,1].

So, this works.

In the first test case, both the provided output and this output work.

So, choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work.

Let's check another test case.

Second test case:

n=3, x=[1,1]

Output: 2 5 11

Check:

5 % 2=1, 11 % 5=1, which matches.

But according to my approach, if I set a_1=2, a_2=2+1=3, a_3=3+1=4.

Check:

3 % 2=1, 4 % 3=1, which also matches.

So, another valid a array is [2,3,4].

Similarly, [2,5,11] is also valid.

So, multiple solutions exist.

Now, is choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i always within the limits?

Given that n <=500 and x_i <=500, starting from a_1=1, a_2=1+ x_1 <=501, a_3<=501+500=1001, and so on, up to a_n <=1 +500*(n-1). For n=500, a_n <=1 +500*499=249501, which is less than 10^9, so it's safe.

But in the first test case, they chose a_1=3, and then a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9, which also works.

So, choosing a_1 arbitrarily and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i works.

But, to make it efficient and to avoid any issues, perhaps I can choose a_1 to be a value that is greater than or equal to the maximum x_i.

Wait, in the first test case, x=[2,4,1], max x_i is 4.

If I choose a_1=4, then a_2=4+2=6, a_3=6+4=10, a_4=10+1=11.

Check:

6%4=2, 10%6=4, 11%10=1, which matches.

Another valid solution.

Alternatively, if I choose a_1=5, then a_2=5+2=7, a_3=7+4=11, a_4=11+1=12.

Check:

7%5=2, 11%7=4, 12%11=1, which matches.

So, choosing a_1 >= max(x_i) seems to work.

But in the first test case, they chose a_1=3, which is less than max(x_i)=4, and it still worked because a_2=5, which is greater than a_1=3.

Wait, but in that case, a_3=4 < a_2=5, but 4 %5=4, which is x_3=4, so it's okay.

So, even if a_i < a_{i-1}, it's fine, as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Therefore, choosing a_1 to be any value between 1 and max(x_i), or greater, seems to work.

But to make it simple, choosing a_1 to be max(x_i) +1 ensures that a_1 > x_i for all x_i, which might simplify things.

Wait, but in the first test case, x=[2,4,1], max(x_i)=4, so a_1=5 would work, as shown earlier.

But in the second test case, x=[1,1], max(x_i)=1, so a_1=2 would work.

Indeed, in the sample output, a_1=2 is used.

So, choosing a_1 = max(x_i) +1 seems to be a safe choice.

But in the first test case, a_1=3 works even though max(x_i)=4, because a_2=5 > a_1=3, and so on.

So, it's possible to choose a_1 less than max(x_i), but need to ensure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

To make it simple, perhaps choosing a_1 to be a large enough number, say 500, which is greater than or equal to max(x_i), would work.

But in the first test case, a_1=3 works with a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

So, it's possible to have a_1 less than max(x_i), as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Therefore, choosing a_1 arbitrarily and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work in general.

Now, in the program given, it sets a_1 to 500, and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Given that x_i <=500, and n<=500, a_i will be at most 500 + 500*(n-1) = 500*n, which for n=500 is 250,000, which is less than 10^9, so it's safe.

But in the first test case, a_1=3 works, and a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i gives a valid a array.

So, the approach in the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's check if there are any cases where this approach might fail.

Suppose n=2, x=[500]

Choose a_1=500, a_2=500 +500=1000.

Check: 1000 %500=0, which should equal x_2=500.

But 1000 %500=0, not 500.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, this is a problem.

So, in this case, a_2 = a_1 + x_1 =500 +500=1000, and 1000 %500=0, which is not equal to x_2=500.

So, this approach fails in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this particular test case.

So, I need to think differently.

In this case, I need a_2 % a_1 =500, with a_1=500.

But 500 %500=0, which is not 500.

So, a_2 cannot be 1000 in this case.

Wait, actually, a_2 should be k*a_1 + x_2.

So, a_2 = k*500 +500.

But 500 %500=0, which is not 500.

Wait, no, a_2 % a_1 = (k*500 +500) %500 = (k*500 %500 +500%500) = (0 +0)=0, which is not 500.

So, this approach doesn't work when x_i is equal to a_{i-1}.

Wait, in this case, x_2=500, and a_1=500.

So, a_2 %500=500, but 500 %500=0, which is not 500.

So, in this case, I need a_2 to be something like 1000 +500=1500, but 1500 %500=0 again.

Wait, no, 1500 %500=0.

Wait, actually, to have a_2 % a_1 =500, with a_1=500, I need a_2 to be 500 + k*500 for k>=1.

But then a_2 %500=0, which is not 500.

So, in this case, there is no solution because 500 %500=0, which can never be equal to 500.

Wait, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists such an array a.

Wait, in this case, if a_1=500, and x_2=500, then a_2 must satisfy a_2 %500=500.

But a_2 %500=500 would only be possible if a_2 =500 + k*500 +500, but that still gives a_2 %500=0.

Wait, no, 500 %500=0, 1000 %500=0, 1500 %500=0, and so on.

So, it seems impossible to have a_2 %500=500.

Wait, but 500 %500=0, which is not 500.

So, perhaps in this case, I need to choose a_1 < x_2.

Wait, but x_2=500, and a_1 <500.

Let's say a_1=499.

Then, a_2 can be k*499 +500.

Choose k=1, a_2=499 +500=999.

Then, 999 %499=999 - 499*1=499*1=499, which is not 500.

Wait, but 499*2=998, 999 -998=1.

Wait, no, 999 %499=999 -499*2=1.

So, 1 !=500.

Wait, so this doesn't work either.

Wait, maybe choose a higher k.

a_2 = k*499 +500.

Let k=2, a_2=2
