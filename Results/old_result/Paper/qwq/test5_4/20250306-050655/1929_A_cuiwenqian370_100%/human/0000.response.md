Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example output.

Wait a minute, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. But if I arrange it differently, say [1, 3, 2], the beauty would be (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, rearranging it in ascending order gives me a higher beauty value.

Let me try another arrangement, like [2, 1, 3]. Then, beauty is (1-2) + (3-1) = (-1) + 2 = 1, which is less than 2. So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty.

Wait, but in the problem, it says to rearrange the array in any way to maximize the beauty. So, maybe I need to sort the array in ascending order to get the maximum beauty.

But let's think about what the sum actually represents. The sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is actually just a telescoping sum. Let's see:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

Most terms cancel out, and we're left with an - a1.

So, sum = an - a1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, no matter how I arrange the array, the sum of differences is just the last element minus the first element.

If that's the case, then to maximize this sum, I need to maximize an - a1. That means making an as large as possible and a1 as small as possible.

So, to maximize an - a1, I should arrange the array such that an is the maximum value and a1 is the minimum value.

So, if I sort the array in ascending order, a1 is the smallest and an is the largest, so an - a1 is maximized.

Wait, but in the first example, an - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the beauty.

In the second example, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0, which matches the output.

In the third example, array is [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. Sorting it gives [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. So, an - a1 = 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the output.

So, it seems that the beauty is simply an - a1, and to maximize it, I need to sort the array in ascending order and take the last element minus the first element.

Wait, but in the fourth example, array is [3, 4, 3, 3]. Sorting it gives [3, 3, 3, 4]. So, an - a1 = 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the output.

And in the fifth example, [2, 1], sorting gives [1, 2], so 2 - 1 = 1, which matches the output.

So, it seems that the beauty is always an - a1 when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

So, I can simplify the function to just find the maximum and minimum elements in the array and subtract them.

Wait, but in the program provided, it sorts the array and then computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

But according to my reasoning, since the sum telescopes to an - a1, and in the program, it's using abs(array[i] - array[i-1]), which, when the array is sorted in ascending order, is just array[i] - array[i-1], so the sum would be an - a1.

So, in this case, the program is correct because it sorts the array and then computes the sum of differences, which is an - a1.

But wait, in the program, it's using abs(array[i] - array[i-1]), which is necessary in case the array is not sorted in ascending order. But since the array is sorted in func_1, the difference array[i] - array[i-1] is always non-negative, so abs is redundant.

But it doesn't hurt, and it still gives the correct result.

So, the program is correct.

Wait, but let's check if there are any cases where this might not hold.

Suppose the array is [5, 1, 3, 2]. Sorting it gives [1, 2, 3, 5]. Sum of differences is (2-1) + (3-2) + (5-3) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is an - a1 = 5 - 1 = 4. So, it holds.

Another example: [1, 1, 1, 1]. Sorted array: [1, 1, 1, 1]. Sum of differences: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is an - a1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Correct.

Array with negative numbers: [-1, -3, 0, 2]. Sorted: [-3, -1, 0, 2]. Sum of differences: (-1 - (-3)) + (0 - (-1)) + (2 - 0) = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5, which is an - a1 = 2 - (-3) = 5. Correct.

So, it seems to hold for various cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "rearrange its elements in any way" to maximize the beauty, and the beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

According to my reasoning, this sum is equal to an - a1, where an is the largest element and a1 is the smallest element in the array, when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

So, in func_1, instead of sorting the array and summing the differences, I could simply find the max and min elements and subtract them, which would be more efficient.

But the given program still works correctly, even though it's not the most efficient way.

So, in terms of correctness, it's fine.

Also, the program reads all input at once, processes it, and outputs the results, which is suitable for competitive programming where multiple test cases are provided in a single input.

Therefore, I can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]

**Correctness: True**
