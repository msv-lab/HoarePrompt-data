Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board, and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers. For example, if n is 12, the numbers become 1 to 12, then their digit sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, and the sum is 51. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line is an integer t, which is the number of test cases, and then each of the next t lines contains an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5. I need to output the sum for each n.

First, I need to think about how to compute the sum of the digit sums from 1 to n efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, which means I need a fast way to compute this for each test case.

One straightforward way is to precompute the sum for all values up to the maximum n, which is 2*10^5, and then just answer each test case in O(1) time by printing the precomputed value for each n.

So, I can create an array where values[i] represents the sum of digit sums from 1 to i. Then, for each test case, I just need to print values[n].

To fill this array, I can iterate from 1 to 2*10^5, and for each i, calculate the sum of its digits and add it to the previous sum.

Let me think about how to calculate the sum of digits of a number efficiently. Since n can be up to 2*10^5, which is 6 digits, it's not too bad. I can convert the number to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum them up.

But is there a better way without converting to a string? I could use modulo and division to extract each digit, but for numbers up to 6 digits, the string method might be simpler and efficient enough.

Let me try to write a function to compute the sum of digits of a number.

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

while n > 0:

s += n % 10

n = n // 10

return s

Alternatively, using str(n):

def digit_sum(n):

return sum(int(x) for x in str(n))

I think the string method might be faster in Python because string operations are optimized.

Now, back to filling the array. I'll initialize values[0] = 0, and then for i from 1 to 2*10^5, values[i] = values[i-1] + digit_sum(i).

This way, I can compute the prefix sums, and for each test case, just output values[n].

Let me think about the time complexity. Computing digit_sum for one n is O(d), where d is the number of digits in n, which is at most 6. So for 2*10^5 numbers, it's O(2*10^5 * 6) = O(1.2*10^6), which should be acceptable.

Then, for t test cases, each answered in O(1) time, total time should be fine within the 0.5 seconds per test case limit, especially since t can be up to 10^4, but each test case is just an array lookup.

Wait, but 10^4 test cases each with potentially up to 2*10^5 operations, but since the operations are precomputed, actually, the precomputation is done once, and then each test case is just a lookup.

So, total time should be acceptable.

Let me think about space. I need an array of size 2*10^5 + 1, which is manageable.

Now, let's consider some examples to verify.

For n=12, as given, the sum should be 51.

Let me compute it manually:

1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9, 10:1, 11:2, 12:3.

Sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51. Correct.

Another example, n=1:

Just 1, sum is 1. Correct.

n=2:

1:1, 2:2, sum is 3. Wait, but in the problem's example output for n=2, it's 3, which matches 1+2=3. Okay.

n=3:

1:1, 2:2, 3:3, sum is 6. Matches the example output.

n=1434, sum is 18465.

n=2024, sum is 28170.

n=200000, sum is 4600002.

I don't have to verify these manually, but I can assume they are correct as per the problem statement.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it matches this approach.

The program is:

def func_1():

inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1

t = int(input())

values = [0] * inf

for i in range(1, inf):

sum_value_digits = 0

for x in str(i):

sum_value_digits += int(x)

values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits

for _ in range(t):

value = int(input())

print(values[value])

So, it defines func_1, sets inf to 2*10^5 +1, reads t, initializes a list values of size inf with zeros.

Then, for each i from 1 to inf-1, it computes the sum of digits of i by converting i to a string, iterating through each character, converting it back to int, and summing them up. Then, it sets values[i] to values[i-1] + sum_value_digits, which is accumulating the sum of digit sums up to i.

After precomputing this array, it reads t test cases, reads each n, and prints values[n].

This matches exactly the approach I was thinking of.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
