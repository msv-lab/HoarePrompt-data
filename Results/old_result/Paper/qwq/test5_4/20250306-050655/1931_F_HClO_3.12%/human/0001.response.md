Alright, I've got this problem to solve. There are n people in a chat, ordered by their activity, but each person sees themselves at the top of the list. So, for example, if the actual order is [2, 3, 1, 4], then:

- User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4]

- User 2 sees [2, 3, 1, 4]

- User 3 sees [3, 2, 1, 4]

- User 4 sees [4, 2, 3, 1]

K people posted screenshots of the order they saw, and I need to determine if there's a single order that could correspond to all these screenshots.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an actual order of participants, but each participant sees themselves at the top, followed by the actual order. So, for any participant X, their view is [X, followed by the rest of the actual order without X].

Given k such views (screenshots), I need to check if there exists one actual order that could produce all these views.

Let me think about the properties of these views.

1. Each view has the participant themselves at the top.

2. The rest of the list should match the actual order, minus that participant.

So, if I have multiple views, I need to see if they are consistent with a single actual order.

Let's consider the example in the problem:

n=4, k=4

Views:

- [1,2,3,4]

- [2,3,1,4]

- [3,2,1,4]

- [4,2,3,1]

I need to check if there's a single actual order that can produce all these views.

Let's try to find the actual order.

Looking at the first view: [1,2,3,4]. So, participant 1 sees themselves first, followed by 2,3,4. So, the actual order should be [2,3,1,4].

Wait, but according to the problem, user 1 sees [1,2,3,4], which implies that the actual order is [2,3,1,4].

Now, let's check with the second view: [2,3,1,4]. So, participant 2 sees themselves first, followed by 3,1,4. If the actual order is [2,3,1,4], then removing 2, it should be [3,1,4], which matches.

Similarly, third view: [3,2,1,4]. Participant 3 sees themselves first, followed by 2,1,4. If actual order is [2,3,1,4], removing 3, it should be [2,1,4], which matches.

Fourth view: [4,2,3,1]. Participant 4 sees themselves first, followed by 2,3,1. If actual order is [2,3,1,4], removing 4, it should be [2,3,1], which matches.

So, in this case, the actual order [2,3,1,4] is consistent with all the views.

Now, let's consider another example from the problem:

n=6, k=2

Views:

- [1,3,5,2,4,6]

- [6,3,5,2,1,4]

So, first view: participant 1 sees [1,3,5,2,4,6]. So, actual order should be [3,5,2,4,6,1].

Second view: participant 6 sees [6,3,5,2,1,4]. If actual order is [3,5,2,4,6,1], then removing 6, it should be [3,5,2,4,1], which matches the second view.

So, in this case, it's consistent.

Now, another example:

n=3, m=3

Views:

- [1,2,3]

- [2,3,1]

- [3,2,1]

Let's see:

First view: participant 1 sees [1,2,3], so actual order should be [2,3,1].

Second view: participant 2 sees [2,3,1], which matches the actual order minus 2: [3,1], which is consistent.

Third view: participant 3 sees [3,2,1], which matches the actual order minus 3: [2,1], consistent.

So, this should be "YES".

Wait, but in the sample input, there's a case where the answer is "NO". Let's look at that.

n=5, m=4

Views:

- [3,5,1,4,2]

- [2,5,1,4,3]

- [1,5,4,3,2]

- [5,1,4,3,2]

I need to check if there's a single actual order that can produce all these views.

Looking at the first view: [3,5,1,4,2], so participant 3 sees [3,5,1,4,2]. So, actual order should be [5,1,4,2,3].

Second view: [2,5,1,4,3], participant 2 sees [2,5,1,4,3]. If actual order is [5,1,4,2,3], removing 2, it should be [5,1,4,3], which matches.

Third view: [1,5,4,3,2], participant 1 sees [1,5,4,3,2]. If actual order is [5,1,4,2,3], removing 1, it should be [5,4,2,3], but the view shows [5,4,3,2], which doesn't match. So, inconsistency here.

Fourth view: [5,1,4,3,2], participant 5 sees [5,1,4,3,2]. If actual order is [5,1,4,2,3], removing 5, it should be [1,4,2,3], but the view shows [1,4,3,2], which doesn't match.

So, in this case, it's "NO".

From these examples, I need to find a way to generalize this check for any n and k.

Approach:

1. For each view, determine what the actual order would be if that view is considered.

2. Check if all these inferred actual orders are consistent with each other.

But doing this directly might be inefficient, especially since n and k can be up to 2e5, and n*k <= 2e5.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me think in terms of permutations and consistency.

Each view gives a permutation of the participants, with the participant themselves at the top.

So, if I have the actual order as A = [a1, a2, ..., an], and a participant X sees [X, followed by A without X], then for each view, I can get a permutation P, where P[0] is the participant themselves, and P[1:] is A without P[0].

So, for each view P, A should be equal to [P[0]] + [A[i] for i in range(n) if A[i] != P[0]].

Wait, that seems circular.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two views, P and Q.

Then, P[0] should be in position 1 in P, and in position (index of P[0] in A) in Q.

Similarly, Q[0] should be in position 1 in Q, and in position (index of Q[0] in A) in P.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the relative positions.

Actually, for two views P and Q:

- P[0] should be in position (index of P[0] in A) in Q.

- Q[0] should be in position (index of Q[0] in A) in P.

Wait, perhaps I need to construct a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the required positions.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of merging the permutations.

Wait, perhaps I can fix one view as the reference and map others to it.

Let me consider the first view as the reference.

Letâ€™s say the first view is P, so P[0] is the participant who took the screenshot, and the actual order A is [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]].

Wait, no. Actually, if P is the view of participant X, then A should be [X] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != X].

But since X is P[0], A should be [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]].

So, for the first view, I can directly get A.

Then, for each subsequent view Q, I need to check if Q matches the A I have.

But wait, A is determined by the first view, and I need to verify that all other views are consistent with that A.

But in the problem, it's possible that the first view is not necessarily the "correct" one, as all views could be correct but refer to different A's.

Wait, no. Each view corresponds to a different participant, and they all should correspond to the same A.

So, perhaps I can fix one A based on one view and check consistency with others.

Let me try that.

Take the first view P, set A = [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]].

Then, for each subsequent view Q, check if Q[0] is in position 1, and the rest of Q matches A without Q[0].

Wait, but A is determined from the first view, which might not be correct if another view contradicts it.

I need a better way.

Maybe I can think in terms of pairwise consistency.

Take the first two views, determine the possible A, and then check consistency with the remaining views.

Let's consider two views P and Q.

From P, A should be [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]].

From Q, A should be [Q[0]] + [x for x in Q[1:] if x != Q[0]].

So, set A_P = [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]]

A_Q = [Q[0]] + [x for x in Q[1:] if x != Q[0]]

Now, for these two to be consistent, A_P should be equal to A_Q.

If A_P == A_Q, then that's fine.

If not, I need to see if there's a way to reconcile them.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that all authors are different, so P[0] != Q[0].

So, in A_P, P[0] is at position 1, and in A_Q, Q[0] is at position 1.

So, in the actual A, P[0] should be at position (index of P[0] in A), and Q[0] at position (index of Q[0] in A).

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two views P and Q.

In P, P[0] sees himself first, followed by the rest of A without P[0].

Similarly, in Q, Q[0] sees himself first, followed by the rest of A without Q[0].

So, the rest of P (P[1:]) should be equal to A without P[0], and similarly, Q[1:] should be equal to A without Q[0].

So, A = [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]]

Similarly, A = [Q[0]] + [x for x in Q[1:] if x != Q[0]]

So, for consistency, [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]] should equal [Q[0]] + [x for x in Q[1:] if x != Q[0]]

Let me denote this as A_P and A_Q.

So, A_P = [P[0]] + [x for x in P[1:] if x != P[0]]

A_Q = [Q[0]] + [x for x in Q[1:] if x != Q[0]]

For consistency, A_P should equal A_Q.

If A_P == A_Q, then fine.

If not, I need to see if there's a way to merge them.

But in the example above, when n=4, k=4, A_P for P=[1,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4], A_Q for Q=[2,3,1,4] is [2,3,1,4], which are different.

But in reality, they correspond to the same A=[2,3,1,4].

Wait, no.

Wait, according to the earlier reasoning, for P=[1,2,3,4], A_P=[1,2,3,4]

For Q=[2,3,1,4], A_Q=[2,3,1,4]

But in reality, the actual A is [2,3,1,4], which matches A_Q, but not A_P.

So, in this case, A_P != A_Q, but they can still correspond to the same actual A if A_P and A_Q are adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the relative positions.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two views P and Q.

I can align them by finding where P[0] is in Q and where Q[0] is in P.

Let me try that.

Take P=[1,2,3,4], Q=[2,3,1,4]

In P, P[0]=1, and in Q, Q[0]=2.

In Q, P[0]=1 is at position 3.

In P, Q[0]=2 is at position 2.

So, in the actual A, Q[0]=2 should be at position 1, and P[0]=1 should be at position 3.

Wait, no.

Wait, in Q's view, P[0]=1 is at position 3, which means in the actual A, P[0]=1 is at position 3.

Similarly, in P's view, Q[0]=2 is at position 2, which means in the actual A, Q[0]=2 is at position 2.

Wait, this seems contradictory.

In Q's view, P[0]=1 is at position 3, so in actual A, 1 should be at position 3.

In P's view, Q[0]=2 is at position 2, so in actual A, 2 should be at position 2.

But in actual A, 2 is at position 2 and 1 is at position 3, which matches.

So, no contradiction.

Then, looking at the rest of the elements, they should be in the same order in both views, except for the positions of P[0] and Q[0].

Wait, in P: [1,2,3,4]

In Q: [2,3,1,4]

Removing P[0]=1 from Q's view, it's [2,3,1,4] without 2 (Q[0]), which is [3,1,4]

Similarly, in A_P, A_P = [1,2,3,4]

Removing Q[0]=2 from A_P, it should be [1,3,4], but in Q's view, it's [3,1,4], which is a permutation of [1,3,4], but not the same order.

Wait, but in the problem, the order should be the same.

Wait, no, in Q's view, after Q[0]=2, it's [3,1,4], which should match A without Q[0]=2, which is [1,3,4].

But [3,1,4] is a permutation of [1,3,4], but not the same order.

So, this seems inconsistent.

But in reality, in the example, it's consistent because A is [2,3,1,4], and Q's view is [2,3,1,4], which matches A.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, A_P is [1,2,3,4], which is different from A_Q=[2,3,1,4].

So, how can they both be consistent?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for two views P and Q:

- P[1:] should be equal to A without P[0]

- Q[1:] should be equal to A without Q[0]

So, A without P[0] should be equal to Q[1:]

And A without Q[0] should be equal to P[1:]

But A without P[0] is Q[1:], and A without Q[0] is P[1:]

So, if I take Q[1:] and insert Q[0] at the position where P[1:].index(Q[0]) + 1, it should match P[1:].

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the relative positions of P[0] and Q[0] in each other's views.

Let me try that.

In P's view, P[0] is at position 1, and Q[0] is at position pos_in_P.

In Q's view, Q[0] is at position 1, and P[0] is at position pos_in_Q.

Then, in the actual A, P[0] should be at position pos_in_Q, and Q[0] should be at position pos_in_P.

So, I can set up equations for positions.

Let me denote pos_A(X) as the position of X in A.

Then:

pos_A(P[0]) = pos_in_Q

pos_A(Q[0]) = pos_in_P

Similarly, for more views, I can set up more equations.

Then, I need to check if these equations are consistent.

This seems like a system of equations that I need to solve.

But implementing this directly might be too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me think about it in terms of graph.

I can model this as a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the required positions.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a permutation graph.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for two views P and Q:

- P[0] is at position 1 in P, and in position pos_in_Q in Q.

- Q[0] is at position 1 in Q, and in position pos_in_P in P.

So, in the actual order A, P[0] is at position pos_in_Q, and Q[0] is at position pos_in_P.

Then, I can set up a graph where there is an edge from P[0] to Q[0] with weight pos_in_Q, and from Q[0] to P[0] with weight pos_in_P.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of topological order.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look at the code provided and see if it makes sense.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if m == 1:

input()

print('yes')

continue

(a1, *l1) = map(int, input().split())

(a2, *l2) = map(int, input().split())

l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]

l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]

if l11 != l22:

for _ in range(m - 2):

input()

print('no')

continue

idx1 = idx2 = -1

p1 = p2 = 0

for i in range(n - 1):

if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:

break

if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:

if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:

idx1 = idx2 = i

break

else:

if l1[i + p1] == a2:

idx1 = i

p1 = 1

else:

idx2 = i

p2 = 1

if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:

break

val = []

if idx1 < idx2:

l2.insert(idx1, a2)

l = l2

elif idx1 > idx2:

l1.insert(idx2, a1)

l = l1

else:

if m == 2:

print('yes')

continue

(a3, *l3) = map(int, input().split())

if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):

l1.insert(idx2, a1)

l = l1

else:

l2.insert(idx1, a2)

l = l2

val.append((a3, l3))

m -= 1

for _ in range(m - 2):

(a3, *l3) = map(int, input().split())

val.append((a3, l3))

for (a3, l3) in val:

if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:

print('no')

break

else:

print('yes')

So, the code handles m=1 directly by printing 'yes'.

Then, for m>=2, it reads the first two views, l1 and l2.

It removes a2 from l1 and a1 from l2, and checks if the remaining lists are equal.

If not, it prints 'no'.

If they are equal, it looks for the positions where a2 and a1 appear in l1 and l2 respectively.

Then, it decides where to insert a2 or a1 to make the lists consistent.

If m>2, it reads the remaining views and checks if they match the inferred actual order.

Finally, it prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the consistency.

This seems like an attempt to merge the views into a single actual order.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the example where n=4, k=4:

Views:

[1,2,3,4]

[2,3,1,4]

[3,2,1,4]

[4,2,3,1]

According to the code:

m=4 >=2

a1=1, l1=[2,3,4]

a2=2, l2=[3,1,4]

l11 = [2,3,4] without a2=2: [3,4]

l22 = [3,1,4] without a1=1: [3,4]

So, l11 == l22: [3,4]

Then, idx1 and idx2 are set based on where a2=2 and a1=1 differ in l1 and l2.

In l1: [2,3,4], in l2: [3,1,4]

At i=0: l1[0]=2 != l2[0]=3

l1[0]=2 == a2=2, so idx1=0, p1=1

At i=1: l1[1]=3 != l2[1]=1

l1[1]=3 != a2=2, and l2[1]=1 != a1=1 (wait, a1=1)

Wait, l2[1]=1 == a1=1, but a1 is being removed, so l22 = [3,4]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

In the code, l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2], which is [2,3,4] without 2: [3,4]

Similarly, l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1], which is [3,1,4] without 1: [3,4]

So, l11 == l22: [3,4]

Then, idx1 and idx2 are set where l1[i+p1] != l2[i+p2]

Initially, p1=p2=0

At i=0:

l1[0]=2 != l2[0]=3

l1[0]=2 == a2=2, so idx1=0, p1=1

At i=1:

l1[1]=3 != l2[1]=1

l1[1]=3 != a2=2, and l2[1]=1 == a1=1, so p2=1

At i=2:

l1[2]=4 == l2[2]=4

So, idx1=0, idx2=1

Since idx1 < idx2, l2.insert(idx1, a2)=insert 2 at position
