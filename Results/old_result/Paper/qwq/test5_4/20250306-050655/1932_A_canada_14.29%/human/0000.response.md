Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this path with n cells, and each cell can be empty ('.'), have thorns ('*'), or have a coin ('@'). I start at the first cell, which is always empty, and I can move one or two cells at a time. But I can't land on a cell with thorns. If I land on a cell with a coin, I pick it up. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible.

First, I need to understand the movement rules. I can move one or two cells forward, as long as the destination cell doesn't have thorns. So, from my current position, I have options to move to the next cell or skip one cell, but only if those cells don't have thorns.

I need to maximize the number of coins collected. This sounds like an optimization problem, probably best solved with dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Let me think about dynamic programming. I can define dp[i] as the maximum number of coins I can collect up to cell i. To compute dp[i], I need to consider whether I came from cell i-1 or cell i-2, provided those moves are legal (i.e., I didn't land on thorns).

So, for each cell i from 1 to n-1:

- If s[i] is '*', then dp[i] = -infinity or some invalid value, since I can't land there.

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

The base cases are:

- dp[0] = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

- dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*' else dp[0])

Wait, s[1] can't be '*', because if it is '*', I can't land there directly from s[0]. So, dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else dp[0]

Actually, since s[1] can be '*', but I might reach it by jumping over it from s[0] to s[2], but no, moving two steps from s[0] would land on s[2]. So, I need to be careful.

Let me adjust the dp definitions.

Actually, dp[i] should be the maximum coins collectable up to and including cell i, provided I end at cell i and it doesn't have thorns. But if s[i] has thorns, then dp[i] should be invalid.

Wait, but I can skip over thorns. So, if s[i] has thorns, I just can't land there, but I can jump over it.

Let me think differently. dp[i] represents the maximum coins collectable up to cell i, ending at cell i only if it doesn't have thorns.

If s[i] is '*', then dp[i] is invalid, meaning I can't end there, so any move to i is invalid.

Otherwise, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Wait, but I need to ensure that the move to i is valid, meaning that s[i] is not '*'.

Wait, s[i] can't be '*' if I'm landing there, so dp[i] is only defined when s[i] != '*'.

In that case, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Yes, that makes sense.

For example:

- dp[0] = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

- dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else dp[0]

Wait, but s[1] could be '*', in which case dp[1] is invalid.

Wait, no, s[1] can be '*', but I might not land there if I choose to jump over it.

Wait, actually, in dp[i], I'm considering landing at cell i, provided it doesn't have thorns.

So, for each i from 0 to n-1:

- If s[i] == '*', then dp[i] is invalid (or we can set it to -infinity or something)

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

With base cases:

- dp[0] = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

- dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else dp[0] if s[1] != '*', else invalid

Wait, but in the dp formula, dp[i] is only defined when s[i] != '*'.

So, in code, I need to handle that.

Finally, the answer will be the maximum dp[i] for all i where dp[i] is defined.

Wait, no. Since I have to start at cell 0 and move forward, the maximum coins collected would be dp[k] where k is the last cell I can reach.

But actually, I can stop at any cell along the path, as long as I collect coins along the way. So, the maximum coins collected would be the maximum dp[i] for all i from 0 to n-1, provided dp[i] is defined.

But in the problem, it seems that I have to go from cell 0 to some cell, collecting coins along the way, with the option to stop at any cell, but I have to start at cell 0.

So, the maximum coins collected would be the maximum dp[i] for all i from 0 to n-1.

Wait, but in the dp definition, dp[i] is the maximum coins collectable up to and including cell i, provided I end at cell i without landing on thorns.

But perhaps I should allow dp[i] to be the maximum coins collectable considering all possible paths that reach cell i without landing on thorns.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to allow dp[i] to be the maximum coins collectable if I land at cell i, which doesn't have thorns.

Then, dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in possible previous positions) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0), where possible previous positions are j such that j = i-1 or j = i-2, and s[j] != '*'.

But this seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, I can use the dp approach as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0), but only if s[i] != '*'.

Otherwise, dp[i] is invalid.

In code, I can set dp[i] to -1 or something to indicate invalid.

But then, when computing dp[i], I need to make sure that i-1 and i-2 are valid positions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to initialize dp[0], and then iterate from 1 to n-1, computing dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], provided that s[i] != '*'.

Let's try to write down the dp transitions more clearly.

Initialize dp[0] = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

If n == 1, then the answer is dp[0]

Else, proceed.

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else dp[0] if s[1] != '*', else -1

Wait, but s[1] can be '*', in which case dp[1] is invalid.

So, in general, for i from 1 to n-1:

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = -1

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

But wait, for i=1, dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + (1 if s[1]=='@' else 0)

dp[-1] is undefined, so we should consider dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] only if they are valid.

So, perhaps initialize dp[-1] = 0, dp[0] = 1 if s[0]=='@' else 0

Then, for i from 1 to n-1:

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = -1

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i]=='@' else 0)

Then, the answer is the maximum dp[i] for all i from 0 to n-1 where dp[i] is not -1.

Wait, but in the problem, I have to start at cell 0 and move forward, so I can't just pick any dp[i], I have to consider the path from 0 to i.

Actually, dp[i] represents the maximum coins collectable ending at cell i, which is reachable from cell 0 without landing on thorns.

So, the answer should be dp[k], where k is the farthest cell I can reach.

But, in the problem, it seems that I can stop at any cell along the path, not necessarily the farthest one, as long as it's reachable from cell 0.

So, the maximum coins collected would be the maximum dp[i] for all i from 0 to n-1, provided dp[i] is valid.

But, in practice, since dp[i] is built upon dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], it should reflect the maximum coins collectable up to cell i.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for each dp[i], it's reachable from cell 0.

In the dp transition, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + (1 if s[i]=='@' else 0), provided s[i] != '*'

This ensures that to reach cell i, I'm coming from either i-1 or i-2, both of which are valid positions.

So, this seems correct.

Let me test this dp approach with the first example.

Example 1:

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

Indices: 0: ., 1: @, 2: @, 3: *, 4: @, 5: ., 6: *, 7: *, 8: @, 9: @

Compute dp[i]:

dp[0] = 1 (since s[0] == '.')

dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3

dp[3] = -1 (since s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1 = max(-1, 3) + 1 = 4

dp[5] = max(dp[4], dp[3]) + 0 = max(4, -1) + 0 = 4

dp[6] = -1 (since s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = -1 (since s[7] == '*')

dp[8] = max(dp[7], dp[6]) + 1 = max(-1, -1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

dp[9] = max(dp[8], dp[7]) + 1 = max(1, -1) + 1 = 2

So, dp array: [1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 4, -1, -1, 1, 2]

The maximum dp[i] is 4, which matches the first sample output.

Good.

Second example:

n = 5

s = .@@@@

dp[0] = 1 (s[0] == '.')

dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3

dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1 = max(3, 2) + 1 = 4

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1 = max(4, 3) + 1 = 5

But the sample output for this case is 4, but according to this dp approach, it's 5.

Wait, but looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

3

10

.@@*@.**@@

5

.@@@@

15

.@@..@***..@@@*

Output:

3

4

3

Wait, in the second test case, n=5, s=.'@@@@', output is 4, but dp approach gives 5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, in the input, it's:

3

10

.@@*@.**@@

5

.@@@@

15

.@@..@***..@@@*

Output:

3

4

3

Wait, but in the second test case, n=5, s=.'@@@@', and output is 4, but dp says 5.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that I can't land on a cell with thorns, but in this case, all cells are '@', which are coins, so I can land on them.

Wait, maybe I can't land on a cell if it's blocked by thorns in between.

Wait, but in this case, there are no thorns, so dp should give 5, but sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, no, sample output is 3, 4, 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to collect as many coins as possible without necessarily going to the end.

Wait, but in the dp approach, dp[i] is the maximum coins collectable up to cell i.

In the second test case, n=5, s=.'@@@@', output is 4.

But according to dp, it's 5.

Wait, maybe I have to stop at cell n-1, but in the problem, it says "you can move one or two cells along the path", so I can choose to stop at any cell, not necessarily the last one.

Wait, but in the second test case, the maximum coins should be 5, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I can't land on a cell with thorns, but in this case, there are no thorns, so it should be 5.

Wait, maybe I can't jump over cells with thorns, but in this case, there are no thorns.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, the sample input is:

3

10

.@@*@.**@@

5

.@@@@

15

.@@..@***..@@@*

Output:

3

4

3

Wait, in the second test case, n=5, s=.'@@@@', output is 4.

But according to dp, it's 5.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "the first cell is empty", which it is '.'.

So, dp[0] = 1 if s[0]=='@', else 0. Here, s[0]=='.' -> dp[0]=0

Wait, no, in my earlier assumption, dp[0] = 1 if s[0]=='@', else 0.

But in the problem, "It is guaranteed that the first cell is empty", so s[0]=='.'.

So, dp[0]=0.

Then:

dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + 1 = max(0, 0) + 1 = 1

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1 = max(3, 2) + 1 = 4

So, dp array: [0,1,2,3,4]

Maximum dp[i] = 4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly set dp[0]=1, but since s[0]=='.' and not '@', dp[0]=0.

So, correct dp is [0,1,2,3,4], maximum is 4, matching sample output.

I must have misremembered s[0].

So, dp[0] = 1 if s[0]=='@', else 0.

In this case, s[0]=='.' -> dp[0]=0.

Then, dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + (1 if s[1]=='@' else 0) = max(0,0) + 1 = 1

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(1,0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1 = max(2,1) + 1 = 3

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1 = max(3,2) + 1 = 4

Yes, so maximum is 4.

I must have misremembered s[0].

So, dp approach seems correct.

Third test case:

n=15

s=.'.@@..@***..@@@*'

Let's compute dp[i]:

dp[0] = 0 (s[0]=='.')

dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[-1]) + (1 if s[1]=='@' else 0) = max(0,0) + 1 = 1

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(1,0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 0 = max(2,1) + 0 = 2

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 0 = max(2,2) + 0 = 2

dp[5] = max(dp[4], dp[3]) + 1 = max(2,2) + 1 = 3

dp[6] = -1 (s[6]=='*')

dp[7] = -1 (s[7]=='*')

dp[8] = -1 (s[8]=='*')

dp[9] = max(dp[8], dp[7]) + 0 = max(-1, -1) + 0 = -1 + 0 = -1

dp[10] = max(dp[9], dp[8]) + 0 = max(-1, -1) + 0 = -1

dp[11] = max(dp[10], dp[9]) + 1 = max(-1, -1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

dp[12] = max(dp[11], dp[10]) + 1 = max(1, -1) + 1 = 2

dp[13] = max(dp[12], dp[11]) + 1 = max(2,1) + 1 = 3

dp[14] = max(dp[13], dp[12]) + 1 = max(3,2) + 1 = 4

But in this case, dp[14]=4, but sample output is 3.

Wait, but according to dp, dp[14]=4.

Wait, perhaps I can't reach cell 14 because there are thorns in between.

Wait, looking back at s:

s = '.@@..@***..@@@*'

Indices:

0: ., 1: @, 2: @, 3: ., 4: ., 5: @, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: ., 10: ., 11: @, 12: @, 13: @, 14: *

dp[0] = 0

dp[1] = max(0,0) + 1 = 1

dp[2] = max(1,0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = max(2,1) + 0 = 2

dp[4] = max(2,2) + 0 = 2

dp[5] = max(2,2) + 1 = 3

dp[6] = -1

dp[7] = -1

dp[8] = -1

dp[9] = max(-1, -1) + 0 = -1

dp[10] = max(-1, -1) + 0 = -1

dp[11] = max(-1, -1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

dp[12] = max(1, -1) + 1 = 2

dp[13] = max(2,1) + 1 = 3

dp[14] = max(3,2) + 1 = 4

But sample output is 3, but dp says 4.

Wait, perhaps I can't collect the coin at cell 14 because it's '*', but in the dp approach, I set dp[i] as invalid only if s[i]=='*', but in this case, s[14]=='*', so dp[14] should be invalid.

Wait, so dp[14] should be -1.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, dp[14] = max(dp[13], dp[12]) + 1 = max(3,2) + 1 = 4, but since s[14]=='*', dp[14] should be -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[i] = -1 when s[i]=='*', and not compute the dp[i] in that case.

So, correcting that:

dp[0] = 0

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 2

dp[3] = 2

dp[4] = 2

dp[5] = 3

dp[6] = -1

dp[7] = -1

dp[8] = -1

dp[9] = -1

dp[10] = -1

dp[11] = 1

dp[12] = 2

dp[13] = 3

dp[14] = -1

Then, the maximum dp[i] is 3, which matches the sample output.

So, in the dp approach, when s[i]=='*', dp[i] = -1, and it's not considered in the maximum.

Hence, the dp approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

len = int(input())

s = list(input())

ret = 0

thorn = 0

for i in s:

if i == '@':

thorn = 0

ret += 1

elif i == '*':

thorn += 1

if thorn == 2:

break

else:

thorn == 0

print(ret)

This seems different from the dp approach.

Let's see what this code is doing.

It initializes ret=0 and thorn=0.

Then, iterates through each character in s.

If the character is '@', it sets thorn=0, increments ret by 1.

If the character is '*', it increments thorn by 1, and if thorn==2, breaks the loop.

If the character is '.', it seems to set thorn==0, but it's a comparison, not an assignment. Wait, it's thorn == 0, which is
