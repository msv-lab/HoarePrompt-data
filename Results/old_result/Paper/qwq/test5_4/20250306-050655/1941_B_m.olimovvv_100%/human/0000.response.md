Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of n integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (between 2 and n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When Rudolf chooses an index i, he subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1]. This operation can be applied multiple times, and any index between 2 and n-1 can be chosen zero or more times. The question is whether, after some sequence of these operations, all elements of the array can be reduced to zero.

I should consider what effect this operation has on the array. It seems like it's a way to redistribute values in the array, specifically by reducing the values in a localized manner. It's similar to applying a filter or a kernel of some sort over the array.

Let me think about the constraints. The array has n elements, where n is at least 3 and can be up to 2*10^5. There are t test cases, up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so it's manageable in terms of time constraints if the algorithm is efficient enough.

I need to find a way to determine, for each test case, whether it's possible to make all elements zero. A brute-force approach would be to try all possible sequences of operations, but that's clearly infeasible given the constraints.

I should look for a smarter way to model this problem. Maybe I can think of the operations as equations and see if there's a solution where all variables (the number of times each operation is applied) satisfy the conditions to make all array elements zero.

Let's consider that each operation corresponds to a vector that is subtracted from the array. For example, choosing i = 2 corresponds to subtracting [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, ..., 0] from the array. If I can represent the operations as vectors, then the problem reduces to whether the vector formed by the initial array can be expressed as a linear combination of these operation vectors.

However, since all operations are subtracting, and we want to reach zero, it's equivalent to seeing if the initial array is a linear combination of the operation vectors.

Given that, perhaps I can set up a system of equations where each operation is a variable, and solve for the coefficients that sum up to the initial array.

But with n up to 2*10^5, solving a system of equations directly isn't practical. I need a better approach.

Let me consider the effects of the operations in a different way. Suppose I start from the left end of the array and try to eliminate elements one by one.

Starting with the first element, a[0]. If a[0] is greater than zero, I need to reduce it to zero. However, I can only perform operations that affect a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] for i from 2 to n-1. So, directly applying operations to affect a[0] is limited because operations involving i=2 affect a[1], a[2], a[3], and so on.

Wait, indices are 1-based in the problem description, but in programming, arrays are usually 0-based. I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me rephrase: indices in the problem are from 1 to n, so a1 to an. In code, I'll use 0 to n-1.

I need to make sure I'm consistent with indexing.

Let's try to find a pattern or a way to sequentially reduce the array elements.

Suppose I have the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]. According to the example, it's possible to make all elements zero through a series of operations.

Let me try to see how that's done.

First operation at i=3 (in 1-based indexing, which is index 2 in 0-based):

- a[1] -=1 -> a[1] = 3 -1 =2

- a[2] -=2 -> a[2] =5 -2=3

- a[3] -=1 -> a[3]=5-1=4

So the array becomes [1,2,3,4,2]

Then operation at i=2:

- a[1] -=1 -> a[1]=2-1=1

- a[2] -=2 -> a[2]=3-2=1

- a[3] -=1 -> a[3]=4-1=3

Array is now [1,1,1,3,2]

Then operation at i=3:

- a[2] -=1 -> a[2]=1-1=0

- a[3] -=2 -> a[3]=3-2=1

- a[4] -=1 -> a[4]=2-1=1

Array is now [1,1,0,1,1]

Then operation at i=2:

- a[1] -=1 -> a[1]=1-1=0

- a[2] -=2 -> a[2]=0-2=-2

- a[3] -=1 -> a[3]=1-1=0

Array is [0, -2, 0, 0, 1]

Wait, this doesn't seem right. In the example, they reached [0,0,0,0,0], but in my steps, I ended up with negative numbers. Maybe I chose the wrong sequence of operations.

This suggests that the order in which operations are applied matters, and choosing the right sequence is crucial.

This makes the problem more complex, as I need a strategy that guarantees reaching zero for all elements if it's possible.

Perhaps there's a way to model this problem using differences or cumulative sums.

Let me consider the operations in terms of how they affect the array.

Each operation at index i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, the operation can be seen as subtracting the vector [0, ..., 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, ..., 0] from the array, where the 1,2,1 are at positions i-1, i, i+1.

I need to find a combination of such vectors that sums up to the initial array.

This seems like a system of linear equations, but solving it directly is not feasible for large n.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider the problem in terms of differences.

Suppose I compute the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1, with d[0] = a[0].

In the operation, when I choose i, a[i-1] -=1, a[i] -=2, a[i+1] -=1.

So, d[i-1] = a[i] - a[i-1] would become (a[i]-2) - (a[i-1]-1) = a[i] - a[i-1] -1 = d[i-1] -1.

Similarly, d[i] = a[i+1] - a[i] becomes (a[i+1]-1) - (a[i]-2) = a[i+1] - a[i] +1 = d[i] +1.

So, applying an operation at i affects d[i-1] by subtracting 1 and d[i] by adding 1.

This is interesting. So, each operation adjusts d[i-1] and d[i] in a specific way.

My goal is to make all a[i] = 0, which implies that all d[i] = 0, because if a[0] = 0 and d[i] = 0 for all i, then a[i] = 0 for all i.

Wait, actually, if a[0] = 0 and d[i] = a[i+1] - a[i] = 0 for all i, then indeed a[i] = 0 for all i.

So, perhaps I can work with these differences d[i].

Initially, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1, and d[0] = a[0].

My operations allow me to adjust d[i-1] and d[i] by subtracting 1 from d[i-1] and adding 1 to d[i], for i from 1 to n-2.

My goal is to make all d[i] = 0.

This seems more manageable.

Let me see.

I can think of the operations as a way to propagate changes from one d[i] to the next.

Each operation at i adjusts d[i-1] and d[i].

So, starting from d[0], I can adjust d[0] and d[1] by applying operations at i=1 (which corresponds to adjusting d[0] and d[1]).

Then, operations at i=2 adjust d[1] and d[2], and so on.

This seems like a chain where each operation affects two consecutive d[i]'s.

So, perhaps I can sequentially adjust each d[i] to zero by applying operations that target them.

Let me try to formalize this.

I'll iterate through the d[i]'s from d[0] to d[n-2], and try to make each d[i] zero by applying operations.

Starting with d[0].

If d[0] is not zero, I need to make it zero by applying operations that subtract from d[0].

Each operation at i=1 subtracts 1 from d[0] and adds 1 to d[1].

So, if d[0] > 0, I can apply d[0] operations at i=1, which will subtract d[0] from d[0] and add d[0] to d[1].

After this, d[0] becomes zero, but d[1] increases by d[0].

Wait, but d[1] was already something, so adding d[0] to it might not be desirable.

Wait, but my goal is to make all d[i] = 0.

So, after making d[0] = 0, I need to make d[1] = 0, and so on.

But if I apply operations at i=1 to make d[0] = 0, d[1] increases by that amount.

Then, to make d[1] = 0, I need to apply operations at i=2, which will subtract from d[1] and add to d[2].

This seems like a way to propagate the adjustments through the array.

So, in code, I can simulate this process:

- Start with d[0] = a[0]

- For i from 1 to n-1: d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

- Then, for i from 0 to n-2:

- If d[i] < 0, it's impossible because operations can only subtract from d[i] and add to d[i+1]

- Else, apply d[i] operations at i+1, which subtracts d[i] from d[i] and adds d[i] to d[i+1]

- After processing all d[i], check if d[n-1] == 0

- If yes, then it's possible; else, no

Wait, but d[n-1] = a[n-1] - a[n-2], and after all operations, it should be zero.

But in my simulation, d[n-1] would have been adjusted by the operations applied at i=n-2.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the d[i]'s and adjust them sequentially.

Let me try with the first example:

Array: [1,3,5,5,2]

Compute d:

d[0] = 1

d[1] = 3 -1 =2

d[2] =5 -3=2

d[3] =5 -5=0

d[4] =2 -5=-3

Wait, d[4] is -3, which is a problem.

In my earlier thought process, if any d[i] becomes negative after adjustments, it's impossible.

In this case, d[4] is already -3, which suggests it's impossible, but according to the example, it's possible.

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in computing d[i].

Wait, hold on. In my initial thought, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1], for i from 1 to n-1, and d[0] = a[0].

But in the example, after operations, it's possible to make all a[i]=0.

But according to this difference approach, if any d[i] is negative except possibly the last one, it might still be possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me look at the operations in terms of how they affect the array.

Each operation at i subtracts [1,2,1] from [a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1]].

This is similar to convolving with [-1, -2, -1].

I need to find coefficients for each operation such that the sum of these convolutions equals the initial array.

This seems like solving a system of linear equations, but it's too slow for large n.

Another approach could be to use the cumulative sum.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the array a, and I want to make it all zeros using these operations.

Let me consider the operations as a way to reduce "peaks" in the array.

Each operation reduces a "peak" at position i by 2, and the adjacent elements by 1.

So, it's like smoothing out the array by reducing peaks.

My goal is to smooth it out completely.

Perhaps I can iterate from left to right, and at each step, apply operations to make the current element zero, propagating the remainder to the next elements.

Let me try that with the first example: [1,3,5,5,2]

Start with a[0]=1.

To make a[0]=0, I need to apply operations that subtract 1 from a[0].

But operations can only subtract from a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1], with the constraints on i.

Wait, operations can only be applied to i from 2 to n-1 (1-based), which correspond to i from 1 to n-2 in 0-based indexing.

So, for the first element, a[0], I cannot directly apply an operation to reduce it because the operations that affect a[0] are only those with i=1 (which is the second element in 1-based indexing).

Wait, in 0-based indexing:

- Operations are for i from 1 to n-2.

- Operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, operation at i=1 (0-based) affects a[0], a[1], a[2].

Operation at i=2 affects a[1], a[2], a[3], and so on.

So, to reduce a[0], I need to apply operations at i=1.

Each operation at i=1 subtracts 1 from a[0], 2 from a[1], and 1 from a[2].

So, if a[0] is 1, I can apply one operation at i=1, which subtracts 1 from a[0], making it zero, but also subtracts 2 from a[1] and 1 from a[2].

So, a[1] becomes 3-2=1, and a[2] becomes 5-1=4.

Now, the array is [0,1,4,5,2].

Next, I need to make a[1]=0.

To reduce a[1], I can apply operations at i=2, which subtracts 1 from a[1], 2 from a[2], and 1 from a[3].

If I apply one operation at i=2, a[1] becomes 1-1=0, a[2]=4-2=2, a[3]=5-1=4.

Now, the array is [0,0,2,4,2].

Next, make a[2]=0.

Apply operations at i=3, which subtracts 1 from a[2], 2 from a[3], and 1 from a[4].

Apply two operations at i=3: a[2] becomes 2-2=0, a[3]=4-4=0, a[4]=2-2=0.

Now, the array is [0,0,0,0,0].

So, it's possible.

This seems to work.

Let me try with another example.

Take the third test case:

n=5

a = [0,1,3,3,1]

Apply operations:

First, a[0]=0, so no operation needed for a[0].

Next, a[1]=1. Apply operation at i=2: a[1]-=1, a[2]-=2, a[3]-=1.

a becomes [0,0,1,2,1]

Next, a[2]=1. Apply operation at i=3: a[2]-=1, a[3]-=2, a[4]-=1.

a becomes [0,0,0,0,0]

So, it's possible.

Now, the second test case:

n=5

a = [2,4,4,5,1]

Try to make all zeros.

Apply operation at i=2: a[1]-1, a[2]-2, a[3]-1.

a becomes [2,3,2,4,1]

Apply operation at i=2 again: [2,2,0,3,1]

Apply operation at i=3: [2,2,0,1,0]

Apply operation at i=2: [2,0,-2,1,0]

Now, a[2] is -2, which is invalid.

So, it's impossible.

Hence, the answer is "NO" for this test case.

This seems consistent with the sample output.

So, the strategy is:

- Starting from the first element, if it's not zero, check if it can be reduced by applying operations that affect it.

- For a[0], only operations at i=1 (0-based) can affect it.

- After making a[0]=0, move to a[1], and so on.

- At each step, ensure that no element becomes negative.

But in the above manual simulation, sometimes a[2] or a[3] become negative, which is not allowed.

Hence, I need a way to ensure that all elements remain non-negative during the process.

This seems similar to the idea of "borrowing" in subtraction, where you borrow from the next digit, but need to ensure that you don't over-borrow.

Another way to think about it is to use the concept of prefix sums or cumulative sums.

Let me consider computing prefix sums.

Define p[0] = a[0]

p[1] = a[0] + a[1]

p[2] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]

...

p[n-1] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]

Now, consider the operations in terms of prefix sums.

When an operation is applied at i (0-based), it subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

This would affect p[j] for j >= i-1.

Specifically:

- p[i-1] -=1

- p[i] -=2 (since a[i] is included in p[i] and onwards)

- p[i+1] -=1

So, p[i-1] -=1

p[i] -=2

p[i+1] -=1

p[j] remains unchanged for j > i+1

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe prefix sums aren't the best way to approach this.

Let me consider another idea.

Suppose I have the array a, and I want to make it all zeros.

I can think of the operations as a way to subtract a specific pattern from the array.

Each operation at i subtracts [1,2,1] from positions [i-1, i, i+1].

I need to find a combination of such patterns that sums up to the initial array.

This is similar to solving a system of linear equations, but as mentioned before, it's not practical for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Looking back at the earlier approach with differences, perhaps I can adjust it.

Let me try to iterate through the array and adjust the differences.

Start with d[0] = a[0]

For i from 1 to n-1:

d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

Now, to make a[0]=0, I need d[0]=0.

To make a[1]=0, I need d[1]=0, and so on, until d[n-1]=0.

But operations affect d[i-1] and d[i].

Specifically, an operation at i (0-based) subtracts 1 from d[i-1] and adds 1 to d[i].

So, operation at i adjusts d[i-1] -=1 and d[i] +=1.

This is similar to moving a value from d[i-1] to d[i].

So, if d[i-1] > 0, I can apply operations to reduce d[i-1] and increase d[i].

My goal is to make all d[i]=0.

Starting from d[0].

If d[0] > 0, I can apply d[0] operations at i=0 (which affects d[-1] and d[0], but d[-1] doesn't exist, so maybe this isn't directly applicable).

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me consider that operations at i adjust d[i-1] and d[i].

So, for i from 0 to n-2 (0-based):

- operation at i subtracts 1 from d[i]

- and adds 1 to d[i+1]

So, it's like shifting value from d[i] to d[i+1].

My aim is to shift values in such a way that all d[i] become zero.

This is similar to moving all the imbalance to the last element.

So, if I can shift all the d[i] values to d[n-1], and then check if d[n-1] is zero, that would determine the possibility.

Wait, in the operation, subtracting from d[i] and adding to d[i+1], it's like moving value from d[i] to d[i+1].

So, if I process from left to right, I can move all the imbalances to the rightmost d[i].

At the end, if d[n-1] is zero, it means all imbalances have been canceled out, and it's possible to make all a[i]=0.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Let me test this idea with the first example.

Array: [1,3,5,5,2]

Compute d:

d[0] =1

d[1] =3-1=2

d[2] =5-3=2

d[3] =5-5=0

d[4] =2-5=-3

Now, starting from d[0]:

d[0] =1, so shift it to d[1]: d[1] +=1, d[0] -=1 => d[1]=3, d[0]=0

Then d[1]=3, shift to d[2]: d[2] +=3, d[1]-=3 => d[2]=5, d[1]=0

Then d[2]=5, shift to d[3]: d[3] +=5, d[2]-=5 => d[3]=5, d[2]=0

Then d[3]=5, shift to d[4]: d[4] +=5, d[3]-=5 => d[4]=2, d[3]=0

Now, d[4]=2, which is not zero, so according to this, it should be impossible.

But in the sample, it's possible.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

In the sample, it's possible to make all zeros, but according to this, d[4]=2 !=0, which suggests it's impossible.

This contradiction means my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I compute d[i].

Let me think differently.

Suppose I define b[i] = a[i] - a[i-1], for i from 1 to n-1, and b[0] = a[0].

Then, to make a[0]=0, I need b[0]=0.

To make a[1]=0, I need b[1]=0, and so on.

But operations affect b[i-1] and b[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate the values.

Another idea: since each operation subtracts [1,2,1] from [a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1]], maybe I can model this as convolving the array with [-1, -2, -1].

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the total sum.

Each operation subtracts a total of 4 from the sum of the array.

So, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reach zero.

Wait, no. In each operation, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 is subtracted from the sum of the array.

Therefore, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4.

But is this sufficient?

Let's check the first example:

Sum is 1+3+5+5+2=16, which is divisible by 4.

Second example: 2+4+4+5+1=16, divisible by 4.

Third example: 0+1+3+3+1=8, divisible by 4.

Fourth example: seems to be 5+6+0+2+3+0=16, divisible by 4.

Fifth:1+2+7+2=12, divisible by 4.

Sixth:7+1+0=8, divisible by 4.

Seventh:1+1+1+1=4, divisible by 4.

But according to the sample, some are "NO", even though their sums are divisible by 4.

So, sum divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

Hence, I need a better condition.

Let me consider the parity of the elements.

But that seems unlikely.

Another idea: since operations can only be performed on i from 2 to n-1 (1-based), which is i from 1 to n-2 in 0-based indexing, perhaps I need to process the array in a specific order, ensuring that I don't create negative values.

Let me consider iterating from left to right, and at each step, applying operations to make the current element zero, while ensuring that I don't make any element negative.

So, starting from a[0].

If a[0] > 0, I need to apply operations that subtract from a[0].

But operations that affect a[0] are only those at i=1 (0-based), which subtract 1 from a[0], 2 from a[1], and 1 from a[2].

So, to make a[0]=0, if a[0] = k, I need to apply k operations at i=1.

But this will subtract 2k from a[1] and k from a[2].

So, after making a[0]=0, a[1] becomes a[1]-2k and a[2] becomes a[2]-k.

I need to ensure that a[1]-2k >=0 and a[2]-k >=0.

Similarly, proceed to a[1], and so on.

This seems promising.

So, in code, I can implement this as:

for i in 0 to n-3:

if a[i] < 0:

return "NO"

operations = a[i]

a[i] -= operations

a[i+1] -= 2*operations

a[i+2] -= operations

After processing all such i, check if a[n-2] and a[n-1] are zero.

If yes, return "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but in the first example:

a = [1,3,5,5,2]

First step: i=0, a[0]=1, operations=1

a[0] -=1 =>0

a[1] -=2 =>3-2=1

a[2] -=1 =>5-1=4

Now, a=[0,1,4,5,2]

Next, i=1, a[1]=1, operations=1

a[1] -=1 =>0

a[2] -=2 =>4-2=2

a[3] -=1 =>5-1=4

Now, a=[0,0,2,4,2]

Next, i=2, a[2]=2, operations=2

a[2] -=2 =>0

a[3] -=2*2=4 =>4-4=0

a[4] -=2 =>2-2=0

Now, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

So, it's possible.

Another test case: n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Follow the same steps:

i=0, a[0]=2, operations=2

a[0]-=2 =>0

a[1]-=4 =>4-4=0

a[2]-=2 =>4-2=2

Now, a=[0,0,2,5,1]

i=1, a[1]=0, skip

i=2, a[2]=2, operations=2

a[2]-=2 =>0

a[3]-=4 =>5-4=1

a[4]-=2 =>1-2=-1

Now, a=[0,0,0,1,-1]

Since a[4]=-1 <0, "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=5, a=[0,1,3,3,1]

i=0, a[0]=0, skip

i=1, a[1]=1, operations=1

a[1]-=1 =>0

a[2]-=2 =>3-2=1

a[3]-=1 =>3-1=2

Now, a=[0,0,1,2,1]

i=2, a[2]=1, operations=1

a[2]-=1 =>0

a[3]-=2 =>2-2=0

a[4]-=1 =>1-1=0

Now, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

So, "YES"

This seems to work.

Let me try with n=4, a=[1,2,7,2]

i=0, a[0]=1, operations=1

a[0]-=1 =>0

a[1]-=2 =>2-2=0

a[2]-=1 =>7-1=6

Now, a=[0,0,6,2]

i=1, a[1]=0, skip

i=2, a[2]=6, operations=6

a[2]-=6 =>0

a[3]-=12 =>2-12=-10

Now, a=[0,0,0,-10], which is negative, "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Hence, the given code implements this logic.

In the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = int(input())

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(0, a - 2):

if b[i] < 0:

print('NO')

break

b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2

b[i + 2] -= b[i]

b[i] -= b[i]

else:

if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')



This code iterates through the array from i=0 to i=n-3, applying the operations as described, and checks if the last two elements are zero after processing.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make all elements of a given array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and modifying the elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Operation**:
   - Each operation subtracts 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.
   - We need to apply these operations in such a way that all elements of the array become zero.

2. **Simulating the Operations**:
   - We iterate through the array from the start to the third-to-last element.
   - For each element `b[i]`, if it is greater than zero, we apply operations to reduce it to zero. This involves subtracting `b[i]` from `b[i]`, `2 * b[i]` from `b[i+1]`, and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If at any point an element becomes negative during the operations, it means it's impossible to make all elements zero.
   - After processing, we check if the last two elements are zero.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

### Explanation

1. **Operation Simulation**:
   - For each element from `b[0]` to `b[n-3]`, if `b[i]` is positive, we subtract `b[i]` from itself, `2 * b[i]` from `b[i+1]`, and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`.
   - This effectively simulates the operation of reducing `b[i]` to zero and adjusting the adjacent elements accordingly.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If any element becomes negative during the operations, we immediately conclude that it's impossible to make all elements zero and output "NO".
   - After processing all elements up to `b[n-3]`, we check if the last two elements (`b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]`) are zero. If they are, we output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether it's possible to reduce the entire array to zero using the given operations.
