Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Polycarp has a string made up of lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it using a specific algorithm. My task is to write a program that can decode this encoded string back to the original string.

First, I need to understand the encoding algorithm clearly. It says that he constructs a new auxiliary string 'r' which consists of all distinct letters of the string 's', written in alphabetical order. Then, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character from 'r'. That means, the first character of 'r' is replaced by the last character of 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

For example, with s = "codeforces", r is "cdefors". So, 'c' is replaced by 's', 'o' by 'e', 'd' by 'r', and so on, resulting in "serofedsoc".

Okay, so my job is to reverse this process. Given the encoded string 'b', I need to find the original string 's'.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the auxiliary string 'r' was, based on the encoded string 'b'. Since 'r' is made up of unique characters from 's' in alphabetical order, and 'b' is 's' with each character replaced by its symmetric character from 'r', I need a way to map back from 'b' to 's'.

Wait, but I don't know 'r', I only have 'b'. So, I need to deduce 'r' from 'b'.

Let's see. Since 'r' is the sorted unique characters of 's', and 'b' is 's' with each character replaced by its symmetric character from 'r', I need to find a way to map from 'b' back to 's'.

Maybe I can find the unique characters in 'b', sort them to get 'r', and then map each character in 'b' to its symmetric character in 'r' to get back to 's'.

Wait, but in the example, s = "codeforces", r = "cdefors", and b = "serofedsoc". If I take the unique characters in b, which is "cdefors", sort them, I still get "cdefors", which is 'r'. Then, mapping each character in b back to s would involve mapping 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', etc., following the symmetric mapping in 'r'.

So, it seems like my approach could work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given 'b', I can find 'r' by taking the unique characters in 'b' and sorting them.

Then, I need to create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'.

For example, if r = "cdefors", which has 7 characters, the mapping would be:

c -> s

d -> r

e -> o

f -> f

o -> d

r -> e

s -> c

So, positions 0 maps to -1, position 1 maps to -2, and so on.

Then, to decode 'b' back to 's', I just need to apply this mapping to each character in 'b'.

Wait, but in the example, b = "serofedsoc", and s = "codeforces". So, mapping 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', 'o' to 'f', 'f' to 'e', 'e' to 'd', 'd' to 'r', 's' to 'c', 'o' to 'f', 'c' to 's'.

Hmm, that seems consistent with the mapping above.

So, my plan is:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and b.

b. Find the unique characters in b and sort them to get r.

c. Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character in r.

d. Apply this mapping to each character in b to get s.

e. Output s.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

Looking at the given program, it seems like they've implemented something similar.

Let's look at the code:

num_test_cases = int(input())

for _ in range(num_test_cases):

num_chars = int(input())

b = input()

print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):

"""

Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

Args:

b (str): The encoded string.

Returns:

str: The decoded string s.

"""

char_map = {}

for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):

char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))

s = ''

for c in b:

s += char_map[c]

return s

Wait, this doesn't seem right.

In the docstring, it says "Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.", but looking at the implementation, it's not matching what I thought it should do.

Let's see.

It creates a char_map where for each unique character in b, sorted alphabetically, it maps to a new character, which is 'a' shifted by (len(b) - i - 1).

Wait, that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Wait, no, len(b) is the length of the string, not the length of r.

Wait, but r is the sorted unique characters of b.

Wait, in the code, sorted(set(b)) gives r.

Then, for each character in r, it maps to chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1)).

Wait, len(b) is the length of the encoded string, which is not related to the mapping in the problem.

In the problem, the mapping is based on the symmetric positions in r, not based on the length of b.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, in the example, b = "serofedsoc", len(b) = 10.

Then, r = "cdefors", which has 7 characters.

So, for i from 0 to 6:

i=0, c -> chr(97 + 10 - 0 -1) = chr(97 + 9) = chr(106) = 'j'

But in the example, c should map to 's', not 'j'.

This is clearly wrong.

So, the given program is incorrect.

It seems like the person who wrote this misinterpreted the mapping.

In the problem, the mapping is based on the positions in r, not based on adding some offset to 'a'.

It should map each character in r to its symmetric character in r.

For example, if r has length 7, then:

Position 0 maps to position 6

Position 1 maps to position 5

Position 2 maps to position 4

Position 3 maps to position 3

And so on.

So, in the code, it should create a mapping where each character in r is mapped to the character at the symmetric position in r.

Then, apply this mapping to each character in b to get s.

But in the given code, it's mapping each character in r to a character that's 'a' shifted by (len(b) - i - 1), which doesn't correspond to anything in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
