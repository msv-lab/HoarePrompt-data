Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that when I take the minimum of each pair and sum them up, I get the maximum possible score.

Let me think about this with an example. Take the first test case: n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. So, I have to choose two numbers, but since n=1, I only choose two numbers once, and that's all. The minimum of 2 and 3 is 2, so the score is 2. That seems straightforward.

The second test case: n=2, numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1. I need to perform two moves. In the first move, I choose two numbers. If I choose 1 and 1, the minimum is 1, and I erase them. Then, I'm left with 1 and 2. In the second move, I choose 1 and 2, minimum is 1, so total score is 2.

Is there a better way? Let's see. Suppose I choose 1 and 2 in the first move. Minimum is 1, erase them, left with 1 and 1. Second move: choose 1 and 1, minimum is 1, total score is 2 again. Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score.

Wait, but the problem says to maximize the score. In this case, it's 2, which matches the example.

Third test case: n=3, all numbers are 1. So, I have six 1's. I perform three moves, each time choosing two 1's, minimum is 1, so total score is 3. Again, straightforward.

From these examples, it seems like I should always pair the smallest available numbers together. But is that always the best strategy?

Let me think about a different example. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. If I pair 1 and 2, get min=1, and pair 3 and 4, get min=3, total score is 4. Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 3, get min=1, and pair 2 and 4, get min=2, total score is 3, which is less than 4. So, pairing the smallest numbers together gives a better score.

Another example: n=3, numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If I pair 1 and 2, get 1; pair 3 and 4, get 3; pair 5 and 6, get 5; total score is 9. If I pair 1 and 3, get 1; pair 2 and 4, get 2; pair 5 and 6, get 5; total score is 8, which is less than 9. So again, pairing the smallest numbers together seems better.

Wait a minute, is there a pattern here? It seems like sorting the array and then pairing the smallest numbers together gives the maximum score. But is that always true?

Let me try to think of a case where this might not hold. Suppose n=2, numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3. If I pair 1 and 1, get 1; pair 2 and 3, get 2; total score is 3. Alternatively, pair 1 and 2, get 1; pair 1 and 3, get 1; total score is 2, which is less than 3. So, again, pairing the smallest together is better.

Another approach: I recall that in similar problems, like maximizing the sum of minimums, sorting and pairing the smallest with the next smallest is optimal. Is that applicable here?

Let me think about why this might be optimal. If I sort the array in non-decreasing order, say a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n, and pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, then in each pair, the minimum is the first element in the pair, since the array is sorted.

So, the sum of minimums would be a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this the maximum possible? Wait, in the examples above, it seems to be the maximum.

But let's check another example. Suppose n=3, numbers are 1,1,2,2,3,3.

If I pair 1 and 1, get 1; pair 2 and 2, get 2; pair 3 and 3, get 3; total score is 6.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 2, get 1; pair 1 and 3, get 1; pair 2 and 3, get 2; total score is 4, which is less than 6.

Again, pairing the smallest together gives a better score.

So, it seems that sorting and pairing the smallest numbers together maximizes the score.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=1, numbers 2 and 3, pairing them gives min=2, which is the same as pairing smallest together since there's only one pair.

In the second test case, n=2, numbers 1,1,2,1. Sorting gives 1,1,1,2. Pairing 1 and 1, then 1 and 2, sum of mins is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=3, all 1's. Pairing any way gives sum 3, which is optimal.

So, it seems that sorting and pairing the smallest numbers together is the way to go.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

score = 0

for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):

score += l[i]

print(score)

This program reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and then 2n integers, sorts them, and then sums up every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest elements).

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, this should be correct.

But let me double-check.

In the sorted list, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

Pairing a1 with a2, a3 with a4, ..., a_{2n-1} with a2n.

In each pair, the minimum is a1, a3, ..., a_{2n-1}.

Summing these up should give the maximum possible score.

But is there a way to get a higher score by pairing differently?

Let's consider a case where pairing differently might give a higher score.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,4.

If I pair 1 and 2, get 1; pair 3 and 4, get 3; total score 4.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 3, get 1; pair 2 and 4, get 2; total score 3.

So, pairing the smallest together is better.

Another case: n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Pairing 1 and 1, get 1; pairing 2 and 2, get 2; pairing 3 and 3, get 3; total 6.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 2, get 1; pairing 1 and 3, get 1; pairing 2 and 3, get 2; total 4, which is less than 6.

So, again, pairing the smallest together is better.

Wait, but what if there are odd numbered elements? Oh, but the problem says 2n elements, so it's always even.

Alright, so the strategy seems solid.

But just to be thorough, let's consider another example.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,3.

Sorted: 1,1,2,3.

Pairing 1 and 1, get 1; pairing 2 and 3, get 2; total 3.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 2, get 1; pairing 1 and 3, get 1; total 2.

So, again, pairing the smallest together is better.

Is there any case where pairing larger numbers together gives a better sum?

Let me try n=2, numbers 1,1,1,2.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

Pairing 1 and 1, get 1; pairing 1 and 2, get 1; total 2.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 1, get 1; pairing 1 and 2, get 1; same total.

No difference here.

Another case: n=3, numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pairing 1 and 2, get 1; pairing 3 and 4, get 3; pairing 5 and 6, get 5; total 9.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 3, get 1; pairing 2 and 4, get 2; pairing 5 and 6, get 5; total 8, which is less than 9.

So, again, pairing the smallest together is better.

It seems consistent.

Now, looking back at the program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

score = 0

for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):

score += l[i]

print(score)

This program sorts the list in non-decreasing order and sums every second element starting from the first, which are the smallest elements.

According to my reasoning, this should give the maximum score.

But to be absolutely sure, let's think about the algorithm in another way.

Suppose I sort the array in non-decreasing order: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

I pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on.

In each pair, the minimum is a1, a3, a5, ..., a_{2n-1}.

So, the sum is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is there a way to rearrange the pairing to get a higher sum?

Suppose I pair a1 with a3, a2 with a4, etc.

Then, the minimums would be a1 and a2, sum is a1 + a2.

But in the sorted list, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

So, a1 + a3 ≤ a1 + a3 (same as before).

Wait, but in general, a1 + a3 ≤ a1 + a3, which is equal.

But in the original pairing, a1 + a3 + a5 + ..., which seems to be better.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total sum of all minimums.

In the sorted pairing, it's a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Suppose I pair a1 with a2, get a1; pair a3 with a4, get a3; and so on.

Alternatively, if I pair a1 with a3, get a1; pair a2 with a4, get a2; and so on.

Then, the sum would be a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + ... up to n terms.

Wait, but in sorted order, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

So, comparing a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1} versus a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + ... + a_{2k-1}, where k = n.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think in terms of choosing pairs.

Each pair takes two elements, and the minimum is added to the score.

I need to maximize the sum of these minimums.

I can think of it as selecting n disjoint pairs from the 2n elements, and for each pair, adding the smaller element to the score, and I want to maximize this total score.

Is there a known algorithm or strategy for this?

Yes, in matching theory, especially in bipartite matching, similar problems are addressed.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Suppose I sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Then, the smallest elements are a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

If I pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, the sum of minimums is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this the maximum possible?

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of choosing the best possible minimum for each pair.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the total sum.

The sum of all elements is S = a1 + a2 + ... + a2n.

In each pair, I'm taking the minimum, and summing them up.

I need to maximize this sum.

Alternatively, the problem can be seen as partitioning the set into n pairs and summing the minimums of each pair.

I need to find the partition that maximizes this sum.

Is there a way to arrange the pairs such that the sum of minimums is maximized?

From the earlier examples, it seems that pairing the smallest elements together achieves this.

But is there a mathematical proof for this?

Yes, there is.

In fact, this is a classic problem in optimization, and the greedy approach of sorting and pairing the smallest elements together is optimal.

Here's why:

Suppose I have four elements: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d.

Option 1: Pair a with b, and c with d. Sum of minimums: a + c.

Option 2: Pair a with c, and b with d. Sum of minimums: a + b.

Option 3: Pair a with d, and b with c. Sum of minimums: a + b.

Comparing Option 1 and Option 2:

a + c vs. a + b.

Since b ≤ c, a + b ≤ a + c.

Similarly, Option 1: a + c vs. Option 3: a + b.

Again, a + b ≤ a + c.

Therefore, pairing a with b and c with d gives the maximum sum a + c.

Similarly, in general, pairing the smallest elements together leads to the maximum sum of minimums.

Hence, the strategy of sorting the array and pairing the smallest elements together is optimal.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of 2n integers, sorts them, and sums every second element starting from the first, which are the smallest elements in their respective pairs.

Thus, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
