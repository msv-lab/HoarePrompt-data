Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a problem with difficulty x, and we need to split it into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty. The sum of these sub-problems' difficulties should equal x. Then, we need to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these sub-problems' difficulties.

So, the goal is to maximize the GCD of the n sub-problems, given that their sum is x.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

So, if I have n numbers, all divisible by some number d, then d is a common divisor. To maximize d, I need to find the largest possible d such that x can be expressed as the sum of n numbers, each of which is a multiple of d.

Wait a minute, if each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of d, then the sum x must also be a multiple of d. Because the sum of multiples of d is also a multiple of d.

So, d must be a divisor of x.

But it's not just any divisor, because I have to split x into n sub-problems, each at least 1.

Let me think about this.

Let's denote d as the GCD we're trying to maximize.

Since each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of d, let's say each sub-problem has difficulty d * k_i, where k_i is an integer >=1.

Then, the sum x = d * (k1 + k2 + ... + kn).

So, x must be divisible by d, and (k1 + k2 + ... + kn) must be equal to x/d.

But each k_i >=1, so the sum k1 + k2 + ... + kn >= n.

Therefore, x/d >= n, which implies d <= x/n.

So, d can be at most x/n.

But d has to be an integer, since difficulties are positive integers.

Wait, x and n are given, and d has to divide x.

So, I need to find the largest d that divides x, and d <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but it's possible that floor(x/n) is not a divisor of x.

So, I need to find the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to floor(x/n).

Is that correct?

Let me check with the first example.

First test case: x=10, n=3.

floor(10/3)=3.

Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.

The largest divisor <=3 is 2.

And in the example, it's possible to have sub-problems with difficulties 2,4,4, which sum to 10, and GCD is 2.

Yes, that works.

Second test case: x=5, n=5.

floor(5/5)=1.

Divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.

The largest divisor <=1 is 1.

And indeed, all sub-problems have difficulty 1, sum to 5, GCD is 1.

Third test case: x=420, n=69.

floor(420/69)=6.

Divisors of 420 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,12,14,15,20,21,28,30,35,42,60,70,84,105,140,210,420.

The largest divisor <=6 is 6.

And the answer is 6.

So, it seems that the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Is this always true?

Let me try to think of a case where this might not hold.

Suppose x=10, n=2.

floor(10/2)=5.

Divisors of 10 <=5 are 1,2,5.

The largest is 5.

Can I have two sub-problems with difficulty 5 and 5? Sum is 10, GCD is 5.

Yes, that's possible.

Another case: x=7, n=2.

floor(7/2)=3.

Divisors of 7 <=3 are only 1.

So, the maximum GCD is 1.

Possible sub-problems: 1 and 6, GCD is 1.

Or 2 and 5, GCD is 1.

Or 3 and 4, GCD is 1.

So, indeed, the maximum GCD is 1.

Another case: x=8, n=4.

floor(8/4)=2.

Divisors of 8 <=2 are 1 and 2.

The largest is 2.

Possible sub-problems: 2,2,2,2, sum to 8, GCD is 2.

Or 1,1,3,3, sum to 8, GCD is 1.

So, 2 is better.

Hence, it seems that the strategy is correct.

So, to solve the problem, for each test case, I need to find the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

How do I implement this efficiently?

Given that t can be up to 10^3, and x up to 10^8, I need an efficient way to find the divisors of x.

Finding all divisors of a number up to 10^8 can be done efficiently by iterating up to sqrt(x) and collecting divisors.

So, for each test case, I can:

1. Compute floor(x/n).

2. Find all divisors of x.

3. Among the divisors, find the largest one that is <= floor(x/n).

Let me look at the provided program to see if it does this.

The program is:

from math import sqrt

def func():

for q in range(int(input())):

(x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

ans = 1

for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:

ans = max(ans, i)

if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

ans = max(ans, x // i)

print(ans)

So, it's trying to iterate through possible divisors i of x, and check certain conditions to update ans.

Let me understand what it's doing.

It initializes ans to 1.

Then, it iterates i from 1 to sqrt(x), inclusive.

For each i, if i is a divisor of x (x % i == 0), it checks two conditions:

1. If x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0, then it sets ans to max(ans, i).

2. If x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0, then it sets ans to max(ans, x // i).

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted.

Let me see.

In the first condition, it's checking if i is a possible GCD.

x - n * i >= 0 means that after allocating n sub-problems each of difficulty i, there's still x - n * i left, which should be divisible by i, meaning that we can distribute the remaining difficulty among the n sub-problems.

Similarly, the second condition is checking for x // i, which is another divisor of x.

But I'm not entirely sure about this implementation.

Let me think differently.

I know that the GCD d must divide x, and d <= floor(x/n).

So, why not find all divisors of x, select those that are <= floor(x/n), and take the maximum among them.

That seems straightforward.

Let me see how to implement that.

To find all divisors of x, I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, add both i and x//i to the list of divisors, unless i == x//i.

Then, among these divisors, find the largest one that is <= floor(x/n).

This should work.

Let me compare this with the given program.

In the given program, it seems to be trying to find divisors and check some conditions, but it's not exactly matching my approach.

Let me see if it's equivalent.

In my approach, I would:

- Find all divisors of x.

- Find floor(x/n).

- Select the largest divisor <= floor(x/n).

In the given program, it's iterating through i from 1 to sqrt(x), checking if i divides x, then checking two conditions related to x - n * i and x - n * (x // i), and updating ans accordingly.

I need to verify if this effectively finds the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Let's take the first test case: x=10, n=3.

floor(10/3)=3.

Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.

Among these, 1,2 <=3, so the largest is 2.

In the program:

Iterate i from 1 to sqrt(10)~3.

i=1:

x % 1 ==0.

x - 3*1 = 7 >=0, and 7 % 1 ==0, so ans=max(1,1)=1.

x - 3*(10//1)=x - 3*10= x -30 = -20 <0, so skip.

i=2:

x % 2 ==0.

x -3*2=4 >=0, and 4 % 2 ==0, so ans=max(1,2)=2.

x -3*(10//2)=x -3*5=10-15=-5 <0, skip.

i=3:

x % 3 !=0, skip.

So, ans=2, which is correct.

Second test case: x=5, n=5.

floor(5/5)=1.

Divisors of 5:1,5.

1 <=1, 5>1.

So, ans should be 1.

In the program:

i from 1 to sqrt(5)~2.

i=1:

x%1==0.

x-5*1=0 >=0, and 0%1==0, so ans=max(1,1)=1.

x -5*(5//1)=x -5*5= -20 <0, skip.

i=2:

x%2 !=0, skip.

So, ans=1, correct.

Third test case: x=420, n=69.

floor(420/69)=6.

Divisors of 420 <=6:1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, ans=6.

In the program:

i from 1 to sqrt(420)~20.

It would check i=1 to i=20, find divisors, check conditions, and set ans to 6.

Seems correct.

So, even though the program's logic is a bit convoluted, it seems to be arriving at the correct answers for the test cases.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the logic behind the conditions it's checking.

Let me try to understand why it's checking x - n * i >=0 and (x - n * i) % i ==0.

If i is a potential GCD, then each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of i, and the sum is x.

So, if I have n sub-problems, each at least i, then the minimum sum is n*i.

So, x - n*i is the remaining difficulty to distribute among the n sub-problems, and this remaining difficulty must be divisible by i, so that it can be added to some sub-problems.

Hence, x - n*i >=0 and (x - n*i) % i ==0 ensures that it's possible to distribute the remaining difficulty among the sub-problems while keeping their difficulties multiples of i.

Similarly, it checks for x//i, which is another divisor.

So, it's considering both i and x//i as potential GCDs, and checking if they satisfy the conditions.

This seems like a way to find the largest possible d that divides x and d <= floor(x/n).

Hence, despite the convoluted way it's written, it appears to be correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
