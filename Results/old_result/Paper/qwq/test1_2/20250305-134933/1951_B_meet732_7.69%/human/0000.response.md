Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in their initial positions from 1 to n. They compete in a tournament where the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2, and subsequent matches are between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The winner is the one with the higher rating, and this continues until all matches are done.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow k, and I can do this by either swapping cow k with another cow or doing nothing at all. I need to find the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve with this one-time swap option.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses. It's a kind of single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line. The tournament proceeds in a specific order, starting from the first two cows and then continuing with the winner facing the next cow.

Let me try to simulate a small example to understand better.

Suppose n=4, k=2, and the ratings are [10, 20, 15, 25].

Initial positions:

Pos 1: 10

Pos 2: 20

Pos 3: 15

Pos 4: 25

First match: Pos1 (10) vs Pos2 (20). Winner: 20.

Next match: Winner (20) vs Pos3 (15). Winner: 20.

Next match: Winner (20) vs Pos4 (25). Winner: 25.

So, cow k=2 (rating 20) won 2 matches.

Is there a way to increase this by swapping cow k with another cow?

Let's try swapping cow k=2 with pos1 (10).

New order: [20, 10, 15, 25]

First match: Pos1 (20) vs Pos2 (10). Winner: 20.

Next match: Winner (20) vs Pos3 (15). Winner: 20.

Next match: Winner (20) vs Pos4 (25). Winner: 25.

Cow k=2 (original cow now at pos1 with rating 20) won 3 matches.

Wait, but cow k=2 is now at pos1. So, in this scenario, cow k=2 (now at pos1) wins 3 matches.

Is this better than the previous 2 matches?

Yes, it's better.

Another swap: swap cow k=2 with pos3 (15).

New order: [10, 15, 20, 25]

First match: Pos1 (10) vs Pos2 (15). Winner: 15.

Next match: Winner (15) vs Pos3 (20). Winner: 20.

Next match: Winner (20) vs Pos4 (25). Winner: 25.

Cow k=2 (now at pos3 with rating 20) wins 2 matches.

Same as before.

Another swap: swap cow k=2 with pos4 (25).

New order: [10, 25, 15, 20]

First match: Pos1 (10) vs Pos2 (25). Winner: 25.

Next match: Winner (25) vs Pos3 (15). Winner: 25.

Next match: Winner (25) vs Pos4 (20). Winner: 25.

Cow k=2 (now at pos4 with rating 20) wins 1 match.

Worse than before.

So, the best option is to swap cow k=2 with pos1, achieving 3 wins.

But wait, in the original position, without swapping, cow k=2 wins 2 matches.

So, by swapping, we can increase it to 3.

Is there a way to get more than 3?

Let's see.

Suppose we swap cow k=2 with pos4.

Wait, already did that, and it results in 1 win.

What if we don't swap and keep cow k=2 at pos2?

Then, as in the first simulation, it wins 2 matches.

What if we swap cow k=2 with pos3?

Then, it wins 2 matches.

So, the maximum wins is 3 by swapping with pos1.

Now, generalizing this, I need to find the best position to place cow k to maximize its wins.

I need to consider where to place cow k such that it wins as many matches as possible.

Let's think about how the tournament progresses.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, the number of wins a cow can achieve depends on how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

Moreover, since the ratings are unique, the cow with the highest rating will eventually win the entire tournament.

But I'm interested in maximizing the number of wins for cow k, not necessarily winning the tournament.

So, I need to position cow k in such a way that it encounters as many cows with lower ratings as possible before facing a cow with a higher rating.

In other words, I need to place cow k in a position where there are as many cows with lower ratings after it as possible, but before any cow with a higher rating.

Wait, no.

Actually, since the tournament proceeds by always matching the current winner with the next cow in line, the number of wins a cow can achieve depends on its rating and the ratings of the cows that come after it in line.

Specifically, if a cow has a higher rating than all the cows that come after it in line, it will win all matches until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, for cow k, if I place it in position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, more precisely:

- Once cow k is in position p, it will participate in the tournament at that position.

- It will first play against the cow in position p+1, then the winner of that plays against position p+2, and so on, until it loses to a cow with a higher rating.

- Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k.

- However, this is not entirely accurate because the tournament is not exactly a straightforward sequence; it's a tree-like structure where each match depends on the previous one.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively or in terms of a tournament bracket.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that in the tournament, each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, the matches are sequential, and the winner advances to the next match.

Therefore, the number of wins a cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it in line, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but it's not exactly that, because the order matters in how the matches are conducted.

Maybe I should simulate the tournament for different positions of cow k and count its wins.

But that would be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 10^5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position p, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, it's like counting the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

This seems similar to calculating the length of the decreasing sequence starting from position p+1, where each cow has a lower rating than cow k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

So, for each possible position p, I can calculate this value.

But since I can only swap cow k with at most one other cow, I need to consider the positions where cow k can be placed:

- Its original position.

- Any position q where I swap cow k with cow q.

So, I need to consider all possible positions p, compute the number of wins for cow k at position p, and choose the maximum among these values.

But iterating over all possible positions p (up to 10^5) for each test case (up to 10^4) would be too slow.

Therefore, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

Suppose I fix the position p where cow k is placed.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

In other words, it's the length of the largest suffix starting from p+1 where all cows have lower ratings than cow k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

This is similar to finding the length of the decreasing sequence starting from p+1, where each cow has a lower rating than cow k, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

So, for each position p, the number of wins is equal to the position of the first cow after p that has a higher rating than cow k, minus p, minus one.

Wait, not quite. It's the number of cows after p with lower ratings than cow k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

So, it's the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, but actually, it's a bit more involved because the tournament is sequential.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the tournament tree.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the matches are conducted in a specific order, and the winner advances.

So, if I place cow k in position p, then it will first play against position p+1, then the winner of that plays against position p+2, and so on, until it loses.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic because it doesn't account for the fact that the winner advances to play against the next cow, not necessarily in a straight sequence.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the winner of each match proceeds to play against the next cow in line.

So, if cow k is in position p, and it has a higher rating than cow p+1, it advances and plays against cow p+2, and so on, until it loses.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k.

But, there's a catch: during this sequence, if there are cows with higher ratings, they would have already been eliminated before reaching cow k.

Wait, no. The tournament proceeds sequentially: first, cow p plays against cow p+1, then the winner plays against cow p+2, and so on.

So, if cow k is in position p, and its rating is higher than cow p+1, it advances to play against cow p+2, and so on, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, but this seems straightforward.

So, for position p, the number of wins is equal to the largest m such that for all i from p+1 to p+m, a_i < a_p, and a_{p+m+1} > a_p (if it exists).

In other words, it's the number of consecutive cows after p with lower ratings.

But, in practice, it's the number of cows after p with lower ratings before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

So, for each position p, I can precompute this value.

But again, iterating over all p is too slow.

Therefore, I need a way to find the optimal position p for cow k such that the number of wins is maximized.

Wait, but I can only choose to swap cow k with at most one other cow, or choose not to swap.

So, I need to consider all possible positions p where cow k can be placed: its original position, or any position q where I swap cow k with cow q.

Therefore, the possible positions for cow k are:

- Its original position k.

- Any position q, by swapping with cow q.

So, in total, there are n possible positions for cow k.

But n can be up to 10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, so I need an efficient way to compute this.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum number of wins over all possible positions p for cow k.

Let me think about how to compute the number of wins for cow k at a given position p.

As discussed earlier, it's equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

So, for each position p, I can compute this value.

But doing this naively for each p is O(n), which is too slow for the constraints.

Therefore, I need a way to precompute these values efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute for each position p, the number of consecutive cows after p with lower ratings than a_p, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

This can be done in O(n) time for all p using a stack or some similar data structure.

Once I have this array, say wins[p], I can then consider all possible positions p where cow k can be placed, which are:

- Its original position k.

- Any position q, by swapping with cow q.

Therefore, for each possible p, I need to consider placing cow k at p, which means setting a_p to a_k, and adjusting the array accordingly.

Wait, but if I place cow k at position p, I need to set a_p to a_k, and set a_k to a_p.

Because swapping involves exchanging the positions of cow k and another cow q.

Wait, no, in the problem, I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow q, or do nothing.

So, effectively, I can choose to place cow k at any position p, provided that I set the cow at position p to its original position.

Wait, no.

Actually, when I swap cow k with cow q, I exchange the positions of cow k and cow q.

So, cow k is now at position q, and cow q is at position k.

Therefore, to consider all possible positions p for cow k, I need to consider p being either k (no swap), or any q where I swap k and q.

So, in other words, I need to consider p = k, or p = q for any q != k.

But q can be any position, so p can be any position from 1 to n.

Therefore, I need to consider placing cow k at any position p, and compute the number of wins for cow k at that position.

Then, choose the position p that maximizes the number of wins.

Wait, but when I place cow k at position p, I need to set a_p to a_k, and set a_k to a_p.

Because I'm swapping the positions of cow k and cow p.

Wait, more precisely, if I swap cow k with cow q, then cow k is now at position q, and cow q is at position k.

So, in the array a, a[q] becomes a_k, and a[k] becomes a_q.

Therefore, to consider all possible positions p for cow k, I need to consider p = k (no swap), or p = q for any q != k, by swapping k and q.

So, in other words, I need to consider all positions p from 1 to n, and compute the number of wins for cow k at position p, where:

- If p = k, then a_p = a_k.

- If p != k, then a_p = a_k, and a_k = a_p.

Wait, more carefully:

- If p = k, no swap, a_p remains a_k.

- If p != k, swap a_k and a_p, so a_p becomes a_k, and a_k becomes a_p.

Therefore, for each position p, I need to compute the number of wins for cow k at position p, considering the array a with a_p set to a_k and a_k set to a_p.

Wait, but this seems time-consuming.

Is there a smarter way to do this?

Let me consider that the number of wins for cow k at position p is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_p (which is a_k after the swap).

So, for each position p, I need to know:

- The number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k.

- Until I encounter a cow with a higher rating than a_k.

So, perhaps I can precompute for each position p, the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k.

But a_k is fixed, it's the rating of cow k.

Wait, but if I swap cow k with cow q, then a_p becomes a_k, so I need to consider a_p = a_k for p = q.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix cow k's position to p.

Then, the array becomes:

- a_p = a_k

- a_k = a_p (original a_p)

And all other a_i remain the same.

Then, I need to compute the number of wins for cow k at position p in this new array.

But computing this for each p is O(n), which is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins a cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that come after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, for cow k at position p, the number of wins is the length of the longest suffix starting from p+1 where a_i < a_p, until a_i > a_p.

This can be precomputed for all p in O(n) time.

But since I need to consider placing cow k at any position p, and for each p, compute the number of wins, I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p.

To do this efficiently, I need to find for each p, the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, until a cow with a higher rating than a_k is encountered.

So, I need to find, for each p, the first cow after p that has a higher rating than a_k, and count the number of cows between p and that cow that have lower ratings than a_k.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can think of it as:

- For each p, find the first cow after p that has a higher rating than a_k.

- The number of wins is the number of cows between p and that cow minus one (since the first match is against p+1).

Wait, but I need to consider that the tournament proceeds sequentially, so it's the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_p (which is a_k).

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each p, the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

Then, I can find the maximum among these values for all p.

But even better, perhaps I can find specific positions where placing cow k would maximize its wins.

Let me consider that if I place cow k at position p, then the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

So, to maximize this, I need to place cow k at a position p where:

- There are as many cows after p as possible that have lower ratings than a_k.

- And the first cow after these has a higher rating than a_k.

So, I need to find the position p that maximizes this count.

But to do this efficiently, I need a way to compute this without iterating over all p.

Let me consider that the tournament is essentially a process where the current winner faces the next cow in line, and the one with the higher rating advances.

So, if I place cow k at position p, it will face the cows after p in sequence, winning against those with lower ratings and losing to the first one with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins is the number of cows after p with lower ratings than a_k, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

So, to maximize this, I need to place cow k as early as possible in the sequence, provided that there are no cows before it with higher ratings that would defeat it earlier.

Wait, but I can only swap cow k with one other cow, or keep it in its original position.

So, I need to consider the positions where I can place cow k by swapping it with another cow.

Therefore, the possible positions are:

- Its original position k.

- Any position q, by swapping with cow q.

So, in total, there are n possible positions for cow k.

Given that n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, I need a way to compute this efficiently for each test case.

Let me think about the optimal position to place cow k.

If I place cow k at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

So, to maximize this, I need to place cow k at the earliest possible position where there are many cows with lower ratings after it.

However, if I place cow k too early, there might be cows with higher ratings before it that would defeat it earlier.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, since the matches are sequential and the winner advances, the position of cow k matters in terms of when it enters the tournament.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider two scenarios:

1. Cow k stays in its original position or is swapped to a position where it participates later in the tournament.

2. By swapping, I can place cow k earlier in the sequence, allowing it to face more cows and potentially win more matches.

But I need to be careful because if I place cow k too early, it might face a cow with a higher rating and lose early, reducing its number of wins.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, the matches are sequential, and the winner advances to the next match.

So, if I place cow k at position p, it will first face position p+1, then the winner of that faces p+2, and so on, until it loses.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k.

So, to maximize this, I need to find the position p where the number of consecutive cows after p with lower ratings than a_k is maximized.

But I can only choose p to be either k or any q by swapping k and q.

So, I need to find the maximum number of wins over all possible p.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p.

Then, among all possible p (which are all positions from 1 to n), find the maximum number of wins.

But computing this for each p is too slow for the constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the number of wins for cow k at position p is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, until a_i > a_k.

So, for each p, I can compute this value.

But to do this efficiently, I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the number of consecutive lower ratings until a higher rating is encountered.

This way, I can compute for each p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p.

Then, I can find the maximum among these values.

But I need to consider that when I place cow k at position p, I need to set a_p to a_k, and set a_k to a_p.

Wait, more precisely:

- If p == k, then a_p remains a_k.

- If p != k, then swap a_p and a_k.

Therefore, for each p, I need to set a_p to a_k, and a_k to a_p.

Then, compute the number of wins for cow k at position p in this new array.

But this seems time-consuming.

Is there a way to compute this without actually swapping?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I fix p, and set a_p to a_k and a_k to a_p.

Then, the array becomes:

- a_p = a_k

- a_k = a_p

- All other a_i remain the same.

Then, the number of wins for cow k at position p is the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_p (which is a_k), until a_i > a_k.

So, it's the same as counting the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

Therefore, for each p, I can compute this value without actually swapping the array.

I can precompute for each position p, the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

Then, the number of wins for cow k at position p is this precomputed value.

Then, I can find the maximum among these values for all p.

But again, iterating over all p is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the number of wins for cow k at position p is equal to the number of consecutive a_i < a_k starting from p+1, until a_i > a_k.

So, for each p, I need to find the smallest m such that a_{p+m+1} > a_k, and the number of wins is m.

If there is no such m, then m = n - p - 1.

But computing this for each p is O(n), which is too slow.

Is there a way to compute this for all p in O(n) time?

Yes, I can precompute for each position p, the next position after p where a_i > a_k.

Then, the number of wins is next - p - 1.

This can be done using a stack to find the next greater element for each p.

Here's how it works:

- Traverse the array from left to right.

- For each position p, find the smallest q > p such that a_q > a_k.

- Then, the number of wins for p is q - p - 1.

- If no such q exists, then it's n - p - 1.

I can precompute this for all p in O(n) time using a stack.

Once I have this array, say wins[p], then the number of wins for cow k at position p is wins[p].

Then, I need to find the maximum wins[p] over all p where p is either k or p is a position where I can swap k with p.

But since I can swap k with any p, p can be any position from 1 to n.

Therefore, I can simply take the maximum of wins[p] for all p from 1 to n.

Wait, but I need to consider that if p == k, then a_p = a_k, which is already the case.

If p != k, then I need to swap a_p and a_k, meaning a_p becomes a_k and a_k becomes a_p.

But in the wins[p], I'm considering a_p = a_k, which is correct for p == k or p != k after swapping.

Wait, but in reality, when p != k, swapping a_p and a_k means that a_p becomes a_k and a_k becomes a_p.

So, in the wins[p], I need to set a_p = a_k and a_k = a_p.

But in the wins[p] calculation, I need to consider a_p = a_k, and then find the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

Wait, but a_k is fixed, so in wins[p], I'm already setting a_p = a_k.

But in reality, when p != k, swapping a_p and a_k means that a_k becomes a_p.

So, in the wins[p], I need to set a_p = a_k, but a_k = a_p.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I want to place cow k at position p.

Then, I need to set a_p = a_k, and a_k = a_p.

Then, the number of wins for cow k at position p is the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_p (which is a_k), until a_i > a_k.

But in this new array, a_k = a_p.

So, in the tournament, cow k at position p will face the cows after p with a_i < a_k until it faces a cow with a_i > a_k.

Therefore, the number of wins is the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

So, for each p, I can precompute this value.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum over all p of wins[p].

But as I said earlier, computing this for each p is O(n), which is too slow for t=10^4.

Therefore, I need a way to compute this efficiently for all p.

I can precompute for each p, the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

This can be done in O(n) time using a stack.

Here's how:

- Initialize an array wins of size n, all zeros.

- Initialize an empty stack.

- Traverse the array from right to left.

- For each p from n-1 down to 0:

- While the stack is not empty and a[stack.top()] <= a_k:

- Pop the stack.

- If the stack is empty:

- wins[p] = n - p - 1

- Else:

- wins[p] = stack.top() - p - 1

- Push p onto the stack.

This way, for each p, wins[p] contains the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value in the wins array.

But wait, in the problem, the tournament proceeds in a specific way: first match is between position 1 and 2, then the winner plays against position 3, and so on.

So, the order in which the matches are conducted is fixed based on the positions.

But in my earlier approach, I assumed that placing cow k at position p would make it face position p+1, then p+2, etc., which might not be accurate because the tournament structure is such that the matches are between the current winner and the next cow in line.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the tournament more carefully.

Let me consider the tournament process:

- First match: pos1 vs pos2.

- Winner of match1 vs pos3.

- Winner of above vs pos4.

- And so on, until all cows have participated.

So, it's like a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current champion and the next cow in line.

Therefore, the matches are sequential, and the winner advances to the next match.

Given this structure, if cow k is at position p, then it will participate in the tournament when it's its turn, i.e., after the first p-1 matches.

Wait, no.

Actually, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match1: pos1 vs pos2.

- Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3.

- Match3: winner of match2 vs pos4.

- ...

- Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs pos n.

So, in this structure, each match i (starting from 0) is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

Therefore, if cow k is at position p, it will participate in match p-1.

Then, if it wins, it will proceed to match p, and so on.

So, the number of wins for cow k is equal to the number of matches it wins starting from match p-1.

Given that, I need to find the maximum number of wins for cow k by choosing the best position p to place it.

This seems more involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where cow k is placed.

Then, in the tournament, cow k will participate in match p-1.

If it wins, it proceeds to match p, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of matches it wins starting from match p-1.

Given that, I need to determine how many matches it can win starting from match p-1.

But this seems tricky to compute directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the ratings of the cows and see how cow k's rating compares to the other cows.

Let me consider that the tournament is essentially a process where a champion is built sequentially.

Each match, the current champion faces the next cow, and the one with the higher rating becomes the new champion.

So, the champion's rating is non-decreasing over the matches.

If I place cow k at position p, then cow k becomes the champion starting from match p-1, provided that it wins against the previous champion.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think in terms of the champion's path.

The champion starts from match1 between pos1 and pos2.

Then, the winner becomes the champion and faces pos3 in match2.

This continues until pos n is faced.

So, the champion must defeat each subsequent cow in order.

Given that, if I place cow k at position p, then the champion up to match p-2 is some cow, and then match p-1 is between the champion and cow k.

If cow k has a higher rating, it becomes the new champion and proceeds to match p, and so on.

So, the number of wins for cow k is equal to the number of cows after position p that it can defeat, i.e., have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, this seems similar to what I thought earlier.

So, perhaps the number of wins for cow k at position p is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p with lower ratings than a_k, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

If that's the case, then I can precompute for each p, the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum among these values for all p.

But as I mentioned earlier, computing this for each p is O(n), which is too slow for t=10^4.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider that I can precompute for each p, the next position q > p where a_q > a_k.

Then, the number of wins is q - p - 1.

I can compute next[q] for all q in O(n) time using a stack.

Here's how:

- Initialize an array next of size n, initialized to n.

- Initialize an empty stack.

- Traverse the array from left to right.

- For each p from 0 to n-1:

- While the stack is not empty and a[p] > a_k:

- Pop the stack and set next[stack.top()] = p

- Push p onto the stack.

Then, for each p, wins[p] = next[p] - p - 1

This way, I can compute wins[p] for all p in O(n) time.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value in wins[p] for all p.

But in the problem, I can only choose to swap cow k with at most one other cow, or choose not to swap.

So, I need to consider all possible positions p for cow k, which are:

- Its original position k.

- Any position q, by swapping k and q.

Therefore, I need to consider p from 1 to n, and choose the p that maximizes wins[p].

But in the above approach, I compute wins[p] assuming that cow k is at position p, i.e., a_p = a_k.

But in reality, if I place cow k at position p, then a_p = a_k, and a_k = a_p.

So, I need to adjust the array accordingly.

Wait, but in the wins[p] calculation, I'm considering a_p = a_k, which is correct for the position p where cow k is placed.

But I need to make sure that in the rest of the array, the ratings are adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each p, setting a_p = a_k and a_k = a_p, and then compute the number of wins for cow k at position p.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Is there a way to compute this without actually swapping the array?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I fix p, and set a_p = a_k and a_k = a_p.

Then, to compute the number of wins for cow k at position p, I need to consider the new array with a_p = a_k and a_k = a_p.

Then, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_p (which is a_k), until a_i > a_k.

But in this new array, a_k = a_p (which is the original a_p).

So, in the tournament, cow k at position p will face the cows after p with a_i < a_p until it faces a cow with a_i > a_p.

Wait, but a_p is now a_k, so a_i < a_k until a_i > a_k.

So, it's similar to the earlier case.

Therefore, perhaps I can precompute for each p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p, considering a_p = a_k.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum among these wins[p].

To compute wins[p] for all p in O(n) time, I can use the stack method as described earlier.

Here's the plan:

- Find the position of cow k, which is k.

- Find a_k = a[k-1] (since positions are 1-based).

- Precompute for each p, the number of consecutive a_i < a_k after p, until a_i > a_k.

- This can be done using a stack in O(n) time.

- Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value in wins[p] for all p.

But in the problem, I can only choose to swap cow k with at most one other cow, or choose not to swap.

So, I need to consider all possible positions p for cow k, which are:

- p = k (no swap).

- p = q for any q != k, by swapping k and q.

Therefore, I need to consider all p from 1 to n.

But in the above approach, I'm considering all p from 1 to n, which includes p = k and p != k.

So, perhaps I can proceed with this approach.

Let me verify this with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

6 5

7 2 727 10 12 13

2 2

1000000000 1

Sample Output:

1

2

0

Let's take the first test case:

n=6, k=1

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

a_k = a[0] = 12

I need to compute for each p from 0 to 5, the number of consecutive a_i < 12 after p, until a_i > 12.

Let's compute next[p] for each p:

- p=0: a[0]=12

- Look for the first a_q > 12 after p=0.

- a[1]=10 < 12

- a[2]=14 > 12

- So, next[0] = 2

- wins[0] = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1

- p=1: a[1]=10 < 12

- Look for the first a_q > 12 after p=1.

- a[2]=14 > 12

- So, next[1] = 2

- wins[1] = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0

- p=2: a[2]=14 > 12

- No a_q > 12 after p=2.

- next[2] = 6

- wins[2] = 6 - 2 - 1 = 3

- p=3: a[3]=11 < 12

- Look for the first a_q > 12 after p=3.

- a[4]=8 < 12

- a[5]=3 < 12

- No a_q > 12 after p=3.

- next[3] = 6

- wins[3] = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2

- p=4: a[4]=8 < 12

- Look for the first a_q > 12 after p=4.

- a[5]=3 < 12

- No a_q > 12 after p=4.

- next[4] = 6

- wins[4] = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1

- p=5: a[5]=3 < 12

- No a_q > 12 after p=5.

- next[5] = 6

- wins[5] = 6 - 5 - 1 = 0

So, wins = [1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0]

The maximum wins is 3.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, there must be something wrong with this approach.

In the sample explanation, it says that for the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing, and cow k=1 wins 1 match.

But according to my approach, the maximum wins is 3, which contradicts the sample output.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe I'm miscounting the number of wins.

Let me simulate the tournament for the first test case with different placements of cow k.

Original array: [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

k=1, a_k=12

Option 1: Do nothing.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10). Winner: 12

Match2: Winner (12) vs pos3 (14). Winner: 14

Match3: Winner (14) vs pos4 (11). Winner: 14

Match4: Winner (14) vs pos5 (8). Winner: 14

Match5: Winner (14) vs pos6 (3). Winner: 14

Cow k=1 (rating 12) wins 1 match.

Option 2: Swap k=1 with pos3 (14).

New array: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10). Winner: 14

Match2: Winner (14) vs pos3 (12). Winner: 14

Match3: Winner (14) vs pos4 (11). Winner: 14

Match4: Winner (14) vs pos5 (8). Winner: 14

Match5: Winner (14) vs pos6 (3). Winner: 14

Cow k=1 (original rating 12, now at pos3 with rating 12)

Wait, no.

Wait, if I swap k=1 with pos3, then cow k=1 (rating 12) is now at pos3, and cow pos3 (rating 14) is now at pos1.

So, new array: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

Now, cow k=1 is at pos3 with rating 12.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (14) vs
