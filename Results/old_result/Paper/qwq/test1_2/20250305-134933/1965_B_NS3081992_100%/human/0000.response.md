Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should have two properties:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except for k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to make sure that my sequence has at most 25 elements.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3], [2], and [1, 2, 3] are all subsequences.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. It seems like I need to cover all sums from 1 to n except for k.

One approach that comes to mind is to use the concept of subset sums. If I have a set of numbers, the subset sums are all the possible sums I can get by choosing subsets of these numbers.

I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n except for k are achievable, and k is not achievable.

This sounds similar to creating a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n except for one specific sum, k.

I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, I can generate any sum from 1 to the sum of all elements in the set. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k, while still being able to make all other sums from 1 to n.

So, maybe I can start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

Alternatively, I can try to construct the set in such a way that k is impossible to achieve, while ensuring that all other sums are possible.

Let me think about the constraints. The sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element is a non-negative integer, up to 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^7, I need an efficient way to construct the sequence.

I need to find a general method that works for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

- Subsequences: [], [1] with sums 0 and 1.

- No subsequence sums to 2, which is k.

- For v=1, which is v != k, there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

Good.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- Possible subsequences and their sums:

- [2]: 2

- [3]: 3

- [4]: 4

- [5]: 5

- [6]: 6

- [2,3]: 5

- [2,4]: 6

- [3,4]: 7

- etc.

- Missing sum 1, which is k.

- All other sums from 2 to 6 are achievable.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Seven 1's.

- Subsequences can sum from 0 to 7, but not 8.

- All sums from 1 to 7 are achievable except for k=8.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Possible sums:

- 7,1,4,1

- Combinations:

- 7+1=8

- 7+4=11

- 7+1+1=9

- 1+4=5

- 1+1=2

- 7+4+1=12

- 7+4+1+1=13

- etc.

- Missing sum 3.

- Other sums from 1 to 9 are achievable except 3.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- Possible sums:

- 1,2,8,3

- 1+2=3

- 1+8=9

- 1+3=4

- 2+8=10

- 2+3=5

- 8+3=11

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+2+3=6

- 1+8+3=12

- 2+8+3=13

- 1+2+8+3=14

- Missing sum 7.

- Other sums from 1 to 10 are achievable except 7.

From these examples, I can see that different strategies are used for different values of n and k.

In the second test case, the sequence consists of numbers from 2 to 6, excluding 1, which is k.

In the third test case, all ones are used to achieve sums from 1 to 7.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, a mix of numbers is used to cover the required sums except for k.

So, I need a general method to construct such a sequence.

Let me think about the properties required.

I need a set A with at most 25 elements, all non-negative integers up to 10^9, such that:

- The subset sum k is not achievable.

- All subset sums v (1 <= v <= n, v != k) are achievable.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient way to construct A.

I need to make sure that for each test case, the sequence A satisfies the conditions.

Also, since m <= 25, I need to keep the sequence short, which might require carefully choosing the elements to cover the required sums efficiently.

Let me consider the properties of subset sums.

If I have a set A, the subset sums are all possible sums of subsets of A.

I need to ensure that all v from 1 to n except k are achievable.

Also, k should not be achievable.

One way to approach this is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

But how?

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

For example, if I include 1, I can make sum 1.

If I include 2, I can make sums 2 and 3 (1+2).

If I include 4, I can make sums up to 7 (1+2+4), and so on.

This is similar to binary representation, where powers of 2 allow me to make any sum.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can use a modified version of the binary approach.

Wait, in the third test case, where n=8 and k=8, the sequence is seven 1's.

With seven 1's, I can make sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

This works for that specific case.

But for other cases, I might need a different approach.

Another idea is to include elements that sum up to all values except k.

I need to ensure that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be achieved is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

At the same time, all other sums from 1 to n (except k) should be achievable.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed.

Since m can be up to 25, and 2^25 is over 33 million, which is larger than n's maximum of 10^6, it seems feasible to cover the required sums.

But I need to optimize the number of elements and ensure that k is excluded.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m elements, I can have up to 2^m - 1 distinct non-zero subset sums.

Given m <= 25, 2^25 - 1 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

I need a way to ensure that k is not achievable, while all other sums from 1 to n are.

One approach could be to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to make k unachievable.

For example, if I have a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and k is achievable, I can try to remove or modify some elements to make k unachievable, while keeping the other sums achievable.

Alternatively, I can try to construct the set in such a way that k is impossible to achieve, while ensuring that all other sums are possible.

Let me consider the properties of k.

If k is 1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are achievable.

Similarly, if k is n, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to n, but all sums from 1 to n-1 are achievable.

In general, k can be any value between 1 and n inclusive.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= k <= n, but in the sample input, k is at least 1 and n is at least 2.

I need to handle all cases where k can be any value between 1 and n inclusive.

Let me consider different cases for k.

Case 1: k = 1

If k = 1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are achievable.

In this case, I can choose elements all greater than or equal to 2.

For example, if n=2, k=2, then I can choose [1], but wait, in the sample input, for n=2, k=2, the sequence is [1], which can sum to 1, but not to 2.

Wait, but 1 is less than 2, so it's allowed.

Wait, in this case, since k=2, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 2, but I can have sums up to n=2, which is just 1 in this case.

Wait, n=2, k=2, so v can be 1 (since v != k), and [1] achieves sum 1, and no subsequence sums to 2.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which can sum to all values from 2 to 15, but not 1.

This covers all v from 1 to 6 except k=1.

Wait, but with elements starting from 2, I can make sums starting from 2.

But in this case, since k=1, and v cannot be k, so v starts from 2 to n.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "for all 1 <= v <= n where v != k", so in this case, v starts from 2 to 6.

So, in this case, choosing elements starting from 2 upwards ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all sums from 2 to n are achievable.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, k=8, choosing seven 1's allows sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

This covers all v from 1 to 7, excluding k=8.

So, in this case, using multiple 1's allows me to achieve all sums from 1 to 7.

Wait, but with seven 1's, I can make sums from 0 to 7, which includes 1, but in this case, k=8, which is excluded.

Wait, but in this case, v can be from 1 to 8 except k=8, so sums from 1 to 7 are needed.

But with seven 1's, I can make sums from 0 to 7, which includes 1 to 7.

So, this works.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=9, k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Possible sums: 1,4,7,1; 1+4=5; 1+7=8; 4+7=11; 1+1=2; 1+4+7=12; 1+1+4=6; 1+1+7=9; 1+4+1=6; 7+1+4+1=13.

Missing sum 3.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=10, k=7, sequence is [1,2,8,3].

Possible sums: 1,2,8,3; 1+2=3; 1+8=9; 1+3=4; 2+8=10; 2+3=5; 8+3=11; 1+2+8=11; 1+2+3=6; 1+8+3=12; 2+8+3=13; 1+2+8+3=14.

Missing sum 7.

So, in this case, by choosing specific elements, I can cover all sums except for k.

Now, I need a general method to construct such a sequence for any n and k.

Let me consider different strategies based on the value of k.

First, if k = 1:

- I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all sums from 2 to n are achievable.

- To prevent any subsequence from summing to 1, I can choose all elements to be >= 2.

- Then, to achieve sums from 2 to n, I can include elements that cover these sums.

- For example, include elements that are powers of 2 starting from 2, i.e., 2,4,8,16,... up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

- This way, I can make any sum that is a combination of these powers of 2, starting from 2 up to the sum of all included powers.

- I need to make sure that the sum of all elements is at least n, to cover all sums up to n.

- However, this might not be sufficient if n is larger than the sum of the chosen powers of 2.

- To handle this, I can include additional elements to cover the higher sums.

- Alternatively, I can include elements that allow me to make any sum from 2 to n.

Similarly, for k > 1, I need to ensure that k cannot be achieved, while all other sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

This seems more challenging.

One idea is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to make k unachievable.

For example, if I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and k is achievable, I can try to remove or adjust some elements to make k unachievable, while keeping the other sums achievable.

Another idea is to split the range [1, n] into two parts: [1, k-1] and [k+1, n], and construct sets that can generate sums in these ranges without generating k.

But this might be complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except for k.

I need to ensure that:

- All sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

- Sum k is not achievable.

One way to ensure that k is not achievable is to ensure that no combination of elements in A sums to k.

At the same time, all other sums from 1 to n except k should be achievable.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or some other combinatorial approach.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I include elements that are powers of 2, I can generate any sum from 1 to the sum of all elements.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can include powers of 2 up to some point, and then adjust by including or excluding certain elements to make k unachievable.

Alternatively, I can include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that generate all sums up to n, and then adjust the set to remove the possibility of achieving k.

But I need to be careful not to affect the achievability of other sums.

Another idea: If I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of A should cover all v from 1 to n except k.

This means that the set of subset sums of A is equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems complex to guarantee in general.

Let me think about smaller examples to find a pattern.

Example 1:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

Subsets: [], [1] with sums 0,1.

Cannot make 2, which is k.

Can make 1, which is v=1.

Good.

Example 2:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

Subsets:

[2]:2

[3]:3

[4]:4

[5]:5

[6]:6

[2,3]:5

[2,4]:6

[3,4]:7

[2,3,4]:9

etc.

Cannot make 1, which is k.

Can make all v from 2 to 6.

Good.

Example 3:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Subsets:

Any sum from 0 to 7, cannot make 8.

Can make all v from 1 to 7.

Good.

Example 4:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Subsets:

[7]:7

[1]:1

[4]:4

[1]:1

[7,1]:8

[7,4]:11

[7,1]:8

[1,4]:5

[1,1]:2

[7,1,4]:12

[7,1,1]:9

[1,4,1]:6

[7,1,4,1]:13

Cannot make 3.

Can make all v from 1 to 9 except 3.

Good.

Example 5:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Subsets:

[1]:1

[2]:2

[8]:8

[3]:3

[1,2]:3

[1,8]:9

[1,3]:4

[2,8]:10

[2,3]:5

[8,3]:11

[1,2,8]:11

[1,2,3]:6

[1,8,3]:12

[2,8,3]:13

[1,2,8,3]:14

Cannot make 7.

Can make all v from 1 to 10 except 7.

Good.

From these examples, I can see that different strategies are used:

- For k=1, use elements >=2 to prevent sum=1, and include elements to cover sums from 2 to n.

- For k=n, use elements that can sum up to n-1, but not n.

- For intermediate k, include elements that can cover all sums except k.

I need a general method to handle any k.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. If k = 1:

- Choose elements all >=2, and ensure that their subset sums cover all v from 2 to n.

- For example, include elements 2,3,4,... up to n, but this might require more elements than allowed (m <=25).

- To minimize the number of elements, I can use higher values to cover larger sums.

- For instance, include powers of 2 starting from 2: 2,4,8,16,... This allows me to cover a wide range of sums with fewer elements.

- I need to make sure that the sum of these elements is at least n, to cover all sums up to n.

2. If k >1:

- I need to ensure that k cannot be achieved, but all other sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

- One way to do this is to have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- This can be achieved by combining smaller sets in a way that avoids k.

- For example, include elements that can generate sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

- But ensuring that k cannot be achieved requires careful selection.

- One idea is to include elements that can generate all sums except multiples of a certain number, but this might not directly apply.

- Another idea is to include elements that can generate all sums up to n, and then remove or adjust elements to make k unachievable.

- For instance, if I have a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and k is achievable, I can try to remove an element that is part of every subset that sums to k, thereby making k unachievable.

- However, this might affect other sums as well, which I need to compensate for.

- This seems complicated to implement in general.

Let me think of another approach.

Suppose I start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I can try to partition the sums into those less than k and those greater than k, and ensure that:

- All sums from 1 to k-1 are achievable.

- All sums from k+1 to n are achievable.

- Sum k is not achievable.

I can try to construct two separate sets:

- One that generates sums from 1 to k-1.

- One that generates sums from k+1 to n.

Then, combine them to form the final set A.

But this might not be efficient, and it's possible that some sums overlap.

Alternatively, I can use a single set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to k-1.

- Include elements that can generate all sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that no combination of these elements sums to k.

This way, I cover all required sums and exclude k.

But I need to make sure that the two parts don't combine to form k.

Wait, if I have two disjoint sets: one generating sums up to k-1 and the other generating sums starting from some value above k, their combined subsets should not sum to k.

But I need to be careful about the combinations of elements from both sets.

This might not be straightforward.

Let me consider a different angle.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I can think of this as the subset sums of A being equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of A are all v in [1,n] except v=k.

I need to find such a set A with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m <=25, it's feasible, but I need an efficient way to construct A.

Let me consider the properties of subset sums.

The subset sums of a set A form a set S.

I need S to be equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This is a specific S, missing only k.

I need to find A such that its subset sums exactly match S.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can use some mathematical properties to achieve this.

One idea is to use the fact that if A can generate all sums from 1 to s, then the number of subset sums is s, assuming all sums are distinct.

In this case, I need s = n -1 (since I'm excluding k).

But I need to ensure that the missing sum is exactly k.

This seems difficult to control directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I can try to start with a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

For example, if I have a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and I can identify a specific subset that sums to k, I can remove one element from that subset, making k unachievable.

However, this might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, I can try to adjust the set in a way that k becomes unachievable, while keeping the other sums achievable.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I can try to split A into two disjoint sets B and C.

- B generates sums from 1 to k-1.

- C generates sums from k+1 to n.

- And ensure that no combination of elements from B and C sums to k.

This way, k is excluded, and all other sums are covered.

But I need to make sure that the combination of B and C doesn't allow any subset to sum to k.

This could be achieved if the sums from B and C are such that no sum from B plus any sum from C equals k.

But this seems complicated to ensure in general.

Let me consider specific constructions based on the value of k.

Case 1: k =1

- Need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all sums from 2 to n are achievable.

- To prevent any subsequence from summing to 1, I can choose all elements >=2.

- Then, I need to ensure that all sums from 2 to n are achievable with these elements.

- One way to do this is to include elements that are powers of 2 starting from 2: 2,4,8,16,...

- With these elements, I can make any sum that is a combination of these powers, starting from 2 up to the sum of all included elements.

- To cover sums up to n, I need to include enough powers of 2 such that their sum is at least n.

- For example, if n=10, include 2,4,8, since 2+4+8=14 >=10.

- This way, I can make any sum from 2 to 14, which covers 2 to 10.

- So, for k=1, choosing powers of 2 starting from 2 up to the smallest power of 2 greater than n is sufficient.

Case 2: k >1

- Need to ensure that k cannot be achieved, but all other sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

- This is more tricky.

- One idea is to include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n, without allowing any subset to sum to k.

- To achieve this, perhaps I can include elements that are necessary to generate the required sums and exclude any elements that would allow sum k to be achieved.

- This seems too vague.

Let me consider the following strategy for k >1:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to k-1.

- Include additional elements to generate sums from k+1 to n, ensuring that k cannot be achieved.

- To prevent k from being achievable, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

- One way to do this is to ensure that the subset sums that add up to k are impossible.

- For example, if k cannot be expressed as a sum of any combination of the included elements, then it's impossible to achieve k.

- But ensuring this in general is difficult.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed.

Given that m <=25, and 2^25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

So, in terms of the number of elements, it's feasible.

But I need to choose the elements carefully to satisfy the conditions.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- Use a greedy algorithm to select elements that cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing k to be achieved.

- This might involve selecting elements that fill in the gaps in the subset sums.

But this seems too vague and not straightforward to implement.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix a set A with m elements, and I want to check if its subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of A are exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems difficult to check directly for large n.

I need a smarter way to construct A.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k by carefully choosing their values.

- For example, include elements that are just enough to cover the required sums.

- This might involve including elements that are equal to the differences between the required sums.

But this is not clear.

Let me consider the following construction:

- Include elements that are 1 repeated multiple times to cover sums from 1 to m, where m <k.

- Then include larger elements to cover higher sums up to n, ensuring that k cannot be achieved.

- For example, include (k-1) and (k+1), and adjust accordingly.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if there is a pattern.

In the second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- All elements >=2, covering sums from 2 to 6.

In the third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Seven 1's, covering sums from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

In the fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Can make sums: 1,4,7,1; 1+4=5; 1+7=8; 4+7=11; 1+1=2; 1+4+7=12; 1+1+4=6; 1+1+7=9; 1+4+1=6; 7+1+4+1=13.

- Missing sum 3.

In the fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- Can make sums: 1,2,8,3; 1+2=3; 1+8=9; 1+3=4; 2+8=10; 2+3=5; 8+3=11; 1+2+8=11; 1+2+3=6; 1+8+3=12; 2+8+3=13; 1+2+8+3=14.

- Missing sum 7.

From these, I can see that for k=1, using elements >=2 works.

For k=n, using elements that can sum up to n-1 works.

For intermediate k, using a combination of small and large elements to cover the required sums except k works.

So, perhaps a general approach is:

- If k=1, choose elements >=2 that can sum up to at least n.

- If k>1, include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- To ensure that k cannot be achieved, perhaps include elements that are factors of the required sums, avoiding combinations that sum to k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a set A, and I want its subset sums to be all v from 1 to n except k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of A are equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This is a specific target set for the subset sums.

I need to find a set A with at most 25 elements that achieves this.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can use the fact that the subset sums form a specific set.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- Use a greedy algorithm to select elements that cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing k to be achieved.

- This might involve selecting elements that fill in the gaps in the subset sums.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Let me consider the following construction:

- If k=1, choose elements >=2 and ensure their subset sums cover 2 to n.

- For k>1, include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n, without allowing any subset to sum to k.

- To prevent k from being achieved, I can include elements that are just above k or have specific values that make it impossible to reach k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider the following specific construction:

- Include elements that are powers of 2 up to a certain point, and adjust for k.

- For example, include 1,2,4,8,... up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

- Then, adjust the set to exclude k.

- If k is a power of 2, remove it from the set.

- But this might not work, because removing a power of 2会影响其他和。

- 另外，如果k不是2的幂，我需要找到一种方法来防止k被实现，同时保持其他和。

- 这似乎很困难。

让我考虑另一个角度。

假设我有一个集合A，其子集和是{1,2,...,n}\{k}。

这意味着集合A的子集和涵盖了从1到n的所有整数，除了k。

我需要找到这样的一个集合A，它最多有25个元素。

给定n可以达到10^6，我需要一种有效的方法来构造A。

让我尝试使用生成函数的方法来思考这个问题。

集合A的子集和可以表示为生成函数的乘积。

具体来说，如果A={a1,a2,...,am}，那么子集和的生成函数是：

(1 + x^{a1}) * (1 + x^{a2}) * ... * (1 + x^{am})

我需要这个生成函数中x^v的系数大于0，对于所有1<=v<=n且v!=k，而x^k的系数为0。

这等价于：

- 对于所有v in {1,2,...,n}\{k}，生成函数中x^v的系数大于0。

- 生成函数中x^k的系数为0。

这看起来很复杂，但可能有一些技巧可以利用。

让我考虑生成函数的值在x=1处。

生成函数在x=1处的值等于2^m，因为每个(1 + x^{ai})在x=1时变为2。

所以生成函数在x=1处是2^m。

但是，我需要的是特定的系数为0或正数。

这可能不是直接帮助，但我可以考虑生成函数的性质。

让我尝试另一种方法。

假设我有一个集合A，它可以生成所有从1到s的和，其中s >= n。

然后，我需要确保k不能通过A的任何子集和来实现。

为了做到这一点，我需要确保没有子集的和等于k。

但是，如果A可以生成所有从1到s的和，那么它自然可以生成所有从1到s的和，除非我特意排除k。

这似乎与我的目标相矛盾。

也许我需要A的子集和覆盖{1,2,...,n}\{k}，并且没有其他不必要的和。

但这可能太严格了。

让我尝试一个不同的策略。

假设我有一个集合A，它的子集和正好是{1,2,...,n}\{k}。

这意味着A的子集和的集合是{1,2,...,n}\{k}。

这等价于说，A的子集和的集合是{1,2,...,n}减去{k}。

这似乎很难直接构造，所以我需要一个间接的方法。

让我考虑将A分成两部分：B和C。

- B生成{1,2,...,k-1}。

- C生成{k+1,k+2,...,n}。

- 并且确保没有B的子集和C的子集的和等于k。

但这可能不足够，因为B和C的组合可能仍然能够生成k。

让我更具体一点。

假设B生成{1,2,...,k-1}，C生成{k+1,k+2,...,n}。

然后A = B union C。

现在，我需要确保没有A的子集的和等于k。

也就是说，没有B和C的子集的并集的和等于k。

为了防止这一点，我需要确保B的子集和与C的子集和的和不等于k。

但这可能太模糊了。

让我尝试一个具体的例子。

考虑n=9, k=3。

序列：[7,1,4,1]

子集和：1,4,7,1; 1+4=5; 1+7=8; 4+7=11; 1+1=2; 1+4+7=12; 1+1+4=6; 1+1+7=9; 1+4+1=6; 7+1+4+1=13。

缺失的和是3。

在这里，B={1,1}生成{1,2}，C={4,7}生成{4,7,11,12,13}。

结合B和C，可以生成{1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13}，缺失3。

这与上述策略类似。

所以，如果我选择B生成{1,2}，C生成{4,7,11,...}，那么结合它们可以生成更高的和，同时避免生成3。

这可能是一个可行的方法。

因此，对于k>1，我可以：

- 选择B生成{1,2,...,k-1}。

- 选择C生成{k+1,k+2,...,n}。

- 确保B和C的组合不生成k。

为了确保组合不生成k，我需要确保没有B的子集和C的子集的和等于k。

但这可能不足够，因为B和C的子集的和可能超过k。

让我更仔细地思考。

如果B生成{1,2,...,k-1}，C生成{k+1,k+2,...,n}，那么B的子集和是<=k-1，C的子集和>=k+1。

那么，B的子集和与C的子集和的和>=k+1。

因此，没有B的子集和C的子集的和等于k，因为k < k+1 <= 和。

所以，这种构造可以确保k不能通过B和C的子集和的和来实现。

因此，A = B union C可以满足条件。

具体来说：

- B生成{1,2,...,k-1}。

- C生成{k+1,k+2,...,n}。

- A = B union C。

- B和C的子集和的和>=k+1，因此k不能被实现。

- 同时，所有v in {1,2,...,k-1}可以通过B的子集和实现。

- 所有v in {k+1,k+2,...,n}可以通过C的子集和实现，或者B和C的组合。

但是，我需要确保B和C的组合可以生成所有v in {k+1,k+2,...,n}。

为了实现这一点，C本身需要能够生成从k+1到n的和。

如果C的元素选择得当，这可以实现。

例如，如果C包含元素{k+1, k+2, ..., n}，那么显然可以生成从k+1到n的和。

但是，这样可能需要太多的元素，因为m<=25。

所以，我需要更高效地选择C的元素，以覆盖从k+1到n的和。

一个有效的方法是选择C的元素为k+1, (k+1)+1, (k+1)+2, etc.

但这可能仍然需要很多元素。

更好的方法是选择C的元素为较大的数，以便覆盖更大的和。

例如，选择C的元素为k+1, 2*(k+1), 4*(k+1), 8*(k+1), etc.

这样，通过组合这些元素，可以生成从k+1到多倍k+1的和。

但是，这可能不足以覆盖所有从k+1到
