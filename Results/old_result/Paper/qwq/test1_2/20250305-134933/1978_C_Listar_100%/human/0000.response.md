Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find a permutation of length n such that the Manhattan value, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each element and its position, equals a given k. If no such permutation exists, I should output "No"; otherwise, "Yes" and the permutation.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan value represents. For a permutation p of length n, the Manhattan value is calculated as |p1 - 1| + |p2 - 2| + ... + |pn - n|. So, it's essentially the total distance that each element has moved from its original position.

Let's look at the example given:

- For permutation [1, 2, 3], the Manhattan value is 0 because each element is in its original position.

- For [3, 1, 2], it's |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

So, for a given n and k, I need to find a permutation where this sum equals k, or determine that it's not possible.

I need to think about the possible values of k for a given n. What's the minimum and maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length n?

- The minimum is 0, which occurs when the permutation is the identity permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

- The maximum would be achieved when each element is as far away as possible from its original position.

Let's try to find a general formula for the maximum Manhattan value.

For each position i, the maximum distance for pi is |i - (n - i + 1)|, but I need to think differently.

Wait, no. The maximum distance for any element is when it's placed as far as possible from its original position. For element i, the farthest it can be moved is to position 1 if i is n, or to position n if i is 1.

Wait, more precisely, the maximum distance for any element i is n - i.

But to find the maximum sum, I need to consider how to arrange the permutation to maximize the sum of these distances.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns in small n.

Let's try n=3:

Possible permutations and their Manhattan values:

- [1,2,3]: 0

- [1,3,2]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

- [2,1,3]: |2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

- [2,3,1]: |2-1| + |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

- [3,1,2]: |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

- [3,2,1]: |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4

So, for n=3, the maximum Manhattan value is 4.

Similarly, for n=4:

- [1,2,3,4]: 0

- [1,2,4,3]: |1-1| + |2-2| + |4-3| + |3-4| = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

- [1,3,2,4]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |4-4| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

- [1,3,4,2]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |4-3| + |2-4| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

- [1,4,2,3]: |1-1| + |4-2| + |2-3| + |3-4| = 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

- [1,4,3,2]: |1-1| + |4-2| + |3-3| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4

- [2,1,3,4]: |2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| + |4-4| = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2

- [2,1,4,3]: |2-1| + |1-2| + |4-3| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

- [2,3,1,4]: |2-1| + |3-2| + |1-3| + |4-4| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 4

- [2,3,4,1]: |2-1| + |3-2| + |4-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6

- [2,4,1,3]: |2-1| + |4-2| + |1-3| + |3-4| = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6

- [2,4,3,1]: |2-1| + |4-2| + |3-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 6

- [3,1,2,4]: |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4

- [3,1,4,2]: |3-1| + |1-2| + |4-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6

- [3,2,1,4]: |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4

- [3,2,4,1]: |3-1| + |2-2| + |4-3| + |1-4| = 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 6

- [3,4,1,2]: |3-1| + |4-2| + |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8

- [3,4,2,1]: |3-1| + |4-2| + |2-3| + |1-4| = 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 8

- [4,1,2,3]: |4-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

- [4,1,3,2]: |4-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| + |2-4| = 3 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 6

- [4,2,1,3]: |4-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| + |3-4| = 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6

- [4,2,3,1]: |4-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| + |1-4| = 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 6

- [4,3,1,2]: |4-1| + |3-2| + |1-3| + |2-4| = 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8

- [4,3,2,1]: |4-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |1-4| = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8

So, for n=4, the maximum Manhattan value is 8.

Looking at n=3, max is 4; n=4, max is 8. It seems like the maximum is n^2/2 for even n, and (n^2-1)/2 for odd n.

Wait, for n=3: (9-1)/2 = 4, which matches.

For n=4: 16/2 = 8, which matches.

So, in general, max_k = floor(n^2 / 2).

I need to confirm this.

Let's see for n=1: max_k = 0, which is correct.

n=2: max_k = 1, since [2,1]: |2-1| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, but wait, 2^2 / 2 = 2, which matches.

n=3: (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, matches.

n=4: 4^2 / 2 = 8, matches.

n=5: (25-1)/2 = 12, let's verify.

For n=5, the maximum should be 12.

Let's consider [5,4,3,2,1]:

|5-1| + |4-2| + |3-3| + |2-4| + |1-5| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12, yes.

So, the formula seems correct: max_k = floor(n^2 / 2).

Also, k must be between 0 and max_k, inclusive.

But looking back at the problem, k can be up to 10^12, but n is up to 2*10^5, so max_k for n=2*10^5 is floor((2*10^5)^2 / 2) = floor(4*10^10 / 2) = 2*10^10, which is less than 10^12. So, for larger k beyond max_k, it's impossible.

But in the problem, k can be up to 10^12, but for n=2*10^5, k up to 2*10^10 is possible.

But the problem says 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, but for n=1, k=10^12 is way beyond max_k=0, so it's impossible.

So, in the code, I need to check if k > max_k, then output "No".

Also, from the example, when n=1 and k=10^12, it's impossible, so "No".

Now, I need to find a way to construct a permutation with Manhattan value equal to k, given that 0 ≤ k ≤ max_k.

First, I need to check if such a permutation exists.

From the examples and my calculations, it seems that for k from 0 to max_k, with some constraints.

But looking back at n=3, k=4 is possible, k=5 is not possible (since max_k=4 for n=3), but in the second test case, n=4 and k=5 is "No", which is consistent.

Wait, n=4, max_k=8, but k=5 is "No", which suggests that not all k between 0 and max_k are achievable.

Wait, in n=4, max_k=8, and possible k values are 0,2,4,6,8.

From the list above for n=4, the possible sums are 0,2,4,6,8.

So, only even k are possible.

Similarly, for n=3, possible k are 0,2,4.

So, it seems that only even k are achievable.

Wait, but for n=1, only k=0 is possible, which is even.

For n=2, possible k are 0 and 2, both even.

Wait, but n=2, [1,2]: k=0; [2,1]: k=2.

So, for n=2, only even k are possible.

Similarly for n=3 and n=4.

So, in general, for any n, only even k are possible.

Because the sum of absolute differences is always even.

Wait, why is that?

Let's see.

Each |pi - i| is an integer, and the sum of integers can be odd or even.

But in these cases, it's turning out to be even.

Wait, perhaps it's because the parity of the sum is even.

Wait, maybe it's because n is even, and the sum is even.

Wait, no, for n=3, which is odd, the possible k are even.

Wait, perhaps it's because the sum of |pi - i| over all i is always even.

I need to verify this.

Let's consider n=2:

Possible k: 0 and 2, both even.

n=3: 0,2,4, all even.

n=4: 0,2,4,6,8, all even.

So, it seems that the sum is always even.

Therefore, k must be even to have a solution.

Hence, in the code, if k is odd, output "No".

Additionally, k must be between 0 and max_k, and even.

But, is that sufficient?

Meaning, if k is even and 0 ≤ k ≤ max_k, then a permutation exists.

Is that true?

From the examples:

For n=3, k=0,2,4 are possible (all even, up to max_k=4).

For n=4, k=0,2,4,6,8 are possible (all even, up to max_k=8).

So, seems like for even k between 0 and max_k, inclusive, a permutation exists.

Hence, in code, if k is even and 0 ≤ k ≤ max_k, then "Yes" and output such a permutation; else, "No".

Now, I need to find a way to construct such a permutation for given n and k.

I need to think about how to construct a permutation with a specific Manhattan value.

One approach could be to start with the identity permutation, which has k=0, and then perform swaps to increase the Manhattan value step by step.

Each swap increases the Manhattan value by a certain amount.

But I need to think carefully about how to achieve the desired k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of inversions or some other property.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the positions where pi != i.

Each pi != i contributes at least 1 to the sum.

Wait, but |pi - i| can be more than 1.

I need a systematic way to construct the permutation.

Let me consider that the sum |pi - i| is equal to k.

I can try to maximize this sum by placing pi as far as possible from i.

But I need to achieve exactly k, which is more tricky.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the sum is equal to twice the number of inversions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider the sum as the total distance moved by all elements.

I need to arrange the elements such that the total distance is exactly k.

This seems similar to assigning distances to each element, summing up to k.

But with constraints because the positions must be a permutation.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the code provided and try to understand it.

Looking at the code:

- There's a function func_4() that reads n and k, and checks if k is odd or if k > max_k, in which case it returns (0,0), meaning no solution.

- Otherwise, it returns (n,k).

- func_1(n,k) is the main function that tries to construct the permutation.

- It seems to handle k as k//2, which suggests that it's dividing k by 2 somewhere.

- Then, it iterates from n down to -1 in steps of -2, which is strange because n is positive.

- It calls func_2 and func_3 to modify the permutation list.

- func_2 seems to swap elements in the list based on some calculation.

- func_3 also swaps elements.

- func_5 prints "YES" and the permutation.

- func_6 ties everything together.

I need to understand what's happening in func_1.

First, k = k // 2, which suggests that the actual sum to achieve is k, but divided by 2 for some reason.

Then, it initializes a list l from 1 to n.

Then, it iterates from i = n down to -1 in steps of -2.

Wait, range(n, -1, -2) means it goes from n to 0 in steps of -2.

For example, if n=3: i=3,1,-1, but -1 is not included.

If n=4: i=4,2,0.

It seems like it's considering pairs of elements to swap.

In each iteration, it calculates c +=1, which counts the number of iterations.

If k ==0, it returns the current list l.

If k < i -1, it calls func_2(c, k, l).

Else, it subtracts (i -1) from k and calls func_3(c, l).

This seems like it's trying to reduce k by making swaps that increase the Manhattan value by (i -1).

But I'm not fully following the logic.

Let me try to understand func_2 and func_3.

func_2(c, k, l):

- It swaps l[-c] and l[-c -k].

- Returns the modified list.

func_3(c, l):

- It swaps l[-c] and l[c -1].

- Returns the modified list.

So, in func_1, it seems to be adjusting the permutation by swapping elements based on c and k.

But I need to understand how this achieves the desired Manhattan value.

Perhaps the author has figured out a way to incrementally build the permutation by making specific swaps that add a certain amount to the Manhattan value.

But I need to verify if this approach works correctly for all cases.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take n=3, k=4.

First, k =4 //2 =2.

Initialize l=[1,2,3].

Iterate i from 3 to -1 step -2:

i=3:

c=1.

k=2.

k < i-1 => 2 < 3-1 => 2 < 2? No.

So, k = k - (i-1) = 2 -2=0.

Call func_3(1, l).

func_3(1, [1,2,3]):

Swap l[-1] and l[0], so swap 3 and 1: l becomes [3,2,1].

Now, k=0.

Next iteration, i=1:

c=2.

k=0.

So, return l=[3,2,1].

Manhattan value: |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 0 + 2 =4, which matches k=4.

Good.

Another example: n=4, k=6.

k=6//2=3.

l=[1,2,3,4].

i=4:

c=1.

k=3.

k < 4-1 => 3 < 3? No.

k = k - (i-1) =3-3=0.

Call func_3(1, l).

Swap l[-1] and l[0]: swap 4 and 1: l=[4,2,3,1].

k=0.

Next iteration, i=2:

c=2.

k=0.

Return l=[4,2,3,1].

Manhattan value: |4-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| + |1-4| =3 +0 +0 +3=6, which matches k=6.

Good.

Another test: n=3, k=2.

k=2//2=1.

l=[1,2,3].

i=3:

c=1.

k=1.

k < 3-1 =>1 <2? Yes.

Call func_2(1,1,l).

func_2(1,1,l):

x=l[-1]=3, y=l[-1-1]=l[-2]=2.

Swap l[-1] and l[-1-1]: swap l[2]=3 and l[1]=2: l becomes [1,3,2].

Manhattan value: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3|=0 +1 +1=2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Seems like the approach works for these cases.

Now, I need to verify if this approach works in general.

Looking back at the code, func_4() checks if k is odd or if k > max_k, in which case it returns (0,0).

Otherwise, it returns (n,k).

func_1(n,k//2) is called, which suggests that the actual sum to achieve is k//2.

Wait, but in the examples above, k was divided by 2, but the Manhattan value was k.

Wait, perhaps the author realized that the sum is always even, so k must be even, and k//2 is used internally.

But in the func_1, k is divided by 2, and then operations are performed based on this halved k.

I need to understand the logic behind this.

Let me consider that each operation in func_1 increases the Manhattan value by twice the value used in the swap.

Wait, maybe that's why k is divided by 2.

Because each swap increases the Manhattan value by twice the distance involved.

Hence, by dividing k by 2, the operations can be thought of in terms of half the required sum.

This might be the reason for dividing k by 2.

Now, in the iteration, it goes from i=n down to -1 step -2.

In each iteration, it checks if k ==0, in which case it returns the current list.

If k < i -1, it calls func_2 to make a specific swap.

Otherwise, it subtracts (i -1) from k and calls func_3.

func_3 seems to swap l[-c] and l[c-1], which are elements from the ends towards the center.

func_2 swaps l[-c] and l[-c -k], which seems to adjust the last c elements based on the remaining k.

This seems like a way to distribute the required sum k among the elements by making specific swaps.

But I need to confirm if this approach covers all possible k that are even and within 0 to max_k.

Given that the examples worked, and assuming that the logic is correct, it seems that the code is implementing a valid approach to construct the permutation.

Hence, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
