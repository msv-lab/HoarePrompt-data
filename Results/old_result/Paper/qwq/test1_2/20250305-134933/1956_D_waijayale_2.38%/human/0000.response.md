Alright, I've got this problem to solve. So, let's understand what's being asked here. I have an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on it multiple times to maximize the sum of the array. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I need to do this in a way that the sum of the array is maximized, and I have to output the maximum sum along with a sequence of operations that achieve this sum, without exceeding 5*10^5 operations.

First things first, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. For example, MEX of [0, 1] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, so the smallest non-negative integer not in the set is 2. MEX of [1, 3, 9] is 0, since 0 is not in the set.

My goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing these operations. I need to think about how these operations can be used to increase the values in the array.

Let me consider small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Take the first example:

n = 2

a = [0, 1]

If I perform the operation on the entire array (l=1, r=2), the MEX of [0,1] is 2. So, I set both elements to 2, making the array [2,2], sum=4.

If I don't perform any operation, the sum remains 1.

So, by performing one operation, I can achieve a higher sum.

In the second example:

n = 3

a = [1,3,9]

The sum is already 13. If I apply the operation on any subarray, the MEX would be less than or equal to the current maximum in that subarray, so setting all elements to MEX would decrease the sum. Hence, it's better to perform no operations.

In the third example:

n = 4

a = [1,100,2,1]

After the first operation on l=3 to r=3, a[3] becomes MEX of [2], which is 0, so a becomes [1,100,0,1].

Then, operation on l=3 to r=4, MEX of [0,1] is 2, so both a[3] and a[4] become 2, making a = [1,100,2,2], sum=105.

If I had done different operations, maybe I could have achieved a higher sum, but according to the explanation, 105 is the maximum possible.

In the fourth example:

n = 1

a = [0]

Performing the operation once: MEX of [0] is 1, so set a[1] to 1, sum becomes 1.

If I don't perform any operation, sum remains 0.

So, performing one operation increases the sum to 1.

From these examples, I can see that the operation can be used to increase the values in the array, but it's not always beneficial to perform operations. Sometimes, it's better to leave certain subarrays unchanged if their sum is already maximized.

Now, I need to think about a general strategy to maximize the sum for any given array of length up to 18.

Given that n is up to 18, which is relatively small, I can consider exponential time solutions, but I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough to handle the worst cases.

One approach that comes to mind is to consider all possible subarrays and decide whether to perform operations on them or not. However, with n=18, the number of subarrays is around n^2/2 = 171, which is manageable, but I need a smarter way to decide which operations to perform.

Another idea is to use dynamic programming, where I keep track of the maximum sum achievable for subarrays and build up from smaller subarrays to the entire array.

Wait, but the problem allows me to perform operations multiple times on the same subarrays, up to 5*10^5 times, which is a lot. But I need to find a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum, without necessarily minimizing the number of operations.

But since n is small, maybe I can find a way to maximize the sum without performing an excessive number of operations.

Let me think differently. Each operation sets a subarray to the MEX of its current values. The MEX is always a non-negative integer, and it's the smallest integer not present in the subarray.

So, if I have a subarray where all elements are unique and form a consecutive sequence starting from some number, the MEX would be the next number in the sequence.

For example, if a subarray is [0,1,2], MEX is 3.

If I set this subarray to 3, and then perform the operation again on the same subarray, the new MEX would be 4, and so on.

This suggests that I can increment the value of a subarray repeatedly, but there must be a limit to how high I can set the values.

However, the problem states that I should not perform more than 5*10^5 operations, which is a soft limit, and it's guaranteed that the maximum sum can be achieved within this limit.

But performing too many operations might not be efficient, and since n is small, maybe I can find a way to achieve the maximum sum with a minimal number of operations.

Wait, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations; I just need to ensure that the number of operations doesn't exceed 5*10^5.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to achieve the maximum sum with a reasonable number of operations.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each subarray, determine the highest value I can set it to, and perform operations accordingly.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: Since MEX is involved, perhaps I can think in terms of the frequency of numbers in the array.

Wait, maybe I should consider the entire array and see what the highest possible sum I can achieve is.

Let me consider that the maximum possible value for any element is不受限制，因为我可以反复执行操作来增加子数组的值。但是，我需要找到一个最优的方式来做这件事。

Wait, but in the examples provided, it seems that there is an optimal sum that can be achieved, and it's not just setting all elements to the highest possible value.

For instance, in the third example, setting a[3] to 0 and then setting a[3] and a[4] to 2 achieves a sum of 105, which is higher than the initial sum of 104.

If I try to set more elements to higher values, maybe I can get a higher sum, but according to the explanation, 105 is the maximum.

So, perhaps there is an optimal value for each element, and I need to find a sequence of operations that sets each element to its optimal value.

But how do I determine the optimal value for each element?

One observation is that setting a subarray to its MEX effectively sets all elements in that subarray to the same value, which is the MEX of their current values.

Since MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer in the set, it's always greater than or equal to the number of unique elements in the subarray.

Wait, no. For example, if the subarray is [0,1,2], MEX is 3, which is greater than the number of unique elements (3).

If the subarray is [0,0,0], MEX is 1.

If the subarray is [1,2,3], MEX is 0, since 0 is missing.

Wait, no: MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

So, for [1,2,3], MEX is 0, because 0 is not in the set.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. MEX of [1,2,3] should be 0, as 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

But in the first example, [0,1], MEX is 2.

Wait, no: MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the set.

So, for [1,2,3], 0 is not present, so MEX is 0.

But in the first example, [0,1], MEX is 2, because 0 and 1 are present.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no: MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

So, for [0,1], MEX is 2, because 0 and 1 are present.

For [1,2,3], MEX is 0, because 0 is not present.

Wait, but in the first example, after setting [1,2] to MEX=2, the array becomes [2,2], sum=4.

If I consider [1,2,3], MEX is 0, so setting all to 0 would decrease the sum.

So, in that case, it's better not to perform any operation on subarrays where MEX would be less than the current sum.

Wait, but in the first example, setting [1,2] to 2 increases the sum.

In the second example, [1,3,9], MEX of the entire array is 0, which is less than the current sum, so it's better not to perform any operation.

In the third example, [1,100,2,1], setting [3,3] to 0 and then [3,4] to 2 increases the sum.

So, perhaps the strategy is to identify subarrays where setting them to their MEX increases the sum, and perform operations on those subarrays.

But this seems too vague. I need a more concrete plan.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have the entire array, and I want to maximize its sum.

I can consider all possible ways to split the array into subarrays, perform operations on them, and see which combination gives the maximum sum.

But with n=18, this would be exponential and too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of intervals and memoization.

Define dp[l][r] as the maximum sum achievable for the subarray from l to r.

To compute dp[l][r], I can consider all possible operations on the subarray [l,r], and choose the one that leads to the maximum sum.

But I need to consider that operations can overlap and affect each other.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the final values of each element in the array.

Each element can be set to some value, but it's constrained by the operations performed on the subarrays containing it.

This seems too vague to work with directly.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the entire array and compute its MEX.

- If setting the entire array to this MEX increases the sum, perform this operation.

- Otherwise, split the array into smaller subarrays and repeat the process.

But this might not always lead to the optimal solution.

For example, in the third sample input:

n=4

a=[1,100,2,1]

If I set the entire array to MEX([1,100,2,1])=0, which is worse than the initial sum.

So, in this case, I need to split the array into smaller parts.

Alternatively, I can think about the positions where I should split the array.

Suppose I have a peak value in the array; maybe I should avoid performing operations that include both the peak and lower values, as setting them to MEX would decrease the sum.

In the third example, [1,100,2,1], it's better to perform operations on [3,3] and [3,4], which allows the 100 to remain high while increasing the lower values.

So, perhaps the strategy is to identify the maximum values in the array and try to preserve them while increasing the lower values around them.

But this still feels too vague.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix a position pos in the array, and decide to set all elements from l to r, where l <= pos <= r, to MEX(a_l to a_r).

I need to choose pos such that this operation increases the sum.

But again, this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe I can think about the contribution of each element to the sum independently.

But since operations can change multiple elements at once, this might not be straightforward.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Find the maximum possible value each element can be set to, considering the operations performed on the subarrays containing it.

- Sum these maximum possible values to get the maximum sum.

But how do I determine the maximum possible value for each element?

It seems interdependent on the operations performed on various subarrays.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the provided code to see how it approaches the problem.

Looking at func_1, it seems to be a recursive function that sets a subarray from l to r to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray, under certain conditions.

Wait, in the first example, for n=2, a=[0,1], setting both to 2 gives sum=4, which matches the sample output.

In the third example, after operations, a=[1,100,2,2], sum=105.

So, perhaps the strategy is to set each subarray to its length, which is r - l + 1.

But in the second example, [1,3,9], sum=13, and no operations are performed, which makes sense because setting any subarray to its length would decrease the sum.

Wait, if I set the entire array to 3, which is the length, sum would be 9, which is less than 13.

Similarly, setting [1,2] to 2 would give [2,2,9], sum=13, which is the same as the original sum, but the problem allows for equal sums as well.

But according to the sample output, no operations are performed, implying that performing operations doesn't increase the sum.

So, perhaps the condition to perform an operation is when the sum of the subarray is less than the MEX multiplied by the length of the subarray.

Wait, in the first example, sum of [0,1] is 1, and MEX is 2, so 2*2=4 > 1, so it's beneficial to perform the operation.

In the third example, sum of [1,100,2,1] is 104.

If I set the entire array to 4, sum would be 16, which is less than 104, so it's not beneficial.

If I set [3,3] to 0, sum becomes [1,100,0,1], sum=102.

Then set [3,4] to 2, sum becomes [1,100,2,2], sum=105, which is better than the initial sum.

If I had set [3,4] directly to 2, sum would have been [1,100,2,2], sum=105, which is the same as the two-step operation.

So, perhaps performing operations on smaller subarrays can lead to a higher sum than operating on larger subarrays.

Hence, maybe I should prioritize operations on smaller subarrays.

But how do I decide which subarrays to operate on?

Let me think about the MEX values for different subarrays.

For a subarray of length 1, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in that subarray.

For example, for a single element a_i, MEX is 0 if a_i != 0, otherwise 1.

Wait, if a_i == 0, MEX of that single element is 1, since 0 is present.

If a_i != 0, MEX is 0, since 0 is not present.

So, for a single element, if a_i == 0, MEX is 1; else, MEX is 0.

Wait, no: MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

So, for a single element a_i:

- If a_i == 0, MEX is 1, because 0 is present, so the smallest non-negative integer not present is 1.

- If a_i != 0, MEX is 0, because 0 is not present in the set.

So, for a single element, setting it to MEX would be:

- If a_i == 0, set to 1.

- If a_i != 0, set to 0.

In the fourth example, n=1, a=[0], setting it to MEX=1 increases the sum to 1.

In the first example, setting the entire array to MEX=2 increases the sum to 4.

In the third example, setting [3,3] to MEX=0 and then [3,4] to MEX=2 achieves sum=105.

Wait, but according to the earlier observation, for a single element a_i:

- If a_i == 0, set to 1.

- Else, set to 0.

But in the third example, a[3]=2, which is neither 0 nor something that benefits from being set to 0.

Wait, perhaps this simple rule doesn't hold for larger subarrays.

So, maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each subarray, compute its MEX.

- If setting the subarray to MEX increases the sum, perform the operation.

- Repeat this process until no further operations can increase the sum.

But this could be inefficient, as I might need to perform many operations on different subarrays.

Given that n is small, up to 18, and the operation limit is 5*10^5, which is high, it might be feasible.

But I need to make sure that my solution doesn't enter an infinite loop or perform an excessive number of operations.

I need to find a way to perform operations in a way that guarantees I reach the maximum sum without performing too many operations.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to have a recursive function func_1 that sets a subarray to its length under certain conditions.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

In func_2, there's a recursive_maximize_sum function that seems to decide whether to perform an operation on the entire subarray or split it based on the maximum element.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to identify subarrays where the sum can be increased by setting them to their MEX, and perform operations on those subarrays.

But I need to ensure that operations on one subarray don't negatively affect the sum of another subarray.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with the entire array.

- Compute the MEX of the array.

- If setting the entire array to MEX increases the sum, perform this operation.

- Otherwise, find the position of the maximum element in the array.

- Recursively process the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.

The idea is to preserve the maximum elements while increasing the values in other parts of the array.

In the third example, [1,100,2,1], the maximum is 100 at position 2.

So, recursively process [1] (position 1) and [2,1] (positions 3-4).

For [1], set it to MEX=0 (since a[1]=1, MEX=0), but sum decreases from 1 to 0, which is not beneficial.

So, don't perform any operation on [1].

For [2,1], MEX=0, setting both to 0 decreases the sum from 3 to 0, which is not beneficial.

So, don't perform any operation on [2,1].

Then, the total sum remains 100 + 1 + 2 = 103, which is less than the sample output of 105.

Wait, in the sample, they perform operations on [3,3] and [3,4], achieving a higher sum.

So, maybe this splitting approach isn't optimal.

Perhaps I need to consider overlapping subarrays or perform operations in a different order.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I want to maximize the sum of the array.

Each operation allows me to set a subarray to its MEX.

I can perform this operation up to 5*10^5 times.

Given that n is small, maybe I can iteratively find the subarray whose MEX, when set, increases the sum the most, and perform the operation on that subarray.

But this greedy approach might not lead to the optimal solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using graph theory or some other optimization technique, but that might be overkill for this problem.

Given the time constraints, maybe I should accept that an exponential time solution is acceptable given the small n.

So, perhaps I can consider all possible ways to split the array into subarrays, perform operations on each subarray to set them to their MEX, and see which combination gives the maximum sum.

But this seems inefficient, as the number of ways to split the array into subarrays is exponential.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the maximum sum achievable for the subarray from 1 to i.

Then, for each subarray ending at i, I can consider performing an operation on it and see what sum I get.

But I need to consider that operations can overlap and affect each other.

This seems too complicated.

Let me look back at the provided code again.

In func_1, it seems to set a subarray from l to r to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray, under certain conditions.

Then, in func_2, it recursively splits the array based on the position of the maximum element.

But I need to verify if this approach correctly maximizes the sum.

In the third example, following this approach:

- Entire array [1,100,2,1]

- Sum is 104

- MEX is 0, setting to 0 would decrease the sum to 0, which is bad.

- So, find the position of the maximum element, which is 100 at position 2.

- Recursively process [1] and [3,4]

- For [1], a[1]=1, MEX=0, setting to 0 decreases sum.

- For [3,4], a[3]=2, a[4]=1, MEX=0, setting to 0 decreases sum.

- So, no operations are performed, resulting in sum=104, which is less than the sample output of 105.

Wait, but in the sample, they perform operations on [3,3] and [3,4], achieving sum=105.

So, perhaps this approach misses some optimal operations.

Hence, maybe the approach in the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to choose which subarrays to operate on.

Let me consider another strategy:

- Identify subarrays where the MEX is greater than the average value in the subarray.

- Perform operations on those subarrays to increase their values.

But this is still too vague.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the following:

- For each subarray, compute its MEX.

- If the MEX multiplied by the length of the subarray is greater than the current sum of the subarray, perform the operation.

- Prioritize subarrays where the increase in sum is the highest.

But even this might not lead to the global maximum sum.

This seems like a tricky problem.

Given the time constraints, maybe I should accept that finding the optimal sequence of operations is non-trivial and focus on implementing a solution that achieves a high sum, even if it's not provably optimal.

Given that n is small, up to 18, and the operation limit is high, perhaps performing operations on all possible subarrays in a certain order can lead to a high sum.

But this might not be efficient in terms of the number of operations, although the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set each element to its MEX when considered as a subarray of length 1, and then perform operations on larger subarrays.

Wait, for subarrays of length 1:

- If a_i == 0, MEX=1, set to 1.

- If a_i != 0, MEX=0, set to 0.

But in the third example, setting a[2]=100 to 0 would decrease the sum, which is not desirable.

Hence, this approach is not optimal.

So, I need a smarter way to choose which subarrays to operate on.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with the entire array.

- Compute the MEX of the array.

- If setting the entire array to MEX increases the sum, perform this operation.

- Else, find the largest possible subarrays where setting them to their MEX increases the sum, and perform operations on those subarrays.

- Repeat until no further operations can increase the sum.

But this still feels too vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that finding the optimal sequence of operations is complex and instead focus on implementing a solution that achieves a high sum, even if it's not the absolute maximum.

Given that, I can proceed with the provided code and test it against the sample inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs.

Looking back at the code:

- func_1 seems to set a subarray from l to r to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray.

- func_2 uses recursion to split the array based on the position of the maximum element.

- func_3 reads input, calls func_2, and prints the results.

In the third example, according to the code:

- Entire array [1,100,2,1], sum=104.

- MEX is 0, which is less than the current sum, so don't set the entire array.

- Find the position of the maximum element, which is 100 at position 2.

- Recursively process [1] and [3,4].

- For [1], a[1]=1, MEX=0, setting to 0 decreases sum, so don't perform any operation.

- For [3,4], a[3]=2, a[4]=1, sum=3.

- MEX is 0, setting to 0 decreases sum to 0, which is bad.

- So, no operations are performed, resulting in sum=104, which is less than the sample output of 105.

Hence, the code seems to miss the optimal operations in this case.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
