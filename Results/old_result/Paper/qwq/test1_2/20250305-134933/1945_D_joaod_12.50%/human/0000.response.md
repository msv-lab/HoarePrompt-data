Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values associated with them: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with someone at position j (where j < i), he has to pay a_j to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i (excluding j and i), he has to pay b_k to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum cost Kirill has to pay to get into one of the first m positions.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j < i and swap with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that I can find the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Let me think about this step by step.

Let's consider the queue positions from 1 to n, with Kirill initially at position n+1. But since he's at the end, I can consider his initial position as n.

I need to move him from position n to some position between 1 and m.

Each move involves choosing a position j < i, paying a_j, and paying b_k for all k between j and i.

I need to find the sequence of such moves that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

But calculating this directly would be inefficient for n up to 200,000.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Let dp[i] be the minimum cost to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m and then take the minimum among them.

But I need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

First, I need to see how to transition from position i to positions j < i.

Wait, actually, Kirill is moving forward by swapping with people in front of him, but in the problem, he's swapping with people behind him to move forward.

Wait, no, in the problem, he's swapping with people ahead of him (j < i) to move forward.

So, from position i, he can swap with any j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

I need to find, for each position i from 1 to m, the minimum cost to reach i from position n.

But maybe it's better to iterate from position n down to 1, computing the minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0, since he's already there.

Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, dp[i] would be the cost to swap from some position j > i to i, plus dp[j].

But this seems too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the cost to move from position n to position i.

This involves choosing a sequence of swaps to get from n to i.

But maybe I can think of the total cost as the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for each position k that is passed through in these swaps.

But this seems complicated.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j plus sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

But again, building such a graph explicitly is not feasible.

I need a way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m efficiently.

Let me consider prefix sums for the b_k values.

Let me define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, the sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

Wait, but this might not be directly useful.

Let me see.

If I fix i and j, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

So, cost[i][j] = a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find, for each i from 1 to m, the minimum over all sequences of swaps that get from n to i, of the sum of costs for those swaps.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the minimum cost to reach position i, considering that Kirill can choose any sequence of swaps.

Perhaps I can model this as Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph where edges are the possible swaps, but again, n is too large for that.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to either swap with someone or not, and calculate the cumulative cost accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as moving from position n to position 1, and at each step, choosing whether to swap with someone or to pass through, paying the b_k cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think of it as moving from n to 1, and at each position, deciding whether to swap with someone ahead or not.

But it's still confusing.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position i. To do that, he needs to swap with everyone from position i up to n-1.

But no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the cost to reach position i as the sum of a_j for all j from i to n-1.

But that doesn't account for the b_k costs properly.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when Kirill swaps with someone at position j, he pays a_j and also pays b_k for all k between j and i.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the example to get some intuition.

Take the first example:

n = 4, m = 2

a = [7, 3, 6, 9]

b = [4, 3, 8, 5]

And the output is 14.

Let me try to see how to achieve that.

Kirill starts at position 4.

He can swap with position j < 4, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k = j+1 to 3.

For example, swapping with position 2 (j=2), he pays a[2]=3 and b[3]=8, total 11.

Then he is at position 2, which is within the first m=2 positions.

So total cost is 11, but the output is 14. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let me try swapping with position 3 first.

Swap from 4 to 3: pay a[3]=9 and sum of b_k from k=3 to 3, which is 8. Total 17.

Then swap from 3 to 2: pay a[2]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 2, which is 3. Total 3 + 3 = 6.

Total cost: 17 + 6 = 23, which is higher than 14.

Wait, that's worse.

Alternatively, swap from 4 to 1 directly.

Pay a[1]=7 and sum of b_k from k=1 to 3, which is 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Total 22.

That's higher than 14.

Alternatively, swap from 4 to 2: pay a[2]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 3, which is 3 + 8 = 11. Total 14.

Then he's at position 2, which is within m=2.

So total cost is 14, matching the sample output.

Okay, so in this case, swapping directly from 4 to 2 costs 14.

But earlier I thought swapping from 4 to 2 cost 11, but I must have miscalculated.

Wait, no. Let's recalculate:

From position 4, swap with position 2: pay a[2]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 3, which is b[2]=3 and b[3]=8, total 3 + 8 = 11, plus a[2]=3, which is 3 + 11 = 14.

Yes, total is 14.

So, in this case, swapping directly from 4 to 2 gives the minimal cost of 14.

Another option is to swap in multiple steps, but that seems more expensive.

So, in this case, swapping directly to the desired position is optimal.

Maybe in general, the minimal cost to reach position i is the minimal cost over all j < i of (a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k) plus the cost to reach j.

But that sounds like a dynamic programming approach, which might be too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k is the sum of b_k between j and i.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the cost to move from i to j as a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me think about prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

Now, if I can find, for each i from 1 to m, the minimal over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) plus the minimal cost to reach j.

But again, this seems like a dynamic programming approach that's too slow.

I need to find a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider that for each i, the minimal cost to reach i is the minimal over j < i of (minimal cost to reach j) + (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

Let me denote dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rearranged as dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i-1]

Now, if I define temp[j] = dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j, then dp[i] = min(temp[j] for j < i) + prefix_b[i-1]

This seems promising because now I can keep track of the minimum temp[j] up to i-1 and use it to compute dp[i].

So, I can compute prefix_b first.

Then, initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum temp[j].

Then, for each i from 1 to n, compute dp[i] = min_prev_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

And update min_prev_temp with temp[i] = dp[i] - prefix_b[i] + a_i

Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm updating min_prev_temp only with temp[j] for j < i.

So, I need to compute dp[i] using the minimum temp[j] for j < i, and then update min_prev_temp with temp[i].

But I need to be careful with the initial conditions.

Let's try to see with the sample input.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4 + 3 = 7

prefix_b[3] = 7 + 8 = 15

prefix_b[4] = 15 + 5 = 20

Wait, but in code, arrays are 0-indexed, so prefix_b[0] = 0, prefix_b[1] = 4, prefix_b[2] = 4+3=7, prefix_b[3]=7+8=15, prefix_b[4]=15+5=20.

Now, dp[1] = min over j < 1 of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[0] = 0 + prefix_b[0] = 0 + 0 = 0

Because there are no j < 1.

Then, temp[1] = dp[1] - prefix_b[1] + a_1 = 0 - 0 + 7 = 7

min_prev_temp = 7

dp[2] = min_prev_temp + prefix_b[1] = 7 + 4 = 11

temp[2] = dp[2] - prefix_b[2] + a_2 = 11 - 7 + 3 = 7

min_prev_temp = min(7,7) = 7

dp[3] = 7 + prefix_b[2] = 7 + 7 = 14

temp[3] = 14 - 15 + 6 = 5

min_prev_temp = min(7,7,5) = 5

dp[4] = 5 + prefix_b[3] = 5 + 15 = 20

temp[4] = 20 - 20 + 9 = 9

min_prev_temp = min(7,7,5,9) = 5

Now, Kirill wants to be in the first m=2 positions, so min(dp[1], dp[2]) = min(0,11) = 0

But in the sample, the output is 14. Wait, that doesn't match.

I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, in the sample, n=4, m=2, and the output is 14.

But according to this, dp[1]=0, dp[2]=11, dp[3]=14, dp[4]=20, and min(dp[1], dp[2])=0, but that doesn't match the sample output of 14.

Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] should represent the cost to reach position i from the end.

Let me try to adjust my understanding.

Let me try to redefine dp[i] as the cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Wait, in the initial approach, dp[n] = 0, since he's already there.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum_{k=i}^{j-1} b_k)

But this seems too slow.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach positions j > i.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window minimum approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the target position i, and I want to find the minimal cost to reach i.

This cost is the sum of a_j for the person I swap with, plus the sum of b_k for all k between j and i.

I need to choose j > i such that this cost is minimized.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that to reach position i, Kirill can swap with someone at position j > i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from k=j down to i+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of moving from n to i, passing through various positions.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can understand the approach.

The code is:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for c in range(cases):

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = 10 ** 12

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

So, it seems like the code is iterating from na_frente down to 0, keeping a running total cost, and updating the best cost when it reaches positions <= pos_final.

First, it adjusts na_frente and pos_final by subtracting 1, probably to make them 0-indexed.

Then, it initializes total = 0 and best = 10^12.

Then, it loops from v = na_frente down to 0.

If v <= pos_final, it checks if total + a[v] is better than the current best and updates best if it is.

Then, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

Otherwise, if v > pos_final, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to the total.

Finally, it prints the best value found.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5].

Assuming 0-indexing, a[0]=7, a[1]=3, a[2]=6, a[3]=9.

b[0]=4, b[1]=3, b[2]=8, b[3]=5.

na_frente = n - 1 = 3

pos_final = m - 1 = 1

So, loop from v=3 down to 0.

v=3:

v > pos_final (1), so add min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5) = 5 to total. total=5

v=2:

v > pos_final (1), so add min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8) = 6 to total. total=11

v=1:

v <= pos_final, so check if total + a[1]=11 + 3=14 < best=10^12, set best=14

Then, add min(a[1]=3, b[1]=3)=3 to total. total=14

v=0:

v <= pos_final, so check if total + a[0]=14 + 7=21 < best=14, no

Add min(a[0]=7, b[0]=4)=4 to total. total=18

Finally, print best=14

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for this case.

Let me see if I can generalize this approach.

It seems like the code is iterating from the last position (n-1) down to 0, keeping a running total cost.

When it reaches positions <= m-1, it checks if the total cost plus a[v] is better than the current best and updates best if it is.

Then, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total cost, choosing the smaller one.

For positions > m-1, it always chooses the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to add to the total.

Wait, but in the loop, for v <= pos_final, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to the total.

But in the sample, for v=1, it adds 3 to total, making total=14.

Then for v=0, it adds 4 to total, making total=18.

But best is 14, which is less than total=18.

Is this correct?

Wait, no. In the loop, for v <= pos_final, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to the total, but it also checks total + a[v] against best.

Wait, in the code, for v <= pos_final, it checks if total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < best and updates best if it is.

Then, it adds the smaller of custo_pra_trocar_a[v] or custo_pra_passar_b[v] to total.

So, in the sample:

v=3: total += 5, total=5

v=2: total += 6, total=11

v=1: best = min(best, 11 + 3)=14, then total += 3, total=14

v=0: best remains 14, total +=4, total=18

Then, print best=14

Which is correct.

I need to understand why this works.

It seems like the code is accumulating the minimal costs as it moves from the end to the beginning, and whenever it reaches a position that is within the first m positions, it checks if the total cost plus the cost to swap directly to that position is better than the current best.

Then, it continues adding the minimal costs for passing through or swapping at each position.

I need to see if this approach guarantees the minimal cost.

Let me consider another example.

Take the second sample input:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

Compute na_frente=5, pos_final=1

Initialize total=0, best=10^12

v=5:

v >1, add min(3,1)=1 to total, total=1

v=4:

v >1, add min(8,4)=4 to total, total=5

v=3:

v >1, add min(1,1)=1 to total, total=6

v=2:

v >1, add min(7,8)=7 to total, total=13

v=1:

v <=1, check if total + a[1]=13 +9 < best=10^12, set best=22

Then, add min(9,8)=8 to total, total=21

v=0:

v <=1, check if total + a[0]=21 +6 < best=22, set best=22

Then, add min(6,5)=5 to total, total=26

Print best=22

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for this case as well.

Let me try to think about what's happening.

It seems like the code is accumulating the minimal costs required to move from the end to each position, and whenever it reaches a position that is within the first m positions, it calculates the total cost to reach that position by swapping directly to it from the current position, and keeps track of the best such cost.

Then, it continues accumulating the minimal costs.

I need to see if this captures the minimal cost correctly.

Perhaps I can think of it as Kirill moving from position n to position 1, choosing at each step whether to swap with someone ahead or to pay the b_k cost to pass through.

But I need to ensure that this approach doesn't miss any possible sequence of swaps that could lead to a lower cost.

Let me consider that at each step, Kirill can choose to swap with someone ahead or to not swap and pay the b_k cost to pass through.

So, for each position v, if v > pos_final, he chooses the cheaper option between swapping with v (pay a_v) or passing through and paying b_v.

If v <= pos_final, he can choose to swap directly to v, paying a_v plus the accumulated total cost so far, and update the best cost if this is better.

Then, he adds the cheaper option between swapping with v or passing through to the total cost.

This seems logical.

In other words, the total cost accumulated represents the cost to move from position n to position v, and for positions v <= pos_final, he can choose to swap directly to v from the current position, paying a_v plus the accumulated total cost.

Then, the best cost is the minimum of these options for all v <= pos_final.

This seems to capture the minimal cost correctly.

Let me consider another sample input:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

na_frente=6, pos_final=6

Initialize total=0, best=10^12

v=6:

v > pos_final (6 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[6]=0+9=9 < best=10^12, set best=9

Then, add min(a[6]=9, b[6]=9)=9 to total, total=9

v=5:

v > pos_final (5 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[5]=9 +5=14 < best=9, no

Add min(a[5]=5, b[5]=4)=4 to total, total=13

v=4:

v > pos_final (4 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[4]=13 +6=19 < best=9, no

Add min(a[4]=6, b[4]=1)=1 to total, total=14

v=3:

v > pos_final (3 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[3]=14 +2=16 < best=9, no

Add min(a[3]=2, b[3]=7)=2 to total, total=16

v=2:

v > pos_final (2 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[2]=16 +9=25 < best=9, no

Add min(a[2]=9, b[2]=10)=9 to total, total=25

v=1:

v > pos_final (1 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[1]=25 +2=27 < best=9, no

Add min(a[1]=2, b[1]=1)=1 to total, total=26

v=0:

v > pos_final (0 >6 is False), so v <= pos_final, check if total + a[0]=26 +7=33 < best=9, no

Add min(a[0]=7, b[0]=9)=7 to total, total=33

Print best=9

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

2 1

2 3

1 1

na_frente=1, pos_final=0

Initialize total=0, best=10^12

v=1:

v > pos_final (1 >0 is True), so add min(a[1]=3, b[1]=1)=1 to total, total=1

v=0:

v <= pos_final, check if total + a[0]=1 +2=3 < best=10^12, set best=3

Add min(a[0]=2, b[0]=1)=1 to total, total=2

Print best=3

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for all the sample inputs.

Given that, and the fact that it's efficiently implemented with O(n) time complexity, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
