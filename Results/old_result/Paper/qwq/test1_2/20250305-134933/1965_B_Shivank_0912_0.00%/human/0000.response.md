Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets certain conditions related to subsequences and their sums. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me two integers, n and k. I need to create a sequence a of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two main conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of a that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence of a that sums up to v.

A subsequence here means that I can pick elements from a in order, skipping any number of elements in between, but without changing their original order.

The problem also assures me that a solution always exists given the constraints, which is helpful to know.

Now, let's think about how to approach this.

I need to create a sequence where all possible sums except for k are achievable using its subsequences. Moreover, the sequence should have at most 25 elements.

First, I recall that the number of possible non-empty subsequences of a sequence of m elements is 2^m - 1. So, for m = 25, that's over 33 million possible subsequences. But I don't need to consider all of them because I'm only interested in their sums.

I need to ensure that every integer from 1 to n, except k, can be formed as the sum of some subsequence of a, and that k cannot be formed.

One way to think about this is to consider the sequence a as a set of numbers that can generate certain sums through their subsequences.

I recall that if a sequence consists of distinct powers of 2, like [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], then the sums of its subsequences can represent any integer up to the sum of all elements in the sequence. This is because each subsequence sum corresponds to a unique binary representation.

For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any sum from 1 to 15.

So, if I take the first m powers of 2, where m <= 25, I can cover a large range of sums.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while including all other sums from 1 to n.

This seems tricky. How can I modify the sequence of powers of 2 to exclude only k?

One idea is to include all powers of 2 up to some point, but then adjust the sequence to skip k.

Wait, the problem says that n can be up to 10^6 and k can be up to n, and t can be up to 1000 test cases, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7.

Given that m is at most 25, and 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n, which is up to 10^6, perhaps I don't need to use all 25 elements for most cases.

Wait, n can be up to 10^6, but m is at most 25. So, I need to find a sequence of at most 25 numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n except for k.

Given that, perhaps using the first m powers of 2 is a good starting point, but I need to adjust it to exclude k.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case: n=2, k=2.

So, I need a sequence where I can make sums of 1, but not 2.

Well, if I take [1], the possible subsequence sums are 1 and 0 (empty subsequence). But I should ignore 0 as it's not in the range 1 to n.

So, [1] works because I can make 1 but not 2.

Another test case: n=6, k=1.

I need to make all sums from 1 to 6 except 1.

Wait, that seems odd. If k=1, I need to make sums 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

One possible sequence could be [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but that's not efficient.

Actually, with [2, 3], I can make:

- 2

- 3

- 2 + 3 = 5

But I need 4 and 6 as well. So, [2, 3, 4, 6] would cover 2, 3, 4, 5 (2+3), 6, 7 (3+4), etc., but I only need up to 6.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 25 elements, so using more elements isn't a problem, but I should aim for efficiency.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider the sequence of powers of 2: [1, 2, 4, 8, ...].

If I take [1, 2, 4], sums are 1, 2, 3 (1+2), 4, 5 (1+4), 6 (2+4), 7 (1+2+4).

If k=3, for n=7, I need to exclude sum=3.

So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but can sum to all other values from 1 to 7 except 3.

One way is to remove 1 and 2, but then I can't make any sums.

Wait, perhaps including different numbers.

Alternatively, include 3 but exclude the combination that sums to 3.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe there's a general approach.

I need a sequence where the possible subsequence sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One idea is to include k itself in the sequence, but then to ensure that no subsequence sums to k.

But if k is in the sequence, then the subsequence consisting of just k sums to k, which violates the condition.

Therefore, k cannot be in the sequence.

So, k is not in the sequence.

Then, I need to ensure that no combination of elements in the sequence sums to k, while being able to sum to all other values from 1 to n except k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set S of numbers.

I need that the subset sums of S cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Also, no subset sums to k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums cover [1, n] \ {k}.

Given that, I need to find a set S with at most 25 elements, all non-negative integers, such that:

- The subset sums include all v from 1 to n except k.

- There is no subset that sums to k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and k up to n, and t up to 1000, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient way to generate such sequences.

I need a general method that works for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me consider the sequence of powers of 2: [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^24].

The sum of the first m powers of 2 is 2^{m+1} - 1.

So, with m=25, the sum is 2^{25} - 1, which is over 33 million, way larger than n=10^6.

So, if I take the first m powers of 2 where m is chosen such that the sum covers up to n, I can generate all sums from 1 to n.

But I need to exclude k.

How can I modify this sequence to exclude k?

One idea is to include all powers of 2 up to some point, but then exclude k by adjusting the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can remove the element that corresponds to k in the binary representation.

But that might not work directly.

Another idea is to include all powers of 2 except for the ones that would sum up to k.

But since k can be any value from 1 to n, and n can be up to 10^6, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe there's a way to adjust the sequence by including additional elements to cover the sums except k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that the only way to sum to k is by including a specific element, and then exclude that element.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties required.

I need a set S where:

- The subset sums cover all v in [1, n] \ {k}.

- No subset sums to k.

This implies that k cannot be expressed as a sum of any combination of elements in S.

But for all other v in [1, n], v ≠ k, there exists a subset of S that sums to v.

This seems similar to creating a set whose subset sums cover a certain range, except for one specific value.

I recall that if S is the set of powers of 2, then its subset sums can represent any integer uniquely.

But in this case, I need to exclude one specific sum.

How can I modify the set to exclude only that one sum?

One approach could be to include all powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjust by including additional elements to cover the missing sum.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, while all other sums can be formed.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I start with a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

One way to do this is to remove certain elements from S such that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can still be formed.

However, this seems non-trivial, as removing elements might affect multiple sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed by combining the elements differently.

This still seems unclear.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, which would be the first m powers of 2 where m is the smallest integer such that 2^m >= n.

- Then, adjust the set to ensure that k cannot be formed.

But how do I adjust it?

Wait, perhaps I can include an additional element that allows me to cover sums that would otherwise be blocked.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think of a specific example.

Take n=6, k=1.

I need to make sure that no subsequence sums to 1, but can sum to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

One possible sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

But that's not efficient.

Wait, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] allows sums like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7, etc.

But I don't need sums beyond 6.

Alternatively, [2, 3, 4] covers 2, 3, 4, 5 (2+3), 6 (2+4), but no sum to 1.

This works for this case.

Another example: n=8, k=8.

I need to make sure that no subsequence sums to 8, but can sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

If I take [1,2,4], sums are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but no sum to 8.

Wait, but 1+2+4=7, which is less than 8.

If I add another element, say 7, then sums could be 7, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps [1,2,4,7].

Sums:

- 1

- 2

- 4

- 7

- 1+2=3

- 1+4=5

- 2+4=6

- 1+7=8 → but I need to exclude 8.

So, including 7 allows sum to 8, which I don't want.

Therefore, I need to exclude 7.

Wait, perhaps include 5 instead of 7.

So, [1,2,4,5].

Sums:

- 1

- 2

- 4

- 5

- 1+2=3

- 1+4=5

- 2+4=6

- 1+5=6

- 2+5=7

- 4+5=9

- 1+2+4=7

- 1+2+5=8 → again, sum to 8.

So, including 5 also allows sum to 8.

Hmm.

Alternatively, include 6 instead of 5.

[1,2,4,6].

Sums:

- 1

- 2

- 4

- 6

- 1+2=3

- 1+4=5

- 2+4=6

- 1+6=7

- 2+6=8 → still sum to 8.

So, including 6 also allows sum to 8.

Wait, perhaps I need to exclude 6.

Then, [1,2,4,5].

But as seen earlier, that still allows sum to 8 through 2+6 or 1+2+5.

Wait, 2+6 is not possible if 6 is not included.

Wait, in [1,2,4,5], sums are:

- 1

- 2

- 4

- 5

- 1+2=3

- 1+4=5

- 2+4=6

- 1+5=6

- 2+5=7

- 4+5=9

- 1+2+4=7

- 1+2+5=8 → still sum to 8.

So, even without 6, sum to 8 is still possible through 1+2+5.

So, to prevent sum to 8, I need to ensure that no combination adds up to 8.

One way is to not include any combination that sums to 8.

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the sequence [1,2,4,8,16,...], up to 2^24.

If I take the first m powers of 2 where m=25, their sums can represent any number from 1 to 2^25 - 1.

But I need to exclude only k.

Is there a way to modify this sequence to exclude only k?

One idea is to include all powers of 2 except for the ones that, when combined, can form k.

But since k can be any value from 1 to n, and n is up to 10^6, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can include all powers of 2 up to n, and then adjust the sequence based on k.

But I need a general method that works for any n and k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the sequence a to be the first m powers of 2, where m is such that 2^m >= n.

Then, for each test case, I can check if k can be formed as a sum of these powers.

If k cannot be formed, then it's fine.

But in reality, since the powers of 2 can form any sum, k can always be formed.

Therefore, I need to modify the sequence to exclude the possibility of summing to k.

But how?

One approach is to remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, but that might not work in all cases.

Wait, perhaps I can remove the element that is equal to k, but only if k is a power of 2.

But if k is not a power of 2, I need another way.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me consider another idea.

Suppose I include in the sequence all powers of 2 up to n, except for the ones that are part of the binary representation of k.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that their subset sums cover [1, n] \ {k}.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that for each test case, n and k are given, and I need to output a sequence a with at most 25 elements.

Given that t can be up to 1000, and sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7, I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to generate such sequences quickly for multiple test cases.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute a sequence that works for all test cases.

But n and k vary, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a universal sequence of 25 elements that works for all possible n and k within the constraints.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and k up to n.

If I take the first 25 powers of 2, their sums can represent any number up to over 33 million, which is way larger than n=10^6.

But in that case, for each test case, I can output the same sequence of 25 powers of 2, and it would cover all sums from 1 to n, including k.

But I need to exclude k.

So, this approach won't work directly.

Wait, perhaps I can modify the sequence slightly for each test case to exclude k.

But that sounds time-consuming, especially with t up to 1000.

I need a faster way.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the sequence a to be the first m powers of 2, where m is chosen such that the sum covers up to n.

Then, for each test case, I can check if k can be formed as a sum of these powers.

If it can, then I need to adjust the sequence to prevent k from being formed.

But adjusting the sequence for each test case separately would be inefficient.

Is there a way to adjust the sequence in a general way that works for all test cases?

Alternatively, perhaps I can include additional elements in the sequence to cover the necessary sums while excluding k.

But again, without knowing k in advance, it's hard to adjust the sequence universally.

Wait, maybe I can include elements in such a way that the only way to sum to k is by including a specific element, and then exclude that element.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me consider that the problem states it's always possible to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

So, perhaps there's a standard approach to construct such sequences.

I need to find a way to cover all sums from 1 to n except for k, using at most 25 elements.

Given that m is at most 25, and n is up to 10^6, perhaps I can use a sequence that allows for flexible summing, excluding only k.

Wait, maybe I can use the sequence of powers of 2 up to 2^24, which is over 16 million, which covers n up to 10^6.

Then, for each test case, output this sequence.

But this would include the sum k, which is not allowed.

So, I need to modify this sequence to exclude k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can include an additional element that allows me to adjust the sums in such a way that k cannot be formed.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I include k itself in the sequence, then any subsequence that includes k would sum to at least k, but I need to ensure that no subsequence sums exactly to k.

But if I include k, then the subsequence consisting only of k sums to k, which violates the condition.

Therefore, k cannot be in the sequence.

So, k is not in the sequence.

Then, I need to ensure that no combination of elements in the sequence sums to k.

But with the sequence being powers of 2, each sum is unique.

Wait, but with powers of 2, each sum corresponds to a unique subset, so no two subsets sum to the same value.

Therefore, if I use powers of 2, each sum is unique.

Given that, if I exclude the subset that sums to k, I can have a sequence where no subsequence sums to k.

But in reality, with powers of 2, each sum is unique, so only one subset sums to each value.

Therefore, if I have a sequence of powers of 2, and k is one of the possible sums, then only one subset sums to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

So, perhaps I can exclude that specific subset.

But in practice, I can't exclude a specific subset; I need to adjust the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

For example, if k is 5, which is 101 in binary, then the highest set bit is 4.

So, if I exclude 4 from the sequence, then 5 cannot be formed.

But wait, with [1,2], I can form 1,2,3, but not 4 or 5.

But in this case, n=5, and k=5, so I need to cover 1,2,3,4 but not 5.

But with [1,2], I can't form 4.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, include 4 and exclude 2.

Wait, [1,4] allows sums 1,4,5.

But I need to cover 1,2,3,4 except not 5.

But with [1,4], I can't form 2 or 3.

So, that doesn't work.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think about the fact that the problem says a solution always exists.

So, maybe there's a standard way to construct such sequences.

I need to find a sequence of at most 25 elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except for k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and k up to n, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that allow me to cover the necessary sums.

But with t up to 1000 and sum of n up to 10^7, I need an efficient algorithm.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that with m=25 elements, I can cover a large range of sums.

Given that, perhaps I can fix the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2, and for each test case, output this sequence.

But as discussed earlier, this would include the sum k, which is not allowed.

So, I need to adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows me to choose different sequences for different test cases, meaning that for each test case, I can choose a sequence that works for that specific n and k.

Given that, perhaps I can adjust the sequence based on k.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Let's try that.

For example, for n=5, k=5 (binary 101), the highest set bit is 4.

So, exclude 4 from the sequence.

Then, the sequence is [1,2], which allows sums 1,2,3.

But I need to cover 1,2,3,4 except not 5.

But with [1,2], I can't form 4.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps exclude the elements that sum to k.

But with unique subset sums, excluding one element excludes multiple sums.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I include elements in the sequence such that the subset sums can cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

Given that, perhaps I can include elements that are not multiples of k or something similar.

But k can be any value from 1 to n, so this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are relatively prime to k.

But that might not guarantee the required sum properties.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the problem allows m to be up to 25, which is a small number.

Given that, perhaps I can fix a sequence of 25 elements that can cover all sums up to n=10^6, except for one specific sum k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can use a sequence where the elements are chosen such that their subset sums can represent any number except for k.

But I need a systematic way to choose such a sequence.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence where the subset sums can represent any number up to some value, except for one specific number, how can I achieve that?

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except for k by carefully choosing their values.

But without a specific method, this is too vague.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can output the same sequence of 25 elements, and it would satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but for different n and k, the same sequence might not work.

For example, if k varies, the sequence needs to adjust accordingly.

But perhaps there's a universal sequence that can work for all n and k within the constraints.

Wait, but if I take the first 25 powers of 2, their subset sums can represent any number up to over 33 million.

But then, for each test case, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, which would require modifying the sequence based on k.

But if I use the same sequence for all test cases, then for some test cases, k can be formed, which violates the condition.

Therefore, using the same sequence for all test cases won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2 and exclude k from being formed by some mechanism.

But again, that seems difficult.

Let me consider that since m can be up to 25, and n is up to 10^6, perhaps I can choose m such that the sum of the sequence is just above n, but that still doesn't solve the issue of excluding k.

This is tricky.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix m=25 and choose the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2.

Then, for each test case, I can output this sequence.

Given that the subset sums can represent any number up to over 33 million, which is more than n=10^6, it can represent all v from 1 to n except for k.

But this is incorrect because it can represent k as well.

So, I need to adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But adjusting the sequence for each test case separately isn't efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can modify the sequence by excluding the element that corresponds to k.

But if k isn't a power of 2, that won't help.

For example, if k=3, which is not a power of 2, excluding any power of 2 might not prevent the sum from being 3.

So, excluding elements isn't straightforward.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to choose m up to 25, and I can choose different m for different test cases, as long as m <=25.

Given that, perhaps for each test case, I can choose a sequence that is tailored to n and k.

But with t up to 1000, and sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient way to generate these sequences.

I need to find a general method to construct such sequences.

Let me consider that if I take m=1, then a=[n], but that doesn't help because the subset sums would only be 0 and n, which doesn't cover all v from 1 to n.

So, m needs to be larger.

Alternatively, if I take m=25 and choose a sequence that can cover all sums up to n except for k, perhaps by including elements that fill in the gaps appropriately.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that allow me to cover the necessary sums.

For example, start with an empty sequence, and iteratively add the smallest number that allows me to cover new sums, similar to how the greedy algorithm for the subset sum problem works.

But I need to modify this approach to exclude k.

This sounds complicated.

Let me consider that since the problem states that a solution always exists, perhaps there's a standard construction for this.

I need to find a way to construct such sequences efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need a fast solution.

Wait, perhaps I can fix the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2, and for each test case, output this sequence.

Then, for the judge to verify that no subsequence sums to k, and that all other v from 1 to n can be formed.

But as discussed earlier, with the full sequence of 25 powers of 2, the subset sums can represent any number up to over 33 million, including k.

Therefore, this approach would fail because it includes the sum k.

So, I need to adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But how?

This is challenging.

Let me consider that if I exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, then perhaps k cannot be formed.

For example, if k=5 (101 in binary), and I exclude 4 (100), then I can't form 5 with the remaining elements [1,2].

But with [1,2], I can only form 1,2,3, which is fine for n=5 and k=5, as I don't need to form 5.

But in this case, n=5, and I need to cover 1,2,3,4 but not 5.

With [1,2], I can't form 4, which is needed.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps include additional elements to cover the missing sums.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Let me consider that the problem allows sequences with up to 25 elements, but perhaps there's a way to minimize the number of elements while covering the required sums.

But without a clear method, this is difficult.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that using the first 25 powers of 2 and outputting the same sequence for all test cases is acceptable, even if it includes k in the subset sums.

But that would be incorrect, as it violates the condition of not having a subsequence that sums to k.

Therefore, I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can output a sequence that is specifically designed to exclude k.

For example, for n=2, k=2, output [1].

For n=6, k=1, output [2,3,4,5,6].

For n=8, k=8, output [1,2,4,7].

Wait, but in the third example, [1,2,4,7] allows 1+2+4=7, which is less than 8, and 1+7=8, which is k.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps [1,2,4,5].

Sums: 1,2,4,5,3 (1+2), 6 (2+4), 5 (1+4), 7 (1+2+4), 6 (1+5), 7 (2+5), 9 (4+5), etc.

Still, 1+2+5=8, which is k.

So, even with this sequence, sum to 8 is possible.

Therefore, I need a different approach.

This is getting too complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that since n can be up to 10^6 and m is at most 25, perhaps I can choose m such that the sum of the sequence is just above n, and adjust it to exclude k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that allow me to cover as many sums as possible without covering k.

For example, start with an empty sequence, and iteratively add the smallest number that allows me to cover new sums without covering k.

But implementing this for t=1000 test cases efficiently might be challenging, given the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^7.

I need a faster way.

Let me consider that since the problem allows m up to 25, and n up to 10^6, perhaps I can fix m=25 and choose a sequence that can cover all sums up to n except for k.

Given that, perhaps I can use a sequence that includes elements that are powers of 2, but adjust it based on k.

But without a clear method, this is too vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the problem allows me to output any sequence that satisfies the conditions, and that such a sequence exists, so perhaps there's a standard construction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2 and adjust k by including or excluding certain elements.

But again, without a clear plan, this is difficult.

Given that, perhaps I should accept that using the first 25 powers of 2 and outputting the same sequence for all test cases is acceptable, even if it includes k in the subset sums.

But that would be incorrect.

Therefore, I need to find a different approach.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different way to solve this problem.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m=25, I can cover all sums from 1 to n except for k by carefully choosing the elements.

Given that, perhaps I can choose elements such that their subset sums cover [1, n] \ {k}.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sequence of powers of 2 up to m=25, and for each test case, output this sequence, and rely on the fact that the subset sums can represent any number up to over 33 million, which covers n up to 10^6, and assume that k is excluded.

But that's incorrect because the subset sums would include k.

Therefore, I need to adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But I don't know how to do that systematically for all test cases.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that I don't have a clear solution and look for hints or consider that the problem might have a specific construction that I'm missing.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that using the first 25 powers of 2 and outputting the same sequence for all test cases is acceptable, even if it's not correct.

But that would be dishonest.

Therefore, I need to find a better way.

Given that, perhaps I can fix the sequence to be the first 25 powers of 2 and exclude the element that corresponds to k.

But if k is not a power of 2, that won't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements that prevent the sum from being k.

But without a clear method, this is too vague.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that I don't have a solution for this problem within the time constraints.

Therefore, I need to conclude that the given program is incorrect because it outputs the same sequence of 25 powers of 2 for all test cases, which would include the sum k, violating the condition.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
