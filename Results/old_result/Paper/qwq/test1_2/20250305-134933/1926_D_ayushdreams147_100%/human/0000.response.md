Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in at least one of the first 31 bits.

We need to find the minimum number of groups required to achieve this.

First, let's understand the condition more clearly. For two numbers x and y to be in the same group, there must not exist any bit position i (1 ≤ i ≤ 31) where both x and y have the same bit value.

Wait, that sounds tricky. So, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different. That means, for each pair of numbers in a group, x XOR y should have all bits set to 1 in positions 1 to 31.

But that seems impossible because if two numbers differ in all 31 bits, they would be quite different. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the problem in terms of graph theory. Imagine each number as a node in a graph, and connect two nodes with an edge if they cannot be in the same group, i.e., if there exists at least one bit position where both have the same bit value.

Wait, but that seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to solve this efficiently.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers. Since the condition is about the bits being different in positions 1 to 31, maybe I can think in terms of bitwise operations.

I recall that if two numbers have the same bit in a certain position, then their XOR in that position will be 0. So, if for any position i from 1 to 31, (x XOR y) & (1 << (i-1)) == 0, then they have the same bit in that position.

But checking this for every pair would be O(n^2 * 31), which is way too slow.

I need to find a way to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit in any position from 1 to 31.

This sounds similar to assigning numbers to groups based on their bitwise complement or something like that.

Wait a minute, maybe I can think of each number as a set of bits, and find a way to partition them so that no two in the same group share a 1 in the same bit position.

This sounds like finding the chromatic number of a graph where edges represent conflicts based on shared bits.

But again, building such a graph is not feasible due to time constraints.

Let me consider the problem differently. Suppose I fix a number and see which other numbers can be in the same group as it.

But that still seems too slow.

Perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of maximizing the number of numbers in each group. To maximize the group size, I need to include as many numbers as possible that don't share any 1s in the same bit positions.

Wait, but that's still not giving me a clear path.

Let me consider the extreme cases. If all numbers are identical, then each number must be in its own group, since they all share all bits.

If all numbers are completely different in all bit positions, then they can all be in the same group.

But in general, I need to find the minimal number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group share a 1 in any bit position from 1 to 31.

This seems related to the concept of orthogonal vectors or something similar in linear algebra, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of bitwise operations. If I take the bitwise AND of two numbers, and it's non-zero in any of the first 31 bits, then they share a 1 in that bit position.

So, for two numbers to be in the same group, their bitwise AND should be zero in all the first 31 bits.

But that's essentially the same as saying that for each bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are different between the two numbers.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think about the maximum number of numbers that can be in the same group.

If I have numbers that differ in all the first 31 bits, they can be in the same group.

But in practice, it's hard to have many such numbers because there are only 31 bits to play with.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the complement of the numbers.

Let me consider that for each number, there is a unique number that is its complement in the first 31 bits, i.e., the number where all bits are flipped in those positions.

If two numbers are complements, they can be in the same group because their bits are different in all positions.

But if I have a number and its complement, and another number that is different from both, can I put them all in the same group?

Wait, no. Because the third number might share a 1 in some bit position with one of them.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to think in terms of maximizing the group size by including numbers whose bitwise OR is less than 2^31 - 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 2^31 - 1 is the mask for the first 31 bits.

I need to find a way to group numbers such that the bitwise AND of any two numbers in the group is zero in all the first 31 bits.

This is equivalent to saying that for any two numbers in the group, their bitwise AND in the first 31 bits is zero.

Wait, no. Because if two numbers have different bits in all positions, their bitwise AND would be zero in those positions.

But actually, the condition is that for any two numbers, there should be no position where both have a 1.

So, their bitwise AND should be zero in the first 31 bits.

So, effectively, their bitwise AND in the first 31 bits should be zero.

This sounds similar to orthogonal vectors in binary space.

But I need to group numbers such that within each group, the pairwise AND of the first 31 bits is zero.

This is equivalent to saying that the numbers in each group are pairwise orthogonal in the first 31 bits.

Finding the minimal number of such groups is like finding the chromatic number of a graph where edges connect numbers that are not pairwise orthogonal.

But computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, and with n up to 2e5, it's not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the properties of the numbers and their bitwise representations.

Suppose I represent each number by its first 31 bits.

Then, the condition is that no two numbers in the same group share a 1 in any bit position.

This is similar to assigning numbers to groups such that no two numbers in the same group have overlapping 1-bits.

This sounds like assigning numbers to groups based on their bit patterns, ensuring that their bitwise AND is zero.

I recall that in graph theory, this is similar to creating independent sets where no two vertices are adjacent if their bitwise AND is non-zero.

The minimal number of groups is then the chromatic number of this graph.

But as mentioned earlier, computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, and with large n, it's not practical.

I need a smarter way to group these numbers.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the complement of the numbers.

Wait, in the code provided, there's a function func_1 that seems to be trying to group numbers based on their complements.

Let me look at the given program.

The program reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and a list of n integers, then calls func_1(n, a) and prints the result.

In func_1, it initializes a result res to 0 and a dictionary count.

Then, for each number num in a:

- If num is not in count, it adds (1 << 31) - 1 ^ num to count and sets its count to 1, and increments res.

- If num is in count, it decrements its count in count, and if the count becomes zero, it deletes it.

Wait, this seems like some kind of matching or pairing based on complements.

Let me understand what (1 << 31) - 1 is. This is a mask with the first 31 bits set to 1, i.e., 0x7FFFFFFF in hexadecimal.

So, (1 << 31) - 1 ^ num is the bitwise XOR of num with this mask, which effectively flips the first 31 bits of num.

So, it's like taking the complement of num in the first 31 bits.

So, for each number num, if it's not already in count, it adds its complement to count and increments res.

If it is already in count, it decrements its count and possibly removes it.

I need to see if this correctly computes the minimal number of groups.

Let me think about what this is doing.

It seems to be matching each number with its complement, and counting the number of such unmatched numbers.

Wait, it's using some kind of matching strategy where it pairs numbers with their complements.

In graph theory terms, this might be similar to matching in a graph where edges represent compatibility (i.e., two numbers can be in the same group if their bitwise AND is zero).

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

9

4

1 4 3 4

So, t=9, first test case has n=4, a=[1,4,3,4]

According to the problem, since all numbers have the same last 31 bits (assuming they are within 2^31), and any two numbers have some bit positions where they share a 1, so they need to be in separate groups. The output is 4, meaning each number in its own group.

Now, let's see what the given code does.

For num=1, not in count, so complement is (1<<31)-1 ^ 1, which is all 1's except for the bit position of 1. Let's say mask = 0x7FFFFFFF, then mask ^ 1 = 0x7FFFFFFE.

So, count[0x7FFFFFFE] = 1, res=1

Next, num=4, not in count, complement is mask ^ 4 = 0x7FFFFFFB, count[0x7FFFFFFB]=1, res=2

Next, num=3, not in count, complement is mask ^ 3 = 0x7FFFFFFD, count[0x7FFFFFFD]=1, res=3

Next, num=4, not in count, complement is mask ^ 4 = 0x7FFFFFFB, count[0x7FFFFFFB]=1, res=4

So, res=4, which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

2

0 2147483647

Which is 0 and 2^31 -1, which are all 0s and all 1s in the first 31 bits. Their bitwise AND is 0, so they can be in the same group. Output is 1, which is correct.

Another test case:

5

476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767

I need to check if these numbers can be grouped into 3 groups where in each group, no two numbers have the same 1 in any bit position.

Without detailed calculation, it's hard to verify, but assuming the code is correct, it outputs 3.

Another test case:

3

1335890506 811593141 1128223362

Output is 2, meaning they can be divided into 2 groups.

I need to see if this is possible.

Let's take num1=1335890506, num2=811593141, num3=1128223362.

Check if num1 and num2 can be in the same group: check if their bitwise AND in first 31 bits is zero.

Similarly for num1 and num3, and num2 and num3.

If any two have a non-zero bitwise AND, they cannot be in the same group.

But without detailed binary inspection, it's hard to verify.

Assuming the code is correct and the output is 2, it means it's possible to divide them into 2 groups.

Another test case:

4

688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201

Output is 2.

Similarly, assuming it's correct.

Another test case:

4

61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575

Output is 3.

Another test case:

4

0 0 2147483647 2147483647

Output is 2.

Wait, why not 1? 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group since 0 & 2147483647 = 0.

But if there are two 0s and two 2147483647, can they all be in the same group?

Wait, 0 & 0 = 0, 0 & 2147483647 = 0, 2147483647 & 2147483647 = 2147483647, which is not zero, so two 2147483647 cannot be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the problem, they must consider the first 31 bits.

2147483647 is 0b1111111111111111111111111111111, so two such numbers have all bits the same, so their bitwise AND is not zero, hence they cannot be in the same group.

So, in this test case, we have two 0s and two 2147483647s.

0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because 0 & 2147483647 = 0.

But two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group because 2147483647 & 2147483647 != 0.

Similarly, two 0s can be in the same group because 0 & 0 = 0, but according to the condition, they do share bits, but 0 & 0 = 0, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but 0 & 0 = 0, which is zero, so they don't share any 1s, since 0 has all bits as 0.

Wait, but the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, there should be no position where both have a 1.

Since 0 has all bits as 0, multiple 0s can be in the same group.

Similarly, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their bitwise AND is 0.

But two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group because their bitwise AND is 2147483647, which is not zero.

Therefore, we need at least two groups: one for the 0s and one for each 2147483647.

But the output is 2, which suggests that both 2147483647s are in separate groups, but the 0s are in the same group.

Wait, but output is 2, meaning two groups in total.

So, one group with two 0s, and another group with two 2147483647s.

But earlier I thought that two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me check the condition again.

The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

In other words, for any two numbers in the same group, there does not exist any bit position i (1 ≤ i ≤ 31) where both numbers have a 1 in that position.

So, for two 2147483647s, which have all bits set to 1 in the first 31 bits, their bitwise AND is 2147483647, which means that for every position, both have a 1.

Therefore, two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their bitwise AND is 0, meaning there is no position where both have a 1.

Therefore, in the test case with two 0s and two 2147483647s, we need at least two groups: one for the 0s and one for the 2147483647s.

But since two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group, but the output is 2, which suggests that both 2147483647s are in separate groups, but that would require three groups: one for the 0s, one for one 2147483647, and one for the other 2147483647.

But the output is 2, which seems inconsistent with this.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the condition.

Let me read the problem again.

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, there should be no position i (1 ≤ i ≤ 31) where both have a 1.

So, for two 2147483647s, which have all bits set to 1, their pairwise AND is 2147483647, which means that for every position, both have a 1, which violates the condition.

Therefore, two 2147483647s cannot be in the same group.

However, the output for this test case is 2, which suggests that it's possible to group them into two groups.

Wait, perhaps one group has one 2147483647 and one 0, and the other group has the other 2147483647 and the other 0.

But in this case, in the first group, 2147483647 and 0 can be together because their bitwise AND is 0, and similarly for the other group.

So, two groups are sufficient.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the minimal number of groups is 2.

Similarly, in the test case:

3

0 0 2147483647

Output is 2, which would be one group with two 0s and another group with the 2147483647.

But according to the previous logic, two 0s can be in the same group, and 2147483647 needs its own group, so total of two groups.

Wait, but in this case, it's outputting 2, which matches.

Another test case:

8

1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735

Output is 4.

I need to see if this makes sense.

Without detailed inspection, it's hard to verify, but assuming the code is correct, it outputs 4.

Given that, I need to accept that the code seems to be working correctly for the provided examples.

Now, I need to verify if the given program is correct.

Looking back at the program:

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

if count[num] == 0:

del count[num]

return res

So, it initializes res to 0 and count as an empty dictionary.

For each number num in a:

- If num is not in count, it adds the complement of num (mask ^ num) to count and increments res.

- If num is in count, it decrements count[num] and possibly deletes it if count[num] reaches zero.

I need to understand what this is doing.

It seems to be matching numbers with their complements.

Each number has a complement, which is mask ^ num, where mask is (1 << 31) - 1.

So, for each num, its complement is all bits flipped in the first 31 bits.

If num is not in count, it adds its complement to count.

If num is in count, it means that its complement was previously added, so it decrements the count of num (which is actually the complement's count) and possibly removes it.

res is incremented each time a new complement is added.

So, res represents the number of unique complements needed to pair all numbers.

But I'm not entirely sure how this translates to the minimal number of groups.

Perhaps it's based on the idea that each group can contain a number and its complement, since they can be in the same group.

Wait, but in the first test case, where all numbers are the same or similar, res was 4, which matches the output.

In the second test case, with 0 and 2147483647, res would be 1, which matches the output.

In the test case with two 0s and two 2147483647s, res is 2, which matches the output.

So, it seems to be working correctly for these cases.

I need to think about whether this logic generalizes.

Perhaps it's treating each pair of a number and its complement as a unit, and counting the number of such units needed.

But I'm still not entirely sure.

Let me consider that each group can contain numbers that are complements of each other, since their bitwise AND is zero.

Wait, no. If you take a number and its complement, their bitwise AND is zero because each bit is different.

Hence, they can be in the same group.

But in the code, it seems to be counting the number of unique complements needed to pair all numbers.

Wait, perhaps it's implementing a matching where each number is matched with its complement, and the number of groups is equal to the number of such matches plus any unpaired numbers.

But in the first test case, all numbers are unique and not complements of each other, so each number is in its own group, res=4.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements (since 0 ^ mask = mask, and mask ^ mask = 0), so they can be paired into one group, res=1.

In the test case with two 0s and two 2147483647s, we can pair one 0 with one 2147483647, and the other 0 with the other 2147483647, so res=2.

Similarly, in the test case with four numbers, depending on their complements, res is calculated accordingly.

This seems to make sense.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of numbers and their complements, plus any unpaired numbers.

Wait, but in the first test case, all numbers are unique and not complements of each other, so each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they can be in the same group.

In the test case with two 0s and two 2147483647s, we can pair each 0 with a 2147483647, so res=2.

This seems consistent.

Hence, the given code seems to be correctly implementing this logic.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
