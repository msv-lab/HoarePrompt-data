Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the beginning, at moment 0, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time that it's on. Also, he can turn the phone off and on again, but each time he does that, it costs b units of charge.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any point.

First, I need to understand the charge consumption. The phone loses a units of charge per unit of time it's on. So, if the phone is on for t units of time, it will lose a*t charge.

Also, turning the phone off and on costs b units each time he does this action. Importantly, turning it off and on is considered an instantaneous action; it doesn't take time, but it does consume b charge units each time.

I need to find a strategy for when to turn the phone on and off to minimize charge consumption and ensure that at each message moment, there's enough charge to send the message.

Let me think about the intervals between message moments. Since the moments are increasing, mi < mi+1, so the time between mi and mi+1 is mi+1 - mi.

I need to decide whether to keep the phone on between mi and mi+1 or to turn it off and on again at mi+1.

If I keep the phone on between mi and mi+1, the charge will decrease by a*(mi+1 - mi).

If I turn the phone off at mi and on again at mi+1, the charge will decrease by b.

So, at each interval, I have to choose the option that results in less charge consumption.

Wait, but it's not just about each interval independently. Because turning the phone off and on at one interval affects the charge available for the next interval.

Let me think differently. Suppose I decide to keep the phone on from the start until the first message, then decide whether to keep it on or turn it off between each subsequent pair of messages.

But maybe there's a better way. Perhaps I can iterate through the message times and calculate the charge consumption based on the decisions made at each step.

Let's consider the initial charge is f at moment 0.

At moment m1, if the phone is kept on from 0 to m1, the charge will be f - a*m1.

Alternatively, if I turn the phone off at 0 and on at m1, the charge will be f - b.

I need to choose the option that leaves more charge at m1.

Similarly, at each subsequent message, I need to decide whether to keep the phone on from the previous message or turn it off and on at the current message.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where at each message, I consider the charge left based on the previous decision.

But given the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 per test case and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me try to find a greedy approach.

At each interval between messages, I have to choose between:

1. Keeping the phone on, which costs a*(mi+1 - mi) charge.

2. Turning the phone off and on at the next message, which costs b charge.

I should choose the option that costs less charge.

So, for each interval, if a*(mi+1 - mi) < b, then keep the phone on; otherwise, turn it off and on at the next message.

Wait, but there might be cases where turning it off and on is better even if a*(mi+1 - mi) > b, because it resets the charge consumption.

Wait, no. Since the phone loses charge continuously when it's on, and loses b each time it's turned off and on, it's better to choose the option with the least charge consumption for each interval.

So, for each interval between messages, calculate the charge consumption for both options and choose the one that consumes less charge.

But actually, since the phone is required to be on at the moments when messages are sent, I need to ensure that at each message moment, the phone has enough charge to send the message.

Also, the phone starts at moment 0 with f charge, and it's on at moment 0.

Let me try to model this.

Let's initialize the charge as f.

Then, for each interval between messages, I need to decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on at the next message.

I'll iterate through the message times and update the charge accordingly.

At each step, I'll choose the option that minimizes the charge consumption for that interval.

So, for each pair of consecutive messages, mi and mi+1:

Option 1: Keep the phone on from mi to mi+1, which costs a*(mi+1 - mi)

Option 2: Turn the phone off at mi and on at mi+1, which costs b

I'll choose the minimum of these two options and subtract that cost from the current charge.

Wait, but actually, if I choose to keep the phone on from mi to mi+1, the cost is a*(mi+1 - mi), but if I choose to turn it off at mi and on at mi+1, the cost is b.

So, at each step, I can choose the minimum of these two costs and subtract it from the current charge.

Then, at each message moment, I need to ensure that the charge is positive or zero to send the message.

Wait, but according to the problem, if the charge drops to zero or below at any moment, it's impossible to send the message at that moment.

So, after updating the charge after each interval, at the message moment, I need to check if the charge is greater than zero.

Wait, but the charge is updated after each interval, so at each message moment, the charge should be greater than zero.

But actually, in the problem statement, it says that the phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on, and that turning it off and on consumes b units each time.

So, the charge is continuously decreasing when the phone is on, and it decreases by b each time it's turned off and on.

But in the proposed solution, it seems like the charge is being updated at each interval by subtracting the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b.

Wait, but that might not be accurate.

Let me think again.

At moment 0, the phone is on with f charge.

To send the first message at m1, the phone must be on, so it has lost a*m1 charge, so the remaining charge is f - a*m1.

Alternatively, I can turn the phone off at moment 0 and on at moment m1, which would cost b charge, so the remaining charge would be f - b.

I should choose the option that leaves more charge at m1.

So, choose the maximum between f - a*m1 and f - b.

Wait, that makes sense.

Similarly, between m1 and m2:

Option 1: Keep the phone on from m1 to m2, losing a*(m2 - m1) charge.

Option 2: Turn the phone off at m1 and on at m2, losing b charge.

Again, choose the option that leaves more charge.

So, at each step, I should choose the option that results in the maximum remaining charge.

Wait, but in the proposed solution, it's subtracting the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b from the current charge at each step.

That would be equivalent to choosing the option with the least charge consumption.

But actually, choosing the option with the least charge consumption would leave more charge, so it's effectively choosing the option that maximizes the remaining charge.

Wait, no. Subtracting the minimum cost would be choosing the option that costs less, hence leaving more charge.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, at each interval, subtract the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b from the current charge.

Then, after processing all intervals, if the remaining charge is greater than zero, then it's possible to send all messages; otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but in the problem, it's acceptable for the charge to be zero at the last moment, as long as it's not negative.

But the problem says that if at any point the charge level drops to zero or below, it's impossible to send the message at that moment.

So, I need to ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

Wait, but for the last message, it's acceptable to have zero charge after sending it, I think.

But to be safe, I'll ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive before sending the message.

So, in the proposed solution, after subtracting the minimum cost for each interval, check if the remaining charge is positive after all subtractions.

If it is, then output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Looking back at the example in the problem:

First test case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m=[3]

So, only one message at moment 3.

Option 1: Keep the phone on from 0 to 3, losing a*3 = 3 charge, so remaining charge is 3 - 3 = 0.

Option 2: Turn the phone off at 0 and on at 3, losing b=5 charge, so remaining charge is 3 - 5 = -2.

So, choosing the first option, remaining charge is 0 at moment 3.

But the problem says that if the charge is <=0 at any moment, it's impossible to send the message.

So, in this case, since the charge is 0 at moment 3, it's impossible to send the message.

Hence, the answer should be "NO", which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=7, f=21, a=1, b=3

m=[4,6,10,13,17,20,26]

So, let's compute the intervals:

Between m0=0 and m1=4: min(a*4, b)=min(4,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=21-3=18

Between m1=4 and m2=6: min(a*2, b)=min(2,3)=2, so subtract 2, f=18-2=16

Between m2=6 and m3=10: min(a*4, b)=min(4,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=16-3=13

Between m3=10 and m4=13: min(a*3, b)=min(3,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=13-3=10

Between m4=13 and m5=17: min(a*4, b)=min(4,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=10-3=7

Between m5=17 and m6=20: min(a*3, b)=min(3,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=7-3=4

Between m6=20 and m7=26: min(a*6, b)=min(6,3)=3, so subtract 3, f=4-3=1

Final charge is 1, which is >0, so "YES"

This seems correct.

Third test case:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

m=[1,2,3,4,5]

Between 0 and 1: min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1, f=10-1=9

Between 1 and 2: min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1, f=9-1=8

Between 2 and 3: min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1, f=8-1=7

Between 3 and 4: min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1, f=7-1=6

Between 4 and 5: min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1, f=6-1=5

Final charge is 5, which is >0, so "YES"

Again, matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=1, f=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

m=[1000000000]

Between 0 and 1000000000: min(a*1000000000, b)=min(1000000000*1000000000, 1000000000)

But a*1000000000 is 1000000000*1000000000, which is 10^18, but f is only 1000000000, so subtracting min(10^18, 1000000000)=1000000000, f=1000000000-1000000000=0

At moment 1000000000, charge is 0, which is <=0, so "NO"

Fifth test case:

n=3, f=11, a=9, b=6

m=[6,8,10]

Between 0 and 6: min(a*6, b)=min(54,6)=6, f=11-6=5

Between 6 and 8: min(a*2, b)=min(18,6)=6, f=5-6=-1

Since f becomes -1, which is <=0, can't send the message at 8.

So, "NO"

Sixth test case:

n=12, f=621526648, a=2585904, b=3566299

m=[51789,61859,71998,73401,247675,298086,606959,663464,735972,806043,806459,919683]

Compute the intervals and subtract the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b.

After all subtractions, if f > 0, then "YES"

According to the sample output, it's "YES"

So, the proposed solution seems to work for the sample inputs.

Now, let's consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1:

n=1, f=1, a=1, b=1

m=[1]

Option 1: Keep on from 0 to 1, lose a*1=1, f=1-1=0

Option 2: Turn off and on at 1, lose b=1, f=1-1=0

Since at moment 1, f=0, which is <=0, can't send the message. So, "NO"

Edge case 2:

n=1, f=2, a=1, b=1

m=[1]

Option 1: Keep on from 0 to 1, lose a*1=1, f=2-1=1

Option 2: Turn off and on at 1, lose b=1, f=2-1=1

At moment 1, f=1>0, so "YES"

Edge case 3:

n=2, f=5, a=2, b=3

m=[1,3]

Between 0 and 1: min(a*1, b)=min(2,3)=2, f=5-2=3

Between 1 and 3: min(a*2, b)=min(4,3)=3, f=3-3=0

At moment 3, f=0, which is <=0, so "NO"

Edge case 4:

n=2, f=6, a=2, b=3

m=[1,3]

Between 0 and 1: min(2,3)=2, f=6-2=4

Between 1 and 3: min(4,3)=3, f=4-3=1

At moment 3, f=1>0, so "YES"

Seems consistent.

Another consideration: If a=0, then keeping the phone on doesn't consume any charge, so it's always better to keep it on.

But according to the constraints, a >=1, so a=0 is not possible.

Wait, no, in the input constraints, a >=1, so a=0 is not allowed.

Similarly, b >=1.

Also, n can be 1, so need to handle that.

Also, need to handle large inputs efficiently, since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5.

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(n), and overall O(2*10^5), which is acceptable.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

while t > 0:

(n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))

ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))

for i in range(1, len(ls)):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

t -= 1

This seems to implement the logic I described: iterate through the message times, compute the minimum cost for each interval, subtract it from the current charge, and finally check if the charge is positive.

But there's a mistake here.

The loop iterates from i=1 to len(ls)-1, which is from the second message to the last message.

But we need to consider the interval from moment 0 to the first message as well.

In the code, it starts from i=1, which corresponds to the interval between the first and second messages.

It misses the initial interval from 0 to the first message.

Looking back, in the explanation, I considered the interval from 0 to m1, but in the code, it starts from m1 to m2.

This is an error.

So, the code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the charge consumption from moment 0 to the first message.

I need to fix this.

Corrected code should be:

for i in range(len(ls)):

if i == 0:

# Interval from 0 to ls[0]

f -= min(a * ls[0], b)

else:

# Interval from ls[i-1] to ls[i]

f -= min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1]), b)

Then, after processing all intervals, check if f > 0.

So, the original code is missing the initial interval.

Let's confirm with the first test case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m=[3]

So, i=0: interval from 0 to 3, min(a*3, b)=min(3,5)=3, f=3-3=0

Then, check f > 0: 0 > 0 is False, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

If the code didn't include the initial interval, it would not subtract anything for this test case, since there's only one message, and the loop starts from i=1, which doesn't exist, so f remains 3, and it would output "YES", which is incorrect.

Hence, the original code is wrong because it doesn't handle the initial interval.

I need to adjust the code to include the initial interval.

So, the correct approach is:

- For the first message, consider the interval from 0 to m1.

- For subsequent messages, consider the intervals from mi to mi+1.

- For each interval, subtract the minimum of a*(interval length) and b from the current charge.

- After processing all intervals, if the charge is positive, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Therefore, the corrected code should iterate from i=0 to len(ls)-1, where i=0 represents the interval from 0 to ls[0].

Looking back at the original code:

for i in range(1, len(ls)):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

This starts from i=1, which corresponds to the interval between ls[0] and ls[1], missing the initial interval from 0 to ls[0].

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix it, change the loop to start from i=0:

for i in range(len(ls)):

if i == 0:

# Interval from 0 to ls[0]

f -= min(a * ls[0], b)

else:

# Interval from ls[i-1] to ls[i]

f -= min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

Then, after the loop, check if f > 0.

Alternatively, prepend a 0 to the list of message times to represent moment 0.

But need to handle it carefully to avoid errors.

Given that, the original code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial interval.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

But wait, in the sample input, it seems to work because perhaps the loop is processing the single message as the initial interval.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, ls=[3], so len(ls)=1, range(1,1) is empty, so no subtraction is done, and f remains 3.

Then, it checks if 3 > 0 and prints "YES", which is incorrect, because the correct answer should be "NO".

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=5, ls=[1,2,3,4,5], len(ls)=5, range(1,5) is i=1 to 4.

So, it processes intervals between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, but misses the interval from 0 to 1.

So, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
