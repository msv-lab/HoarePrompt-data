Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a permutation of length n, and I'm given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. I need to find out how many different permutations could have these specific prefix and suffix maximum indices. The answer should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. Prefix maximums are elements that are greater than all the elements before them in the permutation. Similarly, suffix maximums are elements that are greater than all the elements after them.

Given that, I have to work with the indices of these maximums. The indices are given in increasing order, which makes sense because prefix maximums are found by scanning from the start, and suffix maximums from the end.

Let me think about the constraints. The permutation is of length n, and I have m1 prefix maximums and m2 suffix maximums. The indices are between 1 and n, inclusive.

Looking at the example, for n=4, m1=2, m2=3, with prefix maximum indices 1 and 2, and suffix maximum indices 2, 3, and 4. The suitable permutations are [1,4,3,2], [2,4,3,1], and [3,4,2,1]. So, there are 3 possible permutations.

I need to find a general way to calculate the number of such permutations for any given n, m1, m2, and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Let me try to understand the properties of these permutations.

First, the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum because it's the start. So, p[0] should always be 1. Similarly, the last element should be a suffix maximum.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, m1=1, m2=1, with index 1 for both. That should be just [1], which is the only permutation, and it's correct.

In the second test case, n=4, m1=2, m2=3, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4]. The permutations that fit are the ones where the elements at positions 1 and 2 are prefix maximums, and at positions 2, 3, and 4 are suffix maximums.

I need to ensure that the permutation satisfies both the prefix and suffix maximum conditions at the specified indices.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the values at these indices. Since it's a permutation, all values from 1 to n are used exactly once.

The prefix maximums are increasing because each new prefix maximum is greater than the previous ones. Similarly, the suffix maximums are decreasing as we move from left to right in the list because they are maximums from their position to the end.

Wait, no. Suffix maximums are found by scanning from the end, so in the list s, they are in increasing order because s is given in increasing order.

Wait, but in the example, s=[2,3,4], which are the positions of suffix maximums. So, the elements at these positions are greater than all elements to their right.

I need to make sure that the permutation satisfies that the elements at p are prefix maximums and at s are suffix maximums.

Let me consider that the intersection of p and s should contain only one element, which is the global maximum of the permutation, because it's both a prefix and suffix maximum.

In the second example, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4]. So, the intersection is position 2. That means the element at position 2 is the global maximum.

Wait, but in the permutations given in the note, the element at position 2 is 4, which is the maximum.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the element at the intersection of p and s is the maximum element, n.

So, in general, the intersection of p and s should have only one element, which is the position of the maximum element, n.

Wait, but in the third test case, p=[1,2,3], s=[3], n=3. So, intersection is position 3, which is correct.

In the fourth test case, p=[1,2,3], s=[2,3,4,5], n=5. Intersection is position 3, which should be the maximum, 5.

Wait, but the output is 0, which suggests that this configuration is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to check more carefully.

Wait, in the fourth test case, p=[1,2,3], s=[2,3,4,5], n=5.

So, p ends with 3, which should be the global maximum, but s includes positions 2,3,4,5. So, position 3 is in both, but position 2 is in s but not in p.

Wait, but position 2 is in p, so it's in both p and s.

Wait, no, p=[1,2,3], s=[2,3,4,5]. So, positions 2 and 3 are in both p and s.

But in the problem statement, it says that p contains the indices of prefix maximums, and s contains the indices of suffix maximums.

In this case, if both p and s contain position 2 and 3, does that mean that both elements at positions 2 and 3 are prefix and suffix maximums?

Wait, but in a permutation, there should be only one global maximum.

Wait, no, the global maximum is only at one position.

Wait, but in this case, if position 2 and 3 are both in p and s, does that mean that both elements are equal and are the maximum?

No, in a permutation, all elements are unique.

So, only one element can be the maximum.

Therefore, only one position can be in both p and s.

Hence, p and s should intersect at exactly one position, which is the position of the maximum element.

In the second test case, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4], n=4.

Here, p and s intersect at position 2, which should be the maximum element, 4.

Similarly, in the third test case, p=[1,2,3], s=[3], n=3. They intersect at position 3, which is the maximum, 3.

In the fourth test case, p=[1,2,3], s=[2,3,4,5], n=5. p and s intersect at positions 2 and 3.

But in a permutation of length 5, only one element can be the maximum, so this is invalid, hence output is 0.

So, the first condition is that p and s should intersect at exactly one position, which is the position of the maximum element.

If they intersect at more than one position, it's invalid, hence output is 0.

Similarly, if they don't intersect at all, it's invalid.

So, in the code, it checks if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] !=1 or s[-1] !=n, then output 0.

Wait, p is sorted in increasing order, same as s.

So, p[-1] is the last prefix maximum index, which should be the position of the maximum element.

Similarly, s[0] is the first suffix maximum index, which should also be the position of the maximum element.

Hence, p[-1] should be equal to s[0], and it should be the position of the maximum element.

Also, p[0] should be 1, as the first element is always a prefix maximum.

Similarly, s[-1] should be n, as the last element is always a suffix maximum.

So, these checks ensure that:

- p[0] ==1

- s[-1]==n

- p[-1] == s[0] == position of the maximum element.

If any of these are not satisfied, output is 0.

Otherwise, proceed to calculate the number of possible permutations.

Now, I need to understand how to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.

I need to consider the arrangement of the elements in the permutation such that the prefix and suffix maximums are at the specified positions.

I recall that in permutations, the number of ways to arrange elements under certain constraints can be calculated using combinatorial methods, such as factorials and binomial coefficients.

Looking at the code, it precomputes factorials modulo 10^9+7 in the list 'facts'.

Then, for each test case, it initializes ans=1 and kol=n.

It iterates through the suffix maximum indices in s, starting from the first one.

For each x in s, it calculates a binomial coefficient cnk using func_2, which seems to compute (a * b^{-1}) mod 1000000007.

Then, it multiplies ans by cnk and updates kol.

Similarly, it does something similar for the prefix maximums.

Finally, it multiplies ans by the factorials of the differences between consecutive p's and s's.

I need to understand what's happening here.

I think the approach is to divide the permutation into segments between the prefix and suffix maximums and determine how many ways to arrange the elements in those segments.

Let me try to visualize this.

Suppose we have n=4, m1=2, m2=3, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4].

So, position 1 and 2 are prefix maximums, and positions 2,3,4 are suffix maximums.

The global maximum is at position 2.

So, the permutation looks like [_ , 4 , _ , _ ], because position 2 is the global maximum.

Now, I need to fill in the remaining positions with 1,2,3.

But also, position 1 is a prefix maximum, so the first element must be greater than anything before it (which is nothing), so it can be any of the remaining numbers, but in this case, it's constrained by the fact that position 2 is the global maximum.

Wait, but in the example, the possible permutations are [1,4,3,2], [2,4,3,1], and [3,4,2,1].

So, in all these, the first element is less than 4, and the elements after position 2 are less than 4.

Also, position 3 and 4 are suffix maximums, meaning that from position 3 to the end, the maximum is at position 3, and from position 4 to the end, the maximum is at position 4.

Wait, position 4 is the last position, so it's always a suffix maximum.

In the permutation [1,4,3,2], position 3 has 3, which is greater than position 4's 2, so it's a suffix maximum.

Position 4 has 2, which is the last one.

Similarly, in [2,4,3,1], position 3 has 3, which is greater than position 4's 1.

In [3,4,2,1], position 3 has 2, which is greater than position 4's 1.

So, the suffix maximums are correctly placed.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need to consider the arrangement of the elements in such a way that the prefix and suffix maximums are at the specified positions.

I think the key is to assign the maximum value to the intersection of p and s, which is the global maximum.

Then, assign the remaining values to the other positions, making sure that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are satisfied.

Perhaps, I can split the permutation into segments divided by the prefix and suffix maximums and calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining numbers in those segments.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be doing something like that.

It first checks if p[-1] == s[0], p[0] ==1, and s[-1] ==n. If not, output 0.

Otherwise, it initializes ans=1 and kol=n.

Then, it iterates through the suffix maximum indices in s, and for each x in s, it calculates cnk = func_2(facts[kol-1], facts[n-x] * facts[kol-1 + x -n]).

Wait, let's look at func_2.

func_2(a, b) computes a * b^{-1} mod 1000000007, where b^{-1} is the modular inverse of b modulo 1000000007.

So, cnk is effectively a / b, but using modular arithmetic.

Given that, cnk seems to be calculating a binomial coefficient, C(a, b), but I need to confirm.

Similarly, it multiplies ans by cnk and updates kol.

Then, it does something similar for the prefix maximums.

Finally, it multiplies ans by the factorials of the differences between consecutive p's and s's.

I need to understand what these steps represent.

I think it's dividing the permutation into segments and calculating the number of ways to arrange the numbers in those segments, considering the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.

Then, I need to assign values to these positions such that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are satisfied.

The global maximum should be at the intersection of p and s.

Then, the other prefix maximums should be increasing up to the global maximum, and the suffix maximums should be decreasing from the global maximum to the end.

Wait, no, suffix maximums are increasing from left to right in their indices because s is sorted.

But in terms of values, from the global maximum to the end, they should be decreasing.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the values assigned to p and s.

Let me consider that the values at the prefix maximum positions are increasing, and the values at the suffix maximum positions are decreasing from the global maximum to the end.

Wait, perhaps not.

I need to ensure that for each prefix maximum position, the value there is greater than all previous elements.

Similarly, for each suffix maximum position, the value there is greater than all subsequent elements.

This seems tricky.

Maybe inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial counting can be applied here.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be calculating some product of binomial coefficients and factorials.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider a small example.

Take n=3, m1=3, m2=1, p=[1,2,3], s=[3].

So, all positions are prefix maximums, and only the last position is a suffix maximum.

The only permutation that fits is [1,2,3], because:

- Position 1: 1 is greater than nothing before it.

- Position 2: 2 is greater than 1.

- Position 3: 3 is greater than 2.

- Position 3 is the suffix maximum, as 3 is greater than nothing after it.

So, only one permutation, which matches the sample output.

Now, another test case: n=4, m1=2, m2=3, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4].

Possible permutations are [1,4,3,2], [2,4,3,1], [3,4,2,1].

So, three permutations.

I need to see if the code correctly calculates this.

Let's simulate the code for this input.

n=4, m1=2, m2=3, p=[1,2], s=[2,3,4].

First, check if p[-1]==s[0], p[0]==1, s[-1]==4. Yes, p[-1]=2, s[0]=2, p[0]=1, s[-1]=4. So, proceed.

Initialize ans=1, kol=4.

Iterate through s:

First x=2:

cnk = func_2(facts[kol-1], facts[n-x] * facts[kol-1 + x -n])

kol=4, n=4, x=2.

So, kol-1=3, n-x=2, kol-1 + x -n =3 +2 -4=1.

So, cnk = func_2(facts[3], facts[2] * facts[1]) = C(6,2*1)=C(6,2)=15, but need to confirm with actual facts values.

Wait, facts is precomputed factorials modulo 1e9+7.

facts[3]=6, facts[2]=2, facts[1]=1.

So, cnk = (6 * (2*1)^(-1)) mod 1e9+7.

Need to compute 2*1=2, its inverse modulo 1e9+7 is (1e9+7)^(-1)/2, but actually, func_1 computes the inverse.

Then, ans *= cnk.

Then, kol = n - x =4 -2=2.

Next x=3:

cnk = func_2(facts[kol-1], facts[n-x]*facts[kol-1 + x -n])

kol=2, n=3, x=3.

Wait, n=4, x=3.

So, kol-1=1, n-x=1, kol-1 + x -n=1 +3 -4=0.

So, cnk = func_2(facts[1], facts[1]*facts[0])= func_2(1,1*1)=1.

ans *=1.

Then, kol = n -x=4-3=1.

Next x=4:

cnk = func_2(facts[kol-1], facts[n-x]*facts[kol-1 + x -n])

kol=1, n-x=0, kol-1=0, kol-1 + x -n=0 +4 -4=0.

So, cnk = func_2(facts[0], facts[0]*facts[0])= func_2(1,1*1)=1.

ans *=1.

So, ans is still 15.

Then, kol = n -x=4-4=0.

Next, kol = s[0] -1=2-1=1.

Then, p2=[p[i] for i in range(m1-2,-1,-1)]=[1].

Then, for x in p2:

x=1:

cnk = func_2(facts[kol-1], facts[x-1]*facts[kol -x])

kol=1, x=1.

So, facts[kol-1]=facts[0]=1, facts[x-1]=facts[0]=1, facts[kol -x]=facts[0]=1.

cnk=func_2(1,1*1)=1.

ans *=1.

Then, kol =x-1=0.

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

m1=2, so i=0.

ans *= facts[p[1]-p[0]-1]=facts[2-1-1]=facts[0]=1.

Then, for i in range(m2-1):

m2=3, so i=0,1.

ans *= facts[s[1]-s[0]-1]=facts[3-2-1]=facts[0]=1.

ans *= facts[s[2]-s[1]-1]=facts[4-3-1]=facts[0]=1.

So, ans remains 15.

But in the sample, the answer is 3, not 15.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, func_2(a,b)=a*b^{-1} mod 1e9+7.

So, cnk = facts[kol-1] * (facts[n-x] * facts[kol -1 +x -n])^{-1}

In the first iteration, kol=4, x=2.

So, cnk = facts[3] * (facts[2] * facts[1])^{-1} = 6 * (2*1)^{-1} =6*(2)^{-1}=6*500000004=3 mod 1e9+7.

Because 2*500000004=1 mod 1e9+7.

So, cnk=3.

ans=1*3=3.

Then, kol=4-2=2.

Next x=3:

cnk = facts[1] * (facts[1] * facts[0])^{-1} =1*(1*1)^{-1}=1*1=1.

ans=3*1=3.

Next x=4:

cnk = facts[0] * (facts[0]*facts[0])^{-1}=1*(1*1)^{-1}=1.

ans=3*1=3.

Then, kol=2-1=1.

p2=[1].

For x=1:

cnk = facts[0] * (facts[0]*facts[0])^{-1}=1.

ans=3*1=3.

Then, for i in range(1):

ans *= facts[2-1-1]=facts[0]=1.

Then, for i in range(2):

ans *= facts[3-2-1]=facts[0]=1.

ans *= facts[4-3-1]=facts[0]=1.

So, ans remains 3, which matches the sample output.

Great, so my earlier miscalculation was wrong.

Now, I need to see if this logic is generalizable.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be correctly calculating the number of permutations based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.

It's considering the constraints imposed by these positions and calculating the number of ways to arrange the remaining numbers accordingly.

Given that it works for the sample input, and seems logically consistent, I would say that the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
