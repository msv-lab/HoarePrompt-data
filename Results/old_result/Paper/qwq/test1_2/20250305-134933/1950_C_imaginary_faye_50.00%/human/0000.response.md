Alright, I've got this problem to solve. The task is to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a time in "hh:mm" format, and I need to output the equivalent time in 12-hour format, specifying AM or PM accordingly.

First, I need to understand the differences between 24-hour and 12-hour formats. In 24-hour format, the day is divided into 24 hours, from 00 to 23, each with 60 minutes from 00 to 59. In 12-hour format, the day is divided into two halves: AM and PM, each with 12 hours numbered from 12 to 11.

So, for any given time in 24-hour format, I need to convert it to the 12-hour format by adjusting the hour and adding either AM or PM.

Looking at the code provided:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This function seems to handle the conversion. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Reading Input:**

   - The first line reads the number of test cases, `t`.

   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` in "hh:mm" format.

2. **Handling Hours:**

   - It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.

   - If `h` is '00', it prints '12' (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).

   - If `h` is less than or equal to '12', it prints `h` as is.

   - If `h` is greater than '12', it subtracts 12 from `h` and prints the result, prefixed with '0' if necessary.

3. **Handling Minutes and AM/PM:**

   - It prints the minutes part directly from the original string `s`.

   - It appends either 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is less than or equal to 11.

Looking at the logic, there are a few potential issues:

- For `h == '00'`, it correctly prints '12' as the hour and appends 'AM'.

- For `h <= '12'`, it prints `h` as is. This seems mostly correct, but I need to verify if `h = '12'` should be treated as PM.

- For `h > '12'`, it subtracts 12 from `h` and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.

Let me consider some examples to verify this logic.

**Example 1:**

- Input: '09:41'

- Expected Output: '09:41 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '09'

  - Since '09' <= '12', print '09' as is.

  - Append 'AM' because '09' < 12.

  - So, '09:41 AM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 2:**

- Input: '18:06'

- Expected Output: '06:06 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '18'

  - Since '18' > '12', print '0{}'.format(18 - 12) = '06'

  - Append 'PM' because '18' >= 12.

  - So, '06:06 PM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 3:**

- Input: '12:14'

- Expected Output: '12:14 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '12'

  - Since '12' <= '12', print '12' as is.

  - Append 'PM' because '12' >= 12.

  - So, '12:14 PM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 4:**

- Input: '00:59'

- Expected Output: '12:59 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '00'

  - Since h == '00', print '12'

  - Append 'AM' because '00' < 12.

  - So, '12:59 AM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 5:**

- Input: '00:00'

- Expected Output: '12:00 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '00'

  - Since h == '00', print '12'

  - Append 'AM' because '00' < 12.

  - So, '12:00 AM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 6:**

- Input: '14:34'

- Expected Output: '02:34 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '14'

  - Since '14' > '12', print '0{}'.format(14 - 12) = '02'

  - Append 'PM' because '14' >= 12.

  - So, '02:34 PM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 7:**

- Input: '01:01'

- Expected Output: '01:01 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '01'

  - Since '01' <= '12', print '01' as is.

  - Append 'AM' because '01' < 12.

  - So, '01:01 AM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 8:**

- Input: '19:07'

- Expected Output: '07:07 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '19'

  - Since '19' > '12', print '0{}'.format(19 - 12) = '07'

  - Append 'PM' because '19' >= 12.

  - So, '07:07 PM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 9:**

- Input: '11:59'

- Expected Output: '11:59 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '11'

  - Since '11' <= '12', print '11' as is.

  - Append 'AM' because '11' < 12.

  - So, '11:59 AM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 10:**

- Input: '12:00'

- Expected Output: '12:00 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '12'

  - Since '12' <= '12', print '12' as is.

  - Append 'PM' because '12' >= 12.

  - So, '12:00 PM' which matches the expected output.

**Example 11:**

- Input: '21:37'

- Expected Output: '09:37 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '21'

  - Since '21' > '12', print '0{}'.format(21 - 12) = '09'

  - Append 'PM' because '21' >= 12.

  - So, '09:37 PM' which matches the expected output.

From these examples, the code seems to handle all cases correctly. However, I should check if there are any edge cases that might not be handled properly.

**Edge Case 1:**

- Input: '13:00'

- Expected Output: '01:00 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '13'

  - Since '13' > '12', print '0{}'.format(13 - 12) = '01'

  - Append 'PM' because '13' >= 12.

  - So, '01:00 PM' which is correct.

**Edge Case 2:**

- Input: '23:59'

- Expected Output: '11:59 PM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '23'

  - Since '23' > '12', print '0{}'.format(23 - 12) = '11'

  - Append 'PM' because '23' >= 12.

  - So, '11:59 PM' which is correct.

**Edge Case 3:**

- Input: '00:01'

- Expected Output: '12:01 AM'

- According to the code:

  - h = '00'

  - Since h == '00', print '12'

  - Append 'AM' because '00' < 12.

  - So, '12:01 AM' which is correct.

**Edge Case 4:**

- Input: '12:00'

- Expected Output: '12:00 PM'

- Already checked and correct.

Another thing to consider is whether the hour part is being handled correctly when it's a single digit after conversion. For example:

- Input: '13:00'

- Converted hour: '01'

- Output: '01:00 PM'

This seems correct.

Also, checking if the leading zero is added properly:

- Input: '14:00'

- Converted hour: '02'

- Output: '02:00 PM'

This is correct.

One more thing to verify is the minute part. The code prints `s[2:]`, which should be the minute part. Since the input is guaranteed to be in "hh:mm" format, this should always be correct.

Now, looking at the way AM/PM is determined:

- If `h >= 12`, it's PM; else, it's AM.

This is correct for the 12-hour format.

Also, note that in the 12-hour format, 12:00 PM is noon and 12:00 AM is midnight.

Looking back at the code, for `h = '12'`, it correctly appends 'PM', and for `h = '00'`, it correctly appends 'AM'.

I think the code handles all the cases correctly based on the problem description and the examples provided.

Therefore, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
