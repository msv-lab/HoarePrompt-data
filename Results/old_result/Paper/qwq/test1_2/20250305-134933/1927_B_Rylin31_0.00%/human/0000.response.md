Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp lost a string, but he has something called a "trace" of that string, which is an array of integers. The trace array a has values where a_i represents the number of indices j (with j < i) such that s_i equals s_j. For example, for the string "abracadabra", the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. That makes sense because, for each character, it's counting how many times that same character has appeared before it in the string.

My task is, given this trace array, to reconstruct any possible string that could have produced this trace. The string should only consist of lowercase Latin letters.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input starts with an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there's an integer n, which is the length of the lost string, followed by an array of n integers, which is the trace.

The output should be t strings, each corresponding to a test case, where each string matches the given trace.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2⋅10^5

It's guaranteed that a valid string exists for each trace provided.

Let me look at the example to understand better.

Example Input:

5

11

0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4

10

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

1

0

8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

8

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Example Output:

abracadabra

codeforces

a

aaaaaaaa

dijkstra

Looking at the first test case:

n=11, trace=[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

The output is "abracadabra". Let's verify this:

- a: 0 (first a)

- b: 0 (first b)

- r: 0 (first r)

- a: 1 (second a, one a before)

- c: 0 (first c)

- a: 2 (third a, two a's before)

- d: 0 (first d)

- a: 3 (fourth a, three a's before)

- b: 1 (second b, one b before)

- r: 1 (second r, one r before)

- a: 4 (fifth a, four a's before)

This matches the trace [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4].

Another test case:

n=10, trace=[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]

Output: "codeforces"

Let's verify:

- c: 0

- o: 0

- d: 0

- e: 0

- f: 0

- o: 1 (second o, one o before)

- r: 0

- c: 1 (second c, one c before)

- e: 1 (second e, one e before)

- s: 0

This matches the trace.

From these examples, it seems like the trace counts the number of previous occurrences of the same character up to that point in the string.

Now, I need to find a way to reconstruct the string from this trace array.

Approach:

I need to map each position in the trace to a character such that the count of previous occurrences matches the trace value.

One way to approach this is to keep track of the frequency of each character up to each position and assign characters accordingly.

But since we have to ensure that for each position i, the number of previous occurrences of s_i is exactly a_i, I need to make sure that for each i, the character chosen has appeared exactly a_i times before.

Given that, I can iterate through the string positions and assign characters based on the frequency counts up to that point.

But considering the constraints (t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 per test case, with total sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5), I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think of a way to do this efficiently.

One idea is to iterate through the string positions and keep track of the frequency of each character. For each position, I need to choose a character that has appeared exactly a_i times before.

To optimize this, I can use a frequency array or a dictionary to keep track of how many times each character has been used so far.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough.

Wait, the sum of n over all test cases is 2*10^5, so overall time complexity should be O(N), where N is up to 2*10^5.

Alright, with that in mind, let's think about how to implement this.

I can proceed as follows:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the trace array a of length n.

- Initialize a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each character has been used.

- Iterate through each position i from 0 to n-1:

- I need to choose a character that has been used exactly a_i times so far.

- To do this efficiently, I can loop through all possible characters ('a' to 'z') and select the one whose frequency matches a_i.

- Assign that character to position i and increment its frequency.

- Collect all characters in order to form the string.

This seems straightforward, but I need to make sure it's efficient.

Since there are only 26 possible characters, checking each character's frequency for each position would be O(n*26), which is acceptable since n is up to 2*10^5.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Another idea: Since for each position, I need a character that has appeared exactly a_i times, I can group positions by a_i and assign characters accordingly.

Wait, but each character can have multiple positions with the same a_i, depending on how it's used.

Hmm.

Let me consider the frequencies.

For each character, the positions where it appears will have a_i values that correspond to the number of times it has appeared before.

For example, for character 'a' appearing at positions with a_i = 0,1,2, etc.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider another approach.

What if I iterate through the string positions in order and for each position, assign the smallest available character that has appeared exactly a_i times so far.

"Smallest available character" would mean the one with the smallest ASCII value among those that satisfy the frequency condition.

This way, I can ensure that I'm assigning characters in a consistent manner.

To implement this, I can maintain a frequency count for each character and, for each position, find the character with the smallest ASCII that has a frequency equal to a_i.

After assigning the character to the position, I increment its frequency.

This seems workable.

Let me try this with the first example:

n=11, a=[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

Initialize frequency dictionary: all characters have frequency 0.

Position 0: a_i=0. Find the smallest character with frequency 0. That's 'a'. Assign 'a', increment frequency of 'a' to 1.

Position 1: a_i=0. Find the smallest character with frequency 0. 'a' has frequency 1, so next is 'b'. Assign 'b', increment to 1.

Position 2: a_i=0. Smallest with frequency 0 is 'c'. Assign 'c', increment to 1.

Position 3: a_i=1. Find smallest with frequency 1. 'a' has frequency 1. Assign 'a', increment to 2.

Position 4: a_i=0. Smallest with frequency 0 is 'd'. Assign 'd', increment to 1.

Position 5: a_i=2. Find smallest with frequency 2. 'a' has frequency 2. Assign 'a', increment to 3.

Position 6: a_i=0. Smallest with frequency 0 is 'e'. Assign 'e', increment to 1.

Position 7: a_i=3. Find smallest with frequency 3. 'a' has frequency 3. Assign 'a', increment to 4.

Position 8: a_i=1. Find smallest with frequency 1. 'b' has frequency 1. Assign 'b', increment to 2.

Position 9: a_i=1. Find smallest with frequency 1. 'c' has frequency 1. Assign 'c', increment to 2.

Position 10: a_i=4. Find smallest with frequency 4. 'a' has frequency 4. Assign 'a', increment to 5.

So the string is "abracadabra", which matches the example.

Great, this approach seems to work.

Let me try another example.

n=10, a=[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]

Initialize frequency dictionary: all 0.

Pos 0: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=1.

Pos 1: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'b'. Assign 'b', freq['b']=1.

Pos 2: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'c'. Assign 'c', freq['c']=1.

Pos 3: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'd'. Assign 'd', freq['d']=1.

Pos 4: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'e'. Assign 'e', freq['e']=1.

Pos 5: a_i=1. Smallest with 1: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=2.

Pos 6: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'f'. Assign 'f', freq['f']=1.

Pos 7: a_i=1. Smallest with 1: 'b'. Assign 'b', freq['b']=2.

Pos 8: a_i=1. Smallest with 1: 'c'. Assign 'c', freq['c']=2.

Pos 9: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'g'. Assign 'g', freq['g']=1.

So the string is "abcdeafbcg", but the example output is "codeforces". Why is that?

Wait, the problem says: "If there are multiple such strings s, then output any of them."

So "abcdeafbcg" is also a valid string that matches the trace [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]. The example output is "codeforces", which is also valid.

So, my approach is correct, and any valid string that matches the trace is acceptable.

Another test case:

n=1, a=[0]

Only one position with a_i=0, so the character must be the first occurrence. Assign 'a'.

Output: "a"

Matches the example.

Next test case:

n=8, a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Initialize frequencies.

Pos 0: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=1.

Pos 1: a_i=1. Smallest with 1: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=2.

Pos 2: a_i=2. Smallest with 2: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=3.

Pos 3: a_i=3. Smallest with 3: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=4.

Pos 4: a_i=4. Smallest with 4: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=5.

Pos 5: a_i=5. Smallest with 5: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=6.

Pos 6: a_i=6. Smallest with 6: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=7.

Pos 7: a_i=7. Smallest with 7: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=8.

So the string is "aaaaaaaa", which matches the example output.

Last test case:

n=8, a=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Initialize frequencies.

Pos 0: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'a'. Assign 'a', freq['a']=1.

Pos 1: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'b'. Assign 'b', freq['b']=1.

Pos 2: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'c'. Assign 'c', freq['c']=1.

Pos 3: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'd'. Assign 'd', freq['d']=1.

Pos 4: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'e'. Assign 'e', freq['e']=1.

Pos 5: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'f'. Assign 'f', freq['f']=1.

Pos 6: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'g'. Assign 'g', freq['g']=1.

Pos 7: a_i=0. Smallest with 0: 'h'. Assign 'h', freq['h']=1.

So the string is "abcdefgh", but the example output is "dijkstra". That's because multiple strings can match the trace, and any one is acceptable.

Therefore, my approach is correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently in code.

I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently, considering the constraints.

I can proceed as follows:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a of n integers.

- Initialize a frequency dictionary for characters 'a' to 'z', initialized to 0.

- Initialize an empty list to store the characters of the string.

- For each a_i in a:

- Iterate through characters 'a' to 'z':

- Find the smallest character whose current frequency is equal to a_i.

- Append this character to the string list.

- Increment its frequency.

- After processing all positions, join the list into a string and print it.

This should work efficiently since for each position, we iterate at most 26 characters, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

t=1

n=1

a=[0]

Expected Output: "a"

Edge Case 2:

t=1

n=2

a=[0,0]

Possible Output: "ab" or "ac" etc.

Edge Case 3:

t=1

n=2

a=[0,1]

Possible Output: "aa"

Edge Case 4:

t=1

n=3

a=[0,1,1]

Possible Output: "aab"

Edge Case 5:

t=1

n=5

a=[0,1,2,3,4]

Possible Output: "aaaaa"

Edge Case 6:

t=10^4

n=1 for each test case

a=[0] for each test case

Possible Output: "a" for each test case

This should be handled efficiently since the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

Another thing to consider is that the trace values a_i can be up to n-1, but since it's guaranteed that a valid string exists, I don't need to handle invalid cases.

I should also make sure that when I iterate through characters 'a' to 'z', I find the smallest character that matches the frequency a_i.

Implementing this in code.

I can represent the frequency dictionary as a list of 26 elements, each corresponding to a character from 'a' to 'z'.

I can map characters to their indices in the list, for example, 'a' corresponds to index 0, 'b' to 1, and so on.

Then, for each position, I iterate through the frequency list and find the smallest character (lowest index) whose frequency matches a_i.

Once found, I append that character to the result list and increment its frequency.

This should be efficient enough.

Let me sketch some pseudocode.

for each test case:

read n

read array a of n integers

freq = [0] * 26  # frequency of each character 'a' to 'z'

string = []

for each a_i in a:

for j from 0 to 25:

if freq[j] == a_i:

char = chr(j + ord('a'))

string.append(char)

freq[j] += 1

break

print(''.join(string))

This seems straightforward.

Now, considering that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and for each position, we iterate up to 26 characters, the total time complexity is O(2*10^5 * 26), which is acceptable.

Now, let's think about the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given Program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

l = int(input())

array = list(map(int, input().split()))

alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

rev_array = array[::-1]

ans = []

for j in range(l):

ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])

print(''.join(map(str, ans)))

So, the given program defines a function func() that seems to handle the test cases.

It reads t, then for each test case, reads n and the array a.

It defines alp as a list of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Then, it reverses the array to rev_array.

Then, for each position j from 0 to l-1, it counts the number of times rev_array[j] appears in the suffix rev_array[j:], and uses that count to select a character from alp.

Wait, this seems different from my approach.

Let me try to understand this logic.

It's reversing the array and then, for each position j, counting how many times the value rev_array[j] appears from position j to the end of rev_array, and then selecting a character from alp based on that count.

This seems unclear to me. I need to verify if this logic correctly reconstructs the string.

Let me test it with the first example.

First test case:

n=11

a=[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

rev_array = [4,1,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0]

For j=0:

rev_array[j:] = [4,1,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0]

Count of 4 is 1. alp[1-1]='a'

ans = ['a']

j=1:

rev_array[1:] = [1,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0]

Count of 1 is 5. alp[5-1]='f'

ans = ['a','f']

j=2:

rev_array[2:] = [1,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0]

Count of 1 is 4. alp[4-1]='d'

ans = ['a','f','d']

This is already different from "abracadabra". So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the logic.

Let me look again.

ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])

So, for each j, it's counting how many times the value rev_array[j] appears in rev_array[j:] and then using that count to select a character from alp.

In the first iteration, rev_array[j]=4, count=1, alp[1-1]='a'

Second iteration, rev_array[j]=1, count=5, alp[5-1]='f'

Third iteration, rev_array[j]=1, count=4, alp[4-1]='d'

Fourth iteration, rev_array[j]=3, count=1, alp[1-1]='a'

And so on.

This doesn't seem to match "abracadabra". So, this logic is flawed.

The correct approach, as I thought earlier, is to iterate through the positions and for each a_i, find the smallest character that has appeared exactly a_i times so far.

The given program doesn't seem to implement this correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
