Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" by deleting 'b' and 'd'.

So, for given n and k, there are k^n possible strings of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet. I need to check if each of these appears as a subsequence in s.

This sounds computationally intensive if I try to check each possible string one by one, especially since k and n can be up to 26, and s can be up to 1000 characters. But waiting, the constraints say that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases don't exceed 1e6, and t can be up to 1e5. So, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Generate all possible strings of length n with the first k letters and check if each is a subsequence of s. But with k=26 and n=26, that's 26^26 possible strings, which is way too big. Even with smaller n and k, this won't scale.

Option 2: Find a way to determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters. Maybe by analyzing the positions of each character in s and seeing if we can form all combinations.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of ways to choose positions for each possible string.

But that seems too vague and complex.

Let me consider the properties of subsequences. For a string to be a subsequence of s, its characters must appear in s in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.

So, for a specific string t of length n, to be a subsequence of s, there must exist indices i1 < i2 < ... < in such that s[ij] = t[j] for all j from 1 to n.

I need to check if all possible t are present in s.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can think about the minimal requirements for s to contain all possible t.

Wait, suppose k=1. Then, there's only one possible string of any length n: "a" repeated n times. So, s must contain "aaa...a" (n times) as a subsequence. Which means that s must contain at least n 'a's in order.

Similarly, for k=2, n=2, there are four possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". s must contain all of these as subsequences.

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba". It contains "aa" (positions 1 and 4), "ab" (positions 1 and 2), "ba" (positions 2 and 3), and "bb" (positions 2 and 4). So, all are present.

In the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb". It contains "aa"? Let's see: positions 1 and 3: 'a' and 'b', not 'a'. Positions 1 and 2: 'a' and 'b' -> "ab". Position 2 and 3: 'b' and 'b' -> "bb". So, "aa" is missing.

Hence, the answer is NO, and "aa" is one such string missing.

In the third test case, n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab". We need to check if all possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c' are present as subsequences in s.

But this seems time-consuming to check manually. So, I need an algorithm that can handle this efficiently.

Let me try to find a smart way to determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters.

One idea is to model this as a graph where each node represents the current state of the subsequence being built. This sounds like the prefix approach in tries or in automata.

But perhaps that's overkill.

Another thought: for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n from k letters, it must be rich enough in the arrangement of these letters.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each letter appears in s.

But that might not be sufficient because the order matters in subsequences.

Let me consider the minimal length of s required to contain all possible subsequences.

For example, with k=2, n=2, the minimal s that contains "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb" is "abb" or "aab", but as we saw, "abb" doesn't contain "aa", while "aabb" would.

Wait, "aabb" contains "aa" (positions 1 and 2), "ab" (positions 1 and 3), "ba" (positions 2 and 4), "bb" (positions 3 and 4).

So, "aabb" works, but "abb" doesn't because it misses "aa".

So, what's the minimal s for given n and k?

This seems related to de Bruijn sequences, but not exactly, because de Bruijn sequences are for cycles and contain all possible substrings of a certain length.

Here, we're dealing with subsequences, not substrings.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n from k letters, it must be possible to choose any sequence of n letters from the k and find them in order in s, possibly with gaps.

This seems tricky to check directly, especially for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can think about the positions of each letter in s and see if combining them in all possible ways covers all possible strings of length n.

But that still seems too broad.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where I track the number of ways to reach each possible subsequence prefix.

Let's define dp[i][j], where i is the position in s, and j is the subsequence prefix built so far.

But j can be up to k^n, which is too large for k=26 and n=26.

This approach is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the problem from the opposite perspective: find a string of length n using the first k letters that is not a subsequence of s, if it exists.

If I can efficiently find such a string, then I can output NO and that string.

Otherwise, output YES.

This seems promising.

So, I need a way to search for a string of length n that is not a subsequence of s.

How can I do that efficiently?

One idea is to use a backtracking approach, trying to build the string step by step, checking at each step if adding a particular character would still allow the remaining subsequence to be formed.

But backtracking can be slow if not optimized.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the longest common subsequence (LCS).

But I'm not sure how to apply that directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the first character of the string and see what positions in s I can choose from.

Then, for the second character, I look for positions after the first chosen position, and so on.

But again, this seems too slow for large n and k.

I need a more efficient way.

Maybe I can precompute the positions of each character in s and then, for each possible string, check if there exists a sequence of positions that match the string's characters in order.

But again, with k^n possibilities, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the following:

If s contains all possible strings of length n as subsequences, then for any string of length n, there should be a way to choose n positions in s where the characters match the string in order.

To check if this is not the case, I need to find a string where such a sequence of positions does not exist.

So, I need to find a string where at least one character in the string cannot be matched in s after considering the previous characters' positions.

This seems like a good direction.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes represent positions in s and possible characters, and then look for paths that don't exist.

But that might be too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the possible prefixes that can be formed up to each position in s.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define dp[i][j], where i is the position in s, and j is the subsequence prefix of length up to n.

But again, j can be up to k^n, which is too large.

This seems infeasible.

I need a different angle.

Let me consider that for s to contain all possible strings of length n from k letters, it must be possible to choose any sequence of n characters from the k letters and find them in order in s.

This is equivalent to saying that the set of all possible strings of length n is a subset of the set of all subsequences of s of length n.

I need to check if these sets are equal, or rather, if the set of all possible strings is a subset of the subsequences of s.

This seems too abstract.

Maybe I can think about the positions of each character in s and see if combining them in all possible ways covers all possible strings.

But again, this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the minimal number of times each character must appear in s to ensure that all possible strings are covered.

For example, for k=2, n=2, s must contain at least two 'a's and two 'b's to cover "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

But in the first test case, s="abba" has two 'a's and two 'b's, which works.

In the second test case, s="abb" has one 'a' and two 'b's, missing "aa".

But this logic seems incomplete because for n=2, k=2, having two 'a's and two 'b's is sufficient, but maybe not necessary in all cases.

Wait, in s="aabb", which has two 'a's and two 'b's, it covers all four strings.

In s="abbb", it has one 'a' and three 'b's. Does it cover "aa"? No, because there's only one 'a'. So, it misses "aa".

Hence, to cover "aa", s must have at least two 'a's.

Similarly, for "ab", it needs at least one 'a' followed by at least one 'b' after it.

Wait, but for "ab", as long as there's at least one 'a' followed by at least one 'b' after it, it's covered.

Similarly, for "ba", there needs to be at least one 'b' followed by at least one 'a' after it.

And for "bb", at least two 'b's with the second one after the first one.

So, for n=2, k=2, s must have:

- At least two 'a's for "aa"

- At least one 'a' and one 'b' for "ab"

- At least one 'b' and one 'a' for "ba"

- At least two 'b's for "bb"

Hence, s must have at least two 'a's and two 'b's to cover all possibilities.

Wait, but in s="aabb", which has two 'a's and two 'b's, it covers all.

In s="abbb", it has one 'a' and three 'b's, which misses "aa".

In s="aabb", it has two 'a's and two 'b's, which covers all.

So, it seems that for n=2, k=2, s must have at least two 'a's and two 'b's.

Generalizing, for n and k, s must have at least n occurrences of each of the first k letters.

Wait, but that might not be sufficient.

Wait, in n=2, k=2, having two 'a's and two 'b's is sufficient.

But let's consider n=3, k=2.

Then, possible strings are "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".

To cover "aaa", s must have at least three 'a's.

To cover "aab", s must have at least two 'a's followed by at least one 'b' after them.

Similarly, for "aba", at least one 'a', then one 'b', then one 'a' after the 'b'.

And so on.

This is getting complicated.

It seems that just having n occurrences of each letter is not sufficient, as the positions matter.

I need a better way.

Let me consider building a directed graph where nodes represent the state of the subsequence being built.

For example, for n=2, k=2, the states would be:

- Start

- Have chosen first character

- Have chosen both characters

But this seems similar to the DP approach I thought earlier, which is not scalable for large n and k.

I need a different strategy.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of possible strings is k^n, and if s is short, it might not contain all of them.

But the problem constraints allow s up to 1000 characters, and t up to 1e5, so I need an efficient per-test-case solution.

Wait, maybe I can precompute in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to binary search for the missing string.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible strings of length n, then for any string, there should be a way to find it as a subsequence.

To find a string that is not a subsequence, I can try to construct one by choosing characters that are not present in s at the required positions.

But this is vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the first character of the string and see what positions in s I can choose for it.

Then, for the second character, I look for positions after the first chosen position, and so on.

But again, this seems too slow for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if s has enough repetitions of each character, in the required order.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

from collections import *

from math import *

from heapq import *

import sys

from bisect import *

from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

for i in s:

if i in us:

win.add(i)

if len(win) == k:

ans.append(i)

ps += 1

win.clear()

if ps >= n:

return print('YES')

print('NO')

for i in us:

if i not in win:

return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))

Okay, so the code reads t test cases, and for each test case, it calls func_1().

In func_1():

- Read n, k, m

- Read string s

- Create a set us containing the first k lowercase letters

- Initialize an empty set win to track unique characters encountered in s

- Initialize an empty list ans to build a potential missing string

- Initialize ps to count the number of k-character sequences found in s

- Iterate through each character in s:

- If the character is in us, add it to win

- If win has all k characters:

- Append the character to ans

- Increment ps

- Clear win to start tracking the next sequence

- If ps >= n, print 'YES'

- Else, print 'NO'

- Find a character in us that is not in win

- Print the constructed string: ans + that character + 'a'*(n - len(ans) - 1)

So, the logic seems to be:

- Try to find sequences of k unique characters in s, and count how many such sequences can be packed into s.

- If the number of such sequences is at least n, then all possible strings are covered, so print 'YES'

- Else, print 'NO' and construct a string that is missing by appending a character not present in the last win set and padding with 'a's.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

In the second test case of the example:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

us = {'a', 'b'}

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

Iterate through s:

- s[0] = 'a' -> win = {'a'}

- s[1] = 'b' -> win = {'a', 'b'} -> len(win) == k=2 -> append 'b' to ans -> ans=['b'] -> ps=1 -> clear win

- s[2] = 'b' -> win={'b'} -> len(win) < k

Total ps=1, which is less than n=2, so print 'NO'

Then, find a character in us not in win={'b'}, which is 'a'

Print ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a'*(n - len(ans) -1) = 'b' + 'a' + 'a'*(2-1-1) = 'ba' + '' = 'ba'

But according to the example, the expected output is 'aa'

So, this seems incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect for this test case.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
