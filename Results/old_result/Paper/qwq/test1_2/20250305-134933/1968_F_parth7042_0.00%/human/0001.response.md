Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR is. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they're the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. So, for a given range [l, r], I need to check if the subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way to handle XOR problems is to use prefix sums, but for XOR, it's prefix XOR. So, I can precompute the prefix XOR array, where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.

Once I have the prefix XOR array, the XOR of any subarray [l, r] can be found by prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]. This is a standard technique in XOR range queries.

Now, for the subarray [l, r] to be interesting, I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value. Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If X is zero, that means the subarray is already all zeros or cancels out to zero. In this case, I can split it into any number of parts, and each part will have XOR zero. So, in this case, the answer is "YES."

If X is not zero, I need to find at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR up to that point is equal to X, and the remaining part also has XOR X. Essentially, I need to find an index m in [l, r] such that the XOR from l to m is X, and the XOR from m+1 to r is also X.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, I can use the prefix XOR array to find such m. Specifically, I need to find m such that prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = X and prefix[r] XOR prefix[m] = X.

Wait a minute, if prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = X, and we know that X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1], then prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]. Simplifying, prefix[m] = prefix[r].

So, if there exists an m in [l, r] where prefix[m] = prefix[r], then the subarray [l, m] has XOR X, and [m+1, r] has XOR X. That would satisfy the condition for k=2.

But the problem allows for k > 1, meaning more than one part. So, I need to ensure that there is at least one such m that allows splitting into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, but if I can find one such m, that's enough to say the subarray is interesting, because I can split it into two parts with equal XOR. If there are more possible splits, that's fine, but I only need at least one.

So, in code, for each query [l, r], I can check:

- If X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] is zero, then "YES".

- Else, check if there exists an m in [l, r] where prefix[m] = prefix[r].

If such an m exists, then "YES"; else, "NO".

Now, to optimize this, because n and q can be up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to handle queries.

I can precompute the prefix XOR array in O(n), and then for each query, compute X in O(1), and then check if prefix[r] exists in the prefix array between l and r.

But searching for prefix[r] in the prefix array between l and r for each query would be O(q * n), which is too slow for n and q up to 2e5.

So, I need a faster way to check if there's an m in [l, r] where prefix[m] = prefix[r].

One way is to use a map to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. Then, for each query, I can check if prefix[r] appears in the prefix array between l and r.

To do this efficiently, I can store, for each prefix XOR value, a list of indices where it appears. Then, for each query, I can check if there's an index m in the list for prefix[r] such that l <= m <= r.

To find if there's such an m, I can use binary search on the list of indices for prefix[r].

This way, preprocessing the prefix array and the map is O(n), and for each query, computing X is O(1), and checking if there's an m in [l, r] is O(log n) using binary search.

Given that n and q are up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Compute the prefix XOR array.

2. Create a map where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where that XOR value occurs.

3. For each query [l, r]:

a. Compute X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

b. If X == 0, then "YES".

c. Else, check if there's an m in [l, r] where prefix[m] = prefix[r].

- Use the map to get the list of indices for prefix[r].

- Use binary search to find if any m in that list satisfies l <= m <= r.

d. If such an m exists, "YES"; else, "NO".

I need to be careful with the indexing. Since the prefix array is 1-based (to handle l=1), I need to adjust indices accordingly.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases, up to t=1e4, but with the constraints that the total n and q across all test cases don't exceed 2e5.

So, I need to read all input at once and parse it accordingly.

Looking at the given code, it seems to follow this approach. Let's analyze it step by step.

First, it reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`. Then, it defines a function `func_1` which seems to handle the entire logic.

Inside `func_1`, it initializes `idx = 0` to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.

It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.

For each test case, it reads `n` (number of elements in the array) and `q` (number of queries).

It initializes an array `a` of size `n+1` with zeros and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n+1` with zeros.

It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to map prefix XOR values to lists of indices where they occur.

Then, it reads the array elements from `data[idx:idx+n]`, updates the prefix XOR array, and populates the dictionary.

After processing the array, it handles each query.

For each query, it reads `l` and `r`, computes X = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1].

If X == 0, it appends "YES" to the results.

Else, it looks up mp.get(pf[r], []) to get the list of indices where pf[r] occurs.

It also gets the list for pf[l-1].

Then, it uses `bisect.bisect_left` to find positions in these lists.

Finally, it checks certain conditions and appends "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

Wait, this seems a bit different from what I outlined.

In my approach, for X != 0, I only need to check if pf[r] appears in the prefix array between l and r.

But in the code, it's getting the lists for pf[r] and pf[l-1], then using bisect to find positions.

I need to understand what exactly it's doing.

Let's look at the code snippet:

```

x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]

if x == 0:

    results.append('YES')

    continue

v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])

v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])

it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)

it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):

    results.append('YES')

else:

    results.append('NO')

```

So, for X != 0, it's getting the lists v1 and v2 for pf[r] and pf[l-1], respectively.

Then, it's using bisect.bisect_left to find the position where l would be inserted in v1, and similarly for v2.

Then, it checks if v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l.

I need to understand why it's checking both v1 and v2.

Wait, maybe it's checking for the existence of m in [l, r] where pf[m] = pf[r], and also ensuring that there's a prefix up to l-1 that allows the split.

But I think my initial approach is simpler: for X != 0, just check if pf[r] appears in the prefix array between l and r.

In other words, check if there's an m in [l, r] where pf[m] = pf[r].

To do this efficiently, since v1 is sorted (as we're storing indices in order), I can use bisect to find if there's an m in v1 such that l <= m <= r.

Specifically, find the first position where m >= l, and check if v1[it1] <= r.

If so, then "YES"; else, "NO".

I think the code is trying to do something similar, but it's also considering v2, which is confusing me.

Maybe the author thought it was necessary to check both, but I think checking v1 is sufficient.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n=5, q=5

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Queries:

1 5

2 4

3 5

1 3

3 4

Let's compute the prefix XOR array:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 0 ^ 1 = 1

pf[2] = 1 ^ 1 = 0

pf[3] = 0 ^ 2 = 2

pf[4] = 2 ^ 3 = 1

pf[5] = 1 ^ 0 = 1

So, mp:

0: [0,2]

1: [1,4,5]

2: [3]

Now, for query 1 5:

l=1, r=5

X = pf[5] ^ pf[1-1] = 1 ^ 0 = 1

X != 0

Check if pf[5] = 1 appears in pf[m] for m in [1,5]

Looking at mp[1]: [1,4,5]

Check if there's an m in [1,5] where pf[m] = 1

Yes, m=1,4,5 are all in [1,5]

So, "YES"

Query 2 4:

l=2, r=4

X = pf[4] ^ pf[2-1] = 1 ^ 1 = 0

X == 0, so "YES"

Query 3 5:

l=3, r=5

X = pf[5] ^ pf[3-1] = 1 ^ 0 = 1

Check if pf[5] = 1 appears in pf[m] for m in [3,5]

mp[1]: [1,4,5]

Check if there's an m in [3,5] where pf[m] =1

m=4 and m=5 are in [3,5], so "YES"

Wait, but according to the explanation, it should be "NO"

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the note, it says for queries 3 and 4, the subarrays are not interesting.

Wait, let's check the subarrays:

Query 3: a[3:5] = [2,3,0]

Possible splits:

[2],[3,0] -> 2 vs 3 XOR 0 = 3, not equal

[2,3],[0] -> 2 XOR 3 = 1, vs 0, not equal

[2],[3],[0] -> 2,3,0 not all equal

So, not interesting.

But according to my earlier logic, it would say "YES" because pf[5]=1 appears at m=4 and m=5 in [3,5].

But apparently, that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe my approach is flawed.

Let me think again.

In the subarray [3,5]: [2,3,0]

pf[3]=2, pf[4]=1, pf[5]=1

So, X = pf[5] ^ pf[2] = 1 ^ 0 = 1

I need to find m in [3,5] where pf[m] = pf[5] =1

m=4 and m=5 are in [3,5]

But, according to the problem, it's not possible to split [2,3,0] into parts with equal XOR.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, it would say "YES" because m=4 and m=5 exist in [3,5] with pf[m]=1.

But in reality, splitting at m=4 would be [2,3] with XOR 1, and [4:5] which is [0] with XOR 0, which are not equal.

Similarly, splitting at m=5 would be [2,3,0] and [] which is invalid.

So, my approach is incorrect.

I need a better way to check the split.

I think I missed a crucial point.

Let me rethink.

If I split the subarray [l,r] into two parts at m, then the first part is [l,m] with XOR X, and the second part [m+1,r] should also have XOR X.

Given that, the total XOR from l to r should be X XOR X = 0.

But in the query, X is not zero, so this seems contradictory.

Wait, no.

Wait, X is the XOR from l to r.

If I split at m, then XOR[l to m] = X, and XOR[m+1 to r] = X, so XOR[l to r] = X XOR X = 0.

But in the query, X is not zero, which means it's impossible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, if X is not zero, and I split into two parts each with XOR X, then the total XOR would be X XOR X = 0.

But if X is not zero, that implies that the total XOR is zero, which contradicts X not being zero.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose the total XOR from l to r is X.

If I split at m, then XOR[l to m] = X, and XOR[m+1 to r] = X.

Then, XOR[l to r] = XOR[l to m] XOR XOR[m+1 to r] = X XOR X = 0.

So, unless X is zero, I cannot split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR.

Therefore, my earlier approach is flawed.

So, the correct approach is:

- If X = 0, then it's possible to split the subarray into at least two parts with equal XOR.

- Else, it's not possible.

Wait, but in the first test case, for query 1 5, X = 1 XOR 0 = 1, which is not zero, but the answer is "YES".

But according to this, it should be "NO".

So, there's something wrong with this logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider splits into more than two parts.

Wait, the problem allows for k > 1 parts.

So, it's possible to split into more than two parts.

Wait, in the first test case, for query 1 5, with X=1, it's possible to split into three parts: [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

So, my earlier logic is incomplete.

I need to find a way to split the subarray into at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, for X != 0, it's still possible if there are multiple splits where each part has XOR X.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have a subarray [l,r] with XOR X, and I can find an m in [l,r] such that XOR[l,m] = X and XOR[m+1,r] = X, then the total XOR would be X XOR X = 0, which contradicts X != 0.

Therefore, for X != 0, it's impossible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

But, as in the first test case, it's possible to split into more than two parts with equal XOR.

So, I need a way to check if the subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR, even if X != 0.

This seems more complicated.

I need to find if there are multiple splits where each part has XOR X.

One way to think about it is to consider the positions where the prefix XOR equals some value.

Wait, perhaps I can count the frequency of each prefix XOR value within the subarray.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the prefix XOR array for the entire array.

For a subarray [l,r], its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If I can split [l,r] into k parts with equal XOR X, then the total XOR should be k * X, but since XOR is not additive in the same way as sum, this doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for repeated patterns in the prefix XOR.

Let me consider that the XOR of each part is X.

So, if I have splits at positions m1, m2, ..., mk, then:

- XOR[l, m1] = X => pf[m1] XOR pf[l-1] = X => pf[m1] = pf[l-1] XOR X

- XOR[m1+1, m2] = X => pf[m2] XOR pf[m1] = X => pf[m2] = pf[m1] XOR X = (pf[l-1] XOR X) XOR X = pf[l-1]

- XOR[m2+1, m3] = X => pf[m3] XOR pf[m2] = X => pf[m3] = pf[m2] XOR X = pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[m1]

- And so on.

So, the prefix XOR values at the split points alternate between pf[l-1] and pf[l-1] XOR X.

In other words, for the subarray [l,r], I need to find positions where the prefix XOR is either pf[l-1] or pf[l-1] XOR X, alternating.

This seems complicated to implement efficiently.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR X, the total XOR of the subarray must be k * X, but since XOR is not additive, this doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times X appears in the prefix XOR within the subarray.

I need to find if there are at least two positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR X.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the standard approach for this kind of problem.

I recall that for subarrays with XOR equal to a specific value, we can use the prefix XOR technique.

But here, we need subarrays that can be split into multiple parts, each with the same XOR.

This seems more involved.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding if there are multiple occurrences of certain XOR values within the subarray.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the XOR of a subarray is X, and see if there are points within the subarray where the cumulative XOR matches what's needed for equal parts.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look at the provided code again and see what it's doing.

In the code, for X != 0, it's getting the lists for pf[r] and pf[l-1], then using bisect to find positions.

Specifically:

v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])

v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])

it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)

it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

I need to understand what this is checking.

v1 is the list of indices where pf[m] = pf[r]

v2 is the list of indices where pf[m] = pf[l-1]

it1 is the position where l would be inserted in v1 to keep it sorted.

If v1[it1] <= r, then there's an m in [l, r] where pf[m] = pf[r]

Similarly, it2 is the position just before r in v2.

If v2[it2] >= l, then there's an m in [l, r] where pf[m] = pf[l-1]

But why is it checking both v1 and v2?

Maybe the author is ensuring that there are points where pf[m] = pf[r] and pf[m] = pf[l-1] within the range [l, r], which would allow for splits where the XOR of parts is equal.

But in the earlier example, for query 3 5, X=1, pf[r]=1, which appears at m=4 and m=5 in [3,5].

But according to the problem, it's not possible to split [2,3,0] into parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps this code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

If I split the subarray [l,r] into k parts with equal XOR X, then the prefix XOR at the split points should be pf[l-1] XOR X, pf[l-1] XOR X XOR X = pf[l-1], and so on, alternating.

So, for k=2, I need pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X, which is pf[l-1] XOR (pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]) = pf[r]

Hence, for k=2, m should satisfy pf[m] = pf[r]

Similarly, for k=3, there should be m1 and m2 where pf[m1] = pf[r], pf[m2] = pf[l-1], etc.

So, perhaps checking for both pf[r] and pf[l-1] in the subarray indicates the possibility of splitting into more than two parts.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Given that, perhaps the code is attempting to check for the existence of such m1 and m2 within the subarray.

However, in the first test case, for query 3 5, it should return "NO", but according to the code, it would return "YES" because pf[r]=1 appears at m=4 and m=5 in [3,5], and pf[l-1]=0 appears at m=2, which is outside [3,5], but it seems to check v2[it2] >= l, which would be false.

Wait, mp[pf[l-1]] is mp[0], which is [0,2]

bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) = bisect.bisect_left([0,2],5) = 2

it2 = 2 - 1 = 1

v2[1] =2, which is less than l=3, so v2[it2] >= l is false.

Hence, it would append "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would append "YES", but actually, it checks both conditions:

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):

For query 3 5:

it1 = bisect.bisect_left([1,4,5],3) = 1 (v1[1]=4 <=5, so "YES")

it2 = bisect.bisect_left([0,2],5) -1 =1, v2[1]=2 <3, so "NO"

Hence, overall "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but according to the earlier mistake, I thought it would be "YES", but actually, it's "NO", which is correct.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Let me check another query.

Query 1 5:

l=1, r=5

X = pf[5] ^ pf[0] =1 ^0=1

v1 = mp[pf[5]]=mp[1]=[1,4,5]

it1 = bisect.bisect_left([1,4,5],1)=0, v1[0]=1 <=5

v2 = mp[pf[0]]=mp[0]=[0], bisect.bisect_left([0],5)=1-1=0, v2[0]=0 <1, so "NO"

But according to the problem, it should be "YES"

Wait, but in the code, if X ==0, it's "YES", else, it's "YES" only if both conditions are satisfied.

Wait, no, in the code, for X !=0, it's "YES" if either condition is satisfied.

Wait, let's look back at the code:

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

So, it's "YES" only if both conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but in the first query, l=1, r=5, X=1

v1=[1,4,5], it1=0, v1[0]=1 <=5

v2=[0], it2=0-1=-1, which is invalid, so "NO"

But according to the problem, it should be "YES"

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the author intended to check if there are points where pf[m] = pf[r] and pf[m] = pf[l-1] within the subarray, indicating possible splits.

But in the first query, pf[r]=1 appears at m=1,4,5, which are within [1,5], and pf[l-1]=0 appears at m=0, which is outside [1,5], so it should be "NO", but according to the problem, it's "YES"

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the condition is incorrect.

I think there's a mistake in the code's logic.

In the first test case, for query 1 5, the subarray is [1,1,2,3,0], which can be split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

But according to the code's logic, it seems to return "NO", which contradicts the expected "YES".

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
