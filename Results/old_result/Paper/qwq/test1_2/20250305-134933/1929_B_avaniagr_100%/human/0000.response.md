Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two main types of diagonals: those that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and those that run from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a grid of size n x n, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2. This includes all possible diagonals of different lengths.

Wait, actually, let's double-check that. For an n x n grid, the number of diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number going from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals should be 4n - 2. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the problem is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to think about how to minimize the number of colored cells while covering at least k diagonals.

One approach is to consider the coverage of each cell on the diagonals. Each cell lies on exactly one diagonal of each type, so coloring a single cell can cover two diagonals: one from each type.

Wait, no. Actually, each cell lies on exactly one diagonal going from top-left to bottom-right and one going from top-right to bottom-left. So, coloring a cell affects two diagonals.

But, depending on the position of the cell, it might lie on a diagonal that already has another colored cell, so I need to be careful not to double-count.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should think in terms of selecting cells to cover the maximum number of diagonals possible.

If I color a cell that is on two unique diagonals, then that cell covers two diagonals. So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two diagonals.

But, there might be cases where a cell is on only one diagonal, but I think that only happens on the edges.

Wait, no. Every cell is on exactly two diagonals: one of each type.

Wait, actually, cells on the borders might only be on one diagonal of one type. For example, the top-left cell is only on one diagonal going down to the right.

Hmm.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals out of the 4n - 2 total diagonals.

I need to select cells such that these cells cover at least k diagonals.

I need to minimize the number of cells selected.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but for such a large n (up to 1e8), there's no way that's the intended solution. There must be a smarter way to approach this.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many diagonals are covered by selecting certain cells.

Let me consider the main diagonals: the two main diagonals are the longest ones, from one corner to the other.

But I'm not sure if focusing on them is helpful.

Let me try to think about the minimal number of cells needed to cover a certain number of diagonals.

If I color one cell, it covers two diagonals (unless it's on the edge and only covers one).

But since n is at least 2, and k is at least 1, I need to consider general cases.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of diagonals that are not covered and find a way to cover them efficiently.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take n=2, which is a 2x2 grid.

Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

But actually, for n=2, there are 2*2 - 1 = 3 diagonals of one type and 3 of the other, so total 6.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, there are actually only two main diagonals: one from (1,1) to (2,2) and one from (1,2) to (2,1). But actually, in a grid, there are more diagonals of length less than n.

Wait, no. In a 2x2 grid, the diagonals are:

- (1,1) to (2,2)

- (1,2) to (2,1)

- (1,1) alone as a diagonal of length 1

- (1,2) alone as a diagonal of length 1

- (2,1) alone as a diagonal of length 1

- (2,2) alone as a diagonal of length 1

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, in an n x n grid, the number of diagonals is indeed 4n - 2.

But perhaps the problem considers only the diagonals that have at least two cells.

Wait, the note says that all 4n - 2 diagonals are considered, so that includes diagonals with fewer than two cells.

So, for n=2, there are 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

In this case, the diagonals are:

- Two main diagonals with two cells each

- Four diagonals with one cell each (each cell itself is a diagonal)

So, for n=2, there are two diagonals with two cells and four diagonals with one cell.

Now, if k=3, for example, I need to cover at least 3 diagonals with at least one colored cell.

One way to do this is to color one cell, which covers two diagonals, and then color another cell to cover an additional diagonal.

Wait, but in this case, if I color one cell, it covers its row and column diagonals.

Wait, no, it covers its two diagonals: one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify what is meant by "diagonals."

In the problem statement, it says "the square grid of size n x n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals."

So, presumably, these are all the possible diagonals, including those with length from 1 to n.

Now, the problem is to select the minimal number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to cover at least k diagonals by coloring the fewest cells possible.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can be applied efficiently, especially since n can be up to 1e8, and t can be up to 1000, so the solution needs to be computationally efficient.

Looking at the sample input and output:

For n=3, k=4, output is 2.

For n=3, k=3, output is 2.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6.

For n=3, k=9, output is 5.

For n=4, k=7, output is 4.

For n=7, k=11, output is 6.

For n=2, k=3, output is 2.

From these samples, it seems that for smaller k, fewer cells are needed, but the relationship isn't immediately obvious.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have to cover all diagonals, i.e., k=4n-2.

In that case, I need to color all cells in the grid, which is n*n cells.

But that doesn't seem right, because even if I color all cells, some diagonals are still only covered once.

Wait, no, the problem is to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell.

So, if I color all cells, all diagonals are covered.

But that's the upper limit.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color to cover at least k diagonals.

I need to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two new diagonals.

So, the minimal number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But, wait, that can't be the whole story, because in the sample input, when n=3 and k=10, the output is 6, which is indeed ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6. Wait, no, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6. So, perhaps there are overlapping issues.

Wait, perhaps for certain values of k, this formula doesn't hold.

Looking back at the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6, which is indeed ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6. Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe there are constraints based on the number of available diagonals.

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals are 4*3 - 2 = 10.

So, k=10 means covering all diagonals.

In this case, coloring 5 cells would cover 10 diagonals, but perhaps it's not possible to cover all diagonals with just 5 cells.

But according to ceil(k / 2) = ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain values of k, I need to consider that some diagonals share cells, so covering multiple diagonals with one cell isn't always possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a threshold where, beyond a certain k, more cells are needed.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

if k <= 4 * n - 4:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

elif k == 4 * n - 3:

print(2 * n - 1)

elif k == 4 * n - 2:

print(2 * n)

So, the code checks if k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, and in that case, it prints ceil(k / 2).

If k is 4n - 3, it prints 2n - 1.

If k is 4n - 2, it prints 2n.

Let me verify this with the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Sample Output:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

Let's take n=3, k=4.

4 <= 4*3 - 4 = 8, so ceil(4 / 2) = 2, which matches the sample output.

n=3, k=3: ceil(3 / 2) = 2, matches the sample.

n=3, k=10: 10 == 4*3 - 2, so print 2*3 = 6, matches the sample.

n=3, k=9: 9 == 4*3 - 3, so print 2*3 - 1 = 5, matches the sample.

n=4, k=7: 7 <= 4*4 - 4 = 12, so ceil(7 / 2) = 4, matches the sample.

n=7, k=11: 11 <= 4*7 - 4 = 24, so ceil(11 / 2) = 6, matches the sample.

n=2, k=3: 3 <= 4*2 - 4 = 4, so ceil(3 / 2) = 2, matches the sample.

So, the code seems to produce the correct output for the sample inputs.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me think about it.

First, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals, except for the cells on the main diagonals, but actually, every cell covers exactly one diagonal of the main set and one of the anti-set, so each cell covers exactly two diagonals.

However, there might be overlaps, meaning that some diagonals share cells, so coloring one cell might cover multiple diagonals, but only up to two per cell.

So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, you would need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But, perhaps in some cases, you can't achieve this, and you need more cells.

Looking back at n=3, k=10: according to ceil(k / 2) = 5, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, but according to the code, when k == 4n - 2, which is 10 for n=3, it prints 2n = 6.

So, it's overriding the ceil(k / 2) in this case.

Similarly, when k == 4n - 3, which is 9 for n=3, it prints 2n - 1 = 5.

So, it seems that for k up to 4n - 4, it's using ceil(k / 2), and for k = 4n - 3 and 4n - 2, it's using 2n - 1 and 2n respectively.

Is this the minimal number of cells needed?

Let me think about n=3, k=10.

Total diagonals are 10.

According to the code, it's 6 cells.

But ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

Why is it 6?

Perhaps because it's not possible to cover all 10 diagonals with just 5 cells.

Maybe there's a dependency or overlap that requires more cells.

Similarly, for k=9, it's 5 cells.

But ceil(9 / 2) = 5, which matches.

So, perhaps for k up to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient, but for k = 4n - 3 and 4n - 2, it requires more cells.

Wait, but in n=3, k=9 requires 5 cells, which is ceil(9 / 2) = 5, and k=10 requires 6 cells, which is 2n.

So, perhaps there's a pattern there.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the minimal number that can cover at least k diagonals, considering the overlaps.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should consider the problem as a graph where diagonals are vertices, and cells are edges connecting the diagonals they belong to.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of edges (cells) to cover at least k vertices (diagonals).

This is a type of set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach it given the structure of the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to select cells such that they cover as many unique diagonals as possible.

Given that each cell covers two diagonals, the maximal number of unique diagonals covered by one cell is two.

So, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But in the sample, for k=10, it's 6 instead of ceil(10 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps there are dependencies where some diagonals can't be covered simultaneously in an optimal way.

Alternatively, perhaps for larger k, you need to cover almost all diagonals, which requires coloring more cells.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the fact that to cover all diagonals, you need to color all cells in either the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of cells needed to cover all rows and columns, but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps thinking in terms of graph theory helps.

Consider that each diagonal is a vertex, and each cell is an edge connecting two vertices (the two diagonals it belongs to).

Then, covering at least k vertices with the minimal number of edges.

This is similar to the set cover problem, which is indeed difficult.

But perhaps in this specific case, there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.

Looking back at the code, it seems that for k up to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient.

For k = 4n - 3, it's 2n - 1, and for k = 4n - 2, it's 2n.

I need to verify if this makes sense.

For n=3:

4n - 4 = 8

So, for k <= 8, ceil(k / 2)

For k=9, it's 2n - 1 = 5

For k=10, it's 2n = 6

Similarly, for n=4:

4n - 4 = 12

So, for k <= 12, ceil(k / 2)

For k=13, it's 2n - 1 = 7

For k=14, it's 2n = 8

But in the sample input, for n=4, k=7, output is 4, which is ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

And for n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is 2n.

So, the code seems consistent with the samples.

But is this the minimal number in general?

Let me consider n=2.

For n=2, 4n - 2 = 6 diagonals.

According to the code:

For k <= 4*2 - 4 = 4, use ceil(k / 2)

For k=5, use 2*2 - 1 = 3

For k=6, use 2*2 = 4

In the sample input, for n=2, k=3, output is 2, which is ceil(3 / 2)=2.

Another sample input is n=2, k=3, output is 2.

But what if n=2, k=5?

According to the code, it should be 3.

Is that correct?

For n=2, total diagonals are 6.

To cover at least 5 diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is 3.

Is that accurate?

Let's see.

In a 2x2 grid, there are two main diagonals with two cells each and four diagonals with one cell each.

Wait, no.

Actually, in a 2x2 grid:

- Diagonals from top-left to bottom-right: one diagonal with two cells.

- Diagonals from top-right to bottom-left: one diagonal with two cells.

- Additionally, each cell is its own diagonal, making total diagonals: 2 (main diagonals) + 4 (single-cell diagonals) = 6.

So, to cover at least 5 diagonals, you need to color enough cells to cover those diagonals.

If you color one cell, it covers two diagonals (its main diagonal and its anti-diagonal).

If you color a second cell, it can cover two more diagonals, but there might be overlap if the second cell is on the same diagonals as the first cell.

So, to cover 5 diagonals, you might need to color three cells.

Yes, that seems right.

So, the code's approach seems consistent.

Another consideration: for k up to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient.

For k = 4n - 3, it's 2n - 1.

For k = 4n - 2, it's 2n.

I need to understand why this distinction is made.

Perhaps, for k up to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) cells are enough.

But for k = 4n - 3 and 4n - 2, more cells are needed because covering all diagonals requires more cells due to overlapping constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

Wait, for k = 4n - 2, which is all diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is 2n - 1, but according to the code, it's 2n.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is 2n.

But in the sample, for n=3, k=10, output is 6.

Wait, but in the note, for n=3 and k=10, it's possible to color 6 cells to cover all 10 diagonals.

But according to ceil(k / 2) = 5, but it's 6.

So, perhaps ceil(k / 2) isn't always sufficient, and for k = 4n - 2, 2n cells are needed.

Similarly, for k = 4n - 3, 2n - 1 cells are needed.

Perhaps there's a general formula based on the value of k relative to 4n - 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is min(ceil(k / 2), 2n).

But in the sample, for k=10, it's 6, which is 2n.

For k=9, it's 5, which is ceil(9 / 2).

So, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 4n - 4, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, 2n - (4n - 2 - k)

Wait, for k=10, which is 4n - 2, it's 2n.

For k=9, which is 4n - 3, it's 2n - 1.

So, it seems that for k >= 4n - 3, the minimal number of cells needed is 2n - (4n - 2 - k).

Let's see:

For k=10, 2n = 6, which matches.

For k=9, 2n - 1 = 5, which matches.

For k=11 in n=7, which is 4*7 - 2 = 26, but k=11 is less than 26 - 4 = 22, so ceil(11 / 2) = 6, which matches the sample.

Wait, n=7, k=11:

4*7 - 4 = 24

k=11 <=24, so ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

- If k <= 4n - 4, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, if k = 4n - 3, then 2n -1

- Else, if k = 4n - 2, then 2n

But, in terms of code, it's implemented as:

if k <= 4 * n - 4:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

elif k == 4 * n - 3:

print(2 * n - 1)

elif k == 4 * n - 2:

print(2 * n)

Which matches the sample inputs.

Therefore, this seems to be a correct implementation based on the sample inputs and outputs.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**
