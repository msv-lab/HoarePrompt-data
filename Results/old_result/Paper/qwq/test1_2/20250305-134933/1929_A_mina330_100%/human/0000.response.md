Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input:

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

In the second test case, n=3 and the array is [69, 69, 69]. No matter how I arrange them, the differences will always be zero, so the beauty is 0.

In the third test case, n=5 and the array is [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. After sorting, it becomes [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

Wait a minute, in all these examples, it seems like sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of differences gives the beauty. But is that the maximum beauty? Let's see.

In the first test case, [1, 2, 3] gives a beauty of 2. Is there a way to arrange them to get a higher beauty? Let's try [1, 3, 2]. Then, beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 -1 = 1, which is less than 2. Another arrangement: [2, 1, 3], beauty is (1-2) + (3-1) = -1 + 2 = 1, which is again less than 2. So, arranging in ascending order seems to give the highest beauty.

In the second test case, all elements are the same, so any arrangement gives beauty 0, which is expected.

In the third test case, sorting gives the maximum beauty of 57. Is there any other arrangement that could give a higher beauty? Let's try arranging it differently, say [43, 100, 54, 80, 90]. Then, beauty is (100-43) + (54-100) + (80-54) + (90-80) = 57 -46 +26 +10. That's 57 -46 is 11, plus 26 is 37, plus 10 is 47, which is less than 57. So, sorting seems better.

Wait, maybe arranging in descending order? Let's try [100, 90, 80, 54, 43]. Then, beauty is (90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = -57, which is worse.

So, arranging in ascending order seems to give the maximum beauty. But why?

Let's think about the sum: (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}). If we expand this, a lot of terms cancel out. It becomes an - a1. Because all the intermediate terms cancel out.

So, sum = an - a1.

Wait, is that always true? Let's check with the first example: [1, 2, 3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches.

Second example: [69, 69, 69], beauty is 69 - 69 = 0, which matches.

Third example: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], beauty is 100 - 43 = 57, which matches.

Fourth example: [3, 4, 3, 3], sorted [3, 3, 3, 4], beauty is 4 - 3 = 1.

Fifth example: [1, 2], sorted [1, 2], beauty is 2 - 1 = 1.

So, in all cases, the beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, regardless of how the rest are arranged, because the sum telescopes to that.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, we just need to maximize (an - a1), where an is the largest element and a1 is the smallest.

But in any arrangement, an is the maximum and a1 is the minimum, so the beauty is always max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the program given, it sorts the array and then prints a[n-1] - a[0], which is exactly max(a) - min(a).

So, the program is correctly implementing this logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
