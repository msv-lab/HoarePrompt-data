Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example to see what's going on. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 2]. The beauty would be (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, it's not immediately obvious what this sum corresponds to.

Wait a minute, let's consider the general case. If I have an array a1, a2, a3, ..., an, the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

If I look closely, this is a telescoping sum, where most terms cancel out. Let's write it out:

= a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + a4 - a3 + ... + an - a_{n-1}

= -a1 + (a2 - a2) + (a3 - a3) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) + an

= -a1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 + an

= an - a1

So, the beauty of the array is simply the last element minus the first element, after rearrangement.

That's interesting! So, no matter how I arrange the array, the beauty is just the difference between the last and the first element in the arranged order.

Given that, to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize (last element - first element). To maximize this difference, I should put the largest element last and the smallest element first.

Wait, but let's verify this. Suppose I have an array [1, 2, 3]. If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2. If I arrange it as [3, 1, 2], beauty is 2 - 3 = -1. If I arrange it as [2, 3, 1], beauty is 1 - 2 = -1. So, indeed, arranging the smallest first and the largest last gives the maximum beauty, which is 2 in this case.

Another example from the input: [2, 1, 3]. Arranging as [1, 2, 3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, all elements are 69, so no matter how you arrange them, the beauty is 69 - 69 = 0.

In the fourth test case, [3, 4, 3, 3], arranging as [3, 3, 3, 4], beauty is 4 - 3 = 1.

And in the last test case, [2, 1], arranging as [1, 2], beauty is 2 - 1 = 1.

So, it seems that the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then the beauty is the last element minus the first element.

Wait, but why not sort in descending order? If I sort in descending order, the difference would be a negative number, which is smaller, so it's not maximizing the beauty.

Hence, the maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and taking the difference between the last and the first elements.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

ntest = int(input())

for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a, sorts a in ascending order, and prints the difference between the last and the first elements.

This aligns perfectly with the strategy I just derived. So, it seems correct.

But let's double-check with some edge cases.

Edge case 1: All elements are the same.

For example, n=2, a=[5,5]. Beauty should be 5 - 5 = 0.

Edge case 2: n=2, a=[1,2]. Beauty should be 2 - 1 = 1.

Edge case 3: n=3, a=[1,1,1]. Beauty should be 1 - 1 = 0.

Edge case 4: n=100, all elements are 10^9. Beauty should be 0.

Edge case 5: n=100, elements are from 1 to 100. Beauty should be 100 - 1 = 99.

Seems consistent.

Another thing to consider is that the problem allows n up to 100, and t up to 500, which is manageable in terms of time complexity, since sorting 100 elements is fast.

Also, the elements can be up to 10^9, but since we're just sorting and subtracting, there shouldn't be any issues with integer overflow in Python.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
