Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero after applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. For any chosen i, the operation reduces a[i-1] by 1, a[i] by 2, and a[i+1] by 1. This seems like a way to propagate changes through the array, affecting three consecutive elements each time.

Given that, I need to find out if it's possible to make the entire array zero by repeatedly applying this operation.

Let me think about the implications of this operation. Each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4 because 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce it to zero. Wait, but that's not necessarily sufficient, as the operations are constrained by the positions where they can be applied.

Hmm, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Perhaps I can model this as a system of equations or look for some invariant that can help determine the possibility.

Let me consider the array as a sequence of variables, and each operation as subtracting specific amounts from three consecutive variables. This resembles a system of linear equations.

But dealing with large n (up to 2*10^5), I need an efficient way to check this for multiple test cases.

Another idea: maybe I can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the required operations to make each element zero, and see if it consistently leads to all elements becoming zero.

Let's try to simulate this process.

Start from the first element, a[0]. To make a[0] zero, I need to perform operations that collectively reduce a[0] by its initial value. Since operations that affect a[0] only come from choosing i=1, which is not allowed (i must be >=2), the only way to affect a[0] is through operations where i=2, which would subtract 1 from a[1] and a[3], and 2 from a[2]. Wait, no, i=2 would affect a[1], a[2], and a[3].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe I can iterate through the array and for each position, determine how many operations need to be performed at the next positions to cancel out the current value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the number of operations performed at position i as x_i.

Then, the effect of x_i operations at position i is:

- a[i-1] -= x_i

- a[i] -= 2*x_i

- a[i+1] -= x_i

We need to choose x_2, x_3, ..., x_{n-1} such that after applying these operations, all a[j] become zero.

This can be modeled as a system of equations:

For each j from 1 to n:

sum of operations affecting a[j] should equal a[j].

Specifically:

- For j=1: x_2 = a[1]

- For j=2: x_2 + x_3 = a[2]/2

Wait, no, let's think again.

Actually, the change to a[j] is:

- If j=1: only affected by x_2, so a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

- If j=2: affected by x_2 and x_3, so a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0

- If j=3: affected by x_3 and x_4, so a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements or look for a pattern.

Another approach: consider the operation as subtracting [1,2,1] from three consecutive elements. So, I can think of this as convolving the array with [-1, -2, -1] in some way.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider the first element again. Since only operations with i=2 can affect a[1], and that operation subtracts 1 from a[1]. So, to make a[1]=0, I need to perform x_2 = a[1] operations at i=2.

Then, moving to a[2], it's affected by operations at i=2 and i=3. Specifically, a[2] is reduced by 2*x_2 + x_3. So, after performing x_2 operations at i=2, the remaining value in a[2] should be a[2] - 2*x_2, which should be offset by x_3.

So, x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

Similarly, for a[3], it's affected by operations at i=3 and i=4, and so on.

Wait, this seems manageable.

Let's try to formalize this.

Start with x_2 = a[1]

Then, x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

x_4 = a[3] - 2*x_3 - x_2

Wait, no, a[3] is affected by x_2 and x_3.

Wait, let's think step by step.

For j=1:

a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

For j=2:

a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

For j=3:

a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0 => x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3

Wait, but x_2 is already determined, and x_3 is determined from the previous step.

This seems like a way to sequentially determine x_i's.

Continue this process up to j=n-1.

Finally, for j=n:

a[n] - x_{n-1} = 0 => x_{n-1} = a[n]

But this seems inconsistent because x_{n-1} is already determined from previous steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the x_i's determined satisfy all equations simultaneously.

This sounds like solving a system of linear equations.

Given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient way to solve this.

Maybe there's a way to iterate through the array and accumulate the required operations.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with x_2 = a[1]

- Then, x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

- x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3

- x_5 = a[4] - x_3 - 2*x_4

- and so on...

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the operations are local and affect only three consecutive elements each time.

I recall that in similar problems involving operations on sequences, sometimes a cumulative sum or difference approach can be used.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the array a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]

I need to make all a[j] = 0 by performing operations on i from 2 to n-1.

Each operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

I can think of this as subtracting the array [1,2,1] shifted appropriately for each operation.

To make the entire array zero, the total operations should subtract exactly the initial values.

This sounds like solving for a convolution.

But perhaps a simpler way is to consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of differences to find a pattern.

Let me consider defining b[i] = x_i - x_{i+1}

Then, summing up the operations, but I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Another idea: since each operation affects three consecutive elements, maybe I can model this as a system where each equation depends only on a few previous variables.

Let me try to implement the sequential determination of x_i's.

Start with x_2 = a[1]

Then, x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

Next, x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3

Wait, but a[3] is affected by x_2 and x_3.

Similarly, a[4] is affected by x_3 and x_4.

This seems like a way to iteratively compute x_i's.

Let me try this with the first example:

n=5, a=[1,3,5,5,2]

Set x_2 = a[1] = 1

Then x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2 = 3 - 2*1 = 1

Then x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 = 5 - 1 - 2*1 = 5 - 1 - 2 = 2

Then x_5 = a[4] - x_3 - 2*x_4 = 5 - 1 - 2*2 = 5 - 1 - 4 = 0

Finally, check a[5] - x_4 = 2 - 2 = 0, which matches.

So in this case, x_2=1, x_3=1, x_4=2, x_5=0, and it works.

Another test case: n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Set x_2=2

Then x_3=4-2*2=0

Then x_4=4-2*0 -2=4-0-2=2 (Wait, hold on.)

Wait, the formula for x_4 is a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2

Then x_5=5 - x_3 - 2*x_4 =5 -0 -4=1

Then check a[5] - x_4 =1 -1=0, which is fine.

But according to the example, the answer is "NO", so there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula for x_i.

Let me double-check.

Actually, in the first step, x_2 is determined by a[1], which is correct.

Then x_3 is determined by a[2] - 2*x_2.

Then x_4 is determined by a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3.

Wait, perhaps I missed that a[3] is also affected by x_4.

Wait, no, each x_i only affects a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

Wait, perhaps I need to set up equations more carefully.

Let me define:

For i from 2 to n-1, x_i is the number of operations at position i.

Then:

a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2

a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0 => x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3

...

a[n-1] - x_{n-2} - 2*x_{n-1} - x_n = 0

a[n] - x_{n-1} = 0 => x_n = a[n]

Wait, but x_n is only affected by operations at i=n-1.

So, perhaps I can set up the equations and solve for x_i's sequentially.

Let me try with the second example: n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Set x_2 = 2

Then x_3 = 4 - 2*2 = 0

Then x_4 = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2

Then x_5 = 5 - 0 - 4 =1

Then check a[5] - x_4 =1 -1=0, which seems fine, but the answer is "NO", so there must be a mistake in this approach.

Wait, maybe I have the equations wrong.

Let me carefully write down the equations for n=5:

Equations:

1. a1 - x2 = 0 => x2 = a1

2. a2 - 2*x2 - x3 = 0 => x3 = a2 - 2*x2

3. a3 - x2 - 2*x3 - x4 =0 => x4 = a3 - x2 -2*x3

4. a4 - x3 - 2*x4 - x5 =0 => x5 = a4 - x3 -2*x4

5. a5 - x4 =0 => x5 = a5

But from equation 4 and 5, we have x5 = a4 - x3 -2*x4 and x5 = a5

So, a4 - x3 -2*x4 should equal a5.

Let's check with the second example:

a=[2,4,4,5,1]

x2=2

x3=4-4=0

x4=4-2-0=2

x5=5-0-4=1, which matches a5=1.

So, according to this, it should be "YES", but the expected output is "NO", so there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that all x_i >=0, since operations can't be negative.

In this case, x_i represents the number of operations, which must be non-negative.

In the second example, x2=2, x3=0, x4=2, x5=1, all non-negative, but the answer is "NO". So, that's not the issue.

Wait, maybe I need to check if the operations make sense in the context of the entire array.

Perhaps there's a dependency or a condition that I'm missing.

Let me look at the note in the example. It shows a sequence of operations that lead to all zeros in the first test case, but in the second test case, it's impossible.

I need a way to determine when it's possible.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after applying the operations, not only the final array is zero, but also that the operations don't lead to negative values in between.

But in my earlier calculation for the second test case, all x_i's are non-negative.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the operations step by step to see if it's possible.

But with n up to 2e5, simulation isn't efficient.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the operations as a way to reduce the array in a specific pattern.

Maybe I can think of the operations as waves that propagate through the array, reducing the values in a certain manner.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the array in terms of the operations performed.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where each operation corresponds to a vector, and I need to see if the initial array can be expressed as a combination of these operation vectors.

But that seems too abstract and not efficient for large n.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 2 to n.

Maybe there's a pattern in these differences that can help determine the possibility.

Wait, in the first test case:

a=[1,3,5,5,2]

d=[3-1=2,5-3=2,5-5=0,2-5=-3]

In the second test case:

a=[2,4,4,5,1]

d=[4-2=2,4-4=0,5-4=1,1-5=-4]

Not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe I can consider prefix sums or something similar.

Another idea: since each operation reduces a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1,2,1 respectively, perhaps I can model this as a matrix and solve for the operations.

But again, that might not be efficient for large n.

Let me think about invariants or properties that must hold for the array to be reducible to zero.

One thing is that the sum of the array must be equal to the total operations multiplied by 4, since each operation reduces the sum by 4.

Wait, but in the first test case:

sum(a) =1+3+5+5+2=16, which is divisible by 4.

In the second test case: 2+4+4+5+1=16, also divisible by 4.

But the first is "YES" and the second is "NO", so sum being divisible by 4 is not sufficient.

Is there another condition?

Wait, in the first test case, after setting x2=1, x3=1, x4=2, x5=0, and it works.

In the second test case, x2=2, x3=0, x4=2, x5=1, which seems to work, but the answer is "NO". So, perhaps there's an additional constraint.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after applying the operations, the array becomes zero without any intermediate steps resulting in negative values.

In other words, at each step, when I apply operations, the array should not have negative values.

This is similar to the idea of borrowing in subtraction, where you can't subtract more than what's there.

So, perhaps in my sequential approach, I need to ensure that after assigning x_i's, the remaining values are non-negative.

Let me try that.

In the second test case:

Set x2=2 (a1=2), so a1 becomes 0.

Then, a2 becomes 4 - 2*2 - x3 = 4 - 4 - x3 =0 - x3.

But a2 should be zero after operations, so 0 - x3 =0 => x3=0.

Then, a3 becomes 4 - x2 -2*x3 -x4=4-2-0 -x4=2 -x4.

Set this to zero: x4=2.

Then, a4 becomes 5 - x3 -2*x4 -x5=5-0-4 -x5=1 -x5.

Set this to zero: x5=1.

Finally, a5 becomes 1 - x4=1 -2=-1, which is negative.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I had a5 - x4=1-2=-1, which is negative.

That's the problem. So, even though x5=1 matches a5 - x4, the intermediate step a5 - x4 is negative, which is invalid.

So, the issue is that after applying operations up to a5, the remaining value is negative, which isn't possible.

Hence, in the second test case, it's impossible because at some point, the array would have negative values.

So, in my approach, I need to ensure that after assigning each x_i, the remaining values are non-negative.

In other words, when calculating x_i, I need to make sure that the remaining a[j]'s are >=0.

So, in the second test case, when I set x2=2, a2 becomes 4 - 4 =0, which is fine.

Then, x3=0, a3 becomes 4 -2 -0=2, which is fine.

Then, x4=2, a4 becomes 5 -0 -4=1, which is fine.

Then, a5 becomes 1 -2=-1, which is negative, invalid.

Hence, "NO".

In the first test case:

Set x2=1, a2 becomes 3 -2=1, which is fine.

Then, x3=1, a3 becomes5 -1 -2=2, which is fine.

Then, x4=2, a4 becomes5 -1 -4=0, which is fine.

Then, a5 becomes2 -2=0, which is fine.

Hence, "YES".

So, the key is to ensure that at each step, after assigning x_i, the remaining a[j]'s are non-negative.

Hence, in my approach, I need to iterate through the array, assign x_i's accordingly, and check if at any point, the remaining a[j] becomes negative.

This seems manageable.

Let me formalize this approach.

Algorithm:

For each test case:

1. Read n and the array a of size n.

2. Initialize an array x of size n, where x[i] represents the number of operations at position i.

3. Set x[1] = a[0] (since a[0] must be reduced to zero by x[2], as only operations at i=2 affect a[1]).

4. For i from 1 to n-2:

a. Set x[i+1] = a[i] - 2*x[i] (since a[i] is affected by x[i] and x[i+1]).

b. If x[i+1] < 0, it's invalid; output "NO" and proceed to the next test case.

c. Update a[i+1] -= x[i+1].

5. After processing up to i=n-2, check if a[n-1] == 0.

a. If yes, output "YES".

b. If no, output "NO".

Wait, in the second test case, following this:

x[1] = a[0] =2

x[2] = a[1] -2*x[1]=4-4=0

x[3] = a[2] -2*x[2]=4-0=4

Then, a[3] -= x[3] => a[3]=5-4=1

Then, check a[4]=1 - x[4]=1 -1=0, which is fine.

But according to the earlier calculation, a5 - x4=1-2=-1, which is negative, but in this approach, a5 -=x5=1-1=0, which seems fine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in tracking the updates.

Let me try to simulate this step by step for the second test case.

Given a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Set x[1]=2

Then x[2]=4-4=0

Then x[3]=4-0=4

Then a[3] -=x[3] => a[3]=5-4=1

Then x[4]=5 -2*x[3]=5-8=-3, which is negative, invalid.

Hence, "NO".

Yes, that matches the expected output.

So, in this approach, after setting x[1]=2, x[2]=0, x[3]=4, and then x[4]=5-2*4=5-8=-3, which is negative, hence "NO".

Hence, the key is to ensure that all x[i] are non-negative.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation, x[4] came out to be -3, which is invalid.

Hence, in my algorithm, I need to ensure that x[i] >=0 for all i.

Hence, the corrected algorithm is:

For each test case:

1. Read n and the array a of size n.

2. Set x[1] = a[0]

3. For i from 1 to n-2:

a. x[i+1] = a[i] - 2*x[i]

b. If x[i+1] <0, output "NO" and proceed to the next test case.

c. a[i+1] -= x[i+1]

4. After the loop, check if a[n-1] ==0.

a. If yes, output "YES"

b. Else, output "NO"

Wait, but in the second test case, x[3]=4, and then x[4]=5-2*4=5-8=-3 <0, which is invalid, hence "NO".

In the first test case:

x[1]=1

x[2]=3-2*1=1

x[3]=5-2*1=3

a[3] -=3 => a[3]=5-3=2

x[4]=2-2*3=2-6=-4 <0, but in the earlier simulation, it was possible.

Wait, but according to this, it should be "NO", but in the example, it's "YES".

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

In the first test case:

a=[1,3,5,5,2]

x[1]=1

x[2]=3-2*1=1

x[3]=5-2*1=3

a[3] -=3 => a[3]=5-3=2

x[4]=5 -2*3=5-6=-1 <0, invalid.

But according to the example, it's "YES".

So, there's a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate x[i].

Let me look back at the operations.

Each operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, to make a[j]=0, the operations affecting a[j] must sum to a[j].

For j=1: only affected by operations at i=2, so x[2]=a[1]

For j=2: affected by x[2] and x[3]: a[2] -2*x[2] -x[3]=0 => x[3]=a[2]-2*x[2]

For j=3: affected by x[2], x[3], x[4]: a[3] -x[2] -2*x[3] -x[4]=0 => x[4]=a[3]-x[2]-2*x[3]

...

For j=n-1: affected by x[n-2], x[n-1], x[n]: a[n-1] -x[n-2] -2*x[n-1] -x[n]=0

For j=n: affected by x[n-1]: a[n] -x[n-1]=0 => x[n-1]=a[n]

Wait, but this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to set up the equations and solve them.

But for large n, I need an efficient way.

Let me consider that x[n]=a[n] - x[n-1]

But I need to ensure consistency across all
