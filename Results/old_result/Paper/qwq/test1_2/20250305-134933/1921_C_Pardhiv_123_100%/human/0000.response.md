Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the beginning, at moment 0, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time that it's on. Also, he can turn the phone off and on again, but each time he does that, it costs b units of charge.

The goal is to determine if he can send all the messages without the charge dropping to zero or below at any point.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's happening over time. The phone starts at moment 0 with f charge. If he keeps the phone on from moment 0 to moment m1, the charge will decrease by a * m1. But he might save charge by turning the phone off between messages.

So, between sending messages, he can choose to keep the phone on, which costs a units per time unit, or turn it off and on again at the next message time, which costs b units each time he does that.

I need to find a strategy that minimizes the charge usage between messages so that he can send all messages without the charge dropping to zero.

Looking at the sample input and output, in the first case:

1 3 1 5

3

So, n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, and m1=3.

If he keeps the phone on from 0 to 3, charge decreases by 1*3=3, so f becomes 0, which is not enough to send the message at moment 3 because he needs a positive charge to send it.

Alternatively, he can turn the phone off at 0 and on at 3, which costs b=5, so f becomes 3-5=-2, which is worse.

So, in this case, it's impossible, hence "NO".

In the third case:

5 10 1 2

1 2 3 4 5

He has to send messages at moments 1 through 5, with f=10, a=1, b=2.

One possible strategy is to turn the phone on just before each message and turn it off after, paying b=2 each time.

But wait, turning it on and off between each message would cost b=2 for each transition, but he needs to send 5 messages, which would require turning it on 5 times, but turning it on at moment 0 is free, so turning it on at moments 1,2,3,4,5 would require 5 times b=2, but I think the cost of turning it on is only when he turns it from off to on.

Wait, the problem says: "Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action consumes b units of energy each time."

So, each time he turns it off and then turns it on again, it costs b.

So, if he turns it off at moment x and turns it on at moment y, it costs b once.

But turning it on at moment 0 is part of turning it on initially, so maybe it doesn't count towards b.

Wait, the problem says: "Consider turning on and off to be instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone at the same moment."

And also, "the phone is turned on at moment 0."

So, initially, the phone is on at moment 0.

Each time he turns it off and then turns it on again, it costs b.

So, between sending messages, he can choose to keep it on, which costs a per time unit, or turn it off and then on again at the next message, costing b.

He needs to manage this to ensure that at each message time, the charge is positive.

In the third sample input:

5 10 1 2

1 2 3 4 5

One strategy is to keep the phone on from 0 to 5, which would cost a*(5-0)=5*1=5, so f=10-5=5, which is positive at each message time.

Alternatively, he can turn it off and on at each message, which would cost b=2 for each on/off cycle.

But since he needs to send messages at moments 1 through 5, and the phone is already on at moment 0, he can choose to turn it off after sending a message and turn it on again before the next one.

Wait, but turning it off and on between each message would be costly.

Wait, no, in this case, keeping it on continuously from 0 to 5 seems more efficient in terms of charge.

But let's see the specific steps.

At moment 0, phone is on with f=10.

At moment 1:

- Keep phone on from 0 to 1: charge decreases by a*(1-0)=1, so f=9.

- Send message at moment 1: charge remains 9 (assuming sending message doesn't consume charge, just requires positive charge).

At moment 2:

- Keep phone on from 1 to 2: charge decreases by a*(2-1)=1, so f=8.

- Send message at moment 2: charge remains 8.

Continuing this way up to moment 5, f would be 10 - 5*1 = 5, which is positive.

So, "YES".

Another sample input:

3 11 9 6

6 8 10

Let's see:

n=3, f=11, a=9, b=6

Messages at 6,8,10.

Option 1: keep phone on from 0 to 10.

Charge decreases by a*(10-0)=9*10=90, but f=11, which is way insufficient.

Option 2: turn off and on between messages.

For example:

- Turn off at 0 and on at 6: cost b=6, f=11-6=5.

- Send message at 6: f=5.

- Keep phone on from 6 to 8: cost a*(8-6)=9*2=18, f=5-18=-13: negative, not possible.

Alternative strategy:

- Turn off at 0 and on at 6: f=11-6=5.

- Send message at 6: f=5.

- Turn off at 6 and on at 8: f=5-6=-1: negative, not possible.

Another strategy:

- Keep phone on from 0 to 6: cost a*6=54, f=11-54=-43: negative, not possible.

Seems like no matter what, he can't maintain positive charge, so "NO".

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

while t > 0:

(n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))

ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

t -= 1

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, f, a, b, and the list of message times, ls.

It prepends 0 to ls, so ls is [0, m1, m2, ..., mn].

Then, for each interval between consecutive message times (including from 0 to m1), it subtracts the minimum of a*(time difference) or b from f.

Finally, if f > 0 after all these subtractions, it prints "YES"; else, "NO".

Is this logic correct?

Let's think about what this is doing.

For each time interval between ls[i-1] and ls[i], it chooses to either:

- Keep the phone on during the entire interval, costing a*(ls[i] - ls[i-1]), or

- Turn the phone off and on at ls[i], costing b.

It chooses the minimum of these two costs and subtracts it from f.

This seems to model the decision of whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again between messages.

In the first sample input:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

ls = [0,3]

So, interval is 3-0=3.

min(a*3, b) = min(3,5) = 3

f = 3 - 3 = 0

Then, check if f > 0: 0 > 0 is False, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

In the third sample input:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

ls = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

Intervals: 1,1,1,1,1

For each interval, min(a*1, b)=min(1,2)=1

So, total subtraction: 5*1=5

f = 10 - 5 = 5 > 0, so "YES"

Which matches the sample.

In the second sample input:

7 21 1 3

4 6 10 13 17 20 26

ls = [0,4,6,10,13,17,20,26]

Intervals: 4,2,4,3,4,3,6

For each interval:

min(a*4, b)=min(4,3)=3

min(a*2, b)=min(2,3)=2

min(a*4, b)=3

min(a*3, b)=3

min(a*4, b)=3

min(a*3, b)=3

min(a*6, b)=3

Total subtraction: 3+2+3+3+3+3+3=17

f = 21 - 17 = 4 > 0, so "YES"

Which matches the sample.

In the fourth sample input:

1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

1000000000

ls = [0,1000000000]

Interval: 1000000000

min(a*1000000000, b)=min(1000000000*1000000000,1000000000)=1000000000

f = 1000000000 - 1000000000 = 0

0 > 0 is False, so "NO"

Which matches the sample.

In the fifth sample input:

3 11 9 6

6 8 10

ls = [0,6,8,10]

Intervals: 6,2,2

min(a*6, b)=min(54,6)=6

min(a*2, b)=min(18,6)=6

min(a*2, b)=min(18,6)=6

Total subtraction: 6+6+6=18

f = 11 - 18 = -7 < 0, so "NO"

Which matches the sample.

In the sixth sample input:

12 621526648 2585904 3566299

51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683

ls = [0,51789,...,919683]

Compute min(a*(time difference), b) for each interval and subtract from f.

Given that a=2585904 and b=3566299, and time differences vary.

In this case, since a is large and b is relatively small, it's likely that min(a*(time difference), b) will often be b, unless the time difference is small enough that a*(time difference) < b.

For example, for the first interval, 51789:

min(2585904*51789, 3566299) = min(13372217376, 3566299) = 3566299

Similarly for other intervals, likely min will be b=3566299.

Total subtraction: 12*3566299 = 42795588

f = 621526648 - 42795588 = 578731060 > 0, so "YES"

Which matches the sample.

So, based on these sample inputs, the program seems to be working correctly.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let's think about what the program is doing.

For each time interval between messages, it chooses the minimum cost between keeping the phone on for the entire interval or turning it off and on at the next message time.

By subtracting this minimum cost from f for each interval, it simulates the optimal choice for each interval independently.

Is this optimal?

Well, in this problem, the intervals are sequential, and the charge is depleted over time based on the choices made in each interval.

Since each interval's cost is independent of the others, and the goal is to minimize the total charge used, choosing the minimum cost for each interval separately leads to the overall minimum charge used.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Moreover, since the problem allows turning the phone on and off at any message time, and the cost is only incurred when turning it off and then on again, this model seems to capture that.

Thus, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
