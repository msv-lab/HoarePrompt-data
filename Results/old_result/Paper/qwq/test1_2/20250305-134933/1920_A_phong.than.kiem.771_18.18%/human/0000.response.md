Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have the number of constraints n, followed by n lines each containing a pair (a, x), where a is the type of constraint and x is the integer value for that constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range of k based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers that are excluded by the constraints of type 3.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among these constraints because k needs to be greater than or equal to all of them. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among these because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them.

Once I have the lower bound (lb) and the upper bound (ub), the possible values of k are from lb to ub, inclusive.

Then, for constraints of type 3 (k != x), I need to exclude these specific values from the range lb to ub.

So, the total number of possible k values would be the count of integers from lb to ub, minus the count of integers that are excluded by the type 3 constraints.

But, I need to make sure that the type 3 constraints are within the range [lb, ub] because if a type 3 constraint's x is outside this range, it doesn't affect the count.

Wait, no. If x is outside the range, it's already excluded by the type 1 and 2 constraints, so I don't need to consider it again.

Therefore, I should collect all the type 3 constraints that are within the range [lb, ub], and then subtract the count of such x's from the total count of integers in the range.

Also, I need to handle cases where lb > ub, which means no integer k can satisfy all constraints, so the answer is 0.

Let me try to formalize this:

1. Find the maximum x among all constraints of type 1. Let's call this lb.

2. Find the minimum x among all constraints of type 2. Let's call this ub.

3. If lb > ub, then there are no possible k values, so answer is 0.

4. Otherwise, the total number of possible k values is ub - lb + 1.

5. Among these, exclude the x values from constraints of type 3 that are within [lb, ub].

6. So, the final count is (ub - lb + 1) - count of type 3 x's that are in [lb, ub].

7. If the count of type 3 x's in [lb, ub] is greater than ub - lb + 1, then the answer is 0.

I think this makes sense.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

First, there's a function func_1 that reads an integer input, presumably the number of test cases.

Then, there's a loop that reads each test case and processes it using func_7.

So, I need to focus on func_7, which seems to handle one test case.

In func_7:

- It reads n, the number of constraints.

- Initializes start to -1 and end to 1000000000.

- Initializes an empty list num, which will store the x values from type 3 constraints.

Then, it loops through n constraints:

- Reads each constraint as (t, v), where t is the type and v is the value.

- If t == 1, it updates start to be the maximum of current start and v.

- If t == 2, it updates end to be the minimum of current end and v.

- If t == 3, it appends v to the list num.

After processing all constraints, it calculates count_num, which is the number of x's in num that are within [start, end].

Finally, if start > end, it returns 0; else, it returns (end - start + 1) - count_num, but only if end - start + 1 >= count_num; otherwise, it returns 0.

Wait, actually, in the code, it's:

if start > end:

return 0

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

So, it's returning end - start + 1 - count_num only if end - start + 1 >= count_num, else 0.

But in reality, end - start + 1 - count_num can be negative if count_num > end - start + 1, but since it's a finite range, the minimum answer is 0.

So, it's ensuring that the answer doesn't go below 0.

But in practice, since the range is finite and count_num can't be greater than the range size, this condition might be redundant.

But it's there anyway.

Now, let's check if this matches my earlier reasoning.

Yes, it does.

It correctly finds the lower bound (start) as the maximum of all type 1 x's.

It correctly finds the upper bound (end) as the minimum of all type 2 x's.

It collects all type 3 x's in the list num.

Then, it counts how many of these type 3 x's are within [start, end], and subtracts that count from the total range size (end - start + 1).

If start > end, it's impossible, so it returns 0.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the problem, it says that it's guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and that no two constraints are the same.

So, I don't need to worry about missing type 1 or type 2 constraints.

Also, since all constraints are unique, I don't have duplicate constraints to worry about.

I think the logic is sound.

Let me check the first example:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

2

1 5

2 4

10

3 6

2 98

1 3

3 99

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Output:

7

0

90

0

0

800000000

Taking the first test case:

n=4

Constraints:

1 3 → k >= 3

2 10 → k <= 10

3 1 → k != 1

3 5 → k != 5

So, lb = max of type 1 x's = 3

ub = min of type 2 x's = 10

Possible k: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But k !=1 (already excluded since k >=3) and k !=5

So, exclude 5 from 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 → 3,4,6,7,8,9,10 → 7 values

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=2

1 5 → k >=5

2 4 → k <=4

So, lb=5, ub=4 → lb > ub → impossible → 0

Third test case:

n=10

Constraints:

3 6

3 7

1 2 → k >=2

1 7 → k >=7 (so lb =7)

2 100

2 98 → ub=98

3 100

3 44

1 3 → already have 1 2 and 1 7, so lb is max(2,7,3)=7

So, lb=7, ub=98

Possible k: 7 to 98

Exclude k=6 (already excluded since k >=7), k=7, k=100 (already excluded since k <=98), k=44

So, exclude k=7 and k=44 from 7 to 98

But k=7 is included, k=44 is included

So, count_num=2

Total k values: 98-7+1=92

Minus 2 excluded values: 90

Matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=6

1 5 → k >=5

2 10 → k <=10

1 9 → k >=9 (so lb=max(5,9)=9)

2 2 → k <=2 (but ub=min(10,2)=2)

So, lb=9, ub=2 → lb > ub → impossible → 0

Fifth test case:

n=5

1 1 → k >=1

2 2 → k <=2

3 1 → k !=1

3 2 → k !=2

3 3 → k !=3 (but k <=2, so already excluded)

So, lb=1, ub=2

Possible k:1,2

Exclude k=1 and k=2 → no values left → 0

Sixth test case:

n=6

1 10000 → k >=10000

2 900000000 → k <=900000000

1 100000000 → k >=100000000 (so lb=max(10000,100000000)=100000000)

2 900000001 → k <=900000001 (but ub=min(900000000,900000001)=900000000

3 500000000 → exclude 500000000

3 10000 → already excluded by k >=100000000

3 900000001 → already excluded by k <=900000000

So, lb=100000000, ub=900000000

Possible k:100000000 to 900000000

Exclude k=500000000

So, total k values:900000000-100000000+1=800000001

Minus 1 for k=500000000:800000000

Matches the sample output.

So, the program seems to be correctly implementing the required logic.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
