Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a one-dimensional grid of length n, and each cell contains either '<' or '>'. When a pinball is placed on one of these cells, it moves according to the character: '<' means move left, '>' means move right. After moving, the character in the cell flips to the opposite direction. The pinball stops when it goes out of the grid from either end, and I need to figure out how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

First, I need to understand the behavior of the pinball. Let's consider a simple example to see how it works.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 3

s = "><<"

Let's place the pinball on the first cell (index 0), which has '>'. So, it moves right to index 1, and s[0] flips to '<'.

Now, s = "<<"

The pinball is at index 1, which has '<', so it moves left to index 0, and s[1] flips to '>'.

Now, s = "<>"

Pinball is at index 0, which has '<', so it moves left and leaves the grid. Total steps: 3.

Similarly, for the second cell:

Start at index 1 with '>', move right to index 2, s[1] flips to '<'.

Now, s = "<<"

At index 2, '<', move left to index 1, s[2] flips to '>'.

Now, s = "<>"

At index 1, '<', move left to index 0, s[1] flips to '>'.

Now, s = "<>"

At index 0, '<', move left and leave the grid. Total steps: 6.

This seems to be the behavior.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n and any string s.

Constraints are large: n up to 5*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^5, but the total sum of n is up to 5*10^5.

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to simulate the process for each starting position, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let's think about the movement.

Each time the pinball moves, it flips the character in the cell it just left.

So, the grid can change over time.

But since we're resetting the grid for each query, we don't have to worry about previous pinballs affecting the current one.

Wait, no, actually, for each query, we're placing a new pinball on a fresh grid.

So, each query is independent, and we can handle them separately.

But still, we need to find a way to compute the steps for each starting position efficiently.

Let me consider the movement rules:

- If pinball is at cell i and s[i] is '<', it moves left to i-1, and s[i] flips to '>'.

- If pinball is at cell i and s[i] is '>', it moves right to i+1, and s[i] flips to '<'.

And it continues until it goes out of bounds.

I need to track the number of steps until it leaves the grid.

Given that the grid can change, it's tricky to simulate directly for all starting positions.

Let me see if there's a pattern or a way to precompute some values.

Maybe I can think in terms of the path the pinball takes and how the flips affect future moves.

Wait, but since each query starts with a fresh grid, the flips don't carry over between queries.

So, for each query, it's a separate simulation.

But simulating each one separately would be too slow for large n.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and the edges depend on the direction and the flip.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me try to find a mathematical pattern.

Suppose I have a grid of length n.

Let me consider the movement step by step.

When the pinball is at position i, it looks at s[i], moves accordingly, and flips s[i].

Then, at the new position, repeats the process until it leaves the grid.

I need to count the number of steps until it leaves.

Let me consider that each time a cell is left, it flips.

So, the state of the grid changes over time.

But since each query is independent, I can reset the grid each time.

I need to find a way to calculate the steps without simulating each move.

Maybe I can think about the path the pinball takes and how many times it visits each cell.

Wait, but that might still be too slow.

Let me consider the fact that the grid is only consisting of '<' and '>', and the flips happen only on the cells that the pinball leaves.

So, for a given starting position, the sequence of moves and flips can be predetermined.

I need to find a way to calculate the total steps based on the initial string s and the starting position.

Looking at the example:

n=3, s="><<"

Starting at position 0:

- Step 1: at 0, s[0]='>', move to 1, s[0] flips to '<'

- Step 2: at 1, s[1]='<', move to 0, s[1] flips to '>'

- Step 3: at 0, s[0]='<', move left and leave the grid

Total steps: 3

Similarly, starting at position 1:

- Step 1: at 1, s[1]='>', move to 2, s[1] flips to '<'

- Step 2: at 2, s[2]='<', move to 1, s[2] flips to '>'

- Step 3: at 1, s[1]='<', move to 0, s[1] flips to '>'

- Step 4: at 0, s[0]='<', move left and leave the grid

Total steps: 6

And starting at position 2:

- Step 1: at 2, s[2]='<', move to 1, s[2] flips to '>'

- Step 2: at 1, s[1]='>', move to 2, s[1] flips to '<'

- Step 3: at 2, s[2]='>', move to 3 and leave the grid

Total steps: 5

So, for n=3, s="><<", the answers are [3,6,5]

Looking at another example:

n=4, s="<<<<"

Starting at position 0:

- Step 1: at 0, s[0]='<', move left and leave the grid

Total steps: 1

Starting at position 1:

- Step 1: at 1, s[1]='<', move left to 0, s[1] flips to '>'

- Step 2: at 0, s[0]='<', move left and leave the grid

Total steps: 2

And so on.

I need to find a pattern or formula to compute these steps efficiently.

Let me consider that each time a cell is left, its direction flips.

So, the next time the pinball passes through that cell, it will see the opposite direction.

But since the grid is being reset for each query, the flips don't affect other queries.

So, for each query, it's a fresh grid.

I need to simulate the path for each starting position without actually simulating each step.

Is there a way to model this?

One idea is to consider that the pinball bounces between cells, and each time it leaves a cell, the direction flips, effectively changing the path.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider the movement in terms of the number of times the pinball crosses certain boundaries.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the pinball crosses from one cell to another, considering the flips.

But I'm not making progress this way.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases, then for each test case, reads n and s, and calls func_1(s).

Then, func_1(s) seems to be doing some calculations to compute the number of steps for each starting position.

Looking at func_1(s):

It first processes the string s to build two arrays A and B, along with their indices idx_A and idx_B.

A seems to be built from positions where s[i] == '>', and B seems to be built from positions where s[i] == '<', but from the end.

Then, it iterates through each position i from 0 to n-1, and based on s[i], it computes the number of steps using A and B.

This seems complicated, and I need to understand if this is correct.

Let me try to see what A and B represent.

For A:

It's built for positions where s[i] == '>', and it seems to accumulate some values based on previous positions.

Similarly, B is built for positions where s[i] == '<', from the end.

Then, for each position i, depending on whether s[i] is '>' or '<', it computes the number of steps using A and B in a certain way.

This seems to be an optimized way to compute the steps without simulating each move.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me check with the first example:

n=3, s="><<"

Compute A and B:

A is for positions with '>', which are i=0 and i=1 (since s[0]='>', s[1]='<', s[2]='<')

Wait, s[1] is '<', so only i=0 should be in A.

Wait, in the code, it's for s[i] == '>', so only i=0.

A[0] = 0

idx_A = [0]

Then, for i=1, s[1]=='<', so nothing added to A

For i=2, s[2]=='<', so nothing added to A

So A = [0], idx_A = [0]

Now, B is for s[i] == '<', from the end.

s[2]=='<', so j=0, i=2-0=2, s[2]=='<', so B.append(0), idx_B=[2]

Then j=1, i=2-1=1, s[1]=='<', so B.append(B[0] + (idx_B[0] - 1)*len(idx_B)) = 0 + (2-1)*1 = 1, idx_B=[2,1]

j=2, i=2-2=0, s[0]=='>', so nothing added to B

So B=[0,1], idx_B=[2,1]

Now, l=0, r=2 (length of B)

For i=0, s[0]=='>'

So, since l < r, which is 0 < 2,

a = A[l] = 0

x = r - (l+2) = 2 - 2 = 0

b = B[r-1] = B[1] = 1

if x >=0: b = B[r-1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r-1])*(x+1)

x=0, B[0]=0, idx_B[0]=2, idx_B[1]=1

So b = 1 - 0 - (2 - 1)*(0+1) = 1 - 0 -1 = 0

Then b = (idx_B[r-1] - i)* (l+1) = (1 - 0)*1 = 1

So total steps = a*2 + b*2 + i +1 = 0*2 + 0*2 + 0 +1 = 1

But in the example, starting at i=0 should take 3 steps, not 1.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted or misunderstood the indices.

Let me double-check.

In the code, for s[i]=='>':

if l < r:

a = A[l]

x = r - (l + 2)

b = B[r - 1]

if x >= 0:

b = b - B[x]

b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)

b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)

print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')

In the first iteration, l=0, r=2, i=0, s[0]=='>'

a = A[0] = 0

x = 2 - (0 + 2) = 0

b = B[1] = 1

x >=0, so b = 1 - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])*(0+1) = 1 - 0 - (2 - 1)*1 = 1 - 0 -1 = 0

Then b = (1 - 0)*1 = 1

So total steps = 0*2 + 0*2 + 0 +1 = 1, but should be 3.

So, the code seems incorrect for this case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the print statement is a * 2 + b * 2 + i +1, but perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I didn't correctly build A and B.

Wait, in the first example, s="><<"

A should be built for '>', which is only at i=0, so A=[0], idx_A=[0]

B is built for '<', from the end:

i=2, s[2]=='<', B.append(0), idx_B=[2]

i=1, s[1]=='<', B.append(B[0] + (idx_B[0] -1)*len(idx_B)) = 0 + (2 -1)*1 =1, idx_B=[2,1]

i=0, s[0]=='>', skip

So, B=[0,1], idx_B=[2,1]

Then, l=0, r=2

For i=0, s[0]=='>'

l < r, so a=A[0]=0

x = r - (l +2) =2 -2=0

b = B[1]=1

x >=0, so b =1 - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])*(x+1)=1 -0 - (2-1)*1=0

Then b=(idx_B[1] - i)*(l +1)=(1 -0)*1=1

Total steps =0*2 +0*2 +0 +1=1, but should be 3.

So, the formula seems incorrect.

Perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the indices.

Wait, perhaps idx_B is [2,1], and B=[0,1]

When x=0, B[x]=0, idx_B[x]=2, idx_B[r-1]=idx_B[1]=1

So, b=1 -0 - (2 -1)*1=0

Then b=(1 -0)*1=1

Total steps=0*2 +0*2 +0 +1=1, but should be 3.

This doesn't match the expected output.

Looking back at the problem, the expected output for the first test case is "3 6 5"

So, the code is producing "1 6 5", which doesn't match for i=0.

Hence, the code seems to be incorrect.

Wait, but the other values seem correct.

For i=1, s[1]=='<'

So, r=2-1=1, r=1

l=0, r=1

since l <= r:

if l ==0:

print(i +1=2), but expected 6

Wait, no, in the code, for s[i]=='<':

if l <= r:

if l ==0:

print(i +1, end=' ')

else:

a = A[l -1]

a = a + (i - idx_A[l -1])*l

b = B[r]

if r - l >=0:

b = b - B[r - l]

b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i)*(r - l)

b = b + (idx_B[r] - i)*l

print(a*2 + b*2 + i +1, end=' ')

In this case, for i=1, s[1]=='<'

l=0, r=1

l <= r, and l ==0, so print(i +1=2), but expected 6

Again, discrepancy.

So, the code is not producing the correct output for the first test case.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
