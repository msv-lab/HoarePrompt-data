Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. I need to determine if he can form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

First, I need to understand what's meant by "different." The problem says that two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation. So, for example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle. Makes sense.

So, Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of the sides, meaning he can either cut parallel to the a side or parallel to the b side.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the a side. That means he's cutting along the b dimension, so he's dividing the b side into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b. After cutting, he has two rectangles: a x b1 and a x b2.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b side, he's dividing the a side into two parts, a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a, resulting in two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

Now, from these two smaller rectangles, he can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle. He can place them side by side or one on top of the other, and he can rotate them.

But, since rotation doesn't change the rectangle's dimensions (as per the problem), I need to consider the possible new dimensions he can achieve.

Let me think about the possible ways to combine the two smaller rectangles.

Case 1: Cutting parallel to the a side (dividing b into b1 and b2).

He has two rectangles: a x b1 and a x b2.

If he places them side by side along the a side, the new rectangle would be a x (b1 + b2), which is the same as the original a x b.

If he places them one on top of the other along the b side, the new rectangle would be (a + a) x min(b1, b2), but that's 2a x min(b1, b2).

But, since min(b1, b2) could be anything from 1 to b-1, depending on how he cuts, I need to see if 2a x min(b1, b2) is different from a x b.

Wait, but 2a x (b/2) could be equal to a x b if b = 2a, but in general, it might not be.

Similarly, if he rotates the smaller rectangles, but since rotation doesn't change the rectangle's type, it's the same as considering the dimensions in any order.

Case 2: Cutting parallel to the b side (dividing a into a1 and a2).

He has two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

Similarly, placing them side by side along the b side gives (a1 + a2) x b, which is the same as the original a x b.

Placing them one on top of the other along the a side gives max(a1, a2) x 2b, but again, this might or might not be different from the original.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The problem is to see if Bob can obtain another rectangle that is not the same as the original one.

Given that rotating by 90 degrees makes rectangles equivalent, I need to check if the new rectangle's dimensions (ignoring order) are different from the original's.

So, for example, if the original is a x b, then any rectangle that is c x d where {c, d} != {a, b} is considered different.

Now, let's consider the possible new rectangles Bob can form.

When he cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, he has two pieces, say R1 and R2.

He can arrange R1 and R2 in different ways:

- Place them side by side along one dimension.

- Place one on top of the other along another dimension.

- Rotate them in any way, but since rotation doesn't change the rectangle type, I can ignore the rotation for now.

So, for each way of cutting, I need to see what new rectangles can be formed by arranging the two pieces.

Then, check if any of these new rectangles have dimensions different from {a, b}.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, these two can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6 because {4,3} != {2,6}.

In the second example, a 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, and arranging them can only form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x1, so it's not different.

So, in the first case, Bob can get a different rectangle, in the second case, he cannot.

I need to generalize this.

Let me consider the general case.

Given a rectangle a x b, Bob can make a cut parallel to one side.

Case 1: Cut parallel to the a side, dividing b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Then, he has two rectangles: a x b1 and a x b2.

He can arrange them in two ways:

- Place them side by side along the a side: a x (b1 + b2) = a x b (same as original).

- Place them one on top of the other along the b side: (a + a) x min(b1, b2) = 2a x min(b1, b2).

Now, for this to be different from the original, {2a, min(b1, b2)} != {a, b}.

So, 2a != a and min(b1, b2) != b, which is generally true unless specific conditions are met.

But, I need to consider that b1 and b2 are positive integers, and b1 + b2 = b.

Similarly, he could cut parallel to the b side, dividing a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, he has two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

Arranging them:

- Side by side along the b side: (a1 + a2) x b = a x b (same as original).

- One on top of the other along the a side: max(a1, a2) x 2b.

Again, for this to be different from the original, {max(a1, a2), 2b} != {a, b}.

So, I need to see if there exists a way to cut the rectangle such that one of these new arrangements results in a rectangle with dimensions different from the original's.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a * b.

The area of the new rectangle should also be a * b, since it's made from the same two pieces.

So, the new rectangle must have area a * b, and dimensions c and d such that c * d = a * b.

But, since {c, d} != {a, b}, I need to see if there's another pair of integers c and d such that c * d = a * b and {c, d} != {a, b}.

If such a pair exists, then Bob can form a different rectangle; otherwise, he cannot.

Wait, but this seems too broad because there could be multiple ways to factorize a * b.

But, not all factorizations are achievable by cutting and rearranging the pieces in the way described.

So, I need to consider the constraints imposed by the cutting and rearranging process.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

Then, he has two rectangles with integer dimensions.

He can arrange them to form a new rectangle by placing them side by side or one on top of the other.

But, in either case, the new rectangle's dimensions will be constrained by the dimensions of the smaller rectangles.

Let me consider that he has two rectangles: R1 of size c x d and R2 of size e x f.

To form a new rectangle from R1 and R2, they must be arranged such that their sides align properly.

Specifically, to place them side by side along one dimension, the dimension that is aligned must be the same.

For example, if placing them side by side along the c side, then e must equal c, and the new rectangle would have dimensions c x (d + f).

Similarly, if placing them one on top of the other along the d side, then f must equal d, and the new rectangle would have dimensions (c + e) x d.

But, in the cutting process, the two smaller rectangles share a common dimension.

Wait, no.

When Bob cuts the original rectangle, if he cuts parallel to the a side, the two smaller rectangles will both have dimension a.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b side, they will both have dimension b.

So, when arranging them, he can place them side by side along the shared dimension or one on top of the other along the other dimension.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider specific cases.

Let me consider that Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, both of which have one dimension equal to a or both have one dimension equal to b, depending on how he cuts.

Then, when arranging them to form a new rectangle, he can place them in different ways, but their dimensions are constrained by the original cut.

I need to find a general condition based on a and b that determines whether it's possible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Looking back at the examples:

- For 2x6, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, then arranging them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

- For 2x1, cutting into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x1.

So, in the first case, it's possible to form a different rectangle, in the second case, it's not.

Looking for a pattern, I notice that in the first case, both a and b are even, but in the second case, they are not.

Wait, a is 2 (even) and b is 6 (even), while in the second case, a is 2 (even) and b is 1 (odd).

But in the sample input, there are other cases like 3x2, 2x2, 2x4, 6x3, with different outcomes.

Wait, in the sample input:

7 test cases:

1 1 → No

2 1 → No

2 6 → Yes

3 2 → Yes

2 2 → Yes

2 4 → Yes

6 3 → No

Looking at these, I try to find a pattern.

Let me list them:

a b → Answer

1 1 → No

2 1 → No

2 6 → Yes

3 2 → Yes

2 2 → Yes

2 4 → Yes

6 3 → No

Hmm.

Looking at a and b, I see:

- If both a and b are odd, like 1x1, or 3x1 (but 3x1 not in sample), the answer is No.

- If one is even and one is odd, like 2x1, 6x3, the answer is No.

- If both are even, like 2x6, 2x2, 2x4, the answer is Yes.

- But 3x2 is also Yes, even though one is odd and one is even.

Wait, 3x2 is Yes, but 2x1 is No, and 6x3 is No.

Hmm, seems inconsistent at first glance.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is 1.

For example:

1x1: GCD=1 → No

2x1: GCD=1 → No

2x6: GCD=2 → Yes

3x2: GCD=1 → Yes

2x2: GCD=2 → Yes

2x4: GCD=2 → Yes

6x3: GCD=3 → No

Hmm, not quite.

GCD=1: 1x1 (No), 2x1 (No), 3x2 (Yes)

GCD=2: 2x6 (Yes), 2x2 (Yes), 2x4 (Yes)

GCD=3: 6x3 (No)

So, GCD alone doesn't determine the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether both a and b are even.

But in the sample, 3x2 has one even and one odd, and the answer is Yes.

Wait, maybe it's related to whether at least one of a or b is even.

In the sample:

1x1 (both odd) → No

2x1 (one even) → No

2x6 (both even) → Yes

3x2 (one even) → Yes

2x2 (both even) → Yes

2x4 (both even) → Yes

6x3 (one even) → No

Hmm, doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a*b is even.

But in the sample, 3x2 has a*b=6, which is even, and the answer is Yes.

6x3 has a*b=18, which is even, and the answer is No.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 4.

But 2x6: 2 is divisible by 2, 6 by 2 → Yes

3x2: 3 not divisible by 2, 2 is → Yes

2x1: 2 is divisible by 2, 1 not → No

6x3: 6 is divisible by 2, 3 not → No

Hmm, still not clear.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a and b share a common even divisor.

In 2x6, both are divisible by 2.

In 3x2, both are divisible by 1 and 2, but GCD is 1.

Wait, 3 and 2 are coprime, but the answer is Yes.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.

So, in the case of 3x2, which is considered different from 2x3, but since they are considered the same, perhaps the condition is based on the set of dimensions.

Wait, but in the sample, 3x2 is Yes, meaning Bob can form a different rectangle.

Wait, but 3x2 can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and then arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, which is different from 3x2.

Wait, but 6x1 is considered the same as 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

Wait, but 3x2 and 2x3 are considered the same.

Wait, the problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.

So, 3x2 and 2x3 are considered the same.

But in the sample, 3x2 is Yes, meaning Bob can form a different rectangle.

Wait, but 3x2 can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and then arranged to form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from 3x2.

Wait, but 6x1 is considered the same as 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Similarly, in 2x6, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

In 2x1, cutting into two 1x1 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x1.

So, the answer is No.

In 2x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x2.

In 2x4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4, so No.

Wait, but in the sample, 2x4 is Yes.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, 2x4: cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4.

So, no new rectangle.

But according to the sample, it's Yes.

Wait, maybe there's another way to cut.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle parallel to the a side, dividing b into, say, 1 and 3.

Then, I have two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x3.

Arranging them side by side along a: 2x(1+3)=2x4 (same).

Arranging them one on top of the other along b: (2+2)x1=4x1, which is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, the answer is Yes.

Got it.

So, perhaps the general condition is whether at least one of a or b is even.

In the sample:

1x1 (both odd) → No

2x1 (one even) → No

2x6 (both even) → Yes

3x2 (one even) → Yes

2x2 (both even) → Yes

2x4 (both even) → Yes

6x3 (one even) → No

Wait, but according to this, 2x1 should be Yes, but it's No.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's whether both a and b are even.

In the sample:

1x1 (both odd) → No

2x1 (one even) → No

2x6 (both even) → Yes

3x2 (one even) → Yes

2x2 (both even) → Yes

2x4 (both even) → Yes

6x3 (one even) → No

Wait, but 3x2 is one even, one odd, and it's Yes.

Similarly, 6x3 is one even, one odd, and it's No.

So, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Wait, perhaps it's whether a and b have a common even divisor.

In 2x6, GCD is 2, which is even → Yes

3x2, GCD is 1, but 2 is even → Yes

2x1, GCD is 1, and 1 is odd → No

6x3, GCD is 3, which is odd → No

2x2, GCD is 2 → Yes

2x4, GCD is 2 → Yes

So, perhaps if the GCD is even, or if at least one of a or b is even and the other is divisible by the GCD in a certain way.

Wait, but 3x2 has GCD 1, which is odd, but since one of them is even, it's considered Yes.

Similarly, 2x1 has one even, but it's No.

Wait, perhaps it's that both a and b need to be even, or one is even and the other is a multiple of the GCD in a certain way.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should think in terms of possible cuts and arrangements.

Let me consider that to form a new rectangle different from the original, Bob needs to be able to arrange the two smaller rectangles in a way that their combined dimensions are not equal to the original dimensions.

Given that, let's consider the general case.

Suppose Bob cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

Case 1: Cut parallel to the a side.

He divides b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

He gets two rectangles: a x b1 and a x b2.

Now, he can arrange them in two ways:

- Place them side by side along the a side: a x (b1 + b2) = a x b (same as original).

- Place them one on top of the other along the b side: (a + a) x min(b1, b2) = 2a x min(b1, b2).

For this to be different from the original, {2a, min(b1, b2)} != {a, b}.

So, unless 2a = b and min(b1, b2) = a, which would make 2a x min(b1, b2) = b x a, which is the same as a x b, so no new rectangle.

Wait, but in the sample, 2x6 can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

Wait, how does that work in this framework?

If a=2, b=6.

Cut parallel to a side, divide b into 3 and 3.

Two rectangles: 2x3 and 2x3.

Arranging them one on top of the other along the b side: (2+2) x 3 = 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, in 3x2, cutting parallel to the b side, divide a into 1 and 2.

Two rectangles: 1x2 and 2x2.

Arranging them side by side along the b side: (1+2) x 2 = 3x2 (same as original).

Arranging them one on top of the other along the a side: max(1,2) x (2*2) = 2x4, which is different from 3x2.

Hence, Yes.

In 2x1, cutting parallel to a side, divide b into 1 and 0, but b cannot be divided into non-positive integers, so only possible cut is into 1x1 and 1x1.

Arranging them side by side: 1x(1+1)=1x2 (same as 2x1).

Arranging them one on top of the other: (1+1)x1=2x1 (same as original).

Hence, No.

In 2x2, cutting parallel to a side, divide b into 1 and 1.

Two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x1.

Arranging them one on top of the other: (2+2)x1=4x1, which is different from 2x2.

Hence, Yes.

In 2x4, cutting parallel to a side, divide b into 2 and 2.

Two rectangles: 2x2 and 2x2.

Arranging them one on top of the other: (2+2)x2=4x2, which is the same as 2x4.

Hence, No.

But according to the sample, it's Yes.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to cut.

If I cut parallel to the b side, divide a into 1 and 1.

Two rectangles: 1x4 and 1x4.

Arranging them side by side: 1x(4+4)=1x8, which is different from 2x4.

Hence, Yes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, in 6x3, cutting parallel to a side, divide b into 1 and 2.

Two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

Arranging them one on top of the other: (6+6)x1=12x1, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample, it's No.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sample, 6x3 is No.

But according to this, it seems like it should be Yes.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the new rectangle must have integer dimensions.

But in this case, 12x1 is integer, and different from 6x3.

But in the sample, it's No.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions strictly greater than 1.

But in this case, 12x1 has one dimension equal to 1, which might not be allowed.

But the problem says "integer sides", so 1 is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in 6x3, cutting into 6x1 and 6x2, and arranging them one on top of the other to get 12x1, which is considered the same as 1x12, but different from 6x3.

But according to the sample, it should be No.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in some cases, despite being able to form a new rectangle, it's still considered the same as the original due to rotation.

But 12x1 is different from 6x3, even considering rotation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions.

In 6x3, original dimensions are 6 and 3.

New rectangle is 12x1: 12 != 6 and 1 != 3, so it's different.

But in the sample, it's No.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must be different from the original, but also satisfy some other condition.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle can be formed in a way that neither of its dimensions is equal to any of the original dimensions.

In 6x3, new rectangle is 12x1: 12 != 6 and 1 != 3, so it should be Yes, but the sample says No.

Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the aspect ratio is the same.

But 12x1 has a different aspect ratio from 6x3.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle can be cut from the original without rotation.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the new rectangle's area is the same as the original, which it always is, since it's made from the same pieces.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle has the same set of dimensions as the original.

In other words, {c, d} != {a, b}.

In 6x3, {12,1} != {6,3}, so it should be Yes, but the sample says No.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in the sample input, 6x3 is considered the same as 3x6.

But in the arrangement, 12x1 is different from both 6x3 and 3x6.

But according to the sample, it's No.

So, perhaps there's another constraint.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions greater than 1.

But in 6x3, 12x1 has one dimension equal to 1, which might not be allowed.

But the problem says "integer sides", which includes 1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle can be formed without rotating the pieces.

But the problem says "he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

So, rotation is allowed.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle can be formed by arranging the two pieces without rotating them.

But the problem says he can rotate them.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in 6x3, cutting into 6x1 and 6x2, and arranging them one on top of the other to get 12x1, but 12x1 cannot be considered different from 6x3 because 12 is a multiple of 6 and 1 is a divisor of 3.

Wait, that seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether a and b share a common divisor greater than 1.

In 2x6, GCD=2 → Yes

2x1, GCD=1 → No

2x6: GCD=2 → Yes

3x2: GCD=1 → Yes

2x2: GCD=2 → Yes

2x4: GCD=2 → Yes

6x3: GCD=3 → No

Wait, still not consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or at least one of them is even and greater than 2.

In 2x1: 2 is even, but the answer is No.

In 3x2: 2 is even, and 3 is odd, answer is Yes.

6x3: 6 is even, 3 is odd, answer is No.

So, perhaps if at least one is even and the other is odd, then it's Yes only if the even one is greater than the odd one.

In 3x2: 2 > 3? No, 2 < 3, but answer is Yes.

In 6x3: 6 > 3, but answer is No.

Wait, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on whether a and b are both divisible by the same even number.

In 2x6: both divisible by 2 → Yes

3x2: only 2 is divisible by 2 → Yes

2x1: 2 is divisible by 2, 1 is not → No

6x3: 6 is divisible by 2, 3 is not → No

But then, why is 3x2 Yes and 6x3 No?

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the even dimension is greater than the odd dimension.

In 3x2: 2 > 3? No, 2 < 3, but it's Yes.

In 6x3: 6 > 3, but it's No.

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether the even dimension is divisible by the odd dimension.

In 2x1: 2 is divisible by 1 → yes, but answer is No.

In 3x2: 2 is not divisible by 3, but answer is Yes.

In 6x3: 6 is divisible by 3 → yes, answer is No.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the even dimension is divisible by 2.

In all cases where at least one dimension is even, and it's divisible by 2, it's Yes, except when the other dimension is a multiple of the even dimension.

Wait, in 2x1: 2 is even, divisible by 2, but answer is No.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the ratio of a and b.

If a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is odd, but with certain conditions.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if a and b are not both odd, and a != b.

Wait, in the sample:

1x1: both odd → No

2x1: one even, one odd → No

2x6: both even → Yes

3x2: one even, one odd → Yes

2x2: both even → Yes

2x4: both even → Yes

6x3: one even, one odd → No

Hmm, doesn't fit perfectly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a and b are not co-prime.

In 2x6: GCD=2 → Yes

2x1: GCD=1 → No

3x2: GCD=1 → Yes

2x2: GCD=2 → Yes

2x4: GCD=2 → Yes

6x3: GCD=3 → No

So, when GCD >1, it's Yes, and when GCD=1, it's No, except in some cases.

But in 3x2, GCD=1, and it's Yes.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's that a*b is even.

In all Yes cases, a*b is even, and in No cases, a*b is odd.

But in the sample, 3x2 has a*b=6, even, and it's Yes.

6x3 has a*b=18, even, and it's No.

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 4.

But in 2x6, 2 is divisible by 2, 6 by 2, not by 4 → Yes

3x2: neither divisible by 4 → Yes

2x1: 2 divisible by 2, 1 not → No

6x3: 6 divisible by 2, 3 not → No

So, perhaps if at least one of a or b is divisible by 4.

But in 3x2, neither is divisible by 4, but it's Yes.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a and b are both odd or both even.

In the sample:

1x1: both odd → No

2x1: one even, one odd → No

2x6: both even → Yes

3x2: one even, one odd → Yes

2x2: both even → Yes

2x4: both even → Yes

6x3: one even, one odd → No

Hmm, perhaps if both are even, or if one is even and the other is odd and a certain condition is met.

But it's still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b have a common even divisor greater than 1.

In 2x6: GCD=2, which is even → Yes

2x1: GCD=1, but 2 is even → No

3x2: GCD=1, but 2 is even → Yes

2x2: GCD=2, even → Yes

2x4: GCD=2, even → Yes

6x3: GCD=3, odd → No

So, perhaps if there exists an even divisor greater than 1 for a and b, then Yes, else No.

But in 3x2, GCD=1, but 2 is even, and it's Yes.

Wait, perhaps if at least one of a or b is even, and the other is not a multiple of the GCD in a certain way.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should think in terms of possible cuts.

Let me consider that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of a or b is even, and the other is not a multiple of the first.

But in 2x1: 2 is even, 1 is not a multiple of 2 → No, but according to the sample, it's No.

Wait, perhaps it's more about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other is greater than 1.

In 2x1: 2 is even, but b=1, which is not greater than 1 → No

3x2: 2 is even, and 3 >1 → Yes

2x2: both even → Yes

2x4: both even → Yes

6x3: 6 is even, 3 >1 → but sample is No

Wait, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other is not divisible by the first.

In 2x1: 2 divisible by 2, but 1 is not divisible by 2 → No

3x2: 2 divisible by 2, 3 is not divisible by 2 → Yes

2x2: both divisible by 2 → Yes

2x4: both divisible by 2 → Yes

6x3: 6 divisible by 2, 3 is not divisible by 6 → No

So, perhaps if at least one of a or b is even, and the other is not a multiple of the first, then Yes.

In 3x2: 2 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 2 → Yes

6x3: 6 is even, 3 is a multiple of 3 (but 3 is not a multiple of 6) → No

Wait, 3 is not a multiple of 6, so it's No.

So, perhaps that's the condition.

Wait, but in 2x1: 2 is even, 1 is not a multiple of 2 → Yes, but sample is No.

Hmm, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other is greater than 1 and not equal to 1.

In 2x1: 2 divisible by 2, but b=1, which is not greater than 1 → No

3x2: 2 divisible by 2, and a=3 >1 → Yes

2x2: both divisible by 2 → Yes

2x4: both divisible by 2 → Yes

6x3: 6 divisible by 2, b=3 >1 → but sample is No

Still not consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other is not divisible by 2.

In 2x1: 2 divisible by 2, 1 not divisible by 2 → No

3x2: 2 divisible by 2, 3 not divisible by 2 → Yes

2x2: both divisible by 2 → Yes

2x4: both divisible by 2 → Yes

6x3: 6 divisible by 2, 3 not divisible by 2 → No

Hmm, that could be a pattern.

Yes in cases where at least one is divisible by 2 and the other is not divisible by 2, except when both are divisible by 2 and the non-divisible one is 1.

Wait, but in 2x1, 1 is not divisible by 2, and 2 is divisible by 2, but answer is No.

While in 3x2, 2 is divisible by 2, 3 is not, answer is Yes.

In 6x3, 6 is divisible by 2, 3 is not, answer is No.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition based on the values.

Wait, perhaps it's about
