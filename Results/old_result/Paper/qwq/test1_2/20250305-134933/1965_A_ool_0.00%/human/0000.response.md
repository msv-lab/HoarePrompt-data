Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, up to a_n. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k that is less than or equal to the smallest number of stones in any non-empty pile and removes k stones from each non-empty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

So, the key here is that on each turn, the same number of stones, k, is removed from every non-empty pile. This is different from games where stones are removed from only one pile per turn.

I need to determine, given the initial configuration of the piles, who will win the game if both players play optimally.

Given the constraints:

- t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4.

- n (the number of piles per test case) can be up to 2*10^5.

- a_i (the number of stones in each pile) can be up to 10^9.

- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

This suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n log n) per test case or better, considering the large input sizes.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a way to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

I recall that in impartial games like this, the concept of Nimbers or the mex function can be useful in determining the winner. However, the standard Nim game allows removing any number of stones from a single pile, but here, we're removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles.

This seems more similar to the game of Nim played in a parallel manner across all piles.

Wait, but that's not quite right. In standard Nim, players choose one pile and remove any number of stones from it. Here, the choice of k affects all piles simultaneously.

I need to find a way to model this game to determine the winning strategy.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty in one move. So, Alice wins.

Second test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 7]

Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has 1 stone), removes 1 from each pile, resulting in [0, 6]. Now, Bob chooses k up to 6 (the smallest non-zero pile), say k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, making it [0,0]. Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Third test case:

n=7

a=[1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

This seems more complex. Let's see.

Alice chooses k=1 (smallest pile has 1 stone), removes 1 from each pile:

Piles become [0,2,8,6,3,1,99]

Now, Bob chooses k up to 1 (the smallest non-zero pile), chooses k=1:

[0,1,7,5,2,0,98]

Alice chooses k=1 again:

[0,0,6,4,1,0,97]

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,5,3,0,0,96]

Alice chooses k=1:

[0,0,4,2,0,0,95]

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,3,1,0,0,94]

Alice chooses k=1:

[0,0,2,0,0,0,93]

Bob chooses k=1:

[0,0,1,0,0,0,92]

Alice chooses k=1:

[0,0,0,0,0,0,91]

Now, all piles are empty, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the example output, Alice wins this case, which matches what I just simulated.

But this seems time-consuming for large n and a_i. I need a better way.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider the number of times stones can be removed from the piles.

Each pile has a certain number of stones, and in each turn, the same number of stones are removed from all non-empty piles.

This seems similar to performing operations in parallel across all piles.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the maximum number of times stones can be removed before all piles become empty.

But I need to consider the interaction between the piles.

Let me consider sorting the piles in ascending order.

For example, in the first test case: [3,3,3,3,3] -> sorted [3,3,3,3,3]

In the second test case: [1,7] -> sorted [1,7]

In the third test case: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100] -> sorted [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Maybe sorting can help me find a pattern.

Let me consider the number of non-empty piles at each step.

In the first test case:

- Initial: 5 piles

- Alice removes k=3: all piles become empty

In the second test case:

- Initial: 2 piles

- Alice removes k=1: [0,6]

- Bob removes k=6: [0,0]

In the third test case:

- Initial: 7 piles

- Alice removes k=1: 6 piles remain (one becomes empty)

- Bob removes k=1: 5 piles remain

- Alice removes k=1: 4 piles remain

- Bob removes k=1: 3 piles remain

- Alice removes k=1: 2 piles remain

- Bob removes k=1: 1 pile remains

- Alice removes k=1: 0 piles remain

So, the number of non-empty piles decreases by the number of piles that become empty in each move.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of times we can reduce the piles until all are empty.

But I need to find a way to calculate the total number of moves possible and see who makes the last move.

Wait, but the game doesn't necessarily have a fixed number of moves; it depends on the choices of k at each step.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the mex function or Grundy numbers for this game.

In combinatorial game theory, the Grundy number for a position is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

If the Grundy number of the initial position is non-zero, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.

So, I need to find the Grundy number for the initial configuration of piles.

But with n up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

First, I need to find a way to model the game to compute its Grundy number.

Let me consider that the game can be seen as a selection of k to remove from all piles, where k is at most the smallest pile.

This is similar to a Nim game where each pile's size contributes to the overall game state.

But the standard Nim game has each pile considered separately, and the overall Grundy number is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of each pile.

However, in this game, moves affect all piles simultaneously, which is different.

I need to find a way to reduce this game to something more familiar.

Let me consider the sequence of possible k values that can be chosen.

Since k can be any integer from 1 up to the smallest non-empty pile, and this k is used to remove stones from all non-empty piles, the game progresses by reducing the piles in a parallel fashion.

Perhaps I can think of the piles after sorting in non-decreasing order.

Let's sort the piles: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Now, consider that in each move, we choose k <= a1 (the smallest non-empty pile), and subtract k from all ai > 0.

This operation is equivalent to setting all ai > 0 to ai - k.

This is similar to "parallel chip-firing" or other parallel move games.

I need to find a way to calculate the total number of moves or the game's Grundy number based on this.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula or pattern that can determine the winner based on the initial pile sizes.

Looking back at the example:

First test case: [3,3,3,3,3] -> Alice wins by choosing k=3.

Second test case: [1,7] -> Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=6, Bob wins.

Third test case: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100] -> Alice wins.

Looking for a pattern:

In the first test case, all piles are equal, so Alice can empty them all in one move.

In the second test case, piles are different, and Alice is forced to choose k=1, allowing Bob to make the last move.

In the third test case, Alice can make a series of moves leading to her winning.

I need a general strategy.

Let me consider the minimal excludant approach.

Define the mex of a set as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

The Grundy number of a game position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.

In this game, choosing k leads to a new configuration of piles, each reduced by k.

But with large n and a_i, computing this directly is infeasible.

I need to find a pattern or mathematical property that allows me to compute the winner efficiently.

Let me consider the number of times we can remove stones until all piles are empty.

But the problem is that the number of moves depends on the choices of k at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the differences between piles.

Let me consider sorting the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Now, consider the differences between consecutive piles: a2 - a1, a3 - a2, ..., an - a_{n-1}.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of piles that are greater than a certain value.

Let me consider the minimal pile.

In each move, k is at most a1 (the smallest pile), and we remove k from all piles.

This operation is equivalent to setting all piles greater than a1 to a1, and then removing k from all piles.

Wait, no.

Wait, after choosing k <= a1, we subtract k from all piles that are greater than 0.

So, the new piles are:

- For ai > 0, ai - k

- For ai == 0, remain 0

This is similar to cutting all piles to the height of the smallest pile and then removing k from them.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of unique non-zero pile sizes.

Let me consider the sorted piles: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

In each move, we choose k <= a1, subtract k from all ai > 0.

This operation reduces the smallest non-zero pile to a1 - k, which could become zero if a1 - k == 0.

So, the number of non-empty piles decreases by the number of piles that become empty in this move.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where the number of piles and their sizes matter.

But I need a way to compute the game's value efficiently.

Let me consider the binary representation of the pile sizes.

But given that a_i can be up to 1e9, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to group piles by their sizes and find a pattern.

Wait, maybe I can think of the game in terms of the mex of the pile sizes.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula or pattern.

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1: [3,3,3,3,3] -> Alice wins by choosing k=3.

Test case 2: [1,7] -> Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=6, Bob wins.

Test case 3: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100] -> Alice wins.

Looking for a pattern:

In the first test case, all piles are equal, so Alice can choose k equal to the pile size and win immediately.

In the second test case, piles are different, and Alice is forced to choose k=1, leading to Bob winning.

In the third test case, Alice can make a series of moves leading to her winning.

Perhaps the game can be won by Alice if the number of "independent" pile sizes is odd, and Bob wins if it's even.

But I need a more concrete idea.

Let me consider the minimal pile size.

If the minimal pile size is 1, then Alice must choose k=1, removing one stone from each pile, effectively reducing each pile by one.

This continues until all piles are empty.

In this case, the total number of moves is equal to the minimal pile size.

Wait, but in the second test case, minimal pile is 1, Alice chooses k=1, then Bob chooses k=6, removing 6 from the second pile, making it zero.

Then Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if the minimal pile is 1, and Alice chooses k=1, then the game continues.

But in this case, it seems that the player who makes the last move wins.

Wait, but in the standard definition, the player who can't make a move loses.

So, if all piles are empty, the player whose turn it is loses.

In the second test case:

- Alice chooses k=1: [0,6]

- Bob chooses k=6: [0,0]

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

In the first test case:

- Alice chooses k=3: [0,0,0,0,0]

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

In the third test case:

As simulated earlier, Alice wins.

I need to find a general rule.

Let me consider the number of times we can choose k=1.

In the second test case, Alice is forced to choose k=1, and then Bob chooses k=6, making all piles zero.

So, the number of times k=1 can be chosen might be relevant.

But I need a better approach.

Let me think about the game in terms of "stages".

Each time the minimal pile decreases, the game progresses to a new stage.

In each stage, k can be chosen up to the current minimal pile size.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of distinct minimal pile sizes.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that the game ends when all piles are empty.

Each move reduces the size of all non-empty piles by k.

So, the total number of moves is equal to the sum of pile sizes divided by the sum of k chosen in each move.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the mex approach again.

Define the Grundy number for the game.

The Grundy number for a position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

If I can find a way to compute the Grundy number for the initial position, I can determine the winner.

But with large n and a_i, I need an efficient way to compute it.

Perhaps there's a pattern based on the binary representation or some other property of the pile sizes.

Alternatively, maybe the game can be decomposed into smaller games that can be solved independently.

Wait, perhaps considering the piles in sorted order can help.

Let me sort the piles in non-decreasing order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Now, in each move, choose k <= a1, subtract k from all ai > 0.

This operation reduces a1 to a1 - k, which could become zero.

So, the number of non-empty piles decreases by the number of piles that become empty in this move.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game as a misère game, where the last move loses.

But in standard Nim, misère games are more complicated.

Wait, no, in standard Nim, misère games can be handled by considering the mex.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula.

I recall that in some games, the XOR of certain values determines the winner.

Maybe I can assign a value to each pile based on its size and then XOR them all together.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game as a Nim game where the piles are represented by the differences between consecutive sorted pile sizes.

Let me try that.

Take the third test case: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Sort them: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Compute differences between consecutive elements: 1,1,1,3,2,91

Then, XOR these differences: 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 2 XOR 91 = ?

Compute step by step:

1 XOR 1 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 3 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 91 = 91

So, the XOR is 91, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

In the second test case: [1,7]

Sorted: [1,7]

Differences: 6

XOR: 6, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

But according to the example, Bob wins in the second test case.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Hence, this idea doesn't hold.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider the number of piles that are greater than a certain value.

Let me define levels or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of times we can choose k=1.

But in the second test case, choosing k=1 leads to Bob winning.

In the third test case, choosing k=1 leads to Alice winning.

So, it's not consistent.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the game can be modeled as a Nim game where each pile's value is the number of times we can choose k=1 before that pile becomes zero.

But again, this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the minimal pile size as determining the number of moves.

In each move, k is chosen up to the minimal pile size, and then that pile becomes zero.

Wait, no, when you choose k, you subtract k from all non-empty piles.

So, the minimal pile size determines the maximum k you can choose.

After choosing k, all piles less than or equal to k become zero.

So, in each move, you're removing all piles that have a size <= k, and reducing the rest by k.

This seems similar to the game of Nim where you're removing entire piles based on their size.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the piles and then group them based on their size.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Now, in the first move, Alice chooses k <= a1, and removes k from all ai > 0.

After this move, the new piles are ai - k for ai > k, and 0 otherwise.

This is similar to cutting all piles to height k and then removing k from the remaining piles.

Wait, maybe I can think of the game in terms of the number of times we can make such cuts.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the minimal excludant again.

Perhaps I can think of the game as a combination of smaller games, each corresponding to a certain range of pile sizes.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the binary representation of the pile sizes.

But with a_i up to 1e9, this might not be practical.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the binary numbers and find a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the Grundy number based on the pile sizes.

Let me consider small pile sizes and try to compute the Grundy numbers manually.

Suppose n=1:

- a=[1]: Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 stone, piles become empty. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

- a=[2]: Alice chooses k=1 or 2.

  - If k=1: piles become [1], Bob chooses k=1, piles become [0], Alice can't move, Bob wins.

  - If k=2: piles become [0], Bob wins.

So, in both choices, Bob wins. So, Grundy number is 0.

Wait, but according to the definition, if all possible moves lead to a position where the opponent wins, then the Grundy number is 0.

Wait, in this case, for n=1, a=1: Alice wins.

For n=1, a=2: Bob wins.

Wait, maybe I need to consider more cases.

Let me make a table for n=1:

- a=1: Alice wins.

- a=2: Bob wins.

- a=3: Alice chooses k=1: piles become [2], Bob chooses k=1: piles become [1], Alice chooses k=1: piles become [0], Bob can't move, Alice wins.

  Alternatively, Alice chooses k=2: piles become [1], Bob chooses k=1: piles become [0], Alice can't move, Bob wins.

  So, Alice can choose to make Bob win or make herself win. So, the Grundy number is the mex of {0,1}, which is 2. But this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me recall that the Grundy number of a position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

In this case, for n=1, a=1:

- Alice chooses k=1: piles become [0], which is a losing position for Bob.

So, the Grundy number is mex{} = 0.

Wait, but Alice wins, so the Grundy number should be non-zero.

Wait, actually, in standard game theory, a position is a winning position if its Grundy number is non-zero, and a losing position if it's zero.

But in this case, for n=1, a=1:

- Alice moves to [0], which is a losing position for Bob.

So, the Grundy number is mex{0} = 1.

Hence, Alice wins.

For n=1, a=2:

- Alice can choose k=1: piles become [1], Grundy number 1.

- Alice can choose k=2: piles become [0], Grundy number 0.

So, the Grundy number for a=2 is mex{0,1} = 2.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, Bob wins in this case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the game as a misère game, but standard Nim is a normal play game.

Wait, no, in this problem, the player who can't make a move loses, which is standard normal play.

So, if the Grundy number is non-zero, the first player wins.

In the case of n=1, a=1:

- Grundy number 1 -> Alice wins.

In the case of n=1, a=2:

- Grundy number 2 -> Alice wins.

But according to my earlier manual simulation, for n=1, a=2, Bob wins.

This suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Grundy number for a=2.

For a=2:

- Choose k=1: piles become [1], Grundy number 1.

- Choose k=2: piles become [0], Grundy number 0.

So, the Grundy number for a=2 is mex{0,1} = 2, which is non-zero, meaning Alice should win.

But according to my manual simulation, Bob wins in this case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me simulate again:

n=1, a=2.

Alice chooses k=1: piles become [1].

Bob chooses k=1: piles become [0].

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Alice chooses k=2: piles become [0].

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, Alice can choose to make Bob win or make herself win.

In standard game theory, if a position has a move to a position with Grundy number 0, then the current position has a non-zero Grundy number, meaning it's a winning position.

In this case, for a=2, Alice can choose k=2 to make the piles [0], which is a losing position for Bob, so Alice should win.

But in the simulation, if Alice chooses k=1, Bob can win.

So, Alice can choose k=2 to win immediately.

Hence, Alice has a winning strategy.

But according to my earlier manual simulation, Bob wins when n=1, a=2.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the simulation.

Wait, no, if Alice chooses k=2, piles become [0], and Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

If Alice chooses k=1, piles become [1], Bob chooses k=1, piles become [0], Alice can't move, Bob wins.

So, Alice can choose to make herself win or make Bob win.

Hence, Alice has a winning move.

Therefore, for n=1, a=2, Alice wins.

But according to my earlier thought, in the second test case with n=2, a=[1,7], Bob wins.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the game is more complex than a single Nim game.

Let me consider that with multiple piles, the game might be equivalent to a Nim game with certain pile values.

But I need to find a way to assign values to the piles such that the overall Grundy number is the XOR of these values.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to group the piles based on their sizes and find a pattern.

Given the time constraints, I need to find an efficient way to compute the winner.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to sort the piles and then check certain conditions based on the sorted pile sizes.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Looking at the provided code:

def func_1(arr):

A = False

if arr[0] != 1:

return 'Alice'

set_ = list(set(arr))

set_.sort()

not_c = True

for i in range(1, len(set_)):

if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:

not_c = False

break

A = not A

if not_c:

A = not A

return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'

This code first checks if the smallest pile is not 1, in which case it immediately returns 'Alice'.

Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes and checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are exactly 1.

If they are, it sets A to not A for each step, and finally toggles A if the differences are all 1, and returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

This seems overly complicated and not based on solid game theory principles.

Given that, I suspect this code might not be correct.

But to confirm, let's check it against the example test cases.

First test case:

n=5, a=[3,3,3,3,3]

sorted unique a: [3]

arr[0]=3 !=1, so return 'Alice' correctly.

Second test case:

n=2, a=[1,7]

arr[0]=1 ==1, so proceed.

set_=[1,7]

sorted: [1,7]

i=1, 7-1=6 >1, so not_c=False

A = not A -> A=True

if not_c: A=not A -> but not_c is False, so no change

return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob' -> 'Alice', but according to the example, Bob wins.

Hence, the code is incorrect for the second test case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
