Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper that starts at the top-left cell (1,1) and wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can form a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when comparing them character by character. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in trying to find the smallest string, I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Now, let's think about how the grasshopper can move. From any cell, it can move right to the next cell in the same row or down to the cell below it (if it's not in the bottom row). So, from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1). From (1,2), it can go to (1,3) or (2,2), and so on. Similarly, from (2,j), it can only move right to (2,j+1).

I need to consider all possible paths from (1,1) to (2,N) and find the path that gives the smallest binary string. Then, among all paths that give this smallest string, I need to count how many there are.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I can keep track of the current position and the string formed so far, but that might be inefficient for large N, since N can be up to 2*10^5, and T can be up to 10^4, with the sum of N over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it.

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's only two rows, so it's like:

Row 1: a11 a12 a13 ... a1n

Row 2: a21 a22 a23 ... a2n

The grasshopper starts at a11 and needs to end at a2n, moving only right or down.

A path can be represented by a sequence of moves: right (R) and down (D). Since it starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), it needs to make exactly one down move to go from row 1 to row 2, and the rest are right moves.

Wait, no. It can make multiple down moves, but given that there are only two rows, the down move is only possible when moving from row 1 to row 2 at the same column, or from row 2 to row 2, which isn't possible since it's already in the bottom row.

Actually, correction: from any cell in row 1, it can move right to the next cell in row 1 or down to the cell in row 2 of the same column. From row 2, it can only move right to the next cell in row 2.

So, the path consists of a sequence of moves where the grasshopper starts in row 1, can switch to row 2 at any column by moving down, and then continues only to the right in row 2 until column N.

Wait, no. If it moves down to row 2 at some column, it can't move up again. So, it can switch from row 1 to row 2 at any column, but once it's in row 2, it can only move right.

Therefore, the path can be described by the column where it decides to move down from row 1 to row 2, if at all. Wait, but it must end at (2,N), so it has to move down to row 2 at some column, and then continue right to column N.

Wait, actually, it must end in row 2, column N. So, it has to be in row 2 when it reaches column N.

But it can be in row 1 or row 2 at any column from 1 to N-1, but must be in row 2 at column N.

So, to formalize, the grasshopper starts at (1,1), and at each step, it can either move right within its current row, or if it's in row 1, it can move down to row 2 in the same column, and then continue moving right in row 2.

Therefore, the path can be characterized by the columns where it chooses to move down from row 1 to row 2.

But since it must end in row 2, column N, it must have moved down to row 2 at some column, and then moved right to column N.

Wait, but it can move down at any column from 1 to N, and then move right to column N.

Alternatively, it can stay in row 1 up to some column, then move down to row 2 at that column, and then move right to column N.

So, the path is defined by the column where it moves down from row 1 to row 2, if it chooses to move down at all.

Wait, but it must end in row 2, so it must move down at some point.

Unless N=1, but in this problem, N >= 2.

So, for N >= 2, it must move down at some column from 1 to N.

Therefore, the possible paths are:

- Move down at column 1, then move right to column N.

- Move right in row 1 to column 2, then move down to row 2, column 2, then right to column N.

- Move right in row 1 to column 3, then move down to row 2, column 3, then right to column N.

- ...

- Move right in row 1 to column N, then move down to row 2, column N.

So, there are N possible down moves, at columns 1 to N.

Each path corresponds to choosing one column to move down from row 1 to row 2, and then moving right to column N in row 2.

Therefore, there are N possible paths.

But actually, no. For example, if it moves down at column k, then the path is:

- From (1,1) to (1,2) to ... to (1,k), then down to (2,k), then right to (2,k+1), ..., to (2,N).

So, for each k from 1 to N, there is one path that moves down at column k.

Hence, there are N possible paths.

But in reality, the number of paths is more than that because between columns, there might be multiple ways to arrange the moves.

Wait, no. Given the movement constraints, for each k from 1 to N, there is exactly one path that involves moving down at column k.

Therefore, there are N possible paths.

But in the first test case, it says that for N=2, with both rows being "00", the lexicographically smallest string is "000", and there are two paths that yield this string.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, there should be N=2 paths.

Let's see what those paths are.

Path 1: Move down at column 1:

- (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

String: a11, a21, a22 => 0,0,0 => "000"

Path 2: Move down at column 2:

- (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

String: a11, a12, a22 => 0,0,0 => "000"

So, both paths give the same string "000".

Hence, there are indeed two paths that give the same string.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, each k from 1 to N corresponds to one path, but in this case, both paths give the same string.

So, to find the lexicographically smallest string, I need to consider all possible paths and find the smallest among them.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5, and T up to 10^4, with sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

I need to find a way to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it without enumerating all paths, which would be too slow.

Let me think about how to construct the smallest string.

I need to choose the path that gives the smallest possible string when reading the cells in order.

Given that the grasshopper starts at (1,1), and must end at (2,N), and can only move right or down (from row 1 to row 2 in the same column), I need to decide at which column to move down from row 1 to row 2 to minimize the string.

Wait, but as in the first test case, it seems that moving down at different columns can lead to the same string.

But in general, different down columns can lead to different strings.

Wait, in the first test case, both down columns lead to the same string because all cells are 0.

But in the second test case, N=4, with s1=1101 and s2=1100.

Let's see:

Possible paths:

- Down at column 1: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s11, s21, s22, s23, s24 => 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

- Down at column 2: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s11, s12, s22, s23, s24 => 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

- Down at column 3: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s11, s12, s13, s23, s24 => 1,1,0,0,0 => "11000"

- Down at column 4: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4)

String: s11, s12, s13, s14, s24 => 1,1,0,1,0 => "11010"

Among these, the lexicographically smallest string is "11000".

And there is only one path that gives this string: down at column 3.

So, in this case, choosing the down column carefully affects the string.

So, to generalize, I need to choose the down column in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.

How can I find this down column?

Wait, but it's not just about choosing one down column; it's about choosing when to switch from row 1 to row 2 to minimize the string.

I need a way to decide the optimal path.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building the string step by step, always choosing the smallest available character at each step.

In other words, at each step, I choose the path that allows me to append the smallest possible character to the string so far.

Given that the grasshopper can be in either row 1 or row 2 at each column, I need to keep track of its position and choose the next move accordingly.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider that at each column j from 1 to N, the grasshopper can be in either row 1 or row 2.

If it's in row 1 at column j, it can:

- Move right to row 1, column j+1.

- Move down to row 2, column j.

If it's in row 2 at column j, it can only move right to row 2, column j+1.

The grasshopper starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N).

I need to build the string by appending the value of each cell as it's visited.

To find the lex smallest string, at each step, I should choose the move that leads to the smallest possible character being appended next.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach would work here.

In a greedy approach, at each step, I choose the option that looks best at the moment.

So, starting at (1,1), I have two choices:

- Move right to (1,2), appending s12.

- Move down to (2,1), appending s21.

I should choose the one that appends the smaller character.

If s12 < s21, then move right; else, move down.

Wait, but in the first test case, s1 = "00", s2 = "00", so s12 = '0', s21 = '0', they are equal, so which one to choose?

In case of a tie, I need to look ahead to see which path leads to a smaller string.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need a more systematic way.

Let me consider that the string is built by the cells in order: starting from the starting cell, then the next cell based on the move, and so on, until reaching the end cell.

I need to choose the path such that the concatenation of the cell values in order is lex smallest.

I recall that in some pathfinding problems, we can use a priority queue to always expand the path that is currently the smallest.

But with N up to 2*10^5, that would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the path can be represented by the column where the grasshopper moves down from row 1 to row 2.

Once it moves down, it continues only to the right in row 2.

So, for each possible down column k from 1 to N, the string is:

- s11, s12, ..., s1(k-1), s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Wait, no.

Wait, if it moves down at column k, the path is:

- From (1,1) to (1,2) to ... to (1,k), then down to (2,k), then right to (2,k+1), ..., to (2,N).

So, the string is: s11, s12, ..., s1k, s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first step, it moves from (1,1) to (1,2), appending s12.

Then, from (1,2) to (1,3), appending s13.

...

Then, at column k, it moves down to (2,k), appending s2k.

Then, from (2,k) to (2,k+1), appending s2(k+1), and so on, until (2,N).

Wait, no.

Wait, in the path, the cells are visited in order:

(1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,k), (2,k), (2,k+1), ..., (2,N)

So, the string is: s11, s12, ..., s1k, s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Wait, but in the first test case, with N=2, s1="00", s2="00", and down at k=1:

String: s11, s21, s22 => 0,0,0 => "000"

Down at k=2:

String: s11, s12, s22 => 0,0,0 => "000"

Similarly, in the second test case, N=4:

Down at k=1: s11, s21, s22, s23, s24 => 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

Down at k=2: s11, s12, s22, s23, s24 => 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

Down at k=3: s11, s12, s13, s23, s24 => 1,1,0,0,0 => "11000"

Down at k=4: s11, s12, s13, s14, s24 => 1,1,0,1,0 => "11010"

So, indeed, the string for each k is:

s11, s12, ..., s1k, s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Wait, but in the first test case, for k=1: s11, s21, s22

For k=2: s11, s12, s22

Wait, that's not matching the general pattern.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the string is built by the cells in the order they are visited.

In the path where down is at column k:

- From (1,1) to (1,2) to ... to (1,k), then down to (2,k), then right to (2,k+1), ..., to (2,N).

So, the string is: s11, s12, ..., s1k, s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Wait, but in the first test case, for k=1: s11, s21, s22

For k=2: s11, s12, s22

So, it seems that in general, the string is s11, s12, ..., s1k, s2k, s2(k+1), ..., s2N

Hence, to find the lex smallest string, I need to find the k that minimizes the string s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

To find the smallest such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and find the minimum among these strings.

But with N up to 2*10^5, and T up to 10^4, with sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(N) per test case solution.

Is there a way to find the smallest string among these options in linear time?

Let me consider that for each k from 1 to N, the string is:

s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

I need to find the minimum among these strings.

To find the lex smallest string, I can compare these strings position by position.

I need to find the path where, at the first position where paths differ, the character is smaller.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step which path leads to the smallest string.

Wait, maybe I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the current position and the current string prefix.

But that might be too slow for large N.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to build the smallest string step by step.

At each step, I choose the smallest available character that can be appended to the current string based on the possible moves.

Starting at (1,1), I have two options:

- Move right to (1,2), appending s12.

- Move down to (2,1), appending s21.

I should choose the smaller of s12 and s21.

If s12 < s21, choose to move right; if s21 < s12, choose to move down; if equal, consider the next steps.

Wait, but in the first test case, s12 = s21 = '0', so they are equal, and I need to look ahead.

So, in case of a tie, I need to look at the next possible moves to decide which path leads to a smaller string.

This seems like a standard lex smallest path problem in a grid with specific movement constraints.

I recall that in such problems, we can simulate the path by always choosing the smallest possible option at each step, breaking ties by looking ahead.

But given the constraints, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider implementing a two-pointer approach or some kind of state machine that keeps track of the current row and the current column, always choosing the move that leads to the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current row, choosing at each step whether to stay in the current row or move down, based on which choice leads to a smaller string.

But I need to think carefully about how to implement this efficiently.

Let me consider that at each column, I have a current row, and I can choose to stay in the current row and move right, or if I'm in row 1, move down to row 2.

I need to choose the option that leads to the smallest string.

So, for each column, I can compare the option of staying in the current row versus moving down (if possible), and choose the one that gives the smallest next character.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a current path and build the string accordingly.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently.

Let me look at the sample input and output to understand better.

Sample Input:

3

2

00

00

4

1101

1100

8

00100111

11101101

Sample Output:

000

2

11000

1

001001101

4

So, for N=2, s1=00, s2=00, the smallest string is 000, and there are 2 paths that give this string.

For N=4, s1=1101, s2=1100, the smallest string is 11000, and there is 1 path.

For N=8, s1=00100111, s2=11101101, the smallest string is 001001101, with 4 paths.

So, in the first test case, both paths give the same string, which is "000".

In the second test case, among the four possible paths, only one gives the smallest string "11000".

In the third test case, four paths give the smallest string "001001101".

So, I need a way to find the smallest possible string and count how many paths lead to it.

I need to find an efficient way to do this without enumerating all paths.

Let me consider that the string is built by choosing, at each step, the smallest possible character that can be appended, given the movement constraints.

I can simulate this process column by column.

Let me initialize the starting position at row 1, column 1.

At each step, I have to decide whether to move right in the current row or, if in row 1, to move down to row 2.

I need to choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

To do this, I need to look at the next character that would be appended by each possible move and choose the smallest one.

If both moves append the same character, I need to look further ahead to decide.

But looking ahead too many steps would be inefficient.

Is there a way to determine, for each column, which move leads to the smallest string without looking too far ahead?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible down column k, the string that would be produced, and then find the minimum among them.

But with N up to 2*10^5, that would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider merging the two rows in a way that allows me to build the smallest string.

I can think of it as zipping the two rows together, choosing the smallest available character at each step.

But I need to ensure that the path respects the movement constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, keeping track of the current row, and always choosing to stay in the current row or move down to row 2, whichever leads to the smallest string.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- current row = 1

- current column = 1

- result string = ""

- path count = 0

Then, for each column from 1 to N:

- If current row is 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append s1j

- Option 2: move down to row 2, append s2j

- Choose the option with the smaller character.

- If both are equal, choose the one that leads to the smallest string in the subsequent columns.

- Append the chosen character to the result string.

- Update the current row based on the chosen option.

- Continue to the next column.

But again, choosing between options when they are equal requires looking ahead.

To handle this efficiently, perhaps I can find the first column where s1j != s2j, and base my decision on that.

Wait, but it's more nuanced than that.

Let me consider that, for a given current row and column, I can simulate the path by always choosing the smallest possible character at each step.

But I need to do this efficiently without simulating each path separately.

An alternative approach is to find the path that minimizes the string by greedily choosing the smallest available character at each step, considering the movement constraints.

To implement this, I can maintain the current row and, for each column, decide whether to stay in the current row or move down (if possible), choosing the option that leads to the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue to always expand the path that has the smallest string so far.

But with N up to 2*10^5, a priority queue would be too slow.

I need something smarter.

Let me consider that, at any point, the grasshopper is in some row and column, and I need to choose the next move that leads to the smallest string.

I can think of this as a shortest path problem where the "distance" is the lex order of the string.

But implementing that directly would be inefficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the down column k, i.e., the column where I move down from row 1 to row 2.

Then, the string is s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

I need to find k that minimizes this string.

To find the minimal string among these options, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and find the minimal string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, iterating through all k and comparing the strings would be too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal string among these options in linear time.

Let me consider that the strings for different k overlap a lot.

In particular, for k from 1 to N, the strings share many prefixes.

Perhaps I can find a way to compare them efficiently using suffixes or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by considering the point where the strings differ.

Let me consider that for k from 1 to N, the strings are:

- For k=1: s11 s21 s22 ... s2N

- For k=2: s11 s12 s22 s23 ... s2N

- For k=3: s11 s12 s13 s23 s24 ... s2N

- ...

- For k=N: s11 s12 ... s1N s2N

I need to find the minimal string among these.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through the positions and find the smallest character at each position across all possible k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that, for position 1, the character is always s11, since all paths start at (1,1).

For position 2, the character can be either s12 (if staying in row 1) or s21 (if moving down at column 1).

I need to choose the smaller one.

If s12 < s21, then choose s12, meaning stay in row 1.

If s21 < s12, choose s21, meaning move down at column 1.

If s12 == s21, I need to look ahead to decide.

Wait, this seems similar to merging two strings with some constraints.

Let me consider that I have two possible paths:

- Path A: staying in row 1 as long as possible.

- Path B: moving down to row 2 at some column.

I need to choose the path that gives the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as merging the two rows, choosing at each step the smallest available character, considering the movement constraints.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some string problems, we can use the concept of the smallest rotation or the smallest substring, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Let me consider that the smallest string will be the one that has the smallest possible characters as early as possible in the string.

So, I need to arrange the path such that the smallest characters are appended first.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row 1 or move down to row 2 to get the smallest possible character at the current position.

Wait, perhaps I can use a pointer to track the current row.

Let me try to implement a simulation:

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- result_string = []

- path_count = 0

For each column j from 1 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append s1j, next_row = 1

- Option 2: move down to row 2, append s2j, next_row = 2

- Choose the option with the smaller character.

- If both are equal, choose the one that leads to the smaller string in the subsequent columns.

- Append the chosen character to result_string.

- Set current_row to next_row.

- If current_row == 2:

- Append s2j to result_string.

- Continue to the next column.

But again, choosing between options when they are equal requires looking ahead, which is tricky.

Let me consider that, when s1j == s2j, I need to look at the next columns to decide which path leads to a smaller string.

This seems too time-consuming for large N.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that, for k from 1 to N, the string is s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

I can think of this as the concatenation of prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2, starting from some column k.

So, to find the minimal string, I need to find the k that minimizes s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and find the minimal among these strings.

But with N up to 2*10^5, comparing strings directly would be inefficient.

I need a way to compare these strings efficiently.

Let me consider that all these strings share prefixes and suffixes.

Perhaps I can find a way to compare them based on their differences.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- result_string = []

- path_count = 0

For j from 1 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option A: stay in row 1, append s1j

- Option B: move down to row 2, append s2j, and from now on, all subsequent characters are s2(j) s2(j+1) ... s2N

- Choose the option that leads to the smallest string.

- If s1j < s2j:

- Choose Option A: stay in row 1, append s1j

- Else if s2j < s1j:

- Choose Option B: move down to row 2, append s2j, and set current_row = 2

- Else if s1j == s2j:

- Need to look ahead to decide.

- In this case, I need to compare the rest of the strings if I choose to stay in row 1 versus moving down.

- To do this efficiently, perhaps I can find the first position where s1 and s2 differ starting from the current column.

- If s1 differs first with a smaller character, choose to stay in row 1; otherwise, choose to move down.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me consider that, when s1j == s2j, I need to find the next column m > j where s1m != s2m, and based on which row has the smaller character at that position, decide whether to stay in row 1 or move down.

This way, I can decide at each step without having to simulate the entire path.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- result_string = []

- path_count = 0

For j from 1 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

- If s1j < s2j:

- Choose to stay in row 1:

- Append s1j to result_string

- Set current_row = 1

- Elif s2j < s1j:

- Choose to move down to row 2:

- Append s2j to result_string

- Set current_row = 2

- Else if s1j == s2j:

- Find the next column m > j where s1m != s2m

- If such m exists:

- If s1m < s2m:

- Choose to stay in row 1:

- Append s1j to result_string

- Set current_row = 1

- Else:

- Choose to move down to row 2:

- Append s2j to result_string

- Set current_row = 2

- Else (all remaining s1m == s2m):

- Choose the option that leads to the smallest string.

- Since s1m == s2m for all m > j, it doesn't matter which path I choose; the strings will be equal.

- In this case, I can choose either, but to minimize the string, I can choose to stay in row 1 or move down; it won't affect the string.

- For simplicity, choose to stay in row 1.

- Else if current_row == 2:

- Append s2j to result_string

This way, I can decide at each step which path to take based on the current and future characters.

To implement this efficiently, I need a way to quickly find the next column where s1 and s2 differ.

I can precompute for each column j the next column where s1 and s2 differ.

Let me precompute an array next_diff[j], which stores the smallest m > j where s1m != s2m, or m = N+1 if s1m == s2m for all m > j.

I can compute this array in O(N) time for each test case.

With this array, at each column j, if current_row == 1:

- If s1j < s2j:

- Choose to stay in row 1

- Append s1j to result_string

- Set current_row = 1

- Elif s2j < s1j:

- Choose to move down to row 2

- Append s2j to result_string

- Set current_row = 2

- Else if s1j == s2j:

- Look at next_diff[j]

- If next_diff[j] == N+1:

- Choose either; since all remaining characters are equal, the strings will be equal.

- For simplicity, choose to stay in row 1.

- Else:

- m = next_diff[j]

- If s1m < s2m:

- Choose to stay in row 1

- Append s1j to result_string

- Set current_row = 1

- Else:

- Choose to move down to row 2

- Append s2j to result_string

- Set current_row = 2

- Else if current_row == 2:

- Append s2j to result_string

This way, I can build the smallest string in O(N) time per test case.

Now, for counting the number of paths that produce this smallest string, I need to find how many down columns k lead to this minimal string.

Given that, for each k from 1 to N, the string is s11 s12 ... s1k s2k s2(k+1) ... s2N

I need to count how many k produce the minimal string.

But with N up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, with sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to count this.

One way is, after finding the minimal string, to iterate through all k from 1 to N and check if the string for that k matches the minimal string.

But this would be O(N^2) in total, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

An alternative is to find the range of k that produce the minimal string.

Given that the strings for different k can be compared, perhaps there is a way to find the minimal string and the range of k that produce it.

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps after finding the minimal string, I can find the range of k where the string for that k is equal to the minimal string.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to compare the string for each k to the minimal string without iterating through all k.

Given that the strings share many prefixes, perhaps I can use some string matching algorithm.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that, once I have the minimal string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and check if the string for that k equals the minimal string.

But with N up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, this would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that, after building the minimal string using the above method, I can reconstruct the set of k that lead to this string.

Given that, in the simulation, I choose at each
