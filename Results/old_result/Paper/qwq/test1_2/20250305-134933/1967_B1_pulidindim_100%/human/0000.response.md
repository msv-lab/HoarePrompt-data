Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b times the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's denote GCD(a, b) as g. So, the condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * g.

Since g divides both a and b, we can write a = g * a' and b = g * b', where a' and b' are integers that are co-prime (their GCD is 1).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = g * a' + g * b' = g * (a' + b')

And b * g = g * b'

So, the condition becomes: g * (a' + b') should be divisible by g * b'.

Since g is non-zero, we can divide both sides by g, which simplifies to:

a' + b' should be divisible by b'.

So, a' + b' ≡ 0 mod b'

Which means a' ≡ -b' mod b'

But since a' and b' are co-prime, and b' divides a', because a' ≡ -b' mod b', which is just a' ≡ 0 mod b', but that would imply b' divides a', but since a' and b' are co-prime, b' can only be 1.

Wait, that seems off. If b' divides a', and a' and b' are co-prime, then b' must be 1.

So, b' = 1.

Which means b = g * 1 = g.

And a = g * a', where a' is co-prime with b' = 1, so a' can be any integer.

But b = g, and since g divides a, a must be a multiple of g.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try another approach.

Let's consider the condition again: a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Let’s denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, a = d * a' and b = d * b', where GCD(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * a' + d * b' is divisible by d * b' * d.

Wait, no. b * d = d * b', but d is GCD(a, b), which is d itself.

Wait, no, b = d * b', so b * d = d * b' * d = d^2 * b'.

But a + b = d * a' + d * b' = d * (a' + b').

So, the condition is that d * (a' + b') is divisible by d * b'.

Since d is non-zero, we can divide both sides by d:

a' + b' is divisible by b'.

But a' and b' are co-prime.

So, a' + b' ≡ 0 mod b'

Which implies a' ≡ -b' mod b'

But since a' and b' are co-prime, and b' divides a', which would mean b' = 1.

Wait, if b' divides a', and GCD(a', b') = 1, then b' must be 1.

Therefore, b' = 1, which means b = d * 1 = d.

So, b = d, and a = d * a', where a' is any integer co-prime with b'.

Since b' = 1, a' can be any integer, because GCD(a', 1) = 1.

Therefore, for each b that is equal to d, and a is a multiple of d, we have valid pairs.

But d is GCD(a, b), and since b = d, and a is a multiple of d, a can be any multiple of d up to n.

Wait, b = d, and a is a multiple of d up to n.

So, for each b = d, a can be d, 2d, 3d, ..., up to floor(n/d) * d, as long as it's ≤ n.

But d = b, so a can be b, 2b, 3b, ..., up to floor(n/b) * b, as long as it's ≤ n.

But we also have 1 ≤ b ≤ m.

So, for each b from 1 to m, and for each a that is a multiple of b, up to n, provided that b divides a.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we saw that b must be equal to d, which is GCD(a, b).

But since b divides a, and d divides b, and d = b, then b divides a, and b divides itself, so d = b.

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, and for each a that is a multiple of b up to n, these pairs (a, b) satisfy the condition.

Wait, but is that all? In the earlier analysis, it seemed like b must be equal to GCD(a, b), which is only true if b divides a and b = d.

But in this case, since b divides a, and d = b, it seems consistent.

Therefore, the number of valid pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of pairs where b divides a, and b = GCD(a, b), which is true whenever b divides a.

Wait, but in general, if b divides a, then GCD(a, b) = b, so the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the number of valid pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of pairs where b divides a, with 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m.

But in our earlier analysis, it seemed like there were some constraints, but it appears that whenever b divides a, the condition is satisfied.

Wait, but in the example given, for n=10 and m=8, the valid pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

Which are exactly the pairs where b divides a.

Yes, that matches.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b divides a.

This is a standard problem in number theory.

To compute this efficiently, especially given the constraints (t up to 10^4, n and m up to 2*10^6, with the sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^6), we need an efficient way to calculate the number of such pairs.

A naive approach would be, for each b from 1 to m, count how many a in 1 to n are divisible by b. This would be floor(n / b).

So, for each b from 1 to m, add floor(n / b) to the answer.

But with t up to 10^4 and n, m up to 2*10^6, this would be too slow if done naively for each test case separately.

Therefore, we need a more optimized approach.

One way to optimize is to iterate over b in a smarter way, perhaps by iterating over possible values of b and computing the number of a's divisible by b in a more efficient manner.

Another optimization is to iterate over b in chunks where floor(n / b) is the same.

This is similar to the "harmonic part" or "divisor grouping" technique, where for a given n, the number of distinct values of floor(n / b) is O(sqrt(n)), and we can group b's that have the same floor(n / b) value.

However, given that t can be up to 10^4 and n and m up to 2*10^6, with the sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^6, we need to be careful.

Wait, the problem says that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^6, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^6.

Therefore, if we process each test case separately, and for each test case iterate up to m, adding floor(n / b), this would be acceptable because the total sum over all test cases is bounded.

But still, for large m and n, we can optimize the computation by reducing the number of operations per test case.

Let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

count = 2

ans = n

while count <= m:

countmins = int(count - 1)

g = int(n / count)

if g < countmins:

break

g -= countmins

ans += int(g / count) + 1

count += 1

print(int(ans))

}

So, for each test case, it reads n and m, initializes count to 2, ans to n, and then enters a loop while count <= m.

In each iteration, it computes countmins = count - 1, g = floor(n / count), checks if g < countmins, and if so, breaks.

Then, g -= countmins, and ans += floor(g / count) + 1, and count is incremented.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, this seems different from the straightforward approach of summing floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

Let's see what's happening here.

First, it initializes ans to n, which might correspond to b=1, since floor(n / 1) = n.

Then, it starts a loop from count=2 to m.

In each iteration, it computes countmins = count - 1, which is b' = b - 1.

Then, g = floor(n / count).

If g < countmins, it breaks.

Else, g -= countmins, and ans += floor(g / count) + 1.

This seems like an attempt to group b's that have the same floor(n / b), but it's not clear.

Let me try to see what this is doing.

Take an example: n=10, m=8.

Initialize ans=10.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(10/2)=5.

5 >=1, so g -=1 → g=4.

ans += floor(4/2) +1 = 2 +1 =3.

ans=10+3=13.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(10/3)=3.

3 >=2, so g -=2 → g=1.

ans += floor(1/3)+1 =0 +1=1.

ans=13+1=14.

count=4.

countmins=3.

g=floor(10/4)=2.

2 <3, so break.

Print ans=14.

But according to the sample input, for n=10, m=8, the answer is 14.

So, it seems correct in this case.

Let me try another sample.

n=3, m=5.

Initialize ans=3.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(3/2)=1.

1 >=1, g -=1 → g=0.

ans += floor(0/2)+1=0+1=1.

ans=3+1=4.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(3/3)=1.

1 >=2? No, break.

Print ans=4.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample: n=1, m=1.

ans=1.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(1/2)=0.

0 <1, so break.

Print ans=1.

Correct.

Seems like it's working.

But I need to understand why this works.

Let's try to reverse-engineer this approach.

It seems that the standard way would be to iterate b from 1 to m and add floor(n / b).

But this program is doing something different.

It starts with ans = n, which might be floor(n / 1).

Then, it iterates count from 2 to m.

In each step, it computes countmins = count -1.

g = floor(n / count).

If g < countmins, it breaks.

Else, g -= countmins.

ans += floor(g / count) +1.

Count is incremented until m.

I need to see what this achieves.

Let’s think about the standard approach: sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

The given program seems to be trying to group terms where floor(n / b) is the same.

In the standard optimized approach, we group b's that have the same floor(n / b), and for each group, compute the number of b's in that group and multiply by the floor value.

But in this program, it seems to be incrementing count one by one, and adjusting g in some way.

I'm not fully following the logic here.

Let me try to see what g represents.

g = floor(n / count).

Then, if g < count -1, break.

Else, g -= count -1.

ans += floor(g / count) +1.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to compute the number of b's for which floor(n / b) is equal to some value.

Let’s consider that.

In the standard approach, for a given n, the number of distinct floor(n / b) values is O(sqrt(n)), because floor(n / b) changes only when b crosses a multiple of n's factors.

But in this program, it's iterating b from 2 to m, and for each b, computing floor(n / b), and conditionally adding something to ans.

It's not clear to me why this works, but the sample inputs seem to suggest that it does.

Perhaps there's a mathematical optimization being applied here that I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different interpretation.

Wait, going back to the original problem.

We need to count pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

From earlier analysis, this is equivalent to counting pairs where b divides a.

Therefore, the number of such pairs is sum over b=1 to m of floor(n / b).

So, the standard approach is to compute sum_{b=1}^m floor(n / b).

Now, the given program seems to compute this sum in a different way.

It starts with ans = n, which is floor(n / 1).

Then, it iterates count from 2 to m.

In each iteration, it computes countmins = count -1.

g = floor(n / count).

If g < count -1, it breaks.

Else, g -= count -1.

ans += floor(g / count) +1.

I need to see how this relates to sum_{b=2}^m floor(n / b).

Let’s try to see what floor(g / count) +1 represents.

g = floor(n / count).

g -= count -1 → g = floor(n / count) - (count -1).

Then, floor(g / count) +1 = floor( (floor(n / count) - (count -1)) / count ) +1.

This seems convoluted.

Perhaps there's a better way to think about it.

Let’s consider that for each b from 2 to m, floor(n / b) is being added to ans.

But in this program, it's not directly adding floor(n / b), but doing some manipulation.

Alternatively, maybe it's grouping b's that have similar floor(n / b) values.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take n=10, m=8.

ans = 10.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(10/2)=5.

5 >=1, so g=5-1=4.

ans += floor(4/2)+1=2+1=3.

ans=13.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(10/3)=3.

3 >=2, g=3-2=1.

ans += floor(1/3)+1=0+1=1.

ans=14.

count=4.

countmins=3.

g=floor(10/4)=2.

2 <3, break.

Total ans=14.

Which matches the sample.

Similarly, for n=3, m=5.

ans=3.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(3/2)=1.

1 >=1, g=1-1=0.

ans += floor(0/2)+1=0+1=1.

ans=4.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(3/3)=1.

1 <2, break.

Total ans=4.

Again matches the sample.

So, it seems to be working correctly.

But I still don't understand why this works.

Let me try to see what floor(g / count) +1 represents.

In the first iteration for n=10, m=8:

floor(4/2)+1=3.

Which corresponds to floor(n / b) for b=2.

But 4/2=2, +1=3.

Wait, but floor(10/2)=5, which is being added partially.

I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is incorrect, but the samples match by coincidence.

But the samples seem to match correctly.

Wait, maybe I need to test another example to verify.

Let’s take n=5, m=5.

Standard approach: sum floor(5 / b) for b=1 to 5.

b=1:5, b=2:2, b=3:1, b=4:1, b=5:1.

Total=5+2+1+1+1=10.

Now, according to the program:

ans=5.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(5/2)=2.

2 >=1, g=2-1=1.

ans += floor(1/2)+1=0+1=1.

ans=6.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(5/3)=1.

1 >=2? No, break.

Total ans=6.

But according to the standard approach, it should be 10.

Wait, that's different.

So, for n=5, m=5, the program outputs 6, but the correct answer is 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it seemed correct.

Wait, in the first sample, n=1, m=1, ans=1, which is correct.

Second sample, n=2, m=3.

Sum floor(2 / b) for b=1 to 3: 2 +1 +0 =3.

Program: ans=2.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(2/2)=1.

1 >=1, g=1-1=0.

ans += floor(0/2)+1=0+1=1.

ans=3.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(2/3)=0.

0 <2, break.

Total ans=3.

Correct.

Third sample, n=3, m=5.

Sum floor(3 / b) for b=1 to 5: 3 +1 +1 +0 +0 =5.

Program: ans=3.

count=2.

countmins=1.

g=floor(3/2)=1.

1 >=1, g=1-1=0.

ans += floor(0/2)+1=0+1=1.

ans=4.

count=3.

countmins=2.

g=floor(3/3)=1.

1 >=2? No, break.

Total ans=4.

But correct answer is 5.

Wait, seems like it's missing one pair.

Similarly, in n=10, m=8, program outputs 14, which matches the sample.

But in n=5, m=5, program outputs 6, but correct is 10.

In n=3, m=5, program outputs 4, but correct is 5.

So, it seems the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
