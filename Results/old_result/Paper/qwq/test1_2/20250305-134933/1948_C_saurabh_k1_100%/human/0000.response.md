Alright, I have this problem to solve. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns, and each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, up, or down. It can't move outside the grid or skip the move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach cell (2,n) from cell (1,1) following these rules.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly.

So, the robot has a choice of direction in the first move: left, right, up, or down. But since it's in cell (1,1), some moves are invalid:

- Left: would take it outside the grid.

- Right: to cell (1,2).

- Up: there's no row 0, so it can't move up.

- Down: to cell (2,1).

So, from (1,1), the robot can either move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1).

After choosing a direction, it moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

Wait, no. The sequence is:

1. Move left, right, up, or down (valid move within the grid).

2. Then move according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, from (1,1), if it moves right to (1,2), then it moves according to the arrow in (1,2).

Similarly, if it moves down to (2,1), then it moves according to the arrow in (2,1).

I need to model this movement to see if there's a path that leads to (2,n).

This seems like a graph traversal problem, where each cell is a node, and the moves define the edges.

But given the constraints, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without building a full graph.

Let me think about the properties of the movement.

First, the grid has only two rows, which simplifies things.

Also, n is even, though I'm not sure if that's crucial yet.

Arrows are only left or right, never up or down, and no arrow points outside the grid.

So, in any cell, the arrow will always point to an adjacent cell in the same row.

That means, if the robot moves to a cell and then follows the arrow, it will stay in the same row unless it chooses to move up or down in the first step.

Wait, no. After moving left, right, up, or down, it then moves according to the arrow, which is only left or right in the same row.

So, the arrow movement is always horizontal within the row.

This seems like the robot can move between rows only by choosing to move up or down in the first step of each turn.

But since there are only two rows, moving up from row 2 takes it to row 1, and moving down from row 1 takes it to row 2.

So, the robot can switch rows only by choosing to move up or down; otherwise, it moves horizontally within the row based on the arrow.

Wait, no. After moving up or down, it then moves according to the arrow in the new cell, which is only left or right in the new row.

So, the robot can switch rows, but after switching, it must move horizontally in the new row based on the arrow.

This seems a bit tricky to model directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of possible positions the robot can be in after a certain number of moves.

But given the constraints on n and the number of test cases, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider the movement in more detail.

Suppose the robot is in cell (r,c). It can choose to move left, right, up, or down.

- If it moves left: goes to (r, c-1), then follows the arrow in (r, c-1).

- If it moves right: goes to (r, c+1), then follows the arrow in (r, c+1).

- If it moves up: goes to (r-1, c), then follows the arrow in (r-1, c).

- If it moves down: goes to (r+1, c), then follows the arrow in (r+1, c).

But it can't move outside the grid.

Now, the arrow movement is only left or right in the same row.

So, after moving to a new cell, it moves again based on the arrow, which is deterministic.

This means that from any cell, for each possible initial move, there is a deterministic next cell.

So, for each cell, there are up to four possible next cells, depending on the initial direction chosen.

But tracking all possible paths seems inefficient for large n.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only by choosing to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right and then follow the arrow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where edges represent possible moves, and then see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But building such a graph for large n is not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can find some invariant or property that allows the robot to reach (2,n).

Let me consider the movement in terms of possible positions after each move.

But maybe I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.

Looking at the first sample input:

4

>><<

>>><

The grid is:

Row 1: > < <

Row 2: > > <

And the output is YES.

One possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

So, the robot moves right to (1,2), follows the arrow left to (1,1); then perhaps chooses a different direction.

Wait, that doesn't match the path described. Maybe I need to understand the movement more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the path is:

- Start at (1,1)

- Move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow left to (1,1)

- Move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow left to (1,1)

- And so on, which doesn't seem productive.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample explanation.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

So, let's see:

- From (1,1), move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow left to (1,1). That doesn't match the path.

Wait, maybe the robot chooses to move in a way that combines movements.

I think I need to understand that the robot's movement consists of two steps: a chosen direction move, followed by an arrow move in the current cell.

So, from (1,1):

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

- Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so move right to (2,2).

- From (2,2), choose to move up to (1,2), then follow the arrow '<' to (1,1).

- From (1,1), choose to move right to (1,2), then follow arrow '<' to (1,1).

- And so on.

This seems cyclical, not leading to (2,4).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after moving according to the arrow, the robot can choose a new direction again.

Wait, no. The problem says that every second, the robot first moves in a chosen direction, then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, each turn consists of these two steps.

In the sample explanation, it seems like the robot can make a sequence of such turns to reach (2,4).

But from my earlier attempts, it seems stuck in a cycle.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I should consider that the robot can choose different directions in each turn to navigate through the grid.

Let me try to trace the path again carefully.

Starting at (1,1):

- Turn 1:

- Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow '>' to (2,2).

- Now at (2,2).

- Turn 2:

- Choose to move up to (1,2), then follow the arrow '<' to (1,1).

- Back to (1,1).

- Turn 3:

- Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow '>' to (2,2).

- Again at (2,2).

- Turn 4:

- Choose to move right to (2,3), then follow the arrow '<' to (2,2).

- Back to (2,2).

- Turn 5:

- Choose to move right to (2,3), then follow the arrow '<' to (2,2).

- Still at (2,2).

This seems like I'm not making progress.

But according to the sample, it's possible.

Maybe I need to choose different sequences.

Wait, perhaps from (2,2), choosing to move right to (2,3), then following the '<' arrow to (2,2) isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe from (2,2), choose to move up to (1,2), then follow the '<' to (1,1), which is back to the start.

Alternatively, from (2,2), choose to move right to (2,3), follow the '<' to (2,2).

Still no progress.

Wait, perhaps from (2,2), choose to move down to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', to (1,1).

Still not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after moving according to the arrow, the robot can choose a new direction again.

Wait, no, according to the problem, each second, the robot first moves in a chosen direction, then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, it's a sequence of such turns.

I need to find a sequence of such turns that leads from (1,1) to (2,n).

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to model this differently.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to switch rows by moving up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right and follow the arrow.

Given that, perhaps I can model possible positions after each turn.

But that seems too slow for large n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot needs to reach (2,n), which is in row 2, column n.

To reach column n, perhaps I need to ensure there's a path that allows the robot to progress through the columns.

Given that n is even, maybe there's a pattern based on the parity of the columns.

Wait, in the problem, n is even, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant yet.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows only by choosing to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right based on the arrow.

Perhaps I can think in terms of possible column positions in each row that can lead to the target.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a state machine, where states are (row, column), and transitions are based on the possible moves.

But again, with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Maybe I can think in terms of possible movements per column and see if there's a way to progress to the next columns.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in each turn, the robot can make progress in columns, possibly jumping over some columns based on the arrows.

But I need a clearer strategy.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move right or down in the first step, and then follow the arrow.

I need to see how the arrows affect the movement.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions after each turn.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define the state as (row, column).

Initial state: (1,1)

Target state: (2,n)

Each turn consists of:

1. Choose to move left, right, up, or down to a valid neighboring cell.

2. Then move according to the arrow in the current cell, which is either left or right.

So, from state (r,c), possible next states are:

- If choosing to move left:

- Move to (r, c-1), then follow the arrow in (r, c-1), which is either left or right.

- So, next state is (r, c-1 + arrow_direction)

- Similarly for right, up, down.

But need to ensure that the move is within the grid.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to define the possible moves from any state.

From (r,c):

- Move left: to (r, c-1), then follow arrow in (r, c-1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r, c-2)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r, c-1 +1) = (r, c)

- But need to ensure c-2 >=1

- Move right: to (r, c+1), then follow arrow in (r, c+1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r, c+1 -1) = (r, c)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r, c+1 +1) = (r, c+2)

- Need to ensure c+2 <=n

- Move up: to (r-1,c), then follow arrow in (r-1,c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r-1,c-1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r-1,c+1)

- Need to ensure r-1 >=1 and c-1 >=1 or c+1 <=n

- Move down: to (r+1,c), then follow arrow in (r+1,c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r+1,c-1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r+1,c+1)

- Need to ensure r+1 <=2 and c-1 >=1 or c+1 <=n

So, from each state, there are up to four possible next states, depending on the chosen direction and the arrow in the new cell.

This seems like a standard graph traversal problem, where states are (row, column), and edges are defined by the possible moves.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case.

Standard BFS would be too slow for this, as it could be O(n) in space and time per test case, but with t=1e4, it might not be efficient enough.

I need a smarter way to model this.

Perhaps I can find a way to model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering that rows are only two and movement between rows is limited.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only by choosing to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right based on the arrows.

Maybe I can think in terms of possible column positions in each row that can lead to the next columns.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a finite automaton, where states represent row positions, and transitions are based on column movements.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the movement in such a way that I track possible column positions in each row and see if I can reach column n in row 2.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can move between rows only at specific column positions, based on the arrows.

But I need a better approach.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n is even, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5.

Given that, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Looking back at the sample input:

4

>><<

>>><

And the path is (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4)

Let's see:

- From (1,1), choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1). Doesn't match the path.

Wait, perhaps the path is different.

Wait, maybe the robot chooses different directions in different turns.

Let me try to trace again.

Turn 1:

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

Turn 2:

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

Turn 3:

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

Turn 4:

- Choose up to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

Turn 5:

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

Turn 6:

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

Turn 7:

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

Still not reaching (2,4). I must be misunderstanding the movement.

Wait, perhaps the robot can choose to move right multiple times in a row, but each turn consists of choosing a direction and then following the arrow.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I should consider that the robot can choose to move in a way that allows it to progress through the grid by switching rows and moving columns accordingly.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only by choosing to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right based on the arrow.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions in each row, considering the ability to switch rows.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can only switch rows at certain column positions, based on the arrows.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows only when it chooses to move up or down, and that the arrows only affect movement within the row.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions in each row, with the ability to switch rows at any column where it's allowed.

Given that there are only two rows, maybe I can model it as a finite state machine with two states, representing the two rows, and transitions based on column movements.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider defining dp[r][c], which is whether the robot can reach row r and column c.

Then, dp[1][1] = True

And for each cell, based on possible moves, update dp for the next cells.

But with n up to 2e5, I need this to be efficient.

Perhaps I can iterate through columns and keep track of possible positions in each row.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as two arrays, one for each row, tracking possible columns that can be reached.

Given that, I can iterate through columns and update the possible positions in each row based on the possible moves from the previous columns.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define two arrays:

- row1_reachable: a set of columns reachable in row 1

- row2_reachable: a set of columns reachable in row 2

Initialize:

row1_reachable = {1}

row2_reachable = {}

Now, for each column from 1 to n:

For each reachable position in row1_reachable, consider possible moves:

- Move right: to column c+1, then follow arrow in (1,c+1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (1,c+2)

- If arrow is '<', move to (1,c)

- Move left: to column c-1, then follow arrow in (1,c-1)

- If arrow is '<', move to (1,c-2)

- If arrow is '>', move to (1,c)

- Move down: to row2, column c, then follow arrow in (2,c)

- If arrow is '>', move to (2,c+1)

- If arrow is '<', move to (2,c-1)

Similarly, for row2_reachable, consider:

- Move right: to column c+1, then follow arrow in (2,c+1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (2,c+2)

- If arrow is '<', move to (2,c)

- Move left: to column c-1, then follow arrow in (2,c-1)

- If arrow is '<', move to (2,c-2)

- If arrow is '>', move to (2,c)

- Move up: to row1, column c, then follow arrow in (1,c)

- If arrow is '>', move to (1,c+1)

- If arrow is '<', move to (1,c-1)

Wait, this seems too complicated to implement efficiently for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows only by choosing to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right based on the arrows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions in each row, considering the ability to switch rows at any column.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can switch rows at any column, but after switching, it must follow the arrow in the new row.

Given that, maybe I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering that the robot can switch rows at any column.

But I need to find a way to track possible column progressions efficiently.

Let me consider that the robot can move right in a row, possibly skipping columns based on the arrows, and can switch rows at any column.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, where the robot can switch rows at any column, but must follow the arrows in the new row.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to track possible column progressions in each row.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column c in row 1 or row 2 if:

- It can reach column c-1 in row 1 and the arrow in (1,c-1) is '>', allowing it to move to (1,c), and possibly further if the arrows allow.

- Similarly, from column c+1 in row 1 if the arrow in (1,c+1) is '<'.

- From the same column in row 2 by moving up.

Similarly, for row 2:

- From column c-1 in row 2 if the arrow in (2,c-1) is '>'.

- From column c+1 in row 2 if the arrow in (2,c+1) is '<'.

- From the same column in row 1 by moving down.

This seems similar to a graph where edges connect columns within the same row based on the arrows, and columns between rows at the same column.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are (row, column), and edges are based on the possible moves.

But again, with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to traverse this graph.

Maybe I can iterate through columns and keep track of reachable columns in each row.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize:

row1_reachable = {1}

row2_reachable = {}

Iterate through columns from 1 to n:

For each column c in row1_reachable:

- If c+1 <=n and a[c] == '>', add c+2 to row1_reachable (since after moving right to c+1 and following the '>' arrow to c+2)

- If c-1 >=1 and a[c-1] == '<', add c to row1_reachable (since moving left to c-1 and following the '<' arrow to c-2, but this seems off)

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that from a given position (r,c), after choosing a direction and following the arrow, the robot ends up at a specific position.

I need to model the possible positions the robot can reach from its current position.

This seems too vague for an efficient solution.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move in any direction at each turn, and I need to see if there's any sequence of moves that leads to (2,n).

This sounds like a graph reachability problem, but with n up to 2e5, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach any column in a row by moving left or right and following the arrows, and can switch rows at any column by moving up or down.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering that the robot can switch rows at any column.

But I need to find a way to track possible column progressions efficiently.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows only at columns where it chooses to move up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right based on the arrows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions in each row, with the ability to switch rows at any column.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column c in row 2 if:

- It can reach column c in row 1 and choose to move down to row 2 at column c.

- Or, it can reach column c-1 in row 2 and the arrow is '>', moving to column c.

- Or, it can reach column c+1 in row 2 and the arrow is '<', moving to column c.

Similarly, for row 1.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering that the robot can switch rows at any column and move within a row based on the arrows.

Given that, maybe I can iterate through columns and keep track of possible row positions for each column.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through columns and keep track of possible row positions that can be reached at each column.

Initialize:

At column 1: row 1 is reachable.

Then, for each column from 1 to n:

- For each reachable row at column c:

- If row ==1:

- Can move down to row 2 at column c, then follow the arrow in row 2, column c.

- Can move right to column c+1, then follow the arrow in row 1, column c+1.

- Can move left to column c-1, then follow the arrow in row 1, column c-1.

- Similarly for row 2:

- Can move up to row 1 at column c, then follow the arrow in row 1, column c.

- Can move right to column c+1, then follow the arrow in row 2, column c+1.

- Can move left to column c-1, then follow the arrow in row 2, column c-1.

This seems manageable.

I can implement this using two sets: one for each row, tracking reachable columns.

But with n up to 2e5, I need this to be efficient.

Perhaps I can use two arrays to track reachable columns for each row and update them column by column.

Wait, maybe I can use two boolean arrays, row1_reachable and row2_reachable, where row1_reachable[c] is True if the robot can reach column c in row 1.

Similarly for row2_reachable.

Initialize:

row1_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

row1_reachable[1] = True

row2_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

Then, iterate through columns from 1 to n:

For each column c:

- If row1_reachable[c]:

- Can move down to row 2 at column c, then follow the arrow in row2[c]. If row2[c] == '>', move to row2[c+1]. So, set row2_reachable[c+1] = True

- If row2[c] == '<', move to row2[c-1]. So, set row2_reachable[c-1] = True

- Can move right to row1[c+1], then follow the arrow in row1[c+1]. If row1[c+1] == '>', move to row1[c+2]. So, set row1_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row1[c+1] == '<', move to row1[c]. So, set row1_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to row1[c-1], then follow the arrow in row1[c-1]. If row1[c-1] == '<', move to row1[c-2]. So, set row1_reachable[c-2] = True

- If row1[c-1] == '>', move to row1[c]. So, set row1_reachable[c] = True

- Similarly, for row2_reachable[c]:

- Can move up to row1[c], then follow the arrow in row1[c]. If row1[c] == '>', move to row1[c+1]. So, set row1_reachable[c+1] = True

- If row1[c] == '<', move to row1[c-1]. So, set row1_reachable[c-1] = True

- Can move right to row2[c+1], then follow the arrow in row2[c+1]. If row2[c+1] == '>', move to row2[c+2]. So, set row2_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row2[c+1] == '<', move to row2[c]. So, set row2_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to row2[c-1], then follow the arrow in row2[c-1]. If row2[c-1] == '<', move to row2[c-2]. So, set row2_reachable[c-2] = True

- If row2[c-1] == '>', move to row2[c]. So, set row2_reachable[c] = True

This seems too involved, and I'm not sure if it's correct.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of possible movements per column and see how reachability propagates.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can reach column c in row 2 if:

- It can reach column c in row 1 and choose to move down to row 2 at column c, then follow the arrow in row2[c].

- Or, it can reach column c-1 in row 2 and the arrow in row2[c-1] is '>', moving to column c.

- Or, it can reach column c+1 in row 2 and the arrow in row2[c+1] is '<', moving to column c.

Similarly for row1.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me define:

- For row1, column c:

- Can be reached from:

- row1, column c-1, if row1[c-1] == '>', moving to c.

- row1, column c+1, if row1[c+1] == '<', moving to c.

- row2, column c, by moving up from row2 to row1 at column c, then follow the arrow in row1[c].

- Similarly for row2, column c:

- Can be reached from:

- row2, column c-1, if row2[c-1] == '>', moving to c.

- row2, column c+1, if row2[c+1] == '<', moving to c.

- row1, column c, by moving down from row1 to row2 at column c, then follow the arrow in row2[c].

This seems more accurate.

Given that, perhaps I can model this using two arrays, row1_reachable and row2_reachable, and iterate through columns, updating reachability based on the above rules.

But I need to make sure that I handle the dependencies correctly.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize:

row1_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

row1_reachable[1] = True

row2_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

Then, for each column c from 1 to n:

- If row1_reachable[c]:

- Can move down to row2 at column c, then follow the arrow in row2[c]:

- If row2[c] == '>', set row2_reachable[c+1] = True

- If row2[c] == '<', set row2_reachable[c-1] = True

- Can move right to row1[c+1], then follow the arrow in row1[c+1]:

- If row1[c+1] == '>', set row1_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row1[c+1] == '<', set row1_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to row1[c-1], then follow the arrow in row1[c-1]:

- If row1[c-1] == '<', set row1_reachable[c-2] = True

- If row1[c-1] == '>', set row1_reachable[c] = True

- If row2_reachable[c]:

- Can move up to row1 at column c, then follow the arrow in row1[c]:

This seems comprehensive, but I need to make sure that I handle the column indices correctly and that I don't go out of bounds.

Also, this approach might be inefficient for large n, as it could involve multiple updates per column.

But given that n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, this should be acceptable if implemented efficiently.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid exceeding time limits.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

But before that, let me verify this approach with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4

>><<

>>><

So, n=4

Row1: > < <

Row2: > > <

Initialize:

row1_reachable = [False, True, False, False, False]

row2_reachable = [False, False, False, False, False]

Process column 1:

c=1:

row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move down to row2, c=1, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move left to row1, c=0 (invalid)

row2_reachable[1] = False

Process column 2:

c=1:

row1_reachable[2] = True (from previous step)

- Move down to row2, c=2, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[3] = True

- Move right to row1, c=3, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[2] = True

- Move left to row1, c=1, arrow '>', set row1_reachable[1] = True

c=2:

row2_reachable[2] = True (from previous step)

- Move up to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move right to row2, c=3, arrow '<', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move left to row2, c=1, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[2] = True

Process column 3:

c=2:

row1_reachable[3] = True (from previous step)

- Move down to row2, c=3, arrow '<', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row1, c=4, arrow (not provided, but n=4), assume out of bounds

- Move left to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[0] (invalid)

c=3:

row2_reachable[3] = True (from previous step)

- Move up to row1, c=3, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row2, c=4, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[5] (invalid)

- Move left to row2, c=2, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[3] = True

Process column 4:

c=3:

row1_reachable[4] = ? (not set yet)

- Move down to row2, c=4, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[5] (invalid)

- Move right to row1, c=5 (invalid)

- Move left to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[0] (invalid)

c=4:

row2_reachable[4] = ? (set in previous step?)

Wait, this seems messy. Maybe my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to iterate through columns in order and update reachability accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate through columns from 1 to n, and for each column, update the reachability based on previous columns.

Let me try to redefine my approach.

Define two arrays:

- row1_reachable: a list of booleans indicating if column c in row 1 is reachable.

- row2_reachable: similarly for row 2.

Initialize:

row1_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

row1_reachable[1] = True

row2_reachable = [False] * (n+1)

Then, for each column c from 1 to n:

- From row1, column c:

- If row1_reachable[c]:

- Can move down to row2, column c, then follow arrow in row2[c]:

- If row2[c] == '>', set row2_reachable[c+1] = True

- If row2[c] == '<', set row2_reachable[c-1] = True

- Can move right to row1, column c+1, then follow arrow in row1[c+1]:

- If row1[c+1] == '>', set row1_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row1[c+1] == '<', set row1_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to row1, column c-1, then follow arrow in row1[c-1]:

- If row1[c-1] == '<', set row1_reachable[c-2] = True

- If row1[c-1] == '>', set row1_reachable[c] = True

- From row2, column c:

- If row2_reachable[c]:

- Can move up to row1, column c, then follow arrow in row1[c]:

- If row1[c] == '>', set row1_reachable[c+1] = True

- If row1[c] == '<', set row1_reachable[c-1] = True

- Can move right to row2, column c+1, then follow arrow in row2[c+1]:

- If row2[c+1] == '>', set row2_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row2[c+1] == '<', set row2_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to row2, column c-1, then follow arrow in row2[c-1]:

- If row2[c-1] == '<', set row2_reachable[c-2] = True

- If row2[c-1] == '>', set row2_reachable[c] = True

This seems comprehensive, but perhaps I can optimize it.

Given that n is up to 2e5, I need to make sure that this is efficient.

I can implement this using lists and iterate through columns, updating the reachability accordingly.

At the end, check if row2_reachable[n] is True.

Let me try implementing this in code.

But before that, let's see if this works with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

n=4

Row1: > < <

Row2: > > <

Initialize:

row1_reachable = [False, True, False, False, False]

row2_reachable = [False, False, False, False, False]

Process column 1:

c=1:

row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move down to row2, c=1, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move left to row1, c=0 (invalid)

c=1:

row2_reachable[1] = False (no change)

Process column 2:

c=2:

row1_reachable[2] = True (from previous step)

- Move down to row2, c=2, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[3] = True

- Move right to row1, c=3, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[2] = True

- Move left to row1, c=1, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[0] (invalid)

c=2:

row2_reachable[2] = True (from previous step)

- Move up to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[1] = True

- Move right to row2, c=3, arrow '<', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move left to row2, c=1, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[2] = True

Process column 3:

c=3:

row1_reachable[3] = True (from previous step)

- Move down to row2, c=3, arrow '<', set row2_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row1, c=4, arrow (not provided, assume out of bounds)

- Move left to row1, c=2, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[0] (invalid)

c=3:

row2_reachable[3] = True (from previous step)

- Move up to row1, c=3, arrow '<', set row1_reachable[2] = True

- Move right to row2, c=4, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[5] (invalid)

- Move left to row2, c=2, arrow '>', set row2_reachable[3] = True

Process column 4:

c=4:

row1_reachable[4] = ? (not set)

c=4:

row2_reachable[4] = ? (not set)

Wait, it seems that row2_reachable[4] is not being set in this process.

But according to the sample explanation, it's possible to reach (2,4).

Perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate through columns in a different way or handle the updates more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the robot can choose different sequences of moves to reach the target.

Given the complexity, perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only at specific columns where the arrows allow it.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering that the robot can move between rows at any column by choosing to move up or down.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where nodes are column positions, and edges represent possible movements based on the arrows and the ability to switch rows.

But with two rows, it's still complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can move between rows at any column, and within a row, it can move based on the arrows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions in each row, with the ability to switch rows at any column.

Given that, maybe I can iterate through columns and keep track of possible row positions for each column.

Initialize:

At column 1: row 1 is reachable.

Then, for each column c from 1 to n:

- For row 1:

- If row1_reachable[c]:

- Can move right to c+1, following the arrow in row1[c+1]:

- If row1[c+1] == '>', set row1_reachable[c+2] = True

- If row1[c+1] == '<', set row1_reachable[c] = True

- Can move left to c-1, following the arrow in row1
