Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR-ing them gives 11, which is 3. The number of 1s in the binary representation of 3 is two, which seems to be higher than either 1 or 2 alone.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the resulting number has as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result, I want as many bits as possible to be set to 1 in the OR of all the numbers. To achieve that, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

Wait, but that might not be sufficient, because I also need to make sure that the sum of all these numbers is exactly k.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 3

Possible sequences:

- [1, 2]: sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3, which has two 1s in binary.

- [0, 3]: sum is 3, and 0 | 3 = 3, which also has two 1s.

- [3, 0]: same as above.

- [1, 2] is already considered.

So, in this case, multiple sequences give the same maximum number of 1s in the OR.

Another example:

n = 1, k = 5

Sequence: [5], OR is 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

Is there any other sequence? No, since n=1.

Third test case:

n = 2, k = 5

Possible sequences:

- [5, 0]: OR is 5, which is 101, three 1s.

- [4, 1]: OR is 5, same as above.

- [3, 2]: OR is 3 | 2 = 3, which is 11, two 1s.

So, [5,0] or [4,1] give a higher number of 1s in OR, which is three.

Wait, but in binary, 5 is 101, which has two 1s, not three. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check.

Wait, 5 in binary is 101, which has two 1s. So, OR being 5 has two 1s. But the problem mentions that in the second test case, they have two 1s in OR, which is correct for 1 | 2 = 3 (11 in binary, which is two 1s).

Wait, in the note for the fourth test case, they mention that the OR is 101 111, which is five 1s. So, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need as many bit positions as possible to have at least one number in the sequence with that bit set to 1.

But I also need the sum to be exactly k.

So, perhaps the strategy is to distribute the value k across the n numbers in such a way that as many high-bit positions as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, which means maximizing the number of bit positions that have at least one 1 across all the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should try to set different bit positions in different numbers, but still sum up to k.

Wait, but if I set different bit positions in different numbers, their OR will have all those bits set to 1.

But I need to maximize the number of such bits that are set to 1 in the OR.

So, perhaps the way to do this is to allocate the highest possible bit positions to different numbers, as long as the sum allows it.

Wait, maybe another way: start by setting the highest bit possible in one number, then the next highest in another, and so on, until the sum is reached.

But I need to ensure that the sum is exactly k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers, and I want their OR to have as many 1s as possible.

That means, for each bit position, at least one number has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible.

Given that, perhaps the way to do this is to set the highest bit possible in each number, without exceeding the sum k.

Wait, but that might not be optimal.

Wait, maybe I should set the bits in such a way that each number covers new bit positions that weren't covered before.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s consider the binary representation of k.

Suppose k has m bits set to 1.

If I could distribute the numbers such that each number covers some unique bit positions, then the OR would have m bits set to 1.

But sometimes, it might be possible to set more bits by overlapping in a certain way.

Wait, but since OR is a bit-wise operation, overlapping doesn't help in increasing the number of 1s; it only maintains or reduces them.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to ensure that as many bit positions as possible have at least one number with that bit set to 1.

Given that, the optimal way is to have each number cover new bit positions that weren't covered by previous numbers.

But, I also need to make sure that the sum is exactly k.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program defines a function func_1(n, k) that takes n and k and returns a list of n non-negative integers that sum to k, and presumably maximizes the number of 1s in the OR of these numbers.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(n, k):

nums = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

k -= nums[i]

nums[-1] += k

return nums

So, it initializes a list of n zeros.

Then, for each of the first n-1 numbers, it sets them to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, which is essentially setting them to 2^(bit_length - 1) - 1, meaning it's setting them to a number with the highest bit set to the highest bit of k minus one, and all lower bits set to 1.

Wait, let's compute that for an example.

Suppose k = 5, which is 101 in binary, bit_length is 3.

So, (1 << (3 - 1)) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

So, for n=2, k=5:

nums[0] = 3

k -= 3 → k = 2

nums[1] = 3, but then k -= 3, but k is only 2, so nums[1] = 3 + 2 = 5.

So, the sequence is [3,5], but in the example, they have [5,0] or [4,1], which achieve OR of 5 (101 in binary, two 1s), same as [3,5] since 3|5 = 7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s, which is better.

Wait, but in the example, they have [5,0], which gives OR of 5, which is two 1s, but [3,5] gives OR of 7, which is three 1s, which is better.

But according to the example, [5,0] is acceptable, but [3,5] would be better.

But in the example, they have [5,0], which gives two 1s, but [3,5] gives three 1s.

Is that correct?

Wait, 3 is 011, 5 is 101, OR is 111, which is seven, which has three 1s.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=2, k=5, they have [5,0], which gives OR of 5, which is 101, two 1s.

But [3,5], which sums to 8, which is more than 5, so that's invalid.

Wait, no, k is 5, so if I set nums[0] = 3, and nums[1] = 5, sum is 8, which is more than 5, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Let's look again.

nums = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

k -= nums[i]

nums[-1] += k

So, for n=2, k=5:

nums = [0,0]

nums[0] = (1 << 3 -1 ) -1 = (1<<2)-1 =4-1=3

k -=3 → k=2

nums[1] = (1<<2)-1=2-1=1

k -=1 → k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=k → nums[1] +=1 → nums[1]=1+1=2

So, final nums = [3,2]

Sum is 5, OR is 3|2=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Wait, but [5,0] also gives OR of 5, which is 101, two 1s.

So, same as [3,2].

But in the example, they have [5,0], which gives two 1s, same as [3,2].

But earlier I thought [3,5] would give three 1s, but that's invalid because sum would be 8, which is more than k=5.

So, in this case, [3,2] and [5,0] both give OR of 3 (11 in binary, two 1s), which seems to be the maximum possible for k=5 and n=2.

Wait, but is there a better sequence?

Let's see.

Another sequence could be [1,4], sum is 5, OR is 1|4=5 (101), which is two 1s.

Or [2,3], sum is 5, OR is 2|3=3 (11), two 1s.

So, seems like two 1s is the maximum achievable for k=5 and n=2.

Hence, the program seems correct for this case.

Another test case: n=2, k=3

According to the example, they have [1,2], which sums to 3, OR is 3 (11 in binary, two 1s).

Using the program:

nums = [0,0]

nums[0] = (1 << 2)-1=2-1=1

k -=1 → k=2

nums[1] = (1<<2)-1=1

k -=1 → k=1

nums[1] +=1 → nums[1]=1+1=2

So, [1,2], same as the example.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=5

nums = [0]

nums[0] = (1 << 3)-1=4-1=3

k -=3 → k=2

nums[0] +=2 → nums[0]=5

So, [5], which matches the first test case.

Seems correct.

Fourth test case: n=6, k=51

According to the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], sum is 51, OR is 3|1|1|32|2|12=3|1|1|32|2|12=3|32|12=35|12=37, which is 100101 in binary, which has three 1s, but in the note, they say it has five 1s.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let's compute 3 |1 |1 |32 |2 |12.

3 is 00003 in binary: 0011

1 is 0001

1 is 0001

32 is 100000

2 is 0010

12 is 0110

OR-ing them all: 10111, which is 23, which has four 1s.

But in the note, they say it has five 1s.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some bits.

Let me write them all in binary:

3: 00000011

1: 00000001

1: 00000001

32: 00100000

2: 00000010

12: 00001100

OR-ing them: 00101111, which is 47, which is 101111 in binary, which has five 1s.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, what does the program do for n=6, k=51?

nums = [0,0,0,0,0,0]

k=51, which is 110011 in binary, bit_length is 6.

So, (1 << 6-1)-1 = (1<<5)-1=32-1=31

So, nums[0]=31, k -=31 → k=20

nums[1]=31, but k=20, which is less than 31.

Wait, but k=20, which is 10100 in binary, bit_length=5.

So, (1<<5-1)-1=(1<<4)-1=16-1=15

So, nums[1]=15, k -=15 → k=5

nums[2]=15, but k=5 <15.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the current k's bit_length each time.

Wait, in the code, it's k.bit_length() -1, but k is changing in the loop.

Wait, in the code, it's (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1

So, for k=51, which is 110011 in binary (6 bits), bit_length=6.

So, (1<<5)-1=31

So, nums[0]=31, k -=31 → k=20

k=20, bit_length=5

(1<<4)-1=15

nums[1]=15, k -=15 → k=5

k=5, bit_length=3

(1<<2)-1=3

nums[2]=3, k -=3 → k=2

k=2, bit_length=2

(1<<1)-1=1

nums[3]=1, k -=1 → k=1

k=1, bit_length=1

(1<<0)-1=0

nums[4]=0, k -=0 → k=1

nums[5]=0, k -=0 → k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1 → nums[5] +=1 → nums[5]=1

So, final sequence: [31,15,3,1,0,1]

Sum is 31+15+3+1+0+1=51

OR is 31|15|3|1|0|1=31|15=31|3=31|1=31|0=31|1=31

31 in binary is 11111, which has five 1s.

According to the note, their sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12] also has OR of 101111, which is 47, which has five 1s.

So, both sequences achieve the same number of 1s in OR, which seems to be the maximum possible.

Is there a way to get more than five 1s?

If I try to set more bits, but the sum is constrained to 51.

Is there a sequence where the OR has six 1s in binary?

Let's see, the binary number with six 1s is 63, which is 111111 in binary.

To achieve OR=63, I need to have at least one number with the 6th bit set, but 64 is 1000000, which is the 7th bit.

Wait, 63 is 111111, which is 6 bits.

But 32 is 100000, which is the 6th bit.

So, to have OR=63, I need to have numbers covering bits 1 through 6.

But in the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is 47, which has five 1s.

Is there a way to get OR=63 with sum=51?

Let's try to construct such a sequence.

For example:

- 31 (11111)

- 16 (10000)

- 4 (100)

- Sum=31+16+4=51

OR: 31|16|4=11111 | 10000 | 00100 = 11111, which is 31, same as before.

Alternatively:

- 32 (100000)

- 1 (000001)

- 2 (000010)

- Sum=32+1+2=35, which is less than 51. To make sum=51, I can add more numbers like 18, but 18 is 10010, so OR would be 100000 | 000001 | 000010 | 10010 = 101111, which is 47, same as before.

Seems like it's not possible to get OR with six 1s for sum=51 and n=6.

Hence, the program seems to be correct for this case as well.

Another test case: n=4, k=10

Let's see what the program does.

k=10, which is 1010 in binary, bit_length=4.

So, (1<<3)-1=7

nums[0]=7, k -=7 → k=3

k=3, bit_length=2

(1<<1)-1=1

nums[1]=1, k -=1 → k=2

k=2, bit_length=2

(1<<1)-1=1

nums[2]=1, k -=1 → k=1

k=1, bit_length=1

(1<<0)-1=0

nums[3]=0, k -=0 → k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1 → nums[3]=1

So, sequence: [7,1,1,1], sum=7+1+1+1=10

OR: 7|1|1|1=7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

Is there a better sequence?

Let's try [3,3,3,1], sum=10

OR: 3|3|3|1=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Worse than [7,1,1,1].

Another sequence: [4,4,1,1], sum=10

OR: 4|4|1|1=5, which is 101 in binary, two 1s.

Worse.

[5,3,2,0], sum=10

OR: 5|3|2|0=7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

Same as [7,1,1,1].

Seems like three 1s is the maximum achievable.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=1

Sequence: [1,0,0], sum=1

OR: 1|0|0=1, which is 1 in binary, one 1.

Is there a better sequence?

[1,0,0] is the only possible sequence, so it's correct.

Seems like the program would produce [1,0,0], which is correct.

Another test case: n=5, k=15

k=15, which is 1111 in binary, bit_length=4.

So, (1<<3)-1=7

nums[0]=7, k -=7 → k=8

k=8, bit_length=4

(1<<3)-1=7

nums[1]=7, k -=7 → k=1

k=1, bit_length=1

(1<<0)-1=0

nums[2]=0, k -=0 → k=1

nums[3]=0, k -=0 → k=1

nums[4]=0, k -=0 → k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1 → nums[4]=1

So, sequence: [7,7,0,0,1], sum=15

OR: 7|7|0|0|1=7|1=7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

Is there a better sequence?

Let's try [8,4,2,1,0], sum=15

OR: 8|4|2|1|0=15, which is 1111 in binary, four 1s.

Ah, that's better than the program's output.

So, in this case, the program outputs [7,7,0,0,1], which has OR=7 (111), three 1s, but [8,4,2,1,0] has OR=15 (1111), four 1s.

So, is the program incorrect in this case?

Wait, according to the problem, if there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

But the program is supposed to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Here, [8,4,2,1,0] achieves four 1s, while the program achieves only three.

Hence, the program is not correctly maximizing the number of 1s in the OR.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier cases, it seemed to work.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me see what the program is doing.

It seems that it's trying to set each number to (1 << k.bit_length() -1 ) -1, which is like setting it to 2^(b-1)-1, where b is the bit_length of k.

But in the case of n=5, k=15, it sets two numbers to 7, which is 0111, and one to 1, and the rest to 0.

But, if I set numbers to powers of two, like [8,4,2,1,0], their OR is 15, which has four 1s, which is better.

So, why doesn't the program do that?

Maybe the program isn't optimal.

Let me think about a better approach.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible.

So, perhaps I should assign each number to cover a unique bit position.

Start from the highest bit, assign the highest possible power of two that is less than or equal to k, then subtract it from k, and move to the next highest bit, and so on, until n is exhausted or k is zero.

If n is greater than the number of bit positions in k, some numbers will be zero, which is fine.

Wait, but k can be up to 1e9, which is 30 bits.

So, for n up to 2e5, which is much larger than 30, but in such cases, most numbers will be zero.

But in the case where n is small, like n=5, k=15, assigning [8,4,2,1,0] is better than [7,7,0,0,1], because it covers more bit positions.

So, perhaps the program should assign the highest power of two less than or equal to k to the first number, then subtract it from k, and repeat for the next number, and so on, until k is zero.

But, in the program, it's setting each number to (1 << k.bit_length() -1 ) -1, which is not necessarily a power of two.

In the case of k=15, which is 1111, bit_length=4, so (1<<3)-1=7.

So, it sets the first number to 7, then k=8, which is 1000, bit_length=4, so again 7, then k=1, which is 1, bit_length=1, so 0, and so on.

But, if instead, it assigned the highest power of two less than or equal to k, it would assign 8 first, then 4, then 2, then 1, and then 0 if n>4.

In that case, for n=5, k=15, it would be [8,4,2,1,0], which is better.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier cases, it seemed to work.

Let me check n=2, k=5.

If I assign the highest power less than or equal to 5, which is 4.

Assign 4 to the first number, k -=4 → k=1

Assign 1 to the second number.

So, sequence [4,1], sum=5, OR=4|1=5 (101), two 1s, same as [5,0] or [3,2].

So, in that case, it's the same.

But in n=6, k=51, the program gives [31,15,3,1,0,1], OR=31|15|3|1|0|1=31, which is 11111, five 1s.

But in the note, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], OR=3|1|1|32|2|12=35|12=47, which is 101111, which is also five 1s.

So, in this case, both achieve the same number of 1s.

But in n=5, k=15, the program gives [7,7,0,0,1], OR=7, which is three 1s, while [8,4,2,1,0] gives OR=15, which is four 1s.

So, the program is not optimal in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to think of a better approach.

Let me consider assigning each number to be a distinct power of two, starting from the smallest, until k is exhausted.

But, the problem is that the sum of distinct powers of two up to 2^m is 2^{m+1}-1.

But, for arbitrary k, it might not be possible to cover all bits with n numbers.

Wait, perhaps the greedy approach of assigning the highest power of two less than or equal to k to each number in sequence is better.

But in the case of n=5, k=15, it gives [8,4,2,1,0], which is better than [7,7,0,0,1].

So, perhaps the program should be modified to assign the highest power of two less than or equal to k to each number, iteratively.

Wait, but in the earlier cases, the program's approach gave the same number of 1s.

Is there a general way to maximize the number of 1s in the OR?

I think the optimal way is to assign each number to be a distinct power of two as much as possible, covering higher bits first.

Because higher bits don't overlap with lower bits in terms of the bits they set.

So, by assigning higher power of two to numbers, we set higher bit positions, and then assign lower powers to other numbers.

This way, the OR will have those higher bit positions set to 1.

In the case of n=5, k=15, [8,4,2,1,0] sets bits 4,3,2,1,0, which OR to 15 (1111), which has four 1s.

While the program's approach sets [7,7,0,0,1], which OR to 7 (0111), which has three 1s.

Hence, the program is suboptimal.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Find the highest bit set in k.

- Assign the highest power of two less than or equal to k to the first number.

- Subtract that from k.

- Repeat for the next number, and so on, until k is zero.

- If n is greater than the number of bits in k, set the remaining numbers to zero.

This way, we cover the highest possible bit positions, maximizing the number of 1s in the OR.

In the case of n=5, k=15, this would give [8,4,2,1,0], which is better.

In the case of n=6, k=51, it would give [32,16,2,1,0,0], sum=51, OR=32|16|2|1|0|0=32|16|2|1=11111, which is 31, but 51 is 110011, so OR would be 32|16|2|1=11111, which is 31, but 51 is 110011, which is 51 in binary.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is 6 bits.

So, OR of [32,16,2,1,0,0] is 32|16|2|1|0|0=32|16|2|1=31, which is 11111, which is 31, but 51 is 110011, which is 51.

Wait, 32 is 100000, 16 is 010000, 2 is 000010, 1 is 000001, OR is 110011, which is 51, which has five 1s.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I thought OR would be 31, but that's incorrect.

Wait, 32 is 100000, 16 is 010000, 2 is 000010, 1 is 000001.

OR-ing them: 110011, which is 51, which has three 1s.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which has three 1s.

Wait, no, 110011 has four 1s.

Wait, 110011:

- 1 in the 6th position (32)

- 1 in the 5th position (16)

- 0 in the 4th position (8)

- 0 in the 3rd position (4)

- 1 in the 2nd position (2)

- 1 in the 1st position (1)

So, four 1s.

But earlier, with n=6, k=51, the program gives [31,15,3,1,0,1], OR=31|15|3|1|0|1=31, which is 11111, which has five 1s.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, [32,16,2,1,0,0] gives OR=51, which is 110011, four 1s, which is less than [31,15,3,1,0,1], which gives OR=31, which is 11111, five 1s.

So, perhaps the program's approach is better after all.

Wait, but in the earlier case of n=5, k=15, the program gives [7,7,0,0,1], OR=7, which is three 1s, while [8,4,2,1,0] gives OR=15, which is four 1s.

So, the program is not optimal in that case.

But in n=6, k=51, the program gives [31,15,3,1,0,1], OR=31, which is five 1s, which is better than [32,16,2,1,0,0], which gives OR=51, which is four 1s.

Wait, but 31 in binary is 11111, which is five 1s.

51 is 110011, which is four 1s.

So, the program's approach gives a better OR in this case.

But in the earlier case, it gave a worse OR.

So, perhaps the program's approach is not consistently optimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to think about it.

Let me think differently.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many bit positions to 1 as possible.

Each number can set some bit positions to 1.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible.

So, I should try to have each number set a unique bit position, if possible.

But, since k might not allow that, I need to prioritize covering higher bit positions.

Wait, but in the case of n=5, k=15, [8,4,2,1,0] covers four bit positions, while [7,7,0,0,1] covers only three.

But in n=6, k=51, [31,15,3,1,0,1] covers five bit positions, while [32,16,2,1,0,0] covers four.

So, perhaps the program's approach is better in terms of covering more bit positions in some cases.

But in n=5, k=15, it's worse.

So, perhaps there's no single approach that always works better.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal values for the numbers to maximize the OR.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, not necessarily maximize the OR value itself.

So, perhaps there's a different strategy.

Wait, maybe I should aim to set the smallest possible numbers, each setting as many new bit positions as possible.

Wait, but that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I should aim to set numbers that cover new bit positions that haven't been covered yet.

So, in each step, choose a number that sets as many new bit positions as
