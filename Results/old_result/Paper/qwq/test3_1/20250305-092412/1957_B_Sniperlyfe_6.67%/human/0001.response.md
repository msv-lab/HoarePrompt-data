Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to have the bitwise OR of all these n numbers have as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of all the numbers in the sequence. That means I want as many bits set to 1 in the OR result as possible.

Given that OR combines the bits, a bit in the OR result is 1 if at least one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result, I need to have as many different bits set to 1 across all the numbers in the sequence as possible.

Wait, but there's a constraint: the sum of the numbers must be k.

So, I need to distribute k among n numbers such that their sum is k, and the OR of these numbers has as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=2, k=3

Possible sequences:

- [1,2]: sum is 3, and 1|2 = 3, which in binary is 11, having two 1s.

- [0,3]: sum is 3, and 0|3 = 3, same as above.

- [3,0]: same as above.

- [1,2] is already considered.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is 2.

Another example:

n=1, k=5

Only one number, which is 5, and 5 in binary is 101, which has two 1s.

Another example:

n=2, k=5

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: 5|0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, two 1s.

- [4,1]: 4|1 = 5, same as above.

- [3,2]: 3|2 = 3|2 = 3 in binary is 11, which is three in decimal, but wait, 3|2 is actually 3 in decimal, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Wait, but the example output shows [5,0], which is fine.

But is there a way to get more than two 1s in the OR?

Let me see: if I choose [1,4], then 1|4 = 5, which is 101 in binary, still two 1s.

Or [2,3], 2|3 = 3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s again.

So, seems like for n=2 and k=5, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is 2.

But the example output shows [5,0], which is correct.

Now, looking at the fourth test case:

n=6, k=51

Output: [3,1,1,32,2,12]

Let's verify:

Sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12 = 51, correct.

Now, bitwise OR: 3|1|1|32|2|12

Let's compute that step by step:

3 in binary: 00011

1: 00001

1: 00001

32: 100000

2: 00010

12: 01100

OR'ing all these together:

Start with 000000

OR with 3: 000011

OR with 1: 000011

OR with 1: 000011

OR with 32: 100011

OR with 2: 100011

OR with 12: 101111

So, the final OR is 101111, which has five 1s in binary.

Is this the maximum possible?

Let's see if we can do better.

Suppose I try to set more bits to 1.

Looking at the binary representation, 101111 has bits 0,1,2,4,5 set to 1.

Is it possible to set bit 3 to 1 as well?

Let's try to set bit 3 (which is 8 in decimal).

For example, include 8 in the sequence.

But, I need to ensure the sum is 51.

So, if I have [3,1,1,32,2,12], sum is 51.

If I try to include 8 instead of something else.

Suppose I replace 12 with 8, then the sequence becomes [3,1,1,32,2,8], sum is 3+1+1+32+2+8=47, which is less than 51.

So, I need to adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe add 8 and adjust other numbers to make the sum 51.

This seems complicated, and probably won't lead to more 1s in the OR result.

So, in the example, the output seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

results = []

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

result = func_1(n, k)

results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))

print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):

nums = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

k -= nums[i]

nums[-1] += k

return nums

So, the main function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and k, calls func_1 to get the sequence, and collects the results to print them all at once.

Now, func_1 is where the logic happens.

Let's understand what func_1 does.

It initializes a list nums of n zeros.

Then, in a loop from i=0 to i=n-1:

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

k -= nums[i]

Finally, nums[-1] += k

So, it's trying to assign to each nums[i] a value that is one less than the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k.

Wait, let's break this down.

k.bit_length() gives the number of bits required to represent k in binary.

So, for example, if k=5, which is 101 in binary, k.bit_length() is 3.

Then, (1 << (3 - 1)) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3

So, nums[0] = 3

Then, k -= 3, so k = 2

Then, nums[1] = (1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = (1 << 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

k -= 1, so k = 1

Finally, nums[-1] += 1, so nums[1] becomes 1 + 1 = 2

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, k=3, the output is [1,2], but according to this logic, it would be [3,1], but k=3 - 3 = 0, then nums[-1] += 0, so [3,1], but in the example, it's [1,2].

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let's see for n=2, k=3.

First iteration, i=0:

k.bit_length() = 2 for k=3 (binary 11)

(1 << (2 - 1)) - 1 = (1 << 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

So, nums[0] = 1

k -= 1, so k=2

Second iteration, i=1:

(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = (1 << 1) - 1 = 1

nums[1] = 1

k -=1, so k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1, so nums[1] =1+1=2

So, the sequence is [1,2], which matches the example.

Okay, so the logic seems to work in this case.

Let's check for n=2, k=5.

First iteration, i=0:

k=5, bit_length=3

(1 << (3 -1)) -1 = (1<<2)-1=4-1=3

nums[0]=3

k -=3, k=2

Second iteration, i=1:

(1 << 2 -1) -1=(1<<1)-1=1

nums[1]=1

k -=1, k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1, so nums[1]=1+1=2

So, sequence is [3,2], but in the example, it's [5,0]

But earlier, I saw that both [5,0] and [3,2] give the same OR of 5, which has two 1s in binary.

So, both are acceptable since they achieve the same maximum number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, the program's output is acceptable.

Now, let's see for n=6, k=51.

According to the program:

First, i=0:

k=51, bit_length=6 (since 2^5=32 < 51 < 64=2^6)

(1 << (6-1)) -1=(1<<5)-1=32-1=31

nums[0]=31

k -=31, k=20

i=1:

k=20, bit_length=5 (16 < 20 < 32)

(1 << (5-1)) -1=(1<<4)-1=16-1=15

nums[1]=15

k -=15, k=5

i=2:

k=5, bit_length=3

(1 << (3-1)) -1=4-1=3

nums[2]=3

k -=3, k=2

i=3:

k=2, bit_length=2

(1 << (2-1)) -1=2-1=1

nums[3]=1

k -=1, k=1

i=4:

k=1, bit_length=1

(1 << (1-1)) -1=1-1=0

nums[4]=0

k -=0, k=1

i=5:

k=1, bit_length=1

(1 << (1-1)) -1=0

nums[5]=0

k -=0, k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1, so nums[5]=0+1=1

So, the sequence is [31,15,3,1,0,1]

But in the example, it's [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51 and OR is 101111 with five 1s.

In the sequence from the program, [31,15,3,1,0,1], let's compute the OR:

31 is 11111

15 is 1111

3 is 00011

1 is 00001

0 is 00000

1 is 00001

OR'ing all these together: 11111, which is 31 in decimal, binary 11111 has five 1s.

Same as the example's OR result, which also has five 1s.

Hence, the program's output is acceptable.

Now, is this always optimal?

I need to verify if this approach always maximizes the number of 1s in the OR.

The strategy in func_1 seems to be:

For each number in the sequence, set it to (1 << (k.bit_length() -1)) -1, which is the largest number less than or equal to k that is of the form 2^(b-1) -1, where b is the bit_length of k.

Then, subtract this value from k and move to the next number.

Finally, add any remaining k to the last number.

Let me see if this strategy maximizes the number of 1s in the OR.

The OR of the sequence will have a 1 in a particular bit position if at least one of the numbers in the sequence has a 1 in that bit position.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set to 1 across the sequence as possible.

The strategy in func_1 seems to try to set the highest possible number first, but not necessarily maximizing the number of distinct bit positions.

Wait, in the example with n=2, k=5:

Program's output: [31,15,3,1,0,1]

OR is 11111, which is 31 in decimal.

But another possible sequence is [3,1,1,32,2,12], OR is 101111, which is 47 in decimal, also has five 1s.

So, both are equally good.

Is there a way to get more than five 1s?

Let's see, 2^5 =32, 2^4=16, 2^3=8, 2^2=4, 2^1=2, 2^0=1.

If I can set bits 0 through 5, that's six bits.

But in the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is 47, binary 101111, which has six bits, with bits 0,1,2,4,5 set to 1, which is five 1s.

Wait, 47 in binary is 101111, which is six bits with bits 1,2,3,4,5 set to 1, which is five 1s.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let's check:

47 in binary:

2^5 =32, 2^4=16, 2^3=8, 2^2=4, 2^1=2, 2^0=1

47 -32=15, 15-16 isn't possible, so it's 1 in the 32s place.

15 -16 isn't possible, so 0 in the 16s place.

15 -8=7, 1 in the 8s place.

7 -4=3, 1 in the 4s place.

3 -2=1, 1 in the 2s place.

1 -1=0, 1 in the 1s place.

So, 47 is 101111, which is bits 1,2,3,4,5 set to 1, which is five 1s.

Similarly, 31 is 11111, which is bits 1,2,3,4,5 set to 1, five 1s.

So, both have five 1s.

Is it possible to get six 1s?

Well, if I can set bit 0 to 1 as well.

But in the sum constraint, with n=6 and k=51.

Let's see, if I set bit 0 to 1, I need to have at least one number with bit 0 set.

But in the sequences above, bit 0 is already set in some numbers.

Wait, in the program's sequence [31,15,3,1,0,1], 31 is 11111, which has bit 0 set to 1.

15 is 1111, bit 0 set to 1.

3 is 00011, bit 0 set to 1.

1 is 00001, bit 0 set to 1.

0 is 00000, bit 0 set to 0.

1 is 00001, bit 0 set to 1.

So, the OR would have bit 0 set to 1.

Wait, but 31 already sets bit 0 to 1.

Hence, the OR will have bit 0 set to 1.

Wait, but 31 is 11111, which is 32-1, i.e., 11111, which is bits 1 through 5 set to 1, and bit 0 set to 1 as well.

Wait, in binary, 31 is 11111, which is bits 1 through 5 set to 1, and bit 0 is also set to 1.

Wait, no, in binary, bit positions are usually starting from 0.

So, bit 0 is the least significant bit.

So, 31 is 11111, which is:

bit 0:1, bit 1:1, bit 2:1, bit 3:1, bit 4:1.

So, bits 0 through 4 are set to 1.

Wait, but 31 in binary is 11111, which is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 =1+2+4+8+16=31.

So, bits 0 through 4 are set to 1.

Then, 15 is 1111, which is bits 0 through 3 set to 1.

3 is 11, bits 0 and 1 set to 1.

1 is 1, bit 0 set to 1.

0 is 0, no bits set.

1 is 1, bit 0 set to 1.

So, the OR would have bits 0 through 4 set to 1, but bit 5 is not set by any of these numbers.

In the example sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], 32 is 100000, which sets bit 5 to 1.

So, the OR has bits 0,1,2,4,5 set to 1, which is five 1s.

Hence, in the program's sequence, since none of the numbers have bit 5 set except possibly 32, but in the program's sequence, the highest bit set is bit 4.

Wait, in the program's sequence for n=6, k=51, the numbers are [31,15,3,1,0,1], none of which have bit 5 set to 1.

Wait, but 31 is 11111, which is bits 0 through 4 set to 1.

So, the OR would be 11111, which is 31, which has five 1s.

But in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which have OR 101111, which is also five 1s.

So, both sequences achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, the program's approach seems acceptable.

Now, is this always optimal?

Let me think about another test case.

Suppose n=3, k=7.

Possible sequences:

- [3,3,1]: sum is 7, OR is 3|3|1 = 3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

- [3,2,2]: sum is 7, OR is 3|2|2 = 3, same as above.

- [4,2,1]: sum is 7, OR is 4|2|1 = 7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

- [7,0,0]: sum is 7, OR is 7|0|0=7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

- [6,1,0]: sum is 7, OR is 6|1|0=7, which is 111 in binary, three 1s.

So, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is three.

Now, according to the program:

For n=3, k=7.

First iteration, i=0:

k=7, bit_length=3

(1 << (3-1)) -1=(1<<2)-1=4-1=3

nums[0]=3

k -=3, k=4

Second iteration, i=1:

k=4, bit_length=3

(1 << (3-1)) -1=3

nums[1]=3

k -=3, k=1

Third iteration, i=2:

k=1, bit_length=1

(1 <<1 -1)-1=1-1=0

nums[2]=0

k -=0, k=1

Then, nums[-1] +=1, so nums[2]=0+1=1

Hence, sequence is [3,3,1], OR is 3|3|1=3, which has two 1s in binary.

But, as per earlier analysis, it's possible to achieve three 1s in the OR.

Hence, the program's approach is not always optimal.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't always maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, and maximize the number of 1's in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to maximize the number of set bits (1's) in the bitwise OR of `n` numbers that sum to `k`.
    - Each set bit in the OR result corresponds to at least one number in the sequence having that bit set.

2. **Strategy**:
    - To maximize the number of set bits in the OR, we should aim to set as many unique bits as possible across the sequence.
    - We can achieve this by distributing the sum `k` such that we set the smallest possible bits first.

3. **Implementation**:
    - Start with the smallest bits and assign values to set these bits in the sequence.
    - Use a greedy approach to allocate the smallest possible numbers that set new bits in the OR.

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    current_bit = 0
    remaining = k
    for i in range(n):
        if remaining == 0:
            break
        # Assign the smallest possible number that sets a new bit
        if current_bit < 32:
            value = 1 << current_bit
            if value > remaining:
                value = remaining
            nums[i] = value
            remaining -= value
            current_bit += 1
        else:
            # If all bits are used, assign the remaining sum to the last number
            nums[i] += remaining
            remaining = 0
    if remaining > 0:
        nums[-1] += remaining
    return nums
```

## Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - We read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and process them using `func_1`.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Initialize a list `nums` of `n` zeros.
  - Use a variable `current_bit` to track the bit position we are trying to set.
  - Distribute the sum `k` among the `n` numbers:
    - Assign the smallest possible value (`1 << current_bit`) to each number to set a new bit.
    - If the value exceeds the remaining sum `remaining`, assign the remaining sum.
    - Increment the bit position and subtract the assigned value from `remaining`.
  - If there are any remaining sum after assigning unique bits, add it to the last number in the sequence.

This approach ensures that we set as many unique bits as possible, thereby maximizing the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
