Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a beautiful array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if I can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] equals a[i + 1], and then replace a[i] with a[i - 1].

So, in other words, if the elements on both sides of an element are the same, I can change that element to match them. The goal is to make the entire array consist of the same value.

Now, the task is to make the array not beautiful by removing the least number of elements possible. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should return -1.

Let me think about what it means for an array to stop being beautiful. It means that after removing some elements, I should not be able to make all elements the same using the given operation.

Looking at the example:

In the first test case:

3

2 2 2

It's impossible to make it not beautiful because no matter how many elements you remove, the remaining array will still have all elements equal, which is the condition for being beautiful.

In the second test case:

5

1 2 1 2 1

Removing one element, say the fifth one, results in [1, 2, 1, 2]. Now, let's see if this is still beautiful. If I try to apply the operation:

- For i=2, a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, so I can replace a[2] with 1, making the array [1,1,1,2]. Then, I can apply the operation again on i=4 to make it [1,1,1,1]. So, it's still beautiful.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's not beautiful after removal. Maybe I misread. Let me check the explanation again.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5, for example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two operations are available:

- Choose i=2: the array becomes [1,1,1,2]. No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same.

- Choose i=3: the array becomes [1,2,2,2]. No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same.

Thus, the array [1,2,1,2] is not beautiful.

Wait, I see. After removal, no sequence of operations can make all elements equal. In the first case, after replacing a[2] with a[1], we get [1,1,1,2], which cannot be further operated to make all elements equal. Similarly, replacing a[3] with a[2] gives [1,2,2,2], which also cannot be further operated to make all elements equal. So, in both cases, we cannot make all elements equal, hence it's not beautiful.

So, the key is to remove elements in such a way that it's impossible to make all elements equal through the given operations.

Now, I need a general strategy to find the minimum number of elements to remove to achieve this.

First, since the array is initially beautiful, meaning that through the operations, I can make all elements equal to some value. My goal is to disrupt this property by removing elements.

Let me think about the structure of a beautiful array. If I can make all elements equal by replacing elements in the middle that don't match their neighbors, it suggests that the array has runs of the same value, and possibly some discrepancies that can be fixed by the operations.

Wait, maybe I should look at the array in terms of runs of identical elements.

Let's consider the array divided into segments where each segment consists of identical elements. For example:

In the second test case:

1 2 1 2 1

Segments: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1

In the fourth test case:

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Segments: 3, 5, 3, 3

Wait, no, 3,3,3 is one segment, then 5, then 3,3,3.

Wait, no, 3,3,3 is one segment, then 5, then 3,3,3.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, it's 3,3,3,5,3,3,3.

So, segments are:

- 3,3,3

- 5

- 3,3,3

Now, if I remove the first three elements, I get [5,3,3,3]. Let's see if this is beautiful.

Can I make all elements equal?

If I try to make them all 5:

- Initially: [5,3,3,3]

- Can I apply the operation on i=3? a[2]=3 and a[4]=3, so replace a[3] with 3, which doesn't change anything.

- Can I apply the operation on i=2? a[1]=5 and a[3]=3, which are different, so no.

- So, I can't change anything, and the array remains [5,3,3,3], which is not all the same. Hence, it's not beautiful.

Alternatively, if I try to make them all 3:

- Initially: [5,3,3,3]

- Can I apply the operation on i=2? a[1]=5 != a[3]=3, so no.

- Can I apply the operation on i=3? a[2]=3 == a[4]=3, so replace a[3] with 3, no change.

- Again, can't make all elements 3.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

So, in this case, removing the first three elements makes it not beautiful.

But the problem is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful.

Looking back at the first test case:

2 2 2

No matter how many elements I remove, it remains beautiful because all remaining elements are equal, and no operations can change that.

So, in this case, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, hence output -1.

In the second test case:

1 2 1 2 1

By removing one element, I can make it not beautiful, as shown in the explanation.

In the third test case:

1

Just one element, which is already beautiful. Since there's only one element, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so output -1.

In the fourth test case:

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

By removing three elements, I can make it not beautiful, as shown in the example.

Now, I need a general approach to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

Let me think about the property of a beautiful array. Since it's possible to make all elements equal by replacing elements in the middle that have the same neighbors, it suggests that the array can be transformed into an array where all elements are equal to some value.

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, it's impossible to make all elements equal through these operations.

One way to think about it is to break the array into segments of identical values and see how these segments interact.

Let me consider the segments:

- If there is only one segment, meaning all elements are equal, then it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, as any subset will still have all elements equal.

- If there are multiple segments, I need to remove elements in such a way that it's impossible to make all remaining elements equal.

Wait, in the second test case, there are five segments: 1,2,1,2,1.

Removing one element breaks the pattern in such a way that it's no longer possible to make all elements equal.

In the fourth test case, there are three segments: 3,5,3.

Removing the first three elements (the first segment) leaves [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Alternatively, removing the second segment (only one element, 5) leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful. So, removing only the second segment doesn't work. Hence, I need to remove more elements.

Wait, but according to the example, removing the first three elements works, which removes the first segment.

So, in that case, removing the first segment of three elements makes it not beautiful.

But, removing only one element from the second segment doesn't work, as shown earlier.

So, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is related to the smallest segment.

Wait, in the second test case, the smallest segment is of size 1 (each 2 is a single element).

Removing one element (a segment of size 1) makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1 (the single 5).

But removing one element, say the 5, leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful again.

Wait, that seems contradictory to the example.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the segments are:

- 3,3,3 (size 3)

- 5 (size 1)

- 3,3,3 (size 3)

Removing the first three elements (the first segment) leaves [5,3,3,3].

This is not beautiful, as explained earlier.

Alternatively, removing only one element, say the single 5, leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

Hence, removing one element isn't enough in this case.

I need to remove at least three elements to make it not beautiful.

Wait, but in the second test case, removing one element is enough.

So, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment.

In the second test case, smallest segment is of size 1, and removing one element is enough.

In the fourth test case, smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough, so that can't be the general rule.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal size of the segments that are not the most frequent one.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, it's impossible to make all remaining elements equal.

This means that there should be at least two different values in the array, and the operations cannot make them all equal.

Given the operation allows changing an element to match its neighbors if they are equal, it seems similar to propagating values through the array.

Perhaps, if I can isolate segments in such a way that they cannot be connected through operations, I can make it not beautiful.

Wait, maybe the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment that is not equal to the majority segment.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array with multiple segments of different values.

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two segments remaining that cannot be made equal through operations.

In other words, there are at least two different values that cannot be transformed into each other.

Given that operations allow changing an element to match its neighbors if the neighbors are equal, it seems that runs of the same value are connected and can be transformed into each other.

Wait, perhaps it's about connected components of identical values.

If I have multiple connected components of different values, and I can't connect them through operations, then the array is not beautiful.

Wait, maybe the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment across all test cases.

But in the first test case, all elements are the same, so removing any element won't make it not beautiful.

In the second test case, removing one element (from a segment of size 1) makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (from a segment of size 3) makes it not beautiful.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, removing the first three elements (a segment of size 3) makes it not beautiful.

But according to the example, removing one element isn't enough, as shown earlier.

Wait, but in the second test case, removing one element is enough.

So, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment in the array.

In the second test case, smallest segment is of size 1, so remove 1.

In the fourth test case, smallest segment is of size 1, but removing 1 isn't enough, so that can't be the general rule.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove all elements from the smallest segment.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, removing the segment of size 1 (the single 5) leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

So, I need to remove more elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove all elements from the smallest segment and one element from the next smallest segment.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I want to make sure that after removal, there are at least two different values that cannot be made equal through operations.

In other words, there are at least two segments remaining with different values, and no operations can connect them.

But, given the operation allows changing elements to match their neighbors if the neighbors are equal, it seems that isolated segments can't be connected.

Hence, if I have at least two segments with different values remaining, the array is not beautiful.

Therefore, to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two segments with different values remaining.

In other words, I need to prevent the array from becoming a single segment or all segments having the same value.

Wait, but if all remaining segments have the same value, it's still beautiful.

Wait, no, if all remaining elements are the same, it's beautiful.

So, to make it not beautiful, I need to have at least two different values remaining, and it's impossible to make them all equal through operations.

Hence, if I can ensure that there are at least two different values remaining, and the operations cannot make them all equal, then the array is not beautiful.

Given that operations can only change an element to match its neighbors if they are equal, if I have at least two different values in separate segments, operations cannot change elements to make all elements equal.

Therefore, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough, as shown earlier.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal size of the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two different values in separate segments.

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Let me think about it in terms of the number of segments.

If I have multiple segments, and I remove elements from some segments, I need to ensure that at least two segments with different values remain.

Hence, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, removing the smallest segment (size 1) isn't enough.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal size among the segments that have different values.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following:

- Find the value that appears in the most segments.

- Remove all segments that have this value.

- Then, the remaining array will have segments with different values, making it not beautiful.

- The minimal number of elements to remove would be the total number of elements in the segments with the most frequent value.

Wait, but in the second test case, the value 1 appears in three segments, and value 2 in two segments.

If I remove all segments with value 1, I remove three elements, leaving [2,2], which is beautiful.

Wait, no, [2,2] is beautiful because all elements are equal.

Wait, so that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if I remove all segments with value 2, I remove two elements, leaving [1,1,1], which is beautiful.

So, in this case, removing the segments with the minority value doesn't make it not beautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to remove enough elements so that the remaining array has at least two different values, and cannot be made equal through operations.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal run length among all segments.

In the second test case, minimal run length is 1, and removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, minimal run length is 1, but removing one element isn't enough.

Wait, in the fourth test case, removing the single 5 leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

Hence, removing the minimal run isn't sufficient in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove all segments of the minimal run length.

But in this case, there is only one segment of length 1, so removing it isn't enough.

Wait, maybe I need to remove all segments of the minimal run length and one more segment.

No, that doesn't seem right.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider the following:

- If the array consists of only one segment, i.e., all elements are equal, then it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so output -1.

- If the array consists of multiple segments, then the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal size of the largest segment.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's the size of the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the second test case, removing one element (from the segments of 1 or 2) leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (the first segment of three 3's) leaves [5,3,3,3], which has two segments with different values.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment in the array.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove the smallest segment that, when removed, splits the array into parts with different values.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove so that the remaining array has at least two different values, and no sequence of operations can make them all equal.

Given that operations allow changing an element to match its neighbors if they are equal, to prevent making all elements equal, I need to ensure that there are at least two different values that cannot be connected through operations.

This seems similar to ensuring that there are at least two disconnected components with different values.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the second test case, removing one element (from the segments of 1 or 2) leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (the first segment of three 3's) leaves [5,3,3,3], which has two segments with different values.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment in the array.

But in the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal size of the largest segment.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, the largest segment is of size 3, and removing three elements works.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest largest segment.

Wait, that's confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me consider that to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two segments with different values, and no operations can connect them.

Hence, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the second test case, removing one element (from the segments of 1 or 2) achieves this.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (the first segment of three 3's) achieves this.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal size of the segments that, when removed, leave at least two segments with different values.

But this seems too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I find the minimal number of elements to remove such that the remaining array has at least two different values, and no sequence of operations can make them equal.

Given that operations allow changing elements to match their neighbors if the neighbors are equal, to prevent making all elements equal, I need to ensure that there are at least two different values in the array, and no operations can connect them.

This seems similar to ensuring that there are at least two distinct values in separate segments.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment in the array.

In the second test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, and removing one element achieves the goal.

In the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough, as it can still be made beautiful.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove enough elements to break the connection in such a way that at least two different values remain in separate segments.

In the fourth test case, removing the first three elements breaks the connection, leaving [5,3,3,3], which has two segments with different values.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment that, when removed, ensures that the remaining array has at least two segments with different values.

But this seems too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I can consider the array as a sequence of segments and find the minimal number of elements to remove to ensure that at least two segments with different values remain.

Hence, find the smallest segment and remove it, then check if the remaining array has at least two segments with different values.

In the second test case, removing one element (the smallest segment) achieves this.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (the smallest segment of size 3) achieves this.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal segment size in the array.

But in the fourth test case, the minimal segment size is 1, but removing one element isn't enough, as shown earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove all elements from the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two segments with different values.

But in the fourth test case, removing the segment of size 3 achieves this.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal segment size among the segments that, when removed, leave at least two segments with different values.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in order to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two different values in the array, and no operations can make them equal.

Given that operations allow changing an element to match its neighbors if they are equal, to prevent making all elements equal, I need to ensure that there are at least two different values in separate segments.

Hence, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment in the array.

In the second test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, and removing one element achieves the goal.

In the fourth test case, the smallest segment is of size 1, but removing one element isn't enough because the remaining array is still beautiful.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove enough elements to ensure that the remaining array has at least two segments with different values, and no operations can connect them.

In the fourth test case, removing the first three elements (a segment of size 3) achieves this by leaving [5,3,3,3], which has two segments with different values.

Alternatively, removing only one element (the single 5) leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

Hence, removing the smallest segment isn't always sufficient.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal segment size across all test cases.

But in the first test case, all elements are the same, so removing any elements doesn't make it not beautiful.

In the second test case, minimal segment size is 1, and removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, minimal segment size is 1, but removing one element isn't enough.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two different values in the array, and no sequence of operations can make them all equal.

This means that there should be at least two segments with different values remaining.

Hence, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest segment that, when removed, leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the second test case, removing one element (from any segment) leaves at least two segments with different values.

In the fourth test case, removing three elements (from one segment) leaves at least two segments with different values.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal segment size among the segments that, when removed, leave at least two segments with different values.

But this is too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I iterate through the array and count the frequency of each value.

Then, find the value that appears the least number of times and remove all its occurrences.

If removing those makes the array not beautiful, then that's the minimal number of elements to remove.

But in the second test case, removing all 2's (which appear twice) leaves [1,1,1], which is beautiful.

Hence, removing the least frequent value isn't sufficient.

Wait, in the fourth test case, removing all 5's (which appear once) leaves [3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

Hence, this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to remove the value that appears in the most segments.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The code is:

from math import inf

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

same = 1

num = ar[0]

minn = inf

i = 1

while i < len(ar):

if ar[i] == num:

same += 1

else:

i += 1

num = ar[i]

minn = min(minn, same)

same = 1

i += 1

minn = min(minn, same)

if minn == inf:

print(-1)

else:

print(minn)

So, it seems to be iterating through the array, counting the size of each segment of identical values, and keeping track of the minimal segment size.

Then, it prints this minimal segment size, or -1 if all elements are the same.

In the second test case, the minimal segment size is 1, which matches the example output of 1.

In the fourth test case, the minimal segment size is 1, but according to the example, the output should be 3, which contradicts this approach.

Hence, this code seems incorrect.

Wait, but according to the example, in the fourth test case, the minimal number of elements to remove is 3, but the code would output 1, which is different from the example output of 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is -1, which matches the example.

In the second test case, the output is 1, which matches the example.

In the third test case, with only one element, the output is -1, which matches.

In the fourth test case, the code would output 1, but the example output is 3, which doesn't match.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
