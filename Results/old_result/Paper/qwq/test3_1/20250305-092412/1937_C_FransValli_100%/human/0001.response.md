Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ as much as possible in their binary representation, especially in the higher bits.

Given that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, all values are unique. So, for a given n, I know the range of possible values.

Now, about the queries: I can ask comparisons between (p_a OR p_b) and (p_c OR p_d). The response will tell me which one is larger or if they are equal.

I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the relative values of p_i.

My initial thought is to find the maximum value in the permutation using these queries, since the maximum XOR might involve the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, but actually, the maximum XOR might not necessarily involve the maximum value. For example, if n=3 and p=[0,1,2], then 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is larger than 0 XOR 2 = 2 or 0 XOR 1 = 1. So, sometimes, it's better to have two values that differ significantly in their bits.

But in general, to maximize XOR, I should look for two numbers that have as many differing bits as possible.

Given that, perhaps I should try to identify the two numbers that differ the most in their higher bits.

But how can I do that using only comparisons of ORs?

Maybe I can try to find the two largest numbers in the permutation, and their XOR would be large.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number with the highest bit set and pair it with the number that has that bit unset.

Wait, but since it's a permutation of 0 to n-1, I know the maximum value is n-1.

Maybe I can first find the index of the maximum value in the permutation using queries.

Once I have the index of the maximum value, say p_max, then I can try to find another value that differs the most from p_max.

But how do I find p_max using these queries?

I can do a tournament-like approach: compare OR of pairs and see which one is larger.

Wait, but I need to compare single elements, not pairs.

Wait, but the query is about comparing (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

If I set a=b and c=d, then I'm comparing p_a with p_c.

Wait, no, p_a OR p_b could be larger than p_a if p_b has some bits that p_a doesn't have.

But if p_a >= p_b, then p_a OR p_b == p_a.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, p_a=2 (10 in binary), p_b=1 (01 in binary), p_a OR p_b = 3 (11 in binary), which is larger than both.

Wait, actually, p_a OR p_b is always greater than or equal to p_a and p_b individually.

So, if p_a >= p_b, then p_a OR p_b >= p_a.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one element, say p0, and compare it with all other elements using queries.

For example, fix a=0, b=0, and compare with c=i, d=i for different i.

Then, I'm comparing p0 OR p0 = p0 with p_i OR p_i = p_i.

So, I'm effectively comparing p0 with p_i.

Based on the response, I can know if p0 < p_i, p0 > p_i, or p0 == p_i.

Wait, that's useful! I can use this to find the maximum value in the permutation.

So, I can set a=b=0 and compare with c=d=i for i from 1 to n-1.

Based on the response, I can find the largest p_i.

Let me formalize this.

Initialize maxi = 0

For i from 1 to n-1:

Ask ? 0 0 i i

If response is <, set maxi = i

After this loop, maxi should be the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, but I need to make sure that this works.

Suppose p0 is indeed the maximum, then for all i, p0 >= p_i, so response should be >=.

But if p_i > p0, then response would be <, and I set maxi = i.

So, at the end, maxi should be the index of the maximum value.

Okay, that seems correct.

Now, once I have the index of the maximum value, say p_max = p[maxi], I need to find another value p_j such that p_max XOR p_j is maximized.

How can I find such a p_j using queries?

One approach is to find the p_j that differs the most from p_max in their binary representation.

To maximize XOR, I want p_j to have bits that are different from p_max's bits in the higher positions.

Given that, perhaps I can find the minimum value in the permutation, because the minimum value would be 0, and XOR with p_max would be p_max itself.

But actually, that might not be the maximum XOR possible.

Wait, for example, if p_max is n-1, and n is a power of 2, then p_max is say 7 for n=8.

Then, p_max XOR 0 = 7, p_max XOR 1 = 6, p_max XOR 2 = 5, p_max XOR 3 = 4, p_max XOR 4 = 3, etc.

So, the maximum XOR would be p_max XOR 0 = p_max.

But in other cases, it might be different.

Wait, no, actually, for p_max = 7 (111 in binary), p_max XOR 0 = 111 = 7, p_max XOR 1 = 110 = 6, p_max XOR 2 = 101 = 5, p_max XOR 3 = 100 = 4, p_max XOR 4 = 011 = 3, p_max XOR 5 = 010 = 2, p_max XOR 6 = 001 = 1, p_max XOR 7 = 000 = 0.

So, in this case, the maximum XOR is 7, achieved with p_j = 0.

But is this always the case?

Wait, take n=3, p=[0,1,2].

p_max = 2.

2 XOR 0 = 2, 2 XOR 1 = 3, 2 XOR 2 = 0.

So, the maximum XOR is 3, achieved with p_j=1.

So, in this case, it's not the minimum value.

Hence, my previous assumption is wrong.

So, just finding the minimum value won't give me the maximum XOR.

Hmm.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

To maximize p_max XOR p_j, I need p_j to have bits that are different from p_max in the highest positions.

In other words, if p_max has the k-th bit set, then to maximize XOR, p_j should have that bit unset, if possible.

But since p_j can be any value from 0 to n-1, I need to find the p_j that differs the most from p_max.

Wait, perhaps I can find the p_j that has the most number of bits different from p_max, starting from the most significant bit.

But how do I find that using the queries I have?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the p_j that is as small as possible, but not necessarily the smallest.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=3, p_max=2, and p_j=1 gives XOR=3, which is larger than p_max XOR 0 = 2.

So, in that case, p_j=1 is not the smallest possible.

Wait, p_j=1 is smaller than p_j=2, but larger than p_j=0.

So, it's in the middle.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to find the p_j such that p_max OR p_j is as large as possible.

Wait, but OR and XOR are different operations.

Wait, no, actually, maximizing XOR doesn't directly correlate with maximizing OR.

In fact, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that p_max is fixed, and I need to choose p_j such that their XOR is maximized.

Given that p_j is from 0 to n-1 and distinct, I need to find the p_j that differs the most from p_max in binary representation.

To do this, I can look for p_j that has bits unset where p_max has them set, and vice versa.

But how can I find such a p_j using the queries allowed?

Wait, maybe I can find the p_j that minimizes p_max AND p_j.

Because XOR is equivalent to p_max OR p_j minus p_max AND p_j.

Wait, no, that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, since p_max is known, I can precompute p_max XOR p_j for all j and find the maximum.

But I don't know p_j's, that's the whole point.

Wait, but I can try to find the p_j that has the highest possible bits unset where p_max has them set.

But I need to do this interactively.

Maybe I can try to find the smallest p_j such that p_max OR p_j is equal to p_max.

Wait, no, that would mean p_j <= p_max.

But I need to maximize XOR, which might involve p_j being smaller or larger in different ways.

This is tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix a=b as the index with the maximum p, say maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for different j and k.

Since p_max OR p_j is equal to p_max if p_j <= p_max, or higher if p_j has some bits that p_max doesn't have.

Wait, but p_max is the maximum, so p_max >= p_j for all j.

Therefore, p_max OR p_j == p_max for all j.

Wait, is that true?

No, wait, p_max OR p_j could be larger than p_max if p_j has some bits that p_max doesn't have.

Wait, but p_max is the maximum, so no p_j can have a bit set that p_max doesn't have, because p_max is the largest.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

For example, consider n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

p_max=4 (100 in binary).

p_max OR 1 (001) = 101 (5), which is larger than p_max=4.

Wait, but p_max=4 is not the actual maximum if n=5, since 4 < 5.

Wait, n=5, p_max=4, but in the permutation, p_max should be the largest value, which is n-1=4 in this case.

Wait, for n=5, p_max=4.

But 4 OR 1 = 5, which is not in the permutation.

Wait, but in the permutation, all values are from 0 to n-1, so if n=5, p_max=4, and p_j=1, then p_max OR p_j = 5, which is not in the permutation.

But in the problem, n can be up to 10^4, so p_max can be up to 9999.

But in any case, p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has some bits not present in p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j can have bits that p_max doesn't have, as long as p_j < n.

Wait, but p_max is the largest in the permutation, so no p_j should have a higher value than p_max.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=3, p_max=2, but p_max OR 1 = 3, which is higher than p_max=2.

But in the permutation, 3 is not present, since n=3.

So, perhaps p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max, but p_j is still less than p_max.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, p_max is the largest in the permutation, so p_j <= p_max.

But OR operation can produce values larger than p_max if p_j has some bits not present in p_max.

But if p_max is the largest, how can p_j have bits not present in p_max?

Wait, perhaps p_max doesn't have all the higher bits set.

For example, if p_max=6 (110), and p_j=3 (011), then p_max OR p_j = 7 (111), which is larger than p_max.

But in the permutation, p_max=6 is the largest, so p_j=3 is less than p_max.

But p_max OR p_j can still be larger than p_max.

Wait, but in the permutation, p_max is the largest, so no p_j can be larger than p_max.

But p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has some bits not present in p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j < p_max, so p_j cannot have bits higher than p_max.

Wait, but in binary representation, it's possible for p_j to have some bits set that p_max doesn't have, even if p_j < p_max.

For example, p_max=6 (110), p_j=3 (011), p_max OR p_j = 7 (111).

So, p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max.

But in the permutation, p_max is the largest value, so no p_j can be larger than p_max.

Wait, but p_max OR p_j can still be larger than p_max, even if p_j < p_max.

So, perhaps I can use this property to find p_j that, when ORed with p_max, gives the largest possible value.

But I need to maximize p_max XOR p_j, not p_max OR p_j.

Wait, but perhaps there's a relationship between OR and XOR that I can exploit.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the p_j that minimizes p_max AND p_j, since p_max XOR p_j = p_max OR p_j - p_max AND p_j.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, p_max XOR p_j = p_max OR p_j - p_max AND p_j.

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

p_max XOR p_j is equal to (p_max OR p_j) - (p_max AND p_j).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, p_max XOR p_j is equal to (p_max OR p_j) - 2*(p_max AND p_j).

Wait, no, that's still not accurate.

Let me recall that p_max XOR p_j is 1 in a bit position where p_max and p_j differ, and 0 where they are the same.

So, to maximize XOR, I need as many differing bits as possible, starting from the most significant bit.

So, perhaps I can try to find p_j such that p_max AND p_j is minimized.

Because if p_max AND p_j is minimized, then more bits differ.

But I need to maximize XOR, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of differing bits.

So, perhaps finding p_j with the smallest p_max AND p_j would help.

But how can I find such p_j using the queries?

Wait, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j equals p_max.

That would mean p_j <= p_max, and p_max AND p_j == p_j.

But I need to minimize p_max AND p_j, so perhaps I need to find p_j where p_max AND p_j is as small as possible.

Wait, but I need to maximize the XOR, which would involve maximizing the number of bits where p_max and p_j differ.

So, I need p_j such that p_max AND p_j is minimized.

Given that, perhaps I can find the p_j where p_max AND p_j is minimized.

But how?

Wait, maybe I can fix a=b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for different j and k.

But p_max OR p_j is equal to p_max if p_j <= p_max, which it always is, since p_max is the maximum.

Wait, but earlier I saw that p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has bits not present in p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j <= p_max.

Wait, but in the earlier example, p_max=6 (110), p_j=3 (011), p_max OR p_j=7 (111), which is larger than p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j cannot be larger than p_max.

Wait, but p_j can be less than p_max but have some bits that p_max doesn't have.

So, perhaps p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max.

But in terms of minimizing p_max AND p_j, I need p_j to have as few bits set that are also set in p_max.

So, perhaps I can look for p_j where p_max AND p_j is as small as possible.

To do that, maybe I can find p_j where p_max OR p_j is as small as possible.

Wait, no, p_max OR p_j being small would imply that p_j has few bits not in p_max, but I need p_j to have bits differing from p_max.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I fix a and b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k.

If p_max OR p_j < p_max OR p_k, then p_j < p_k in terms of the bits they add to p_max.

Wait, but p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has bits not in p_max.

So, perhaps I can find p_j that, when ORed with p_max, give the largest possible value.

But I need to maximize XOR, not OR.

Wait, maybe I'm going in circles here.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

To maximize p_max XOR p_j, I need p_j such that as many bits as possible differ from p_max, starting from the most significant bit.

So, perhaps I can try to find p_j such that the highest bit where p_max has a 1, p_j has a 0, and so on.

But how can I find such p_j using the queries allowed?

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to set bits in p_j to differ from p_max.

But I don't know p_max's binary representation directly.

Wait, but I can infer it through queries.

Wait, actually, no, I don't know p_max's value, only its index.

But I can compare p_max with other p_j to gather information about their relative values.

Wait, perhaps I can find all p_j such that p_max OR p_j equals p_max.

That would mean p_j <= p_max, which is always true, but more specifically, p_j's bits are a subset of p_max's bits.

Then, among those p_j, the ones with the fewest bits set in p_max would maximize the XOR.

Wait, but I need to minimize p_max AND p_j to maximize the XOR.

So, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j == p_max, and then find the p_j with the smallest p_j.

Wait, but smaller p_j would have fewer bits set, which might minimize p_max AND p_j.

But in the earlier example with n=3, p_max=2 (10 in binary), p_j=1 (01 in binary), p_max OR p_j=3 (11 in binary), which is larger than p_max=2.

But in that case, p_max XOR p_j=3, which is the maximum.

Whereas p_max OR p_j=3, which is larger than p_max=2.

So, perhaps I should look for p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

Wait, but in the query, I can only compare p_a OR p_b with p_c OR p_d.

So, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max, and among those, find the one that maximizes XOR.

But how?

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I fix a and b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k.

If p_max OR p_j < p_max OR p_k, then p_j < p_k in terms of the bits they add to p_max.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

Then, among those p_j, find the one that maximizes p_max XOR p_j.

But I still need a way to maximize XOR using the queries.

This seems too indirect.

Maybe I need to consider that for a given p_max, the p_j that maximizes p_max XOR p_j is the one that differs the most from p_max in binary representation.

Given that, perhaps I can find the p_j that has the least number of bits in common with p_max.

In other words, minimize p_max AND p_j.

But again, I need a way to find such p_j using the queries.

Wait, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j == p_max, meaning p_j <= p_max, and then find the p_j with the smallest value, which would minimize p_max AND p_j.

But in the earlier example with n=3, p_max=2 (10 in binary), p_j=0 (00 in binary) would have p_max AND p_j=0, but p_max XOR p_j=2.

However, p_j=1 (01 in binary) gives p_max XOR p_j=3, which is larger.

So, minimizing p_max AND p_j doesn't necessarily give the maximum XOR.

Hmm.

So, perhaps I need to look for p_j where p_max AND p_j is minimized, but also p_max OR p_j is maximized.

Wait, but p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has bits not in p_max.

But in the permutation, since p_max is the maximum, p_j cannot have bits higher than p_max.

Wait, but in the earlier example, p_max=2 (10 in binary), p_j=1 (01 in binary), p_max OR p_j=3 (11 in binary), which is larger than p_max=2.

But in the permutation, p_j=1 < p_max=2.

So, it's possible for p_max OR p_j to be larger than p_max.

Given that, perhaps I should look for p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

But since p_max is fixed, p_max OR p_j is maximized when p_j has as many additional bits as possible compared to p_max.

But since p_max is the maximum, and p_j <= p_max, p_max OR p_j can be larger than p_max if p_j has bits not in p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j <= p_max, so p_j cannot have bits higher than p_max.

Wait, but in the earlier example, p_max=2 (10 in binary), p_j=1 (01 in binary), p_max OR p_j=3 (11 in binary), which is larger than p_max=2.

But in terms of maximizing XOR, p_j=1 gives a better result than p_j=0.

So, perhaps I should look for p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

But in that case, for p_j=1, p_max OR p_j=3, and for p_j=0, p_max OR p_j=2.

So, p_j=1 is better.

Hence, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then choose any p_j from there.

But in the earlier example, p_j=1 gives p_max OR p_j=3, and p_j=3 would give p_max OR p_j=3 as well, if p_max=2 and p_j=3=3 (11 in binary), but p_max=2 < p_j=3, which can't happen since p_max is the maximum.

Wait, but in the permutation, p_max is the largest, so no p_j can be larger than p_max.

Wait, but p_j=1 in n=3, p_max=2, p_max OR p_j=3, which is larger than p_max.

But in the permutation, p_j=1 < p_max=2.

So, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then choose any p_j from there.

But I need to make sure that this maximizes XOR.

In the earlier example, p_j=1 gives p_max XOR p_j=3, which is the maximum.

While p_j=0 gives p_max XOR p_j=2.

So, choosing p_j=1 is better.

Hence, perhaps selecting p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized is a good strategy.

But I need to confirm this with another example.

Let's take n=4, p=[0,1,2,3].

p_max=3 (11 in binary).

p_max OR p_j for p_j=0: 3, p_j=1: 3, p_j=2: 3, p_j=3: 3.

So, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3.

But p_max XOR p_j for p_j=0: 3, p_j=1: 2, p_j=2: 1, p_j=3: 0.

So, in this case, p_j=0 gives the maximum XOR.

But according to the earlier strategy, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3, so any p_j would do, but in this case, p_j=0 is the best.

So, perhaps in this case, choosing any p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized works, as p_j=0 gives the maximum XOR.

Wait, but in the earlier n=3 case, p_j=1 was better than p_j=0.

So, perhaps I need to choose the minimal p_j among those where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

Wait, but in n=4, p_j=0 is the minimal, and it gives the maximum XOR.

In n=3, p_j=1 gives better XOR than p_j=0.

But p_j=1 is not minimal.

So, this doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and p_j is minimal among those.

But in n=3, p_j=1 and p_j=0 both give p_max OR p_j=3, but p_j=0 is minimal, and in n=4, p_j=0 is minimal and gives the maximum XOR.

But in n=3, p_j=1 gives a better XOR than p_j=0.

So, perhaps choosing the minimal p_j among those where p_max OR p_j is maximized works.

Wait, but in n=3, p_j=1 and p_j=0 both give p_max OR p_j=3, but p_j=0 is minimal and gives XOR=2, while p_j=1 gives XOR=3, which is better.

So, choosing the minimal p_j doesn't necessarily give the best XOR.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that among all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, I need to find the p_j that minimizes p_max AND p_j.

Because p_max XOR p_j = p_max OR p_j - p_max AND p_j.

Wait, not exactly, but p_max XOR p_j is maximized when p_max AND p_j is minimized.

So, perhaps among all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, I need to find the p_j with the minimal p_max AND p_j.

But how can I find p_j with minimal p_max AND p_j using the queries?

Wait, perhaps I can find all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then find the minimal p_j among them.

Because the minimal p_j would have the least number of bits set, hence minimizing p_max AND p_j.

In n=3, p_j=0 is minimal, but p_j=1 is better for maximizing XOR.

Wait, p_j=0 has p_max AND p_j=0, and p_j=1 has p_max AND p_j=0.

Wait, in n=3, p_max=2 (10 in binary), p_j=0 (00 in binary): p_max AND p_j=0, p_j=1 (01 in binary): p_max AND p_j=0.

So, both p_j=0 and p_j=1 have p_max AND p_j=0.

But p_max XOR p_j for p_j=0 is 2, and for p_j=1 is 3.

So, even with p_max AND p_j being equal, p_j=1 gives a better XOR because it has more bits differing from p_max.

Wait, in this case, p_j=1 has a bit set that p_max doesn't have, which increases the XOR.

Wait, but p_max OR p_j for p_j=1 is 3, which is larger than p_max OR p_j for p_j=0, which is 2.

Wait, no, in n=3, p_max=2 (10), p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), p_j=0 (00), p_max OR p_j=2 (10).

So, p_j=1 gives p_max OR p_j=3, which is larger than p_max OR p_j=2 for p_j=0.

So, in this case, p_j=1 would be selected over p_j=0 because p_max OR p_j is larger.

But in n=4, p_max=3 (11), p_j=0 (00), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), p_j=2 (10), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), p_j=3 (11), p_max OR p_j=3 (11).

So, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3.

Hence, in n=4, choosing the minimal p_j among those would give p_j=0, which is the best.

But in n=3, choosing the minimal p_j among those where p_max OR p_j=3 would give p_j=1, which is better than p_j=0.

Wait, no, in n=3, p_j=1 and p_j=0 both give p_max OR p_j=3.

But p_j=0 gives p_max OR p_j=2, which is less than 3.

Wait, no, p_max=2 (10), p_j=0 (00), p_max OR p_j=2 (10), p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11).

So, only p_j=1 gives p_max OR p_j=3, while p_j=0 gives p_max OR p_j=2.

Hence, in n=3, only p_j=1 satisfies p_max OR p_j=3.

Hence, in this case, selecting p_j=1 is straightforward.

But in n=4, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3.

Hence, I need a different approach for different cases.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a and b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for different j and k.

If p_max OR p_j < p_max OR p_k, then p_j has fewer bits not in p_max compared to p_k.

Wait, but p_max OR p_j < p_max OR p_k implies that p_j has fewer bits not in p_max.

But I need to maximize XOR, which is related to differing bits.

This is still confusing.

Let me consider that for maximizing XOR, I need p_j to have as many bits as possible that are not in p_max.

Hence, p_j should have bits unset where p_max has them set, and bits set where p_max has them unset.

But I need to find such p_j using the queries.

Wait, perhaps I can find the p_j that minimizes p_max AND p_j.

To do that, I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then choose the p_j with the smallest value among them.

But in n=3, p_j=1 is the only one where p_max OR p_j=3, and it's better than p_j=0.

In n=4, p_j=0 is the minimal among those where p_max OR p_j=3, and it's the best.

But in n=3, p_j=1 is better than p_j=0.

So, perhaps choosing the minimal p_j among those where p_max OR p_j is maximized works.

But in n=3, p_j=1 is not minimal, but it's the only one where p_max OR p_j=3.

Wait, no, in n=3, p_j=1 is the only one where p_max OR p_j=3.

Hence, I have to choose p_j=1.

In n=4, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3, so I can choose the minimal p_j=0.

Hence, perhaps selecting the minimal p_j among those where p_max OR p_j is maximized is a good strategy.

But I need to confirm this.

In n=3, p_j=1 is the only one where p_max OR p_j=3, so I have to choose it.

In n=4, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3, so choose the minimal p_j=0.

In both cases, this seems to work.

Hence, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then choose the minimal p_j among them.

To find the minimal p_j among those, I can compare p_j with each other.

But I need to make sure that I don't exceed the query limit.

Given that, perhaps I can first find the maximum value p_max, then find all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then find the minimal p_j among those.

To find the minimal p_j among those, I can perform a tournament to find the minimal p_j.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I don't exceed the query limit.

Given that, perhaps I can first find p_max, then find all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and then find the minimal p_j among those.

But how do I find all p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized?

I can compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k.

But I need to do this efficiently within the query limit.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a and b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for all j and k.

But that would require n^2 queries, which is too many.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that p_max OR p_j is maximized when p_j has as many bits set that are not in p_max.

Hence, to maximize p_max OR p_j, p_j should have bits set that p_max doesn't have.

But since p_max is the maximum, p_j cannot have bits higher than p_max.

Wait, but in the earlier example, p_max=2 (10), p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), which is larger than p_max=2.

So, p_j=1 adds a bit not present in p_max.

Hence, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

But in n=4, p_max=3 (11), p_j=0 (00), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), which is equal to p_max.

p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), equal to p_max.

p_j=2 (10), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), equal to p_max.

p_j=3 (11), p_max OR p_j=3 (11), equal to p_max.

Hence, in n=4, p_max OR p_j >= p_max for all p_j.

Similarly, in n=3, p_max=2 (10), p_j=1 (01), p_max OR p_j=3 (11) > p_max=2.

p_j=0 (00), p_max OR p_j=2 (10) == p_max=2.

Hence, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

In n=3, that would be p_j=1.

In n=4, there are no p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

Hence, in n=4, I would have to choose among all p_j.

Then, among those, choose the minimal p_j.

In n=3, p_j=1 is the only one where p_max OR p_j > p_max, so choose p_j=1.

In n=4, all p_j give p_max OR p_j == p_max, so choose the minimal p_j=0.

Hence, perhaps I can collect all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max, and if there are any, choose the minimal p_j among them.

Otherwise, choose the minimal p_j among all.

But in n=3, p_j=1 is better than p_j=0.

But p_j=1 is the only one where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

Hence, in this case, choosing p_j=1 is correct.

In n=4, since no p_j gives p_max OR p_j > p_max, choose the minimal p_j=0.

This seems to work.

Hence, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

- Find p_max.

- Find all p_j where p_max OR p_j > p_max.

- If there are any such p_j, choose the minimal p_j among them.

- Otherwise, choose the minimal p_j among all.

But I need to confirm if this always gives the p_j that maximizes p_max XOR p_j.

Let's take another example.

Suppose n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

p_max=4 (100 in binary).

p_max OR p_j for p_j=0: 4 (100), p_j=1: 5 (101), p_j=2: 6 (110), p_j=3: 7 (111), p_j=4: 4 (100).

So, p_j=1,2,3 give p_max OR p_j > p_max=4.

Hence, among p_j=1,2,3, choose the minimal p_j=1.

p_max XOR p_j=4 XOR 1 = 5.

But is this the maximum possible XOR?

p_max XOR 0 = 4, p_max XOR 1 = 5, p_max XOR 2 = 6, p_max XOR 3 = 7, p_max XOR 4 = 0.

So, the maximum XOR is 7, achieved with p_j=3.

Hence, in this case, choosing p_j=1 gives XOR=5, which is not the maximum.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

So, perhaps I need to choose the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized, and among those, choose the one that maximizes p_max XOR p_j.

But how can I do that using the queries?

Wait, in n=5, p_max=4 (100), p_j=3 (011), p_max OR p_j=7 (111), which is larger than p_max OR p_j for p_j=1 or p_j=2.

Wait, p_max OR p_j for p_j=1:5, p_j=2:6, p_j=3:7.

Hence, p_j=3 gives the largest p_max OR p_j.

Hence, perhaps I can choose the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

In n=5, p_j=3 gives p_max OR p_j=7, which is larger than for p_j=1 or p_j=2.

Hence, choosing p_j=3 would give the maximum XOR.

In n=3, p_j=1 gives p_max OR p_j=3, which is larger than p_j=0 gives p_max OR p_j=2.

Hence, choosing p_j=1 is better.

In n=4, all p_j give p_max OR p_j=3, so choose any p_j.

Hence, perhaps I can select the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

In n=5, p_j=3 gives the largest p_max OR p_j=7, which is better than p_j=1 or p_j=2.

Hence, choosing p_j=3 is better.

Hence, perhaps I can find the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

To do that, I can compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for different j and k.

But I need to do this efficiently within the query limit.

Given that, perhaps I can perform a tournament to find the p_j where p_max OR p_j is maximized.

But since p_max OR p_j is maximized for certain p_j, I can find the p_j that gives the largest p_max OR p_j.

Hence, perhaps I can iterate through all p_j and compare p_max OR p_j with the current maximum.

But I need to implement this using the queries allowed.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a and b as maxi, and compare p_max OR p_j with p_max OR p_k for all j and k.

But that would require n^2 queries, which is too many.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that p_max OR p_j is maximized when p_j has as many bits set that are not in p_max.

Hence, to maximize p_max OR p_j, p_j should have as many additional bits as possible compared to p_max.

Given that, perhaps I can find the p_j that adds the most new bits to p_max.

But how can I find that using the queries?

Wait
