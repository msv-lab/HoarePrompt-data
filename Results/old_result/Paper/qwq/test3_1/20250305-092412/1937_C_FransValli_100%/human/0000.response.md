Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ as much as possible in their binary representation, especially in the higher bits.

Given that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, all values are unique. So, for a given n, I know the range of possible values.

Now, about the queries: I can ask comparisons between (p_a OR p_b) and (p_c OR p_d). The response will tell me which one is larger or if they are equal.

I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the relative values of p_i.

My initial thought is to find the maximum value in the permutation using these queries, since the maximum XOR might involve the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, but actually, the maximum XOR might not necessarily involve the maximum value. For example, if n=3 and p=[0,1,2], then 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is larger than 0 XOR 2 = 2 or 0 XOR 1 = 1. So, sometimes, it's better to have two values that differ significantly in their bits.

However, in general, to maximize XOR, I should look for two numbers that differ in the highest possible bits.

Given that, maybe I should try to identify the numbers with the highest bits set.

Let me think differently. Since I can compare ORs, and OR gives me the union of set bits, perhaps I can use this to rank the values somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum value in the permutation by comparing ORs of single elements with themselves.

Wait, but OR of a number with itself is just the number itself. So, comparing p_a OR p_b with p_c OR p_d is essentially comparing values when a=b and c=d.

So, if I set a=b and c=d, then I'm directly comparing p_a with p_c.

Wait, that seems useful. So, I can use queries of the form ? a a c c to compare p_a and p_c.

This way, I can build a comparison network to find the maximum value in the permutation.

Once I have the maximum value's index, say maxi, then I need to find another index j such that p_maxi XOR p_j is maximized.

Given that p_maxi is the largest, to maximize XOR with it, I probably want p_j to differ as much as possible from p_maxi in its binary representation.

So, perhaps p_j should be as small as possible, or more specifically, have bits unset where p_maxi has them set.

Wait, but that might not always be the case. Maybe I need to look into the binary representation.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=4, and p=[0,1,2,3], which is [0b00, 0b01, 0b10, 0b11].

The possible XORs are:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

2 XOR 3 = 1

So, the maximum XOR is 3, achieved by (0,3), (1,2).

Another example, n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

Binary: [0b000, 0b001, 0b010, 0b011, 0b100]

Possible XORs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

0 XOR 4 = 4

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

1 XOR 4 = 5

2 XOR 3 = 1

2 XOR 4 = 6

3 XOR 4 = 7

So, the maximum XOR is 7, achieved by 3 XOR 4.

Wait, but 3 is not the maximum value, 4 is larger, but the maximum XOR is between 3 and 4.

Hmm, so perhaps just finding the maximum value isn't sufficient.

Wait, maybe I need to find the two values that differ the most in their binary representation.

Another approach: Since XOR is maximized when corresponding bits are different, perhaps I can find two numbers that have different bits starting from the most significant bit down.

Wait, but in the second example, 3 is 0b011 and 4 is 0b100. They differ in the highest bit, and also in the other bits, achieving the maximum XOR.

So, perhaps finding the two numbers with the highest values, or more specifically, the two numbers that differ in the most significant bits.

But in the first example, n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the maximum XOR is between 0 and 3, or 1 and 2.

Wait, 0 is 0b00, 3 is 0b11; they differ in both bits.

1 is 0b01, 2 is 0b10; they also differ in both bits.

So, in that case, it's between numbers that differ in the highest bits.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the two numbers that have the two different highest set bits.

Wait, but in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], 3 is 0b011 and 4 is 0b100. They differ in the highest bit, and also in the other bits.

So, maybe I need to find the two numbers with the highest values, but ensure that they differ in the significant bits.

Wait, but in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the two highest numbers are 2 and 3, which are 0b10 and 0b11. Their XOR is 0b01, which is not the maximum; the maximum is between 0b00 and 0b11, which is 0b11, or between 0b01 and 0b10, which is also 0b11.

So, perhaps it's better to look for numbers that differ in the most significant bits rather than just being the largest numbers.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum and then find the number that, when XORed with the maximum, gives the largest value.

Wait, but in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], the maximum is 4 (0b100), and 3 is 0b011. 4 XOR 3 is 0b111, which is 7, the maximum possible.

Similarly, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the maximum is 3 (0b11), and 0 is 0b00, 3 XOR 0 is 0b11, which is 3, the maximum possible.

Wait, but in n=5, 4 XOR 3 is 7, which is larger than any number in the permutation.

So, perhaps, once I have the maximum value, I need to find the value that, when XORed with it, gives the maximum possible value.

Wait, but I need to find two indices in the permutation, so I can't create a new value not in the permutation.

Wait, no, I need to maximize p_i XOR p_j, where both p_i and p_j are in the permutation.

So, in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], p_i=3 and p_j=4 give p_i XOR p_j = 7, which is the maximum possible.

In n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], p_i=0 and p_j=3 give p_i XOR p_j = 3, which is the maximum possible.

So, in both cases, the maximum XOR is achieved by selecting the two numbers that differ in the most significant bits.

So, perhaps, after finding the maximum value, I need to find the number that differs from it in as many high bits as possible.

But how do I find that?

Wait, perhaps I can find the number that has the highest possible XOR with the maximum value.

But I need to do this using the queries that compare ORs.

Wait, maybe I can first find the maximum value in the permutation, and then find the number that maximizes the XOR with this maximum value.

To find the maximum value, I can use the queries to compare elements pairwise and find the largest one.

Once I have the index of the maximum value, say maxi, then I need to find another index j such that p_maxi XOR p_j is maximized.

To maximize p_maxi XOR p_j, I need p_j to differ from p_maxi in as many high bits as possible.

But how do I find such a p_j using the queries?

Wait, maybe I can group the remaining elements based on their OR with p_maxi and find the one that gives the highest XOR.

Wait, that seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix p_i as the maximum value, and then try to find p_j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

To maximize p_i XOR p_j, I can consider the binary representation of p_i and try to find p_j that has bits complementing p_i in the high-order bits.

For example, if p_i has the highest bit set, then to maximize XOR, p_j should have that bit unset, and so on for lower bits.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from highest to lowest, and for each bit, determine if setting that bit in p_j would maximize the XOR.

But I need to do this using the queries that compare ORs.

Wait, maybe I can find the element p_j that has the highest possible value when ORed with p_i.

Wait, but ORing p_i with p_j would give me the union of their set bits, which might not directly help with maximizing XOR.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p_i XOR p_j is equal to (p_i OR p_j) - (p_i AND p_j).

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, maybe I can find the element p_j such that p_i OR p_j is maximized and p_i AND p_p is minimized.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

XOR is maximized when the numbers differ in as many bits as possible.

So, for two numbers, the maximum XOR value is achieved when their bits are different.

Given that, perhaps I can find the number that is as different as possible from p_i in terms of bit patterns.

But how do I find that using the queries?

Wait, maybe I can first find the maximum value in the permutation, and then find the minimum value in the permutation, and see if that gives me the maximum XOR.

Wait, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], p_i=3 and p_j=0 gives p_i XOR p_j=3, which is the maximum.

In n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], p_i=4 and p_j=3 gives p_i XOR p_j=7, which is the maximum.

So, in both cases, XORing the maximum value with the minimum value gave the maximum XOR.

Wait, but in n=4, p_i=3 and p_j=2 also give p_i XOR p_j=3, which is the same as p_i XOR p_j=0.

Wait, but p_i=3 and p_j=1 give p_i XOR p_j=2, which is less.

So, in n=4, XORing the maximum with the minimum gives the maximum XOR.

Similarly, in n=5, XORing the maximum with the one before it gives the maximum XOR.

So, perhaps, in general, XORing the maximum value with the minimum value gives the maximum XOR.

Wait, but in n=3, p=[0,1,2], p_i=2 and p_j=0 give p_i XOR p_j=2, while p_i=1 and p_j=2 give p_i XOR p_j=3, which is larger.

Wait, so in this case, XORing the maximum with the minimum doesn't give the maximum XOR.

Wait, in n=3, p= [0,1,2], the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which is 3.

So, in this case, it's not between the maximum and the minimum.

Hmm, so my previous assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for two numbers that differ in the most significant bits, regardless of their individual magnitudes.

So, perhaps, after finding the maximum value, I need to find the number that differs from it in the highest possible bits.

But how do I determine that using the queries?

Wait, maybe I can fix p_i as the maximum value, and then find the p_j that has the highest possible XOR with p_i.

To do that, perhaps I can find the p_j that is as different as possible from p_i in their binary representation.

But I need a way to compare p_j based on their difference from p_i.

Wait, perhaps I can group the remaining elements based on their XOR with p_i, and find the one with the maximum XOR.

But I need to do this using the queries that compare ORs.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that p_i XOR p_j is equal to (p_i OR p_j) - (p_i AND p_j). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can find the p_j that maximizes p_i OR p_j and minimizes p_i AND p_j.

Since XOR is maximized when the numbers differ in as many bits as possible, which would maximize OR and minimize AND.

But I need to find a way to find such p_j using the queries.

Wait, maybe I can first find the p_j that maximizes p_i OR p_j, and among those, find the one that minimizes p_i AND p_j.

But I need to do this indirectly through comparisons of ORs.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about a different approach.

Perhaps I can sort the permutation based on their values using the queries, and then find the two numbers that maximize XOR.

But sorting n elements would require more queries than allowed, since I only have 3n queries.

Wait, but maybe I can find the maximum and second maximum, or something like that.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems like it's finding the maximum value first, and then finding a set of indices that, when compared with the maximum, give a certain condition.

Wait, let's look at the provided code to understand what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

maxi = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

maxi = i

arr = [0]

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

arr = [i]

elif res == '=':

arr.append(i)

mini = arr[0]

for item in arr[1:]:

print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '>':

mini = item

print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)

So, in the first loop, it's finding the index 'maxi' that has the maximum p_i.

It does this by comparing p_maxi with p_i for each i from 1 to n-1.

Then, it seems to be finding a set of indices 'arr' where p_maxi OR p_arr[0] is compared with p_maxi OR p_i.

Wait, it sets arr = [0], and then for each i from 1 to n-1, it compares p_maxi OR p_arr[0] with p_maxi OR p_i.

If p_maxi OR p_i is less, it sets arr = [i], else if equal, appends to arr.

Wait, but p_maxi is the maximum p_i, so p_maxi OR p_j is going to be p_maxi if p_j <= p_maxi, or p_j if p_j > p_maxi.

But since p_maxi is the maximum, p_maxi OR p_j should always be p_maxi.

Wait, but p_maxi is the maximum, so for any p_j, p_maxi OR p_j should be p_maxi, since p_j <= p_maxi.

Wait, but in the code, it's comparing p_maxi OR p_arr[0] with p_maxi OR p_i.

Given that p_maxi OR p_j should be p_maxi for all j, since p_maxi is the maximum, this comparison should always yield equality.

Wait, but in the code, if res == '<', it sets arr = [i], which shouldn't happen because p_maxi OR p_j should always be p_maxi.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps p_maxi is not necessarily larger than p_j in all cases, but given that we've found the maximum, it should be.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that p_maxi is the maximum.

Wait, let's verify this.

In the first loop, it's finding maxi by comparing p_maxi with p_i using OR.

Wait, but as we saw, OR of p_maxi with itself is p_maxi, and OR with any other p_j should be p_maxi if p_j <= p_maxi, or p_j if p_j > p_maxi.

But since p_maxi is the maximum, p_maxi OR p_j should always be p_maxi.

So, in the comparisons ? maxi maxi i i, it should always return '=' because p_maxi OR p_maxi == p_maxi OR p_i.

Wait, but in the code, if res == '<', it sets maxi = i.

But according to the above, it should always be '='.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps the comparison is not p_maxi OR p_i, but something else.

Wait, no, according to the problem, ? a b c d compares (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

So, in ? maxi maxi i i, it's comparing (p_maxi OR p_maxi) with (p_i OR p_i), which is p_maxi with p_i.

Given that p_maxi is the maximum, and p_i <= p_maxi, p_i OR p_i == p_i, and p_maxi OR p_maxi == p_maxi.

So, if p_i <= p_maxi, then p_i < p_maxi, so res should be '<' if p_i < p_maxi, and '=' if p_i == p_maxi.

Wait, but p_i == p_maxi only if i == maxi.

So, for i != maxi, p_i < p_maxi, so p_i OR p_i == p_i < p_maxi == p_maxi OR p_maxi.

Hence, res == '<'.

Wait, but in the code, for i in range(1, n):

print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

maxi = i

But according to the above, for i != maxi, res should be '<', meaning p_i < p_maxi, so no need to set maxi = i.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, maybe the code is trying to find the maximum value incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps it's intended to find the maximum value by comparing p_maxi with p_i, and if p_i > p_maxi, set maxi = i.

But according to the comparison, ? maxi maxi i i, it compares p_maxi OR p_maxi with p_i OR p_i.

If p_i > p_maxi, then p_i OR p_i == p_i > p_maxi == p_maxi OR p_maxi, so res == '>'.

But in the code, it sets maxi = i only if res == '<', which would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the comparison result.

Let's check the problem statement again.

It says:

- "<" if (p_a OR p_b) < (p_c OR p_d)

- "=" if (p_a OR p_b) == (p_c OR p_d)

- ">" if (p_a OR p_b) > (p_c OR p_d)

So, in ? maxi maxi i i, it's comparing (p_maxi OR p_maxi) with (p_i OR p_i).

If p_i < p_maxi, then p_i OR p_i == p_i < p_maxi == p_maxi OR p_maxi, so res == '<'

If p_i == p_maxi, then p_i OR p_i == p_maxi OR p_maxi, so res == '='

If p_i > p_maxi, then p_i OR p_i == p_i > p_maxi == p_maxi OR p_maxi, so res == '>'

So, in the code, if res == '<', it means p_i < p_maxi, which is expected for i != maxi.

But in the code, it sets maxi = i only if res == '<', which would be setting maxi to a smaller value, which is incorrect.

It should set maxi = i only if res == '>', meaning p_i > p_maxi.

So, there seems to be a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the code.

Let me check the code again.

It says:

if res == '<':

maxi = i

But according to the above, it should be:

if res == '>':

maxi = i

Otherwise, it's selecting smaller values instead of larger ones.

This seems like an error.

Wait, perhaps it's intended for a different purpose.

But if it's intended to find the maximum value, it should set maxi = i only when res == '>', indicating p_i > p_maxi.

So, this seems like a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct for some reason I'm missing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have n=4 and p=[0,3,1,2].

In the first step, maxi is set to 0.

Then, for i=1:

? 0 0 1 1

This compares p_0 OR p_0 = 0 with p_1 OR p_1 = 3.

Since 0 < 3, res == '<', so maxi = 1.

Then, for i=2:

? 1 1 2 2

This compares p_1 OR p_1 = 3 with p_2 OR p_2 = 1.

Since 3 > 1, res == '>', so maxi remains 1.

Then, for i=3:

? 1 1 3 3

This compares p_1 OR p_1 = 3 with p_3 OR p_3 = 2.

Since 3 > 2, res == '>', so maxi remains 1.

So, maxi is correctly set to 1, which is the index of the maximum value 3.

Wait, but according to the code, it sets maxi = i when res == '<', which in this case didn't happen because for i=1, res == '<' and maxi was set to 1, and for i=2 and i=3, res == '>', so maxi remained 1.

Wait, but in the first step, maxi is set to 0.

Then, for i=1, ? 0 0 1 1: 0 OR 0 = 0 vs. 3 OR 3 = 3, so res == '<', so maxi =1.

Then, for i=2, ? 1 1 2 2: 3 OR 3 =3 vs. 1 OR 1=1, so res == '>', but the code doesn't set maxi to i when res == '>', so maxi remains 1.

Similarly, for i=3, ? 1 1 3 3: 3 OR 3=3 vs. 2 OR 2=2, so res == '>', again no change to maxi.

So, in this case, maxi is correctly set to 1.

Wait, but in this specific case, it worked because res == '<' only when p_i > p_maxi.

But according to the code, it sets maxi = i when res == '<', which seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps in the problem description, the comparison result is defined differently.

Let me check again.

It says:

- "<" if (p_a OR p_b) < (p_c OR p_d)

- "=" if (p_a OR p_b) == (p_c OR p_d)

- ">" if (p_a OR p_b) > (p_c OR p_d)

So, in ? a b c d, if (p_a OR p_b) < (p_c OR p_d), it returns "<"

Similarly, if (p_a OR p_b) > (p_c OR p_d), it returns ">"

So, in ? maxi maxi i i:

- If p_maxi OR p_maxi < p_i OR p_i, then p_maxi < p_i, so res == '<'

- If p_maxi OR p_maxi > p_i OR p_i, then p_maxi > p_i, so res == '>'

- If p_maxi OR p_maxi == p_i OR p_i, then p_maxi == p_i, so res == '='

So, in the code, if res == '<', it means p_i > p_maxi, so it sets maxi = i.

Wait, so actually, it's working correctly in this example because res == '<' indicates p_i > p_maxi, so updating maxi to i is correct.

Wait, but in general, is this correct?

Suppose p_maxi is the current maximum, and p_i > p_maxi, then ? maxi maxi i i would give "<", so set maxi = i, which is correct.

If p_i < p_maxi, then ? maxi maxi i i would give ">", but the code doesn't set maxi = i in this case, which is correct.

If p_i == p_maxi, it gives "=", and no change to maxi, which is also correct.

So, actually, the code seems correct in finding the index maxi with the maximum p_maxi.

Ok, so the first loop finds the index maxi with the maximum p_maxi.

Then, it initializes arr = [0]

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

? maxi arr[0] maxi i

This compares (p_maxi OR p_arr[0]) with (p_maxi OR p_i)

Then:

- if res == '<': arr = [i]

- elif res == '=': arr.append(i)

So, what does this mean?

Given that p_maxi is the maximum, p_maxi OR p_j is equal to p_maxi for any j, because p_j <= p_maxi.

So, p_maxi OR p_arr[0] == p_maxi

And p_maxi OR p_i == p_maxi

So, comparing them should always give '='

Hence, it should always append i to arr.

Wait, but in the code, if res == '<', it sets arr = [i], else if res == '=', it appends i.

But according to the above, res should always be '=', so arr should include all i from 1 to n-1.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem:

n=4, p=[0,3,1,2]

maxi=1 (p_maxi=3)

arr=[0]

for i=1:

? 1 1 1 1: p1 OR p1 =3 vs p1 OR p1=3, so res=='=', arr=[0,1]

for i=2:

? 1 1 1 2: p1 OR p1=3 vs p1 OR p2=3 OR 1=3, so res=='=', arr=[0,1,2]

for i=3:

? 1 1 1 3: p1 OR p1=3 vs p1 OR p3=3 OR 2=3, so res=='=', arr=[0,1,2,3]

So, arr includes all indices.

Wait, but in the problem's example interaction:

Input:

4

<

=

>

Output:

? 0 2 3 1

? 1 1 2 3

? 1 2 0 3

! 3 2

! 0 1

Wait, but in the code, it's doing something different.

Wait, perhaps the example interaction is just an example, and the code is different.

Anyway, in the code, arr ends up containing all indices where p_maxi OR p_j == p_maxi OR p_arr[0], which should be all j, since p_maxi is the maximum.

Wait, but in the code, it sets arr = [0], then for each i from 1 to n-1, if ? maxi arr[0] maxi i gives '<', set arr = [i], else if '=', append i to arr.

But according to earlier reasoning, it should always give '=', so arr should include all indices.

Wait, but in the example interaction, it seems like it's not the case.

Wait, perhaps there's something wrong with this part of the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the intent is different.

Wait, perhaps p_maxi is not necessarily larger than p_j in all cases.

Wait, no, p_maxi is the maximum.

Wait, perhaps the intent is to find all j where p_maxi OR p_j == p_maxi OR p_arr[0], which should be all j, since p_maxi is the maximum.

But then, why do this step?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Then, it sets mini = arr[0], which is 0.

Then, for each item in arr[1:], it compares p_mini OR p_mini with p_item OR p_item.

So, ? mini mini item item

This compares p_mini OR p_mini with p_item OR p_item, which is p_mini with p_item, since OR with itself is itself.

Then, if res == '>', set mini = item.

So, it's finding the smallest p_item in arr.

Wait, because if p_mini < p_item, then p_mini OR p_mini < p_item OR p_item, so res == '<', not '>'

Wait, let's see:

If p_mini < p_item, then p_mini < p_item, so p_mini OR p_mini < p_item OR p_item, so res == '<'

If p_mini > p_item, then p_mini OR p_mini > p_item OR p_item, so res == '>'

If p_mini == p_item, then p_mini OR p_mini == p_item OR p_item, so res == '='

So, in the code, if res == '>', set mini = item.

Which means, it's setting mini to the smallest p_item in arr.

Wait, but res == '>' indicates p_mini OR p_mini > p_item OR p_item, meaning p_mini > p_item, so set mini = item, which is correct for finding the minimum.

So, overall, it's finding the index maxi with the maximum p_maxi, then finding the minimum p_item in arr, which includes all j where p_maxi OR p_j == p_maxi OR p_arr[0], which should be all j since p_maxi is the maximum.

Then, it prints ! maxi mini.

So, in the example with n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], maxi=1 (p_maxi=3), arr=[0,1,2,3], mini=0.

Then, it prints ! 1 0, which corresponds to p_maxi=3 and p_j=0, which gives XOR=3, which is correct.

In another case, n=2, p=[0,1], maxi=1 (p_maxi=1), arr=[0,1], mini=0, prints !1 0, which is correct.

So, in this approach, it's selecting the maximum and the minimum values, which seems to work in these examples.

But earlier, I thought that in some cases, XOR is maximized between other pairs, but in these examples, it works.

Wait, in n=3, p=[0,1,2], maxi=2 (p_maxi=2), arr=[0,1,2], mini=0, !2 0, which gives XOR=2, but in reality, XOR between 1 and 2 is 3, which is larger.

Wait, so in this case, it's selecting !1 0 in the code, but in n=3, p=[0,1,2], maxi=1 (p_maxi=1), arr=[0,1,2], mini=0, !1 0, which gives XOR=1, but the maximum XOR is 3.

Wait, but according to the code, in n=3, it would set maxi=1 (p_maxi=1), then arr=[0], then for i=1, ?1 0 1 1: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p1=1, so '=' , arr=[0,1]

for i=2, ?1 0 1 2: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p2=1 OR 2=3, so '<', set arr=[2]

Then, mini=2, and compare ?2 2 vs ?2 2, which is '=', so mini remains 2.

Then, print !1 2, which is p1=1 and p2=2, XOR=3, which is correct.

So, in this case, it works.

Wait, so in n=3, p=[0,1,2], maxi=1 (p_maxi=1)

First, arr=[0]

for i=1:

?1 0 1 1: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p1=1, so '=', arr=[0,1]

for i=2:

?1 0 1 2: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p2=1 OR 2=3, so '<', set arr=[2]

Then, mini=2

Then, print !1 2, which is correct.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, but according to earlier thinking, in n=3, p=[0,1,2], maxi=1 (p_maxi=1), then arr=[0,1,2], but in the code, for i=2, ?1 0 1 2: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p2=1 OR 2=3, so res=='<', set arr=[2]

Wait, why is that?

Because p1 OR p0=1, p1 OR p2=3, so 1 < 3, so res=='<', hence set arr=[2]

Then, mini=2, and it's the only item in arr, so print !1 2, which is correct.

Wait, but in general, if p_maxi OR p_j > p_maxi OR p_arr[0], then set arr=[j], else if equal, append j.

So, in this case, p_maxi OR p0=1 OR 0=1, p_maxi OR p1=1 OR 1=1, p_maxi OR p2=1 OR 2=3.

So, initially, arr=[0]

for i=1:

?1 0 1 1: p1 OR p0=1 OR 0=1 vs p1 OR p1=1, so '=', append i=1 to arr, arr=[0,1]

for i=2:

?1 0 1 2: p1 OR p0=1 vs p1 OR p2=3, so '<', set arr=[2]

Hence, arr=[2], mini=2

Then, print !1 2, which is correct.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, but in another case, n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], maxi=1 (p_maxi=3), arr=[0,1,2,3], mini=0, which is correct.

Wait, but in n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], p1=3, p0=0, p2=1, p3=2

Then, ?1 0 1 1: p1 OR p0=3 OR 0=3 vs p1 OR p1=3, so '=', append i=1 to arr=[0,1]

?1 0 1 2: p1 OR p0=3 OR 0=3 vs p1 OR p2=3 OR 1=3, so '=', append i=2 to arr=[0,1,2]

?1 0 1 3: p1 OR p0=3 OR 0=3 vs p1 OR p3=3 OR 2=3, so '=', append i=3 to arr=[0,1,2,3]

Then, mini=0, compare with others:

?0 0 vs ?0 0: '=', no change

?0 0 vs ?1 1: p0 OR p0=0 vs p1 OR p1=3, so '<', no change

?0 0 vs ?2 2: 0 vs 1, '<', no change

?0 0 vs ?3 3: 0 vs 2, '<', no change

Hence, mini=0

Then, print !1 0, which is correct.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, but in n=3, p=[0,1,2], it worked as well.

But in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], p_maxi=4, arr=[0,1,2,3,4], mini=0

Then, print !4 0, which is p4=4 XOR p0=0=4, but the maximum XOR is p3=3 XOR p4=4=7.

So, in this case, it's not selecting the correct pair.

Wait, but according to the code, it sets arr=[0,1,2,3,4], then mini=0, but actually, p4 OR p0=4 OR 0=4, p4 OR p1=4 OR 1=5, p4 OR p2=4 OR 2=6, p4 OR p3=4 OR 3=7.

So, in the second loop:

arr=[0]

for i=1:

?4 0 4 1: p4 OR p0=4 vs p4 OR p1=5, so '<', set arr=[1]

for i=2:

?4 1 4 2: p4 OR p1=5 vs p4 OR p2=6, so '<', set arr=[2]

for i=3:

?4 2 4 3: p4 OR p2=6 vs p4 OR p3=7, so '<', set arr=[3]

for i=4:

?4 3 4 4: p4 OR p3=7 vs p4 OR p4=4, so '>', arr remains [3]

Hence, arr=[3], mini=3

Then, print !4 3, which is correct, p4=4 XOR p3=3=7, which is the maximum.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, so in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], it correctly selects !4 3.

Earlier, I thought it would select !4 0, but according to the code, it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

In the second loop, it sets arr=[0], then for each i from 1 to n-1, compares ? maxi arr[0] maxi i

So, in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], maxi=4 (p_maxi=4)

arr=[0]

for i=1:

?4 0 4 1: p4 OR p0=4 vs p4 OR p1=5, so '<', set arr=[1]

for i=2:

?4 1 4 2: p4 OR p1=5 vs p4 OR p2=6, so '<', set arr=[2]

for i=3:

?4 2 4 3: p4 OR p2=6 vs p4 OR p3=7, so '<', set arr=[3]

for i=4:

?4 3 4 4: p4 OR p3=7 vs p4 OR p4=4, so '>', no change to arr=[3]

Then, mini=3, and print !4 3, which is correct.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, so perhaps this approach is correct.

Let me see another example.

n=6, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5]

maxi=5 (p_maxi=5)

arr=[0]

for i=1:

?5 0 5 1: p5 OR p0=5 OR 0=5 vs p5 OR p1=5 OR 1=5, so '=', arr=[0,1]

for i=2:

?5 0 5 2: p5 OR p0=5 vs p5 OR p2=5 OR 2=7, so '<', set arr=[2]

for i=3:

?5 2 5 3: p5 OR p2=7 vs p5 OR p3=5 OR 3=7, so '=', arr=[2,3]

for i=4:

?5 2 5 4: p5 OR p2=7 vs p5 OR p4=5 OR 4=5, so '>', no change to arr=[2,3]

for i=5:

?5 2 5 5: p5 OR p2=7 vs p5 OR p5=5, so '>', no change to arr=[2,3]

Then, mini=2

compare with 3:

?2 2 vs ?3 3: p2 OR p2=2 vs p3 OR p3=3, so '<', set mini=3

Then, print !5 3, which is p5=5 XOR p3=3=6, but the maximum XOR is between p4=4 and p5=5, which is 1.

Wait, no, 4 XOR 5 is 1, which is less than 5 XOR 3=6.

Wait, but 5 XOR 3=6, but 2 XOR 5=7, which is larger.

Wait, p2=2 XOR p5=5=7, which is larger.

So, in this case, the code selects !5 3, which is XOR=6, but the maximum is
