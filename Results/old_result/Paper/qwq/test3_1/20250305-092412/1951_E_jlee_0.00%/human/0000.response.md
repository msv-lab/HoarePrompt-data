Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of substrings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], right?

My task is to find at least one such partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

First test case:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

So, the entire string "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so partitioning it into a single substring satisfies the condition.

Second test case:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

Here, every possible substring of "lllllllll" is a palindrome because all characters are 'l'. So, there's no way to partition this string into substrings that are not palindromes.

Third test case:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

In this case, the string can be partitioned into three substrings: "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

Alright, so I need to devise a way to check if such a partition exists for any given string.

Let me think about the constraints:

- The string can be up to 10^6 characters long, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, but the sum of lengths of all strings across test cases is up to 10^6. So, I need an efficient solution, probably linear time per test case.

First, I need a way to check if a string is a palindrome. That's straightforward: compare the string with its reverse.

But checking every possible partition is not feasible due to the length of the strings.

I need a smarter approach.

Let's consider that if the entire string is not a palindrome, then partitioning it into a single substring satisfies the condition. So, in that case, the answer is "YES" with k=1.

If the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to see if I can partition it into smaller substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, if the string consists of all identical characters, like "aaaaa", then any substring will be a palindrome, so the answer is "NO".

Similarly, if the string has some variation, maybe I can find a way to partition it such that none of the parts is a palindrome.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for a string to not be a palindrome, there must be at least one position where the character doesn't match its corresponding character from the end.

So, if a string is not a palindrome, I can partition it into a single substring.

If it is a palindrome, I need to partition it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, even if the whole string is a palindrome, some of its substrings might not be palindromes.

For example, "abba" is a palindrome, but "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes. So, partitioning "abba" into "ab" and "ba" would satisfy the condition.

Similarly, "abcba" is a palindrome, but "ab", "c", and "ba" are not palindromes.

Wait, "c" is a palindrome because it's a single character.

Oh, single-character strings are palindromes.

So, in that case, partitioning "abcba" into "ab", "c", "ba" includes a palindrome ("c").

So, that won't work.

I need to ensure that none of the substrings is a palindrome.

So, for single-character substrings, that's not allowed.

So, in "abcba", I need to partition it into substrings of at least two characters, and none of them should be palindromes.

Is that possible?

"ab", "cb", "a" — "ab" is not a palindrome, "cb" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome.

So, that doesn't work.

"abc", "ba" — "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome. This works.

So, in this case, partitioning into "abc" and "ba" satisfies the condition.

So, for palindromic strings, I need to check if they can be partitioned into substrings of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

Wait, but the problem allows substrings of any length, including length 1, as long as they are not palindromes.

But single-character substrings are palindromes, so they are not allowed.

Therefore, for palindromic strings, I need to partition them into substrings of length >=2, none of which are palindromes.

So, the key is to check if a palindromic string can be partitioned into substrings of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

If the string is not a palindrome, I can partition it into a single substring.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to see if I can partition it into substrings of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

Furthermore, if the string consists of all identical characters, like "aaaaa", then any substring of length >=2 is still a palindrome, so in that case, it's impossible.

So, I need to handle these cases appropriately.

Let me try to formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. For each test case:

a. Read the string s.

b. If s is not a palindrome, output "YES", k=1, and the entire string s.

c. If s is a palindrome:

i. Check if all characters in s are the same. If yes, output "NO".

ii. Otherwise, try to find a partition into substrings of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

- One way to do this is to iterate through the string and partition it into substrings of length 2 or more, ensuring that none of them is a palindrome.

- Since the entire string is a palindrome, but not all characters are the same, there must be some positions where the characters differ.

- I need to find a way to split the string such that each substring is not a palindrome.

- Perhaps splitting at positions where the characters differ from their counterparts from the end would help.

- Wait, but I need to ensure that the substrings themselves are not palindromes.

- Maybe I can always partition the string into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For example, if s is a palindrome of even length, splitting it into two equal halves might work, provided that the halves are not palindromes.

- But wait, in a palindrome, the two halves are mirrors of each other, so if I split a palindrome of even length into two equal halves, each half would be a palindrome only if it itself is a palindrome.

- Wait, no. In a palindrome, the two halves are mirrors, but each half might not be a palindrome.

- For example, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" — neither is a palindrome.

- In "abcba", splitting into "ab" and "cba" — "ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

- In "racecar", splitting into "rac" and "ecar" — "rac" is not a palindrome, "ecar" is not a palindrome.

- So, in general, for a palindromic string of even length, splitting into two equal halves should give two substrings that are not palindrimes, unless the halves themselves are palindromes.

- But, in the cases where the halves are palindromes, perhaps splitting differently would work.

- For example, "aabbcc", which is a palindrome, splitting into "aabb" and "cc" — "aabb" is not a palindrome, "cc" is a palindrome — not acceptable.

- So, in this case, splitting into "aa" and "bbcc" — "aa" is a palindrome, which is not acceptable.

- Alternatively, splitting into "aab" and "bcc" — "aab" is not a palindrome, "bcc" is not a palindrome.

- So, in this case, it works.

- So, perhaps splitting into two unequal parts is a way to go.

- But I need a general approach.

- Maybe, for a palindromic string, if I can find a position i (1 <= i < n) such that both s[0..i-1] and s[i..n-1] are not palindromes, then partitioning at that position would work.

- So, I need to find at least one position to split the string such that neither part is a palindrome.

- Given that the entire string is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there should exist such a position.

- Let me think about this.

- Suppose s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same.

- Then, there exists at least one position where the characters differ from their counterparts from the end.

- Wait, in a palindrome, by definition, characters are symmetric around the center.

- So, if not all characters are the same, then there must be positions where the characters differ from their counterparts from the end, but only if the string has even length.

- Wait, no. In a palindrome with all characters the same, all characters are equal to their counterparts from the end.

- If not all characters are the same, then there must be at least one position where s[j] != s[n-1-j], but since it's a palindrome, this cannot happen.

- Wait, that's contradictory.

- Actually, in a palindrome, s[j] always equals s[n-1-j] for all j.

- So, if not all characters are the same, it doesn't imply that s[j] != s[n-1-j] for some j; in a palindrome, s[j] == s[n-1-j] always holds.

- Wait, that's correct. In a palindrome, s[j] == s[n-1-j] for all j.

- So, if not all characters are the same, it means that there are at least two different characters, but in a palindrome, the positions of these characters are symmetric.

- So, in that case, splitting the string into two parts, each part must also satisfy the condition of not being a palindrome.

- So, for example, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" — neither is a palindrome.

- In "abcba", splitting into "ab" and "cba" — neither is a palindrome.

- In "aabbcc", which is "aabccbaa" (I think I miscalculated earlier), wait, "aabbcc" is not a palindrome, because "aabbcc" reversed is "ccbaab", which is different.

- Wait, perhaps I need to consider specific examples more carefully.

- Let's take "abba", which is a palindrome.

- Splitting into "ab" and "ba" — neither is a palindrome.

- "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

- Another example: "racecar".

- Splitting into "rac" and "ecar" — "rac" is not a palindrome, "ecar" is not a palindrome.

- Another example: "abcba".

- Splitting into "ab" and "cba" — "ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

- So, in general, for palindromic strings of length >=2, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome seems possible.

- But I need to ensure that such a split exists.

- If the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, then it's possible to split it into two parts that are not palindromes.

- However, I need to handle the case where the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, in which case, any substring of length >=2 is also a palindrome, so no valid partition exists.

- Additionally, for strings of length 1, which are palindromes, no partition into substrings of length >=2 exists, so the answer is "NO".

- For strings of length 2, which are palindromes (e.g., "aa"), splitting into two single characters is not allowed, so "NO".

- For strings of length 2 that are not palindromes (e.g., "ab"), partitioning into a single substring works.

- For strings of length 3, which are palindromes (e.g., "aba"), splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

- For strings of length 4, which are palindromes (e.g., "abba"), splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

- For strings of length 5, which are palindromes (e.g., "abcba"), splitting into "ab" and "cba" works.

- So, in general, for palindromic strings of length >=3, where not all characters are the same, splitting into two parts works, provided that neither part is a palindrome.

- I need to make sure that when I split, neither part is a palindrome.

- Given that the whole string is a palindrome, and I'm splitting into two parts, under what conditions are the parts not palindromes?

- If the string is a palindrome, and I split it into two parts of unequal lengths, then neither part needs to be a palindrome.

- But I need to confirm this.

- For example, in "abba", splitting into "a" and "bba" — "a" is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

- Wait, no, I need both parts to not be palindromes.

- So, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" — neither is a palindrome.

- Splitting into "a" and "bba" — "a" is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

- So, I need to choose the split positions carefully.

- Perhaps splitting into two parts where neither part is a palindrome is possible for palindromic strings of length >=3.

- I need to implement a way to find such a split.

- Maybe always splitting into two parts of lengths floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2) would work.

- For example, in "abba", n=4, floor(4/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, so splitting into "ab" and "ba" — works.

- In "abcba", n=5, floor(5/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3, splitting into "ab" and "cba" — works.

- In "racecar", n=7, floor(7/2)=3, ceil(7/2)=4, splitting into "rac" and "ecar" — works.

- But, what if splitting at the middle results in one part being a palindrome?

- For example, in "aabbaa", which is a palindrome, splitting into "aabb" and "aa" — "aabb" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome.

- So, that doesn't work.

- So, I need a different split position.

- In this case, splitting into "aab" and "baa" — "aab" is not a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome.

- So, it works.

- So, perhaps choosing different split positions can resolve this issue.

- So, in general, for palindromic strings of length >=3, where not all characters are the same, there exists at least one way to split the string into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- I need to find such a split.

- To implement this, I can try splitting the string at different positions and check if neither part is a palindrome.

- Since the string is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there should be at least one split where neither part is a palindrome.

- To optimize, I can try splitting the string into two almost equal parts and check if neither part is a palindrome.

- If that doesn't work, I can try splitting at other positions.

- For example, in "aabbaa", splitting into "aabb" and "aa" — "aa" is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

- So, splitting into "aab" and "baa" — neither is a palindrome.

- So, that works.

- So, in code, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, I can try splitting into two parts in such a way that neither part is a palindrome.

- To do this efficiently, I can try splitting the string into two parts of lengths floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2).

- Then, check if neither part is a palindrome.

- If one of them is a palindrome, try splitting at a different position.

- For example, in "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works.

- In general, for even-length palindromes, splitting into two equal parts should work, as in "abba" -> "ab" and "ba".

- For odd-length palindromes, splitting into floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2) should work, as in "abcba" -> "ab" and "cba".

- In both cases, neither part is a palindrome.

- So, in code, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, I can split the string into two parts of lengths floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2), check if neither part is a palindrome, and if so, output those parts.

- If for some reason one of the parts is a palindrome, I can try splitting at a different position.

- But, in practice, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, splitting into two parts as described should work.

- Additionally, for strings where all characters are the same, like "aaaaa", any substring of length >=2 is still a palindrome, so no valid partition exists, and I should output "NO".

- For strings that are not palindromes, I can simply output the entire string as a single substring.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

1. String of length 1: e.g., "a"

- It's a palindrome, and since it's length 1, I can't partition it into substrings of length >=2.

- So, output "NO".

2. String of length 2:

- If it's a palindrome (e.g., "aa"), then I can't partition it into substrings of length >=2 without including "aa", which is a palindrome.

- So, output "NO".

- If it's not a palindrome (e.g., "ab"), then partitioning into "ab" works.

3. String of length 3:

- If it's a palindrome (e.g., "aba"), splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

- If it's not a palindrome (e.g., "abc"), partitioning into "abc" works.

4. String with all characters the same: e.g., "aaaaa"

- Any substring of length >=2 is a palindrome.

- So, output "NO".

5. String that is a palindrome but not all characters are the same: e.g., "abba"

- Splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

6. String that is not a palindrome: e.g., "sinktheyacht"

- Partitioning into the entire string works.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4 (number of test cases)

- Sum of lengths of all strings <= 10^6

So, per test case, the string can be up to 10^6 characters.

I need an efficient way to check if a string is a palindrome.

A straightforward way is to compare the string with its reverse, which takes O(n) time.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 10^4, but sum of all n across test cases is up to 10^6, it should be acceptable.

Also, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, I need to split them into two parts that are not palindromes.

I need to check if both parts are not palindromes.

To check if a substring is a palindrome, again, comparing it with its reverse in O(m) time, where m is the length of the substring.

But since n is up to 10^6, and t is up to 10^4, but sum of n across test cases is up to 10^6, it should be fine.

But to optimize, I should avoid unnecessary operations.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

a. Read the string s.

b. Check if s is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES", k=1, and the entire string s.

- If yes, check if all characters in s are the same.

- If yes, output "NO".

- If not, try to split s into two parts that are not palindromes.

- One way is to split s into two parts of lengths floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2).

- Check if neither part is a palindrome.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output "YES", k=2, and the two parts.

- If one of them is a palindrome, try splitting at a different position.

- For example, in "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works.

- Implement a function to check if a substring is a palindrome.

- To optimize, I can precompute the reverse of s and compare.

- But since n is large, I need to handle it efficiently.

- In Python, slicing strings is efficient, so I can do s == s[::-1] to check if s is a palindrome.

- Similarly, for substrings, I can slice and compare.

- But for very large n, this might be slow, but given the constraints, it should be acceptable.

- To further optimize, I can avoid recomputing reverses.

- For example, compute the reverse of s once, and then slice it accordingly.

- But in practice, Python's slicing is optimized, so it should be fine.

- Also, for the all-characters-the-same check, I can check if the set of characters has only one unique character.

- That is, len(set(s)) == 1.

- Now, for splitting, I can try splitting at position floor(n/2).

- Let left = s[0:floor(n/2)]

- right = s[floor(n/2):]

- Check if neither left nor right is a palindrome.

- If both are not palindromes, output them.

- If one of them is a palindrome, try splitting at a different position.

- For example, split at position floor(n/2) + 1.

- But to keep it simple, splitting at floor(n/2) should work in most cases.

- In the example "aabbaa", splitting at floor(6/2)=3 gives "aab" and "baa", neither of which is a palindrome.

- Another example: "abba", splitting at floor(4/2)=2 gives "ab" and "ba", neither is a palindrome.

- For "abcba", splitting at floor(5/2)=2 gives "ab" and "cba", neither is a palindrome.

- Seems consistent.

- So, in code, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, split at floor(n/2) and ceil(n/2), check if both parts are not palindromes, and if so, output them.

- If not, try splitting at a different position.

- But to keep it simple and efficient, splitting at floor(n/2) should suffice.

- If for some reason one of the parts is a palindrome, I can try splitting at position floor(n/2) + 1 or floor(n/2) - 1.

- But in practice, splitting at floor(n/2) should work.

- So, implement that.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

Given that, I need to read t test cases, and for each test case, read the string s.

Then, for each s, perform the checks as described.

I need to handle the input efficiently, considering that the sum of lengths of all s across test cases is up to 10^6.

In Python, reading input efficiently is important for large inputs.

So, I can read all input at once and process it.

But for simplicity, since t is up to 10^4 and sum of n is up to 10^6, reading t and then reading t strings should be acceptable.

Now, let's think about the function to check if a string is a palindrome.

In Python, s == s[::-1]

For checking if all characters are the same, len(set(s)) == 1

Now, for splitting, I can do:

left = s[0 : n // 2]

right = s[n // 2 :]

Then, check if left != left[::-1] and right != right[::-1]

If both are true, output "YES", k=2, and the two parts.

If not, try splitting at a different position.

But, in practice, splitting at n//2 should work for most cases.

Alternatively, I can split into more parts if needed, but splitting into two should suffice.

Now, let's consider another example.

Take "aabccbaa"

- It's a palindrome.

- Not all characters are the same.

- Length is 8.

- Split at floor(8/2)=4: "aabc" and "cbaa"

- Check if "aabc" != "aabc"[::-1] -> "aabc" != "cbaa" -> true

- "cbaa" != "cbaa"[::-1] -> "cbaa" != "aaabc" -> true

- So, both are not palindromes.

- So, splitting into "aabc" and "cbaa" works.

Another example: "abcdcba"

- Length 7

- Split at floor(7/2)=3: "abc" and "dcba"

- "abc" != "cba" -> true

- "dcba" != "abcd" -> true

- So, both are not palindromes.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if splitting at floor(n/2) results in one part being a palindrome?

I need to handle that.

For example, "aabbcc"

- It's not a palindrome, so partitioning into the entire string works.

Wait, "aabbcc" is not a palindrome, since "aabbcc" != "ccbaab"

So, in this case, partitioning into the entire string works.

Another example: "aabbaa"

- It's a palindrome.

- Not all characters are the same.

- Split at floor(6/2)=3: "aab" and "baa"

- "aab" != "baa" -> true

- "baa" != "aab" -> true

- So, both are not palindromes.

- Works.

Another example: "aaaabaaaa"

- It's a palindrome.

- Not all characters are the same.

- Split at floor(9/2)=4: "aaaa" and "baaaa"

- "aaaa" is a palindrome.

- So, this split doesn't work.

- So, I need to try a different split position.

- Try splitting at floor(9/2)+1=5: "aaaab" and "aaaa"

- "aaaab" != "baaaa" -> true

- "aaaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Try splitting at floor(9/2)-1=3: "aaaab" and "aaaa"

- "aaaab" != "baaaa" -> true

- "aaaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Try splitting at floor(9/2)+2=6: "aaaaba" and "aaa"

- "aaaaba" != "abaaaa" -> true

- "aaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- So, none of these splits work.

- Wait, maybe splitting into three parts?

- But the problem allows any number of parts, but preferably two.

- But in this case, splitting into three parts might be necessary.

- For example, "aaaabaaaa" -> "aaaa", "b", "aaaa"

- But "aaaa" is a palindrome, "b" is a palindrome, "aaaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Another way: "aaaa", "baaa", "a"

- "aaaa" is a palindrome, "baaa" != "aaab" -> true, "a" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Another way: "aa", "aab", "aaaa"

- "aa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Another way: "aaa", "ab", "aaa"

- "aaa" is a palindrome, "ab" != "ba" -> true, "aaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Another way: "aaaa", "ba", "aaa"

- "aaaa" is a palindrome, "ba" != "ab" -> true, "aaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- Seems like no valid partition exists.

- But according to earlier logic, since the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I assumed that splitting into two parts would work.

- But in this case, it's not working.

- So, my assumption might be wrong.

- Maybe for some palindromic strings, even if not all characters are the same, splitting into two parts where neither is a palindrome is not always possible.

- In such cases, I need to split into more than two parts.

- But the problem allows any number of parts, as long as none of the parts is a palindrome.

- So, in this case, for "aaaabaaaa", is there a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes?

- Let's try: "aaaa", "b", "aaaa" — but "aaaa" and "b" are palindromes.

- "aaa", "ab", "aaa" — "aaa" is a palindrome, "ab" is not, "aaa" is a palindrome.

- "aa", "aab", "aaa" — "aa" is a palindrome, "aab" is not, "aaa" is a palindrome.

- "a", "aab", "aaaa" — "a" is a palindrome, "aab" is not, "aaaa" is a palindrome.

- "aa", "ab", "aaaa" — "aa" is a palindrome, "ab" is not, "aaaa" is a palindrome.

- "aaa", "a", "b", "aaa" — all are palindromes except "b".

- But the whole partition must consist of non-palindromic substrings.

- So, in this case, it's impossible to partition "aaaabaaaa" into substrings that are not palindromes.

- But according to my earlier logic, since the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I assumed that splitting into two parts would work.

- But in this case, it's not working.

- So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

- Maybe there are palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, but any partition into substrings includes at least one palindrome.

- In such cases, I need to output "NO".

- So, I need a better way to determine if a palindromic string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

- One approach is to try splitting the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- If that's not possible, try splitting into three parts, and so on.

- But this could be time-consuming for large strings.

- I need a more efficient way.

- Let me think differently.

- If a string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, then there exists at least one position where s[j] != s[n-1-j].

- I can use this property to find a way to split the string.

- For example, find the smallest k such that s[k] != s[n-1-k], and split the string at that position.

- Then, check if the resulting parts are not palindromes.

- But I need to think carefully.

- Wait, in "aaaabaaaa", the 5th character (0-indexed) is 'b', which is different from the 4th character 'a'.

- So, k=4 in this case.

- But splitting at k=4 gives "aaaab" and "aaaa".

- "aaaab" != "baaaa" -> true, "aaaa" is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

- So, this split doesn't work.

- Maybe splitting at k=3: "aaa" and "abaaaa".

- "aaa" is a palindrome, which is not acceptable.

- Splitting at k=5: "aaaa" and "baaa".

- "aaaa" is a palindrome, which is not acceptable.

- So, it's tricky.

- Maybe in such cases, it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

- So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

- Maybe for palindromic strings where all characters are the same, or where the string cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings, the answer is "NO".

- In such cases, I need to output "NO".

- So, to generalize:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with k=1 and the entire string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- If successful, output "YES", k=2, and the two parts.

- If not successful, try splitting into more parts.

- If no such split exists, output "NO".

- But to make it efficient, I'll attempt to split into two parts first.

- If that doesn't work, try splitting into three parts, and so on.

- But this could be inefficient for large strings.

- So, perhaps I need a better way to determine if such a partition exists.

- Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if I can find a substring that is not a palindrome, then I can partition the string into that substring and the remaining part, provided that the remaining part is also not a palindrome.

- But this seems too vague.

- Maybe I need to look for a substring that is not a palindrome, and see if the remaining part can also be handled accordingly.

- This seems complicated.

- Perhaps I should stick with the initial approach of splitting into two parts and see if that works.

- If it doesn't work, then output "NO".

- Given time constraints, this seems acceptable.

- In the earlier example of "aaaabaaaa", splitting into two parts didn't work, so output "NO".

- In other cases, splitting into two parts works.

- So, in code, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, try splitting into two parts at floor(n/2).

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- Else, try splitting at floor(n/2) + 1 or floor(n/2) - 1, and check.

- If no split works, output "NO".

- This should be efficient enough.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

I need to write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

In Python, s == s[::-1]

Function to check if all characters are the same: len(set(s)) == 1

For splitting, define left and right as s[0:m] and s[m:], where m = n // 2

Check if left != left[::-1] and right != right[::-1]

If yes, output them.

Else, try m = n // 2 + 1, and check s[0:m] and s[m:]

But in the earlier example, this might not work.

So, perhaps I need a loop to find a suitable m.

But to keep it simple, splitting at m = n // 2 should work in most cases.

If it doesn't, try m = n // 2 + 1

If that doesn't work, output "NO"

In code:

if s == s[::-1]:

if len(set(s)) == 1:

print("NO")

else:

m = n // 2

left = s[:m]

right = s[m:]

if left != left[::-1] and right != right[::-1]:

print("YES")

print(2)

print(left, right)

else:

m = n // 2 + 1

left = s[:m]

right = s[m:]

if left != left[::-1] and right != right[::-1]:

print("YES")

print(2)

print(left, right)

else:

print("NO")

else:

print("YES")

print(1)

print(s)

This seems straightforward.

But I need to test it with the earlier problematic case.

Test case: "aaaabaaaa"

n = 9

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> False

m = 9 // 2 = 4

left = "aaaa"

right = "baaaa"

Check if left != left[::-1] -> "aaaa" != "aaaa" -> False

So, left is a palindrome.

So, try m = 4 + 1 = 5

left = "aaaab"

right = "aaaa"

Check if left != left[::-1] -> "aaaab" != "baaaa" -> True

right == right[::-1] -> "aaaa" == "aaaa" -> True (it's a palindrome)

So, right is a palindrome -> not acceptable.

So, output "NO"

Which is correct, as we saw earlier that no valid partition exists.

Another test case: "abba"

n = 4

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> False

m = 4 // 2 = 2

left = "ab"

right = "ba"

Check if left != left[::-1] -> "ab" != "ba" -> True

right != right[::-1] -> "ba" != "ab" -> True

So, output "YES", k=2, "ab" "ba"

Which is correct.

Another test case: "abcba"

n = 5

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> False

m = 5 // 2 = 2

left = "ab"

right = "cba"

Check if left != left[::-1] -> "ab" != "ba" -> True

right != right[::-1] -> "cba" != "abc" -> True

So, output "YES", k=2, "ab" "cba"

Which is correct.

Another test case: "aabbaa"

n = 6

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> False

m = 6 // 2 = 3

left = "aab"

right = "baa"

Check if left != left[::-1] -> "aab" != "baa" -> True

right != right[::-1] -> "baa" != "aab" -> True

So, output "YES", k=2, "aab" "baa"

Which is correct.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, let's consider another case: "a"

n = 1

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> True

So, output "NO"

Which is correct.

Another case: "aa"

n = 2

s == s[::-1] -> True

len(set(s)) == 1 -> True

So, output "NO"

Which is correct.

Another case: "ab"

n = 2

s == s[::-1] -> False

So, output "YES", k=1, "ab"

Which is correct.

Another case: "abc"

n = 3

s == s[::-1] -> False

So, output "YES", k=1, "abc"

Which is correct.

Seems like this approach covers all cases.

I can implement this logic in code.

Now, let's think about optimizing the input reading.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.read() and splitting into tokens can be faster for large inputs.

But for simplicity, I can read t and then read t strings.

Given that t is up to 10^4 and sum of n is up to 10^6, it should be acceptable.

In code, I can use a loop over t, read each string, and process it accordingly.

Implementing the checks as described.

Now, let's consider the sample input and output to verify.

Sample Input:

3

sinktheyacht

lllllllll

uwuowouwu

Sample Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

NO

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Let's see:

First test case: "sinktheyacht"

It's not a palindrome, so output "YES", k=1, "sinktheyacht"

Second test case: "lllllllll"

It's a palindrome, and all characters are 'l', so output "NO"

Third test case: "uwuowouwu"

It's a palindrome, and not all characters are the same.

Splitting into "uw", "uow", "ouwu"

Each of these is not a palindrome.

So, output "YES", k=3, "uw" "uow" "ouwu"

In my approach, I split into two parts, but the problem allows any number of parts, so splitting into three is also acceptable.

So, my approach would split it into two parts, but the sample output shows splitting into three parts.

But since the problem allows any valid partition, both are correct.

Hence, my approach is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
