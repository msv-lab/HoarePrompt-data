Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand what's going on here.

So, the game setup is that there are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, up to a_n. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile, and then removes k stones from each non-empty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

My task is to determine, for multiple test cases, who wins the game if both players play optimally. The input has t test cases, each with n piles described by their initial stone counts.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. The key point is that on each turn, the player removes the same number k of stones from all non-empty piles. This is different from standard Nim or other games where stones are removed from a single pile per turn.

Let me try to see what happens in a simple case. Suppose there is only one pile with, say, 5 stones. Alice goes first. She can choose k up to the size of the pile, which is 5. So she can choose k=1,2,3,4, or 5. If she chooses k=5, she removes 5 stones from the single pile, emptying it, and Bob has no moves left, so Alice wins.

If Alice chooses a smaller k, say k=1, then she removes 1 stone from the pile, leaving 4 stones. Now Bob can choose k up to 4. If Bob chooses k=4, he removes 4 stones, emptying the pile, and Alice has no moves left, so Bob wins.

Wait, that seems contradictory. If Alice chooses k=5, she wins, but if she chooses k=1, Bob wins. So Alice's optimal choice is to take k=5 and win immediately.

In this case, with only one pile, Alice can always win by taking all stones at once. So for n=1, Alice wins.

Let's consider another simple case: two piles, both with the same number of stones, say 3 and 3.

Alice goes first. She can choose k up to 3. Suppose she chooses k=1. She removes 1 stone from each pile, leaving 2 and 2.

Now it's Bob's turn. He can choose k up to 2. If he chooses k=2, he removes 2 stones from each pile, emptying both piles, and Alice has no moves left, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses k=2 initially, she removes 2 stones from each pile, leaving 1 and 1.

Then Bob chooses k=1, removing 1 stone from each pile, emptying them, and Alice loses again.

If Alice chooses k=3 initially, she removes 3 stones from each pile, emptying both immediately, and Bob has no moves left, so Alice wins.

Again, Alice can win by choosing the maximum possible k that empties all piles in one move.

Wait, but in the example input, there's a case with 5 piles of 3 each. According to this logic, Alice should choose k=3 and win immediately, which matches the first output "Alice".

But in the second example, with piles of 1 and 7, Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has only 1 stone), removes 1 stone from each pile, leaving piles of 0 and 6. Then Bob chooses k up to 6 (the smallest non-empty pile is 6), chooses k=6, removes 6 stones from the pile of 6, emptying it, and Alice is left with no moves (since the other pile is already empty), so Bob wins. This matches the second output "Bob".

In the third example, with piles of 1,3,9,7,4,2,100, Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile is 1), removes 1 stone from each pile, resulting in piles of 0,2,8,6,3,1,99. Then Bob can choose k up to 2 (the smallest non-empty pile is 1, but since one pile is empty, the smallest non-empty is 1, but k must be at most that). Wait, the problem says k must be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.

After Alice's move, the piles are 0,2,8,6,3,1,99. The smallest non-empty pile is 1, so Bob must choose k up to 1. He chooses k=1, removes 1 stone from each non-empty pile, leaving piles of 0,1,7,5,2,0,98. Now Alice chooses k up to 1, removes 1 stone from each non-empty pile, and so on.

This seems tedious. There must be a better way to approach this.

I recall that in impartial games like this, the game state can often be analyzed using the concept of Nimbers or the mex function in game theory. Maybe this game can be reduced to a standard game like Nim.

Let me think about what happens in the game. Each move consists of choosing a k and removing k stones from each non-empty pile. This is equivalent to subtracting k from each pile's stone count, but only if k is less than or equal to the smallest pile's size.

This operation is similar to subtracting the same amount from each pile, which reminds me of the mex function in impartial games.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of Nim heaps, where each pile's stone count corresponds to a heap's size in Nim.

But in standard Nim, players remove stones from a single pile, whereas here, stones are removed from all non-empty piles simultaneously by the same amount.

This seems more similar to the game of Nim with a restriction that the same amount must be removed from all piles.

I need to find a way to determine the game's outcome without simulating the entire game, which would be too time-consuming for large n and large a_i.

Let me consider the properties of the game.

First, if all piles are empty, the current player loses.

Second, the game progresses by reducing the stone counts in piles by the same amount k, where k is at most the smallest non-empty pile.

This seems akin to a numerical subtraction game, but applied to multiple piles simultaneously.

I need to find a way to compute the game's Nimber or to determine if the game is in a winning or losing position for the starting player.

Perhaps I can consider the minimal excludant (mex) of the possible moves.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of moves Alice and Bob can make.

Each move reduces the stone counts in all piles by the same amount k.

This is similar to cutting the same amount from the lengths of multiple items.

I wonder if there's a mathematical way to compute the number of such moves before the game ends.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the piles and see how many times I can perform the operation before all piles are empty.

Let me try sorting the piles in ascending order.

For example, in the first test case: 3,3,3,3,3. Sorted: 3,3,3,3,3. Alice can choose k=3 and remove 3 from each, emptying all piles in one move, so Alice wins.

In the second test case: 1,7. Sorted:1,7. Alice must choose k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in 0,6. Bob chooses k= up to 6, chooses k=6, removes 6 from the remaining pile, emptying it, so Bob wins.

In the third test case:1,3,9,7,4,2,100. Sorted:1,2,3,4,7,9,100. Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in 0,1,2,3,6,8,99. Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, resulting in 0,0,1,2,5,7,98. Alice chooses k=1 again, and so on.

This seems to be proceeding step by step, but it's time-consuming.

I need a smarter way to determine the winner.

Maybe I can think about the number of non-empty piles at each step.

Wait, perhaps the game can be modeled as a Nim game with a certain number of heaps.

In standard Nim, the XOR of the heap sizes determines the winner. But here, the moves are different.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the game in terms of the mex function, where the mex of the possible moves leads to a winning or losing position.

I need to find a way to assign a value to the game state that can help determine the winner.

Let me consider the minimal non-empty pile. In each move, k must be at most this minimal pile's size.

The player can choose any k from 1 up to this minimal size.

After choosing k, each non-empty pile reduces by k stones.

This operation is equivalent to replacing each non-empty pile's size a_i with a_i - k.

This seems similar to a subtraction game, but applied to all piles simultaneously.

I need to find a way to represent the game state in terms of a single value or a combination of values that can help determine the winner.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the game as equivalent to a single pile of stones, where the pile's size is the mex of the pile sizes.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have piles with sizes a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Let me sort them in ascending order: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

In each move, the player chooses k such that 1 <= k <= a_1 (the smallest non-empty pile), and subtracts k from each a_i where a_i > 0.

This continues until all piles are empty.

I need to find out who has the winning strategy.

I recall that in impartial games, the concept of Nimbers can be used to determine the game's value.

Maybe I can model this game as a Nim heap where the heap size is related to the pile sizes.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game as equivalent to a single Nim heap of size equal to the number of piles.

But that seems too simplistic.

Let me consider the example where n=1, a_1=5. Alice can choose k=5 and win immediately. So Alice wins.

For n=2, a_1=1, a_2=7. Alice must choose k=1, which leaves one pile empty and the other with 6 stones. Then Bob chooses k=6, empties that pile, and Alice loses.

For n=2, a_1=2, a_2=2. Alice chooses k=2, empties both piles, and wins.

For n=2, a_1=2, a_2=3. Alice chooses k=2, leaves a_2 with 1 stone. Bob chooses k=1, leaves both piles empty, and Alice loses.

Wait, in this case, Alice chooses k=2, leaving 0 and 1. Then Bob chooses k=1, leaving 0 and 0, and Alice loses.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses k=1 initially, leaving 1 and 2, then Bob chooses k=1, leaving 0 and 1, and Alice chooses k=1, leaving 0 and 0, so Alice wins in this path.

So, depending on the choices, different outcomes are possible.

This suggests that for n=2, a_1=2, a_2=3, Alice can choose k=1 and win, or choose k=2 and lose.

So, to play optimally, Alice should choose k=1 and win.

But according to the earlier analysis, in the second example with n=2, a_1=1, a_2=7, Alice must choose k=1 and loses, while in n=2, a_1=2, a_2=3, Alice can choose k=1 and win.

So, perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of the number of odd piles or something similar.

Wait, maybe I should look for a pattern based on the binary operations or the grundy numbers.

Let me try to compute the grundy numbers for small pile configurations.

For a single pile:

- a=0: terminal position, grundy=0

- a=1: can choose k=1, moving to a=0, grundy=1 (mex of 0 is 1)

- a=2: can choose k=1 (to a=1) or k=2 (to a=0), grundy=0 (mex of {1,0} is 0)

- a=3: can choose k=1 (to a=2), k=2 (to a=1), k=3 (to a=0), grundies are 0,1,0 respectively, mex is 2

Wait, but in this game, choosing k removes k from all piles, not just one pile.

So, computing grundy numbers for single piles might not be directly applicable.

Perhaps I need to think of the game as a combination of multiple piles, where each pile affects the others simultaneously.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider the game as equivalent to a Nim heap where the size is the number of non-empty piles.

Wait, in the first test case, n=5, all piles have a=3. Alice chooses k=3, empties all piles, and wins.

In the second test case, n=2, a=1 and 7. Alice chooses k=1, leaving one pile empty and the other with 6. Then Bob chooses k=6, empties the remaining pile, and wins.

In the third test case, n=7, a=1,3,9,7,4,2,100. Alice chooses k=1, leaving piles of 0,2,8,6,3,1,99. Then Bob chooses k=1, leaving 0,1,7,5,2,0,98. Alice chooses k=1 again, and so on.

This seems to suggest that if there's at least one pile with 1 stone, Alice is forced to choose k=1, which might lead to a losing position.

Wait, in the first test case, all piles have at least 3 stones, so Alice can choose k=3 and win immediately.

In the second test case, there's a pile with 1 stone, so Alice must choose k=1, leading to a position where Bob can win.

In the third test case, there's a pile with 1 stone, but Alice chooses k=1, and the game continues.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

e = set(l)

m = len(l)

if 1 in l:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

It seems that the code checks if 1 is in the list of pile sizes. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

But according to my earlier analysis, in some cases where 1 is in the pile sizes, Alice can still win, depending on the other pile sizes.

Wait, in the first test case, all piles are 3, no 1s, Alice wins by choosing k=3.

In the second test case, piles are 1 and 7, Alice must choose k=1, and Bob wins.

In the third test case, piles include 1, but Alice chooses k=1, and it's not immediately clear who wins, but according to the sample output, Alice wins.

So, the provided code seems incorrect because in the third test case, there is a pile with 1 stone, and it prints "Alice", contrary to the code's logic.

Wait, the code says:

if 1 in l:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

But in the third test case, 1 is in l, and the sample output is "Alice", which contradicts the code's logic.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
