Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, I have a strip of cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'). I need to choose one continuous segment of these cells and paint them all white. After doing this, any black cells in that segment become white, and the white ones stay white. My goal is to make the entire strip white, and I need to find the minimum length of such a segment to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what it means to paint a segment white. If I paint a segment white, all 'B's in that segment become 'W's. So, to make the entire strip white, I need to ensure that all 'B's in the strip are covered by this segment.

Wait a minute, if I paint a segment that contains all the 'B's, then all 'B's will be turned to 'W's, and the rest are already 'W's. So, the whole strip would be 'W's. That makes sense.

Now, I need to find the smallest such segment that covers all the 'B's. In other words, I need to find the smallest continuous range in the strip that includes every 'B'.

Let me think about how to find this range.

I can look for the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B' in the strip. The segment from the leftmost 'B' to the rightmost 'B' would cover all 'B's. The length of this segment would be the position of the rightmost 'B' minus the position of the leftmost 'B' plus one.

Wait, but is there a possibility that there are multiple groups of 'B's with 'W's in between, and I might need to choose a larger segment? For example, if I have 'B W B B W B', the leftmost 'B' is at position 1, and the rightmost is at position 6. If I paint from 1 to 6, that's a segment of length 6, but maybe there's a smaller segment that covers all 'B's.

Hmm, but in this case, painting from 1 to 6 is necessary because there are 'B's at both ends. If I try to paint a smaller segment, say from 2 to 5, then the 'B's at positions 1 and 6 would still be 'B's, so the whole strip wouldn't be white. So, in this case, the minimal segment is from 1 to 6, length 6.

Another example: 'W B B W W B'. Leftmost 'B' is at position 2, rightmost at position 6. If I paint from 2 to 6, that's length 5. But wait, if I paint from 2 to 6, all 'B's are covered, so that should work. Is there a smaller segment? Let's see: if I paint from 3 to 6, the 'B' at position 2 is not covered, so that's no good. If I paint from 2 to 5, the 'B' at position 6 is not covered. So, indeed, the minimal segment is from 2 to 6, length 5.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the segment should be from the leftmost 'B' to the rightmost 'B', which in this case is positions 2 to 6, length 5. That seems correct.

Another example: 'B W W W W W W W W B'. Here, leftmost 'B' is at position 1, rightmost at position 10. So, painting from 1 to 10, length 10, would cover all 'B's. Is there a smaller segment? No, because any smaller segment would miss one of the 'B's.

Wait, but in this case, if I paint from 1 to 9, the 'B' at position 10 is not covered. So, I have to paint from 1 to 10.

Another example: 'B B B B B'. Here, all cells are 'B's. So, to cover all 'B's, I need to paint from 1 to 5, length 5.

Wait, but is there a way to paint a smaller segment and still have all 'B's covered? If I paint from 2 to 4, then 'B's at positions 1 and 5 are not covered. So, no, I need to paint the entire strip, length 5.

Another example: 'W W W W W'. But the problem says that there is at least one 'B', so this case won't happen.

Wait, no, the problem says "it is guaranteed that at least one cell of the given strip is black." So, I don't need to handle all 'W's cases.

Another example: 'B'. Single 'B', so I need to paint segment of length 1.

Another example: 'W B W'. Here, leftmost 'B' is at position 2, rightmost 'B' is at position 2. So, painting from 2 to 2, length 1, which is correct.

Another example: 'W B B W'. Leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost at position 3. Painting from 2 to 3, length 2, which covers both 'B's.

Seems like the general approach is to find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and paint the segment from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B'. The length of this segment would be rightmost - leftmost + 1.

Now, looking back at the code provided:

```python

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

print(func_1())

def func_1():

ma = mi = 0

m = int(input())

s = input()

c = d = 0

l = []

for j in s:

c += 1

if j == 'B':

mi = c

break

for j in s[::-1]:

d += 1

if j == 'B':

ma = len(s) - d

break

return ma - mi + 2

```

Let's analyze this code.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it calls func_1() and prints the result.

In func_1():

- It initializes ma and mi to 0.

- Reads the strip length m and the strip string s.

- Initializes c and d to 0.

- Initializes an empty list l.

- Then, it loops through s to find the first 'B' and sets mi to its position.

- Then, it loops through s in reverse to find the last 'B' and sets ma to its position.

- Finally, returns ma - mi + 2.

Wait, why is it returning ma - mi + 2? Shouldn't it be ma - mi + 1?

In my earlier reasoning, the length of the segment from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B' is rightmost - leftmost + 1.

But here, it's ma - mi + 2.

That seems off by one. Let's check with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

8

6

WBBWBW

1

B

2

WB

3

BBW

4

BWWB

6

BWBWWB

6

WWBBWB

9

WBWBWWWBW

Outputs:

4

1

1

2

4

6

4

7

Let's take the first test case:

n=6, s=WBBWBW

Leftmost 'B' is at position 2, rightmost 'B' is at position 5.

So, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the expected output is 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe positions are 1-based?

In Python, string indices are 0-based, but in the problem, cell numbering is 1-based.

Wait, in the problem, cells are numbered from 1 to n.

In the code, s is a string with indices from 0 to n-1.

So, when finding mi and ma, they are using 1-based indexing.

Let's see:

For s=WBBWBW:

- Positions: 1:W, 2:B, 3:B, 4:W, 5:B, 6:W

So, leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost at position 5.

ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the expected output is 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Let me see how mi and ma are calculated.

For mi:

Loop through s:

c starts at 0.

First character 'W', c=1.

Second character 'B', so mi=1.

Wait, but in the strip, position 1 is 'W', position 2 is 'B'.

So, mi should be 2.

Wait, in the code, c is incremented before checking j=='B'.

So, for s=WBBWBW:

- c=1, j='W' → no change

- c=2, j='B' → mi=2, break

Similarly, for ma:

Loop through s[::-1]:

d starts at 0.

First character 'W', d=1.

Second character 'B', ma=6-1=5, break.

So, ma=5, mi=2, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but expected output is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be ma - mi + 1.

So, 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.

So, the code is wrong here.

Wait, but in the code, it's returning ma - mi + 2, which in this case is 5.

But the expected output is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in how ma and mi are calculated.

Let me check the positions again.

s=WBBWBW

Indices: 0:W, 1:B, 2:B, 3:W, 4:B, 5:W

Positions: 1:W, 2:B, 3:B, 4:W, 5:B, 6:W

So, leftmost 'B' at position 2 (index 1), rightmost 'B' at position 5 (index 4).

ma = 5, mi = 2, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but expected output is 4.

Wait, perhaps the segment from position 2 to 5 is length 4 (positions 2,3,4,5).

So, length is ma - mi + 1 = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.

But the code is returning ma - mi + 2 = 5, which is incorrect.

So, the code is wrong here.

It should return ma - mi + 1, not ma - mi + 2.

Let me check another test case.

Second test case:

n=1, s=B

leftmost 'B' at position 1, rightmost at position 1.

ma - mi + 2 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2, but expected output is 1.

Wait, that's incorrect again.

According to my reasoning, it should be 1 - 1 + 1 = 1, which matches the expected output.

But the code returns 2.

So, again, the code is wrong.

Third test case:

n=2, s=WB

leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost at position 2.

ma - mi + 2 = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2, but expected output is 1.

According to my reasoning, it should be 2 - 2 + 1 = 1, which matches the expected output.

So, the code is incorrect here as well.

Fourth test case:

n=3, s=BBW

leftmost 'B' at position 1, rightmost at position 2.

ma - mi + 2 = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3, but expected output is 2.

According to my reasoning, it should be 2 - 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the expected output.

So, again, the code is returning 3, which is incorrect.

Fifth test case:

n=4, s=BWWB

leftmost 'B' at position 1, rightmost at position 4.

ma - mi + 2 = 4 - 1 + 2 = 5, but expected output is 4.

According to my reasoning, it should be 4 - 1 + 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.

So, the code is returning 5, which is incorrect.

Sixth test case:

n=6, s=BWBWWB

leftmost 'B' at position 1, rightmost at position 6.

ma - mi + 2 = 6 - 1 + 2 = 7, but expected output is 6.

According to my reasoning, it should be 6 - 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the expected output.

So, the code is returning 7, which is incorrect.

Seventh test case:

n=6, s=WWBBWB

leftmost 'B' at position 3, rightmost at position 6.

ma - mi + 2 = 6 - 3 + 2 = 5, but expected output is 4.

According to my reasoning, it should be 6 - 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.

So, the code is returning 5, which is incorrect.

Eighth test case:

n=9, s=WBWBWWWBW

leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost at position 9.

ma - mi + 2 = 9 - 2 + 2 = 9, but expected output is 7.

According to my reasoning, it should be 9 - 2 + 1 = 8, but expected output is 7.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:B, 3:W, 4:B, 5:W, 6:W, 7:W, 8:B, 9:W

leftmost 'B' at 2, rightmost at 8.

ma - mi + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7, which matches the expected output.

But according to the code, ma - mi + 2 = 8 - 2 + 2 = 8, which is incorrect.

So, in all these test cases, the code is returning ma - mi + 2, which is always one more than the correct answer.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

The correct formula should be ma - mi + 1.

So, the error is in the return statement: it should be ma - mi + 1, not ma - mi + 2.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
