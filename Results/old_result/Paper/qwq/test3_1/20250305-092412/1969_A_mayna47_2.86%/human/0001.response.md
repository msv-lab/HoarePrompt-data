Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is represented by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, meaning no one is their own best friend, and best friendships are unique.

2. A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party, and I need to find the minimum number of invitations he has to send to achieve that.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and all p_i are distinct, this forms a permutation of the friends. In other words, it's like a mapping where each friend is mapped to another unique friend.

Given that, I can think of this as a graph where each friend is a node, and there's a directed edge from friend i to their best friend p_i. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this graph will consist of disjoint cycles.

For example, if n=3 and p=[2,3,1], then friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 1. This forms a cycle of length 3.

Similarly, if n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1], it's a cycle of length 4.

If n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4], it might be multiple cycles.

Wait, in the first test case, p=[3,1,2,5,4], so:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

So, friends 1,2,3 form a cycle of length 3, and friends 4,5 form a cycle of length 2.

This seems important because the structure of these cycles will determine how invitations need to be sent.

Now, the condition for a friend to come to the party is that both they and their best friend receive an invitation. But since best friends are unique and form these cycles, I need to think about how to select invitations in these cycles to maximize the number of friends who come, while minimizing the number of invitations.

Wait, actually, the problem is to have at least 2 friends come to the party, and find the minimum number of invitations needed to achieve that.

So, perhaps I should look for the smallest number of invitations that guarantee at least 2 friends come, considering the cycle structures.

Let's consider different cycle lengths and see what's the minimal number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends come.

First, consider a cycle of length 2. For example, friends A and B are each other's best friends.

If I invite both A and B, then both will come because each has invited their best friend. So, with 2 invitations, both come.

If I invite only one of them, say A, then A won't come because B wasn't invited, and B won't come because A was invited but B wasn't. So, no one comes.

Therefore, for a cycle of length 2, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite both, totaling 2 invitations.

Next, consider a cycle of length 3. Let's say friends A, B, C, where A's best friend is B, B's best friend is C, and C's best friend is A.

If I invite A and B, then:

- A will come because B is invited.

- B will come because C is invited.

- C will not come because A is invited but C wasn't.

So, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come (A and B).

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 2 invitations? No, because inviting only one person won't make anyone come, as their best friend wasn't invited.

Therefore, for a cycle of length 3, inviting 2 people is sufficient to have 2 friends come.

Is there a way to have more friends come with more invitations? For example, inviting all 3 would make all 3 come, but that's more than necessary since we only need at least 2.

So, for cycle lengths of 2 and 3, inviting 2 people is sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

Now, what about longer cycles? Let's consider a cycle of length 4. Say friends A, B, C, D, where A's best friend is B, B's best friend is C, C's best friend is D, and D's best friend is A.

If I invite A, B, and C:

- A will come because B is invited.

- B will come because C is invited.

- C will come because D is invited.

- D will not come because A is invited but D wasn't.

So, with 3 invitations, 3 friends come.

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come with fewer invitations? Let's try inviting A and B:

- A will come because B is invited.

- B will come because C is invited.

- C will not come because D is invited but C wasn't.

- D will not come because A is invited but D wasn't.

So, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

Wait, that seems similar to the cycle of 3. So, in a cycle of 4, inviting 2 people is sufficient to have 2 friends come.

Is this generalizable? Let's check a cycle of 5.

Cycle: A->B->C->D->E->A

Invite A and B:

- A comes because B is invited.

- B comes because C is invited.

- C does not come because D is invited but C wasn't.

- D does not come because E is invited but D wasn't.

- E does not come because A is invited but E wasn't.

So, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

Alternatively, inviting 2 people seems sufficient for any cycle length to have at least 2 friends come.

Wait, but in the second test case of the example:

n=4

p=[2,3,4,1]

According to the explanation, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

But according to my earlier reasoning, inviting 2 people should be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

"The i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

Wait, so friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

But in the cycle of length 4, if I invite A and B:

- A comes because B is invited.

- B comes because C is invited.

- C does not come because D is invited but C wasn't.

- D does not come because A is invited but D wasn't.

So, A and B come.

But according to the sample input:

4

2 3 4 1

Output: 3

According to the note, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

But in my earlier reasoning, inviting 2 people (A and B) makes 2 friends come.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the condition.

Wait, no, the condition is: friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

So, in the cycle of 4:

- A comes if A and B are invited.

- B comes if B and C are invited.

- C comes if C and D are invited.

- D comes if D and A are invited.

So, if I invite A and B:

- A comes because A and B are invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited.

- C does not come because C and D are invited, but C wasn't invited.

- D does not come because D and A are invited, but D wasn't invited.

So, A and B come.

But according to the sample explanation, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample explanation.

Looking back:

"Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1,2 and 3, for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2 have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3 won't come since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come."

Wait, according to this, if you invite 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 does not come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 wasn't invited.

- Friend 4 does not come because 4 and 1 are invited, but 4 wasn't invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the explanation, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, inviting just 1 and 2 should make friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the sample explanation, it's impossible with fewer than 3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread the condition again.

Wait, the condition is: the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation.

So, friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

In the cycle of 4:

- Friend 1 comes if 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes if 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 4 are invited.

- Friend 4 comes if 4 and 1 are invited.

So, if I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 does not come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 3 wasn't invited.

- Friend 4 does not come because 4 and 1 are invited, but 4 wasn't invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the sample explanation, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

Wait, but in this case, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

Wait, maybe the sample explanation is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the coming condition.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited.

In the cycle of 4:

- Friend 1 comes only if 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes only if 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 comes only if 3 and 4 are invited.

- Friend 4 comes only if 4 and 1 are invited.

So, if I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 are invited → comes.

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 are invited → comes.

- Friend 3: 3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: 4 is not invited → does not come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the sample explanation, it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that friend 2 does not come because their best friend is 3, who was not invited.

Wait, no, the condition is that both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

So, for friend 2 to come, both 2 and 3 must be invited.

In the above scenario, 2 is invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 2 does not come.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake.

If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 are invited → comes.

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 are invited → but 3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: 3 and 4 are invited → but 3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: 4 and 1 are invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come.

So, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, that's different from my previous conclusion.

I think I messed up.

Let me re-examine:

- If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

So, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, that aligns with the sample explanation now.

So, my earlier mistake was assuming friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited, but actually, since 3 is not invited, friend 2 does not come.

Therefore, inviting 1 and 2 only makes friend 1 come.

Similarly, inviting 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

No one comes.

Inviting 2 and 3:

- Friend 1: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

Only friend 2 comes.

Inviting 3 and 4:

- Friend 1: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is not invited → does not come.

Only friend 3 comes.

Inviting 1,2,3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Similarly, inviting 1,3,4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited → comes.

So, friends 3 and 4 come.

Inviting 1,2,4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited → comes.

So, friends 1 and 4 come.

Inviting 2,3,4:

- Friend 1: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is not invited → does not come.

So, friends 2 and 3 come.

In all cases where at least 2 friends come, it requires inviting 3 friends.

Hence, for n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Similarly, for n=5 with p=[3,1,2,5,4], as in the first test case, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, since:

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=5 is invited → comes.

- Friend 5: invited and p_5=4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 1: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → does not come.

So, friends 4 and 5 come with 2 invitations.

But according to the sample input, the output is 2, which aligns with this.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], the output is 3.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations depends on the cycle structure.

In the first test case, there are two cycles: a cycle of 3 (1,2,3) and a cycle of 2 (4,5). In this case, inviting 2 people (e.g., 4 and 5) makes 2 friends come.

In the second test case, there's a single cycle of 4 (1,2,3,4). In this case, inviting 3 people is necessary to have at least 2 friends come.

So, perhaps for cycles of length 2 and 3, inviting 2 people is sufficient, but for cycles of length 4 and above, inviting 3 people is necessary.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=2 with p=[2,1], which is a cycle of length 2, and the output is 2.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- For cycles of length 2 or 3: inviting 2 people is sufficient.

- For cycles of length 4 or more: inviting 3 people is necessary.

But in the first test case, n=5 with cycles of length 3 and 2, inviting 2 people is sufficient.

But in the second test case, n=4 with a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 people is necessary.

So, perhaps when there are multiple cycles, inviting 2 people from different cycles is sufficient, but within a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 people is necessary.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there are at least two separate cycles.

- 3, if there's only one cycle and its length is at least 4.

Wait, but in the first test case, there are two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2, so inviting 2 people is sufficient.

In the second test case, there's only one cycle of length 4, so inviting 3 people is necessary.

In the third test case, there's only one cycle of length 2, so inviting 2 people is sufficient.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If there are at least two cycles, inviting 2 people (one from each cycle) is sufficient.

- If there's only one cycle:

- Of length 2 or 3: invite 2 people.

- Of length 4 or more: invite 3 people.

But in the first test case, there are two cycles, and inviting 2 people is sufficient.

In the second test case, there's one cycle of length 4, requiring 3 invitations.

In the third test case, one cycle of length 2, requiring 2 invitations.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there are at least two cycles or if there's one cycle of length 2 or 3.

- 3, if there's only one cycle of length 4 or more.

But, to confirm, let's think about a cycle of length 5.

If n=5 and p=[2,3,4,5,1], which is a single cycle of length 5.

To have at least 2 friends come, how many invitations are needed?

If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 5: not invited → does not come.

Only friend 1 comes.

If I invite 1,2,3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 4: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 5: not invited → does not come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Hence, with 3 invitations, 2 friends come.

Is it possible to have 2 friends come with 2 invitations? From earlier attempts, it seems not.

Hence, for a single cycle of length 5, inviting 3 people is necessary to have at least 2 friends come.

Similarly, for a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 people is necessary.

For a single cycle of length 3 or 2, inviting 2 people is sufficient.

When there are multiple cycles, inviting 2 people (one from each cycle) is sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there are at least two cycles or if there's one cycle of length 2 or 3.

- 3, if there's only one cycle of length 4 or more.

Now, how do I determine the number of cycles and their lengths from the given p array?

Given that p is a permutation, I can find the cycle structure of this permutation.

To find the number of cycles, I can perform a cycle decomposition.

Here's how I can do it:

- Initialize a visited array of size n+1.

- Iterate through each friend from 1 to n.

- If the friend hasn't been visited, start a new cycle.

- Follow the p_i pointers until returning to the starting friend.

- Count the number of cycles and the lengths of each cycle.

Then, based on the above rules, decide whether the minimal number of invitations is 2 or 3.

Wait, but in the given program, it seems to handle this differently.

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

v = [0] * (n + 1)

v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

if n == 2:

print(2)

else:

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if v[v[v[i]]] == i:

print(2)

return

print(3)

So, it reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and p array (indexed from 1 to n).

- If n == 2, print 2.

- Else, for each friend i from 1 to n, check if v[v[v[i]]] == i.

- If for any i, v[v[v[i]]] == i, print 2 and return.

- Else, print 3.

So, it's checking for cycles of length 3.

Wait, v[v[v[i]]] == i implies that applying p three times brings us back to i, which is true for cycles of length 3.

So, it's checking if there's any cycle of length 3 in the permutation.

If there is at least one cycle of length 3, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

But according to my earlier reasoning, for cycles of length 2 or 3, inviting 2 people is sufficient, and for cycles of length 4 or more, inviting 3 people is necessary.

But in the provided program, it only checks for cycles of length 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=5 with p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2, and the output is 2.

In the second test case, n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], which is a single cycle of length 4, and the output is 3.

In the third test case, n=2 with p=[2,1], which is a single cycle of length 2, and the output is 2.

So, in the first test case, there's a cycle of length 3, so the program prints 2.

In the second test case, there's no cycle of length 3, so it prints 3.

In the third test case, n=2, so it directly prints 2.

Hence, the program seems to be implementing the rule:

- If n == 2, output 2.

- Else, if there's any cycle of length 3, output 2.

- Else, output 3.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

- If there are at least two cycles or one cycle of length 2 or 3, output 2.

- If there's only one cycle of length 4 or more, output 3.

So, the program seems to be missing the part where there are multiple cycles.

For example, if n=4 with p=[2,1,4,3], which has two cycles of length 2: (1,2) and (3,4).

According to my reasoning, inviting 2 people (one from each cycle) is sufficient, so output should be 2.

But according to the program, there's no cycle of length 3, so it would output 3, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5 with p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2, it prints 2, which is correct.

For n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], which has one cycle of length 4, it prints 3, which is correct.

For n=2 with p=[2,1], which has one cycle of length 2, it prints 2, which is correct.

But consider another test case: n=4 with p=[2,1,4,3], which has two cycles of length 2.

According to the program:

- n != 2.

- Check if there's any cycle of length 3: no.

- Hence, print 3.

But according to the correct logic, inviting 2 people (one from each cycle) is sufficient, so it should print 2.

Hence, the program is incorrect for this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
