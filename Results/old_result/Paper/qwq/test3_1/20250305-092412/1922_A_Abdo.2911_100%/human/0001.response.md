Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template consists of n characters, which can be lowercase or uppercase Latin letters. The matching rules are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th character.

For example, if the template has 'A' at position i, then the string must have a character that is not 'a' at that position.

My task is to find such a template t where both a and b match t, but c does not.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make the template's character at that position lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider position i:

- If I choose the template's i-th character to be lowercase, say 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

- If I choose the template's i-th character to be uppercase, say 'X', then both a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- If the template has 'X' (uppercase), then a[i] and b[i] must be different from 'x' (lowercase), and c[i] must be 'x'.

- If the template has 'x' (lowercase), then a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

So, for each position i, I have two choices for the template: make it lowercase or uppercase.

Let's formalize this.

Define:

- For position i:

- If I choose template[i] to be lowercase 'x', then:

- a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

- If I choose template[i] to be uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position, I have these constraints based on the choice of template[i].

My goal is to choose for each position i whether to make template[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that all these constraints are satisfied across all positions.

But, I need to ensure that the choices are consistent across all positions.

Wait, actually, since the choices for each position are independent, I can handle each position separately.

Wait, no. The choices are independent in the sense that the choice for one position doesn't directly affect the choice for another position. So, I can consider each position independently.

So, for each position i from 1 to n, I can check if it's possible to choose either lowercase or uppercase for template[i] such that the constraints are satisfied.

But, I need to ensure that the same template is used for all strings, meaning that the choice of lowercase or uppercase for each position must work for all three strings simultaneously.

Wait, no. The template is fixed, and then I check if a and b match it, and c does not.

So, I need to choose a single template t, and then verify whether a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Since the template is of length n, and each character can be either lowercase or uppercase, there are 2^n possible templates. But n can be up to 20, so 2^20 is 1,013,264, which is too large to iterate over for each test case, especially since t can be up to 1000.

So, I need a smarter way to determine if such a template exists.

Let me think about the constraints for each position.

For each position i, I have:

- If template[i] is lowercase 'x', then:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

- If template[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Now, I need to choose for each position i whether to make template[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that all these conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but I don't know what 'x' is; 'x' is the character at that position in the template, which I need to decide.

Wait, no. The template is a string of n characters, each of which is a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter.

But in the problem, it says that the template consists of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, and the strings a, b, and c consist of lowercase Latin letters.

So, for each position i, template[i] can be any lowercase or uppercase Latin letter.

But this seems a bit confusing. Let's think differently.

Perhaps I can fix the template's character for each position and see what constraints that imposes on a, b, and c.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate over all possible choices for template[i], given the characters in a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Wait, but with n up to 20 and t up to 1000, iterating over 2^n possibilities is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each position i, there are certain constraints that must be satisfied, regardless of the choices made for other positions.

Wait, perhaps I can find for each position i, whether it's possible to choose template[i] in such a way that the constraints for a, b, and c are satisfied.

Then, if for every position i, there exists at least one choice (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the constraints, then the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it's "NO".

But, I need to ensure that the same template is used for all positions, meaning that the choices for each position must be consistent across all positions.

Wait, no. The template is a single string, and for each position, I choose whether to make it lowercase or uppercase, and this choice affects the constraints for a, b, and c at that position.

But the choices for different positions are independent, so I can make separate choices for each position.

Wait, but in reality, the template is a string where each character is a specific letter, either lowercase or uppercase.

But in the problem, a, b, and c are given strings of lowercase letters, and t is a template with a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

I need to find if there exists such a template t such that:

- For all positions i where t[i] is lowercase, a[i] and b[i] must match t[i], and c[i] must not match t[i].

- For all positions i where t[i] is uppercase, a[i] and b[i] must not match the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must match the lowercase version of t[i].

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of constraints for each position.

For each position i, I need to choose whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, and set its letter accordingly.

Let me consider that for each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower(), b[i] != t[i].lower(), and c[i] == t[i].lower().

Wait, but t[i] is a specific letter, either lowercase or uppercase.

I need to choose for each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then a[i] == 'x', b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'.

- If t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

But in this case, 'x' is determined by the choice of t[i].

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as choosing for each position i whether to enforce equality (lowercase) or inequality (uppercase), along with specifying the specific character.

But this seems messy.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I try to construct the template t character by character.

For each position i, I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, and set its character accordingly.

Let's consider position i.

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x'.

- Then, a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

If a[i] != b[i], then this choice is invalid.

Also, if a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i], then this choice is invalid.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X'.

- Then, a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x'

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] must not equal 'x'

- b[i] must not equal 'x'

- c[i] must equal 'x'

But 'x' is the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, t[i] is 'X', so 'x' is 'x'.

Wait, in programming terms, 'X'.lower() is 'x'.

So, t[i] being 'X' implies that 'x' is 'x'.

Wait, this is confusing.

Let me try to generalize.

For position i:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position i, I have two options:

1. Choose t[i] as some lowercase 'x', with a[i] == 'x', b[i] == 'x', c[i] != 'x'

2. Choose t[i] as some uppercase 'X', with a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', c[i] == 'x'

But in reality, 'x' is a specific lowercase letter.

Wait, but in the template, t[i] can be any lowercase or uppercase letter.

So, for each position i, I can choose any lowercase 'x' or uppercase 'X', with the constraints above.

Wait, but in the template, t[i] is a specific letter, either lowercase or uppercase.

So, for each position, I can choose any letter 'x' for t[i], as long as it's either lowercase or uppercase, and the constraints are satisfied.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of the possible choices for t[i] given a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each position i, I can choose t[i] to be a specific lowercase or uppercase letter, based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider that for each position i, if I choose t[i] to be a lowercase 'x', then 'x' must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from 'x'.

So, for this choice to be possible, a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

Similarly, if I choose t[i] to be an uppercase 'X', then 'x' must be different from a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be equal to 'x'.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase 'X', then a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x', where 'x' is 'x'.

But 'x' is determined by the choice of t[i].

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can choose t[i] to be any lowercase letter 'x', provided that a[i] == 'x', b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'.

Or, I can choose t[i] to be any uppercase letter 'X', provided that a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

But in reality, 'x' is determined by the choice of t[i].

This seems tangled.

Maybe I should look at it differently.

Perhaps I can iterate through each position and check if there exists a choice (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the constraints for that position, given a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Then, for the entire template to satisfy the conditions, all positions must have at least one valid choice.

But, in addition, the choices must be such that the template is consistent across all positions.

Wait, but since the choices for each position are independent, if each position has at least one valid choice, then I can construct a template by choosing one valid option for each position.

Therefore, the answer is "YES" if and only if, for every position i, there exists at least one choice (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the constraints for a, b, and c at that position.

Wait, but in the problem, the template is a single string, so the choices for each position are independent, and as long as each position has at least one valid choice, I can construct a template that works.

Is that correct?

Wait, no. Because even if each position has a valid choice, the choices are made independently, and the template must be consistent with all these choices.

But since the choices are per position, and positions are independent, yes, I can construct such a template by choosing for each position a valid option.

Therefore, the answer is "YES" if for every position i, there exists at least one choice (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the constraints for a, b, and c at that position.

Otherwise, it's "NO".

So, for each position i, I need to check:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

- If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper().

- If a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

For each position i:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x', where 'x' is a specific lowercase letter.

- For this option to be valid:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

- Therefore, for this option to be possible:

- a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

- Option 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', where 'X' corresponds to lowercase 'x'.

- For this option to be valid:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

- Therefore, for this option to be possible:

- a[i] must be different from c[i]

- b[i] must be different from c[i]

- c[i] must be equal to 'x'

Wait, but 'x' is determined by the choice of t[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to choose 'x' based on c[i].

If I choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', then 'x' is c[i], provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, for option 2:

- Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', where 'X' is the uppercase version of c[i].

- Then, a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

Wait, but 'x' is c[i].

So, for option 2 to be possible:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- c[i] == 'x'

But 'x' is c[i], so this simplifies to:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

So, for option 2, I need a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Similarly, for option 1:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

Therefore, for position i to be valid, at least one of these two options must be possible.

So, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then option 1 is possible.

- If a[i] != b[i], then option 1 is impossible.

- If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then option 2 is possible.

- If a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], then option 2 is impossible.

Therefore, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then it's fine (option 1 possible).

- If a[i] != b[i], then option 1 is impossible.

- In this case, for option 2 to be possible, we need a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

- So, if a[i] != b[i], then we must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for option 2 to be possible.

Therefore, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then it's fine.

- If a[i] != b[i], then we must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

- If neither of these is true, then it's impossible to choose a valid template for this position.

Therefore, if for every position i, at least one of the following is true:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- a[i] != b[i] and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Then, the answer is "YES".

Otherwise, it's "NO".

This seems like a straightforward way to check for each position whether it's possible to choose a valid template character.

Now, let's look at the example to verify this logic.

Example 1:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

For position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'c'

a[1] != b[1], so option 1 is impossible.

Check option 2: a[1] != c[1] ('a' != 'c') and b[1] != c[1] ('b' != 'c'), so option 2 is possible.

Therefore, for this position, at least one option is possible, so the answer is "YES".

Example 2:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a'

a[1] != b[1], so option 1 is impossible.

Check option 2: a[1] != c[1] ('a' != 'a'? No, 'a' == 'a'), so a[1] == c[1], hence option 2 is impossible.

Since neither option is possible for position 1, the answer is "NO".

Example 3:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's consider position 1:

a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l', c[1] = 'a'

a[1] != b[1], so option 1 is impossible.

Check option 2: a[1] != c[1] ('m' != 'a') and b[1] != c[1] ('l' != 'a'), so option 2 is possible.

Similarly, for other positions, I would need to check the same conditions.

If for all positions, at least one option is possible, then the answer is "YES".

Example 4:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a'

a[1] == b[1], and c[1] == a[1], so option 1 is impossible.

Check option 2: a[1] != c[1]? 'a' == 'a', so no, a[1] == c[1], hence option 2 is impossible.

Therefore, for position 1, neither option is possible, so the answer is "NO".

This matches the sample output.

Therefore, my logic seems correct.

So, to implement this, for each test case, I need to:

- Read n

- Read strings a, b, c

- For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then it's fine.

- Else, if a[i] != b[i] and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then it's fine.

- Else, it's impossible, so answer "NO"

- If all positions are fine, answer "YES"

This seems straightforward.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

possible = False

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Wait, this seems similar to what I've derived.

In the code:

- For each test case, read n, a, b, c

- Initialize possible = False

- Loop through each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], set possible = True and break

- Else, if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], continue

- Else (a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]), set possible = True and break

- Print 'YES' if possible, else 'NO'

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, I need to check that for every position, at least one of the two conditions holds.

But in this code, it seems to check if there exists at least one position where the condition holds, which is different.

Wait, this is incorrect.

In my earlier logic, I need to check that for every position, at least one of the two conditions holds.

But in this code, it's checking if there exists at least one position where the condition holds, which is the opposite.

This seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misread it.

Let me look again.

In the code:

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

Then, if possible is True, print 'YES', else 'NO'

Wait, this seems to be checking if there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If such a position exists, set possible = True and break.

Then, print 'YES' if possible, else 'NO'

But according to my earlier logic, I need to check that for all positions, at least one of the two conditions holds.

So, this code is incorrect.

It should be checking for all positions, not just for the existence of at least one position.

Wait, but in the code, it's breaking on the first position where the condition holds.

This suggests that it's checking for the existence of at least one such position, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the code is checking if there exists at least one position where the condition holds, and if so, then it's possible to construct such a template.

But that doesn't make sense, because for all positions, the template must satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the code is flawed.

Let me consider the first example:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

In this case:

- For position 0:

- a[0] == b[0]? 'a' != 'b', so no.

- c[0] == a[0] or c[0] == b[0]? 'c' != 'a' and 'c' != 'b', so no.

- So, possible = True, break.

- Print 'YES'

Which matches the sample output.

Second example:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

For position 0:

- a[0] == b[0]? 'a' != 'b', so no.

- c[0] == a[0] or c[0] == b[0]? 'a' == 'a', so yes.

- So, continue to next position.

For position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? 'a' != 'b', so no.

- c[1] == a[1] or c[1] == b[1]? 'a' == 'a', so yes.

- So, continue.

No position sets possible = True, so print 'NO'

Which matches the sample output.

Third example:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's consider position 0:

- a[0] == b[0]? 'm' != 'l', so no.

- c[0] == a[0] or c[0] == b[0]? 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l', so no.

- So, possible = True, break.

- Print 'YES'

Which matches the sample output.

Fourth example:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

For position 0:

- a[0] == b[0]? 'a' == 'a', yes.

- c[0] != a[0]? 'a' != 'a'? No.

- So, possible remains False.

For position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? 'c' != 'b', no.

- c[1] == a[1] or c[1] == b[1]? 'b' == 'c'? No.

- So, possible = True, break.

- Print 'YES'

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should be 'NO'.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in my earlier manual check, I thought it should be 'NO'.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the fourth example, according to the sample output, it's 'NO', but according to the code, it would print 'YES' because at position 1, a[1] != b[1] and c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], so possible = True.

But according to my earlier logic, for all positions, at least one of the two conditions must hold.

In this case:

Position 0:

- a[0] == b[0] and c[0] != a[0]? 'a' == 'a' and 'a' != 'a'? No.

- a[0] != b[0]? No.

- So, neither condition holds. Therefore, it should be 'NO'.

But the code would still print 'YES' because it found a position where the condition holds.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correct approach should be to check that for every position, at least one of the two conditions holds.

Therefore, I need to iterate through all positions and ensure that for each position, at least one of the two conditions is satisfied.

If all positions satisfy this, then print 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

So, the corrected code should be:

for each test case:

read n, a, b, c

possible = True

for each position i in 0 to n-1:

if (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]) or (a[i] != b[i] and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]):

continue

else:

possible = False

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

This matches the logic I derived earlier.

So, the given code is incorrect because it checks for the existence of at least one position where the condition holds, whereas it should check that for all positions, at least one of the conditions holds.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
