Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game played by Bodya and Sasha on a permutation and an array. They make moves simultaneously over k turns, and at each turn, they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation. The goal is to see who ends up with a higher score after k turns.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. Both players start at specific positions, P_B for Bodya and P_S for Sasha. They play k turns, and in each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add a_x to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to either stay at their current position or move to p_x.

The winner is the one with the higher score after k turns. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

I need to process multiple test cases, up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which suggests that the per-testcase time complexity should be reasonably low, probably O(n) or O(n log n).

Looking at the example, it seems that the players can make choices independently at each turn, but since they make moves simultaneously, their choices don't affect each other directly. Each player tries to maximize their own score.

The key here is to find the maximum possible score each player can achieve independently, given their starting positions and the choices they make at each turn.

Let me think about how to compute the maximum score for a single player. The player is at some position x, and at each turn, they can choose to stay at x or move to p_x. They add a_x to their score if they stay, or a_{p_x} if they move.

Wait, but actually, the problem says they add a_x to their score, where x is their current position, and then choose to stay or move to p_x. So, regardless of whether they stay or move, they add a_x where x is the current position before moving.

So, in each turn:

1. Add a_x to the score.

2. Then choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

But, in the next turn, the current position is either x (if they stayed) or p_x (if they moved).

So, the player's position in the next turn depends on whether they chose to stay or move in the current turn.

Given that, the player needs to make a sequence of choices over k turns to maximize their total score.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each turn, we keep track of the maximum score achievable for each possible position.

However, with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach would be too slow. We need a smarter way to compute the maximum score for each player.

Let me consider the structure of the permutation. Permutations can be decomposed into cycles. If we can find the cycles in the permutation, we can analyze the behavior within each cycle separately.

In a cycle, the positions are connected in a loop. For example, if we have a cycle like 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1, then moving according to p repeatedly will cycle through these positions.

Given that, perhaps we can model the movement within each cycle and find a way to maximize the score based on whether the player stays or moves at each step.

But this seems complicated. Is there a better way?

Let me consider the fact that in each turn, the player adds a_x to their score, where x is their current position, and then chooses to stay at x or move to p_x.

If the player chooses to stay, their position remains x for the next turn.

If they choose to move, their position becomes p_x for the next turn.

So, for each turn, the player can decide independently whether to stay or move.

But since they make this decision simultaneously, and they're trying to maximize their own scores independently, we can treat each player separately.

The challenge is to find, for each player, the maximum possible score they can achieve over k turns, given their starting position and the ability to choose to stay or move each turn.

Let me think about one player's perspective.

Let's denote the player's position at turn t as x_t.

At turn t=0, x_0 is the starting position.

At each turn t, the player adds a_{x_t} to their score, and then chooses to stay at x_t or move to p_{x_t}.

So, x_{t+1} = x_t (if stay) or p_{x_t} (if move).

The player's goal is to choose, for each turn, whether to stay or move, to maximize the total score sum_{t=0}^{k-1} a_{x_t}.

This looks like a dynamic programming problem, where the state is the current position and the current turn.

But with k up to 10^9, we need a more efficient way to compute this.

I recall that in problems involving permutations and cycles, we can analyze the behavior within each cycle separately.

Let's consider the permutation graph, where each position points to its p_x.

Since it's a permutation, the graph consists of disjoint cycles.

We can decompose the permutation into its cycles.

Then, for each player, depending on which cycle their starting position belongs to, we can analyze their possible movements within that cycle.

Within a cycle of length m, the player's position will repeat every m steps if they always choose to move.

But they have the option to stay at any step, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of the maximum possible score achievable given the ability to stay or move at each step.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay for any number of consecutive turns before moving to p_x.

In other words, the player can choose to stay at a position for several turns, adding a_x each time, and then decide to move to p_x and repeat the process.

This seems similar to grouping the turns into phases where the player stays at one position for some turns and then moves to another position.

But with k up to 10^9, we need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the fact that, for a given position x, if the player stays at x for t turns, their score increases by t * a_x, and then they move to p_x and repeat the process.

So, for a sequence of positions in a cycle, the player can choose how many turns to spend at each position before moving on.

But this still seems too slow for large k.

Perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the maximum score.

Let me consider that, for a given cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position as many times as they want before moving to the next position.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to stay at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

But it's not that simple because moving incurs adding a_x and then choosing the next position.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that, for a given position x, the maximum score the player can achieve starting from x for k turns is:

max( a_x + max_score(x, k-1), a_{p_x} + max_score(p_x, k-1) )

Because at each turn, the player chooses to stay at x and add a_x, then continue for k-1 turns from x, or move to p_x, add a_{p_x}, and continue for k-1 turns from p_x.

But this recursive approach is too slow for large k and n.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position x, the maximum score achievable from x for any number of turns.

But that still seems too slow.

Let me consider that, for a given position x, if the player stays at x for all k turns, their total score would be k * a_x.

Alternatively, if they move to p_x after the first turn, their total score would be a_x + (k-1) * a_{p_x}.

Or, they could stay at x for t turns, then move to p_x, stay there for s turns, and so on.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Is there a way to model this more efficiently?

Let me consider that, for each position x, the player can choose to stay at x for some number of turns, then move to p_x and repeat.

So, for example, if the player stays at x for t turns, their score is t * a_x, and then they move to p_x and have k - t turns left.

But maximizing this directly is still too slow.

Perhaps I can consider that the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a_x for as many turns as possible.

But in reality, it's more nuanced because moving to another position might offer a higher a_{p_x}.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each position x, the maximum a_y among the positions y that can be reached from x by moving according to p.

In other words, find the maximum a_y in the cycle that x belongs to.

Then, the optimal strategy is to stay at y for all k turns, where y is the position with the maximum a_y in the cycle.

But is that correct?

Let me think about it.

Suppose x is in a cycle where the maximum a_y is achieved at y.

If the player can reach y in s moves, then they can stay at y for k - s turns.

Their total score would be the sum of a_x for the first s moves plus (k - s) * a_y.

But to maximize the score, they should minimize s, i.e., reach y as quickly as possible.

So, the optimal strategy is to move to p_x until reaching y, and then stay at y for the remaining turns.

This way, the total score is sum of a_x for the path from x to y, plus (k - s) * a_y, where s is the number of moves to reach y.

But actually, since moving involves adding a_x and then moving to p_x, it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I need to formalize this.

Let me define, for a position x, the maximum a_y in its cycle as a_max.

Then, the optimal strategy is to reach a position with a_y = a_max as quickly as possible, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

This minimizes the number of moves (and thus the number of a_x added that are not a_max) and maximizes the number of turns adding a_max.

So, for each player, I need to:

1. Find the cycle that their starting position belongs to.

2. Find the maximum a_y in that cycle.

3. Find the minimal number of moves required to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

4. Compute the total score as:

(sum of a_x for each move until reaching a_max) + (k - s) * a_max

where s is the number of moves to reach a_max.

This seems like a correct approach.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Decompose the permutation into cycles.

- For each cycle, find the maximum a_y.

- For each starting position, find the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max in its cycle.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me think about how to decompose the permutation into cycles.

I can perform a graph traversal, treating the permutation as a directed graph where each node has out-degree 1.

In this graph, the cycles are the strongly connected components, but since it's a permutation, each SCC is a single cycle.

I can use a modified DFS to find the cycle for each starting position.

However, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, I need to find a way to preprocess the permutation and answer queries efficiently.

An alternative approach is to note that, in a cycle, once a player enters the cycle, their movement is determined by following p_x.

So, for each cycle, I can find the maximum a_y in that cycle, and for each position in the cycle, compute the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

But this still seems too slow for large n and t.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position x:

- The cycle it belongs to.

- The maximum a_y in its cycle.

- The minimal number of moves from x to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

Then, for each query, I can look up these precomputed values and compute the total score for Bodya and Sasha separately.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 per test case, and sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need to make sure that the per-testcase time is O(n).

Wait, no, t is the number of test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so per-testcase time should be O(n).

But in the input, t is given first, followed by t test cases, each with its own n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a.

So, I need to process t test cases, each with its own n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a, where sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

Therefore, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Given that, perhaps for each test case, I can:

1. Read n, k, P_B, P_S.

2. Read the permutation p.

3. Read the array a.

4. Decompose the permutation into cycles.

5. For each cycle, find the maximum a_y.

6. For each starting position, find the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max in its cycle.

7. Compute the total score for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the optimal strategy.

But step 6 seems time-consuming if done naively.

Is there a smarter way to compute the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max for each starting position?

Let me consider that, within a cycle, the positions are connected in a loop.

Suppose I have a cycle: x1 -> x2 -> ... -> x_m -> x1.

Let's say the positions with a_y = a_max are x_{j1}, x_{j2}, ..., x_{jk}.

Then, for any position in the cycle, the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max is the minimum distance to any x_{j}.

In a cycle, the distance between two positions can be computed in both directions.

But perhaps I can iterate through the cycle and compute the minimal distance to the nearest x_j in one direction.

Wait, actually, in a cycle, the minimal distance to x_j can be computed by finding the minimal distance in both directions.

But this seems a bit involved.

Is there a simpler way?

Let me consider that, in a cycle, if I fix a starting position and traverse the cycle, I can keep track of the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

But I need to do this efficiently for all positions in the cycle.

Perhaps I can find, for each position in the cycle, the distance to the next position with a_y = a_max in the cycle's direction.

Then, the minimal number of moves to reach a_max is the minimum of this forward distance and the backward distance.

But computing backward distances would require traversing the cycle in both directions.

Is there a better way?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a cycle: x1 -> x2 -> ... -> x_m -> x1.

Let's find the positions with a_y = a_max: say positions j1, j2, ..., jk.

Then, for any position in the cycle, the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max is the minimal distance to any j in both directions.

In a cycle, this is equivalent to finding, for each position, the nearest j in both directions and taking the minimum of those two distances.

This can be done in O(m) time per cycle.

Here's how:

1. For each cycle, identify the positions with a_y = a_max.

2. For each position in the cycle, compute the distance to the next j in the cycle's direction and the distance to the previous j in the cycle's direction, then take the minimum of these two.

To implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Find all cycles and their structure.

- For each cycle, find the positions with a_y = a_max.

- For each position in the cycle, compute the minimal distance to a position with a_y = a_max.

Once I have this, for each player, I can compute their total score as:

sum_{t=0}^{s-1} a_{x_t} + (k - s) * a_max

where s is the minimal number of moves to reach a_max.

Wait, no. Actually, at each turn, the player adds a_x to their score and then chooses to stay or move.

If they choose to move, they go to p_x; if they stay, they remain at x.

So, in the optimal strategy, the player should move towards a_max as quickly as possible and then stay there.

But in this model, since they can choose to stay or move at each turn independently, it's a bit different from just moving along the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of deciding at each step whether to stay or move to p_x, with the goal of maximizing the total score.

But this still seems too slow for large k and n.

Is there a mathematical formula or a pattern that can be exploited here?

Let me consider that, for a given starting position x, the player can choose to stay at x for any number of turns, adding a_x each time, or move to p_x and repeat the process.

This resembles a choice between adding a_x repeatedly or adding a_{p_x} repeatedly, but with the option to switch at any turn.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the position with the maximum a_x in the cycle and stay there for as many turns as possible.

To do that, the player should reach that position as quickly as possible and then stay there.

So, for each player, I need to:

- Find the cycle their starting position is in.

- Find the maximum a_y in that cycle.

- Find the minimal number of moves needed to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

- Compute the total score as:

(sum of a_x for each move until reaching a_max) + (k - s) * a_max

where s is the minimal number of moves to reach a_max.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, P_B, P_S.

b. Read the permutation p.

c. Read the array a.

d. Decompose the permutation into cycles.

e. For each cycle, find the maximum a_y.

f. For each position in the cycle, compute the minimal number of moves to reach a position with a_y = a_max.

g. For Bodya and Sasha, compute their total scores based on their starting positions and the optimal strategy.

h. Compare their scores and output who wins or if it's a draw.

But decomposing the permutation into cycles for each test case would be too slow if t is up to 10^4 and n is up to 2*10^5 in total.

Wait, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so overall time complexity should be O(n), where n is the total sum across all test cases.

So, per test case, it should be O(n) time.

But decomposing a permutation into cycles can be done in O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable.

Now, for step f, computing the minimal number of moves to reach a_max in the cycle.

Given that cycles can be large, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Here's an idea:

- For each cycle, represent it as a list of positions in the cycle's order.

- Find all positions in the cycle where a_y = a_max.

- For each position in the cycle, compute the minimal distance to any of these a_max positions.

This can be done in O(m) time per cycle, where m is the cycle's length.

Overall, since the sum of m across all cycles in all test cases is O(n), this is acceptable.

Once I have the minimal number of moves s for each starting position to reach a_max, I can compute the total score as:

sum_{t=0}^{s-1} a_{x_t} + (k - s) * a_max

where x_t is the position at turn t.

Wait, but in reality, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the optimal strategy is to reach a_max as quickly as possible and then stay there.

So, in the optimal path, the player moves from their starting position towards a_max position, moving to p_x at each step, and then stays at a_max.

The sum_{t=0}^{s-1} a_{x_t} is the sum of a_x for the positions x_t on the path from the starting position to a_max.

Then, they stay at a_max for (k - s) turns, adding (k - s) * a_max to their score.

So, total score = sum(path a_x) + (k - s) * a_max

But I need to make sure that s is minimized, i.e., the minimal number of moves to reach a_max.

Wait, but in the problem, the player can choose to stay or move at each turn, independently.

So, perhaps the player doesn't have to follow a path where they always move; they can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

But the optimal strategy should be to reach a_max as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Hence, the above formula should hold.

Now, to compute sum(path a_x), where the path is the minimal path from the starting position to a_max, I need to sum a_x for each position on this path.

Given that the cycle is a circular structure, the minimal path can be in either direction.

So, for each position, I need to find the minimal distance to a_max in terms of the number of moves, and also sum the a_x along that path.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a cycle and represent it as a circular list.

Then, for each position in the cycle, I can compute the minimal number of moves to reach a_max, considering movement in both directions.

Then, for each position, sum_{t=0}^{s-1} a_{x_t} would be the sum of a_x along the minimal path to a_max.

To compute this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute for each position the sum of a_x along the path to a_max in both directions, and then take the minimum sum.

But this seems complicated.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that, in a cycle, the positions repeat every m steps, where m is the cycle's length.

So, for a given starting position x, if the player always moves to p_x, they will cycle through the positions in the cycle.

But since they can choose to stay at any step, they have more flexibility.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the player can choose to move to p_x at any step, but it's optimal to move towards the a_max position as quickly as possible.

But in a cycle, there might be multiple paths to a_max, depending on the direction.

To simplify, perhaps I can fix a direction and compute the minimal number of moves to reach a_max in that direction, and also in the opposite direction, then take the minimum.

Then, sum(path a_x) would be the sum of a_x along that minimal path.

But computing this for each position seems time-consuming.

Is there a way to compute this efficiently?

Let me consider that, in a cycle, once I have the positions ordered in the cycle's order, I can iterate through them and compute prefix sums.

Then, for each position, find the nearest a_max position in both directions and compute the sum along that path.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. For each cycle:

a. Identify the positions in the cycle and their order.

b. Find all positions in the cycle where a_y = a_max.

c. For each position in the cycle, compute the minimal number of moves s to reach a_max by choosing the minimal distance in either direction.

d. Compute sum(path a_x) for each position, which is the sum of a_x along the minimal path to a_max.

2. For each player, use their starting position to find their cycle, s, and sum(path a_x), and then compute their total score.

3. Compare the total scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

But I need to make sure that this can be done efficiently.

Let me think about how to compute sum(path a_x) efficiently.

Suppose I have a cycle represented as a list: [x1, x2, ..., x_m, x1].

Let's say a_max positions are at indices j1, j2, ..., jk in this list.

For a given position x_i, the minimal path to a_max can be either:

- Move forward to the nearest a_max position in the forward direction.

- Move backward to the nearest a_max position in the backward direction.

Then, sum(path a_x) would be the sum of a_x along that path.

To compute this efficiently, I can:

- Compute the forward distances and sums.

- Compute the backward distances and sums.

- For each position, choose the path with the minimal distance and take the corresponding sum.

Here's how I can do it:

- For each cycle, represent it as a list: [x1, x2, ..., x_m].

- Find all positions j where a[x_j] = a_max.

- For each position i in the cycle:

- Find the nearest j in the forward direction: find the smallest l >= 0 such that a[x_{i+l}] = a_max.

- Similarly, find the nearest j in the backward direction: find the smallest l >= 0 such that a[x_{i-l}] = a_max.

- Then, sum_forward = sum a[x_{i+t}] for t=0 to l_forward -1.

- sum_backward = sum a[x_{i - t}] for t=0 to l_backward -1.

- Choose the path with minimal l (distance), and if l_forward = l_backward, choose the one with larger sum.

Wait, no. Since we want to minimize s (the number of moves), we should choose the path with the smallest l.

But among paths with the same l, we should choose the one with the larger sum a_x.

Wait, actually, since we are summing a_x for the path, and a_x are positive, choosing the path with the smallest l would also give the smallest sum(path a_x), which is better for maximizing the total score, because a_max is greater than or equal to a_x on the path.

Wait, no. Actually, since a_max is the maximum a_y in the cycle, and a_x for x on the path to a_max could be less than or equal to a_max.

But the player wants to reach a_max as quickly as possible to start adding a_max.

So, the player should choose the path with the smallest l, regardless of the sum along the path, because the sooner they reach a_max, the more turns they can spend adding a_max.

Therefore, among paths with the same l, it doesn't matter which one is chosen; the sum(path a_x) would be the same for minimal l.

Wait, no, the sum(path a_x) could be different, but since l is minimal, it's better to choose the path with the smallest l to maximize the number of turns adding a_max.

Hence, for each position, find the minimal l (forward or backward) to reach a_max, and compute sum(path a_x) accordingly.

To implement this efficiently, I can:

- For each cycle, compute prefix sums of a_x.

- For each position i, find the nearest j in the forward direction and compute sum_forward = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] + a[x_i].

- Similarly, find the nearest j in the backward direction and compute sum_backward = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] + a[x_j].

- Then, choose the path with the smallest l, and if l is the same, choose the one with the smaller sum(path a_x).

Wait, actually, since the player wants to maximize their score, they would prefer to have a larger sum(path a_x), but also minimize l to maximize the number of turns adding a_max.

But given that a_max is the highest possible a_y in the cycle, minimizing l is more important, because it allows more turns to add a_max.

Hence, among paths with the same l, the sum(path a_x) doesn't matter; the player should choose the path with the smallest l.

Therefore, for each position, find the minimal l to reach a_max, and compute sum(path a_x) accordingly.

To compute sum(path a_x), I can precompute prefix sums in both directions and then use them to compute the sum for the minimal path.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a cycle [x1, x2, ..., x_m], compute prefix_sum_forward where prefix_sum_forward[i] = sum_{t=0}^{i-1} a[x_t], with x_0 = starting position.

Similarly, compute prefix_sum_backward.

Then, for each position i, find the nearest j in the forward direction with a[x_j] = a_max, and compute sum_forward = prefix_sum_forward[j] - prefix_sum_forward[i].

Similarly, find the nearest j in the backward direction and compute sum_backward.

Then, choose the path with the smallest l, and if l is the same, choose the one with the smaller sum(path a_x).

Wait, but actually, since l is minimized, and a_x are positive, the sum(path a_x) would be minimized by choosing the path with the smallest l.

Hence, I can just choose the path with the smallest l.

Now, to implement this efficiently, perhaps I can:

- For each cycle, represent it as a list and find all positions with a_y = a_max.

- For each position, find the nearest a_max in both directions.

- Choose the direction with the smallest l.

- Compute sum(path a_x) accordingly.

But this still seems a bit involved.

Is there a better way to model this?

Let me consider that, in a cycle, the positions repeat every m steps.

Hence, for a given starting position, the sequence of positions the player visits if they always choose to move is periodic with period m.

But since the player can choose to stay at any step, they have more flexibility.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

Then, find the maximum score path with k steps.

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that, for each position, the player can choose to stay or move at each step.

Hence, for each position x, the player can choose to stay at x for any number of turns before moving to p_x.

This is similar to collecting a_x for several turns and then moving to p_x.

So, for a position x, if the player stays at x for t turns, they add t * a_x to their score and then move to p_x for the remaining k - t turns.

But this still seems too slow for large k.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the optimal strategy is to stay at x for t turns, where t is chosen such that t * a_x is maximized, given the remaining turns.

But this is still not clear.

Let me think about the fact that, in the optimal strategy, the player should reach a_max as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Hence, for each starting position, find the minimal number of moves s to reach a_max, and then compute sum(path a_x) for that path, and add (k - s) * a_max.

Hence, total score = sum(path a_x) + (k - s) * a_max

Now, to compute sum(path a_x), since the path is the minimal path to a_max, which can be in either direction, I can precompute prefix sums in both directions and then pick the minimal l with the corresponding sum.

To implement this efficiently, perhaps I can do the following for each cycle:

1. Represent the cycle as a list: [x1, x2, ..., x_m].

2. Find all positions j where a[x_j] = a_max.

3. Compute prefix_sum_forward[0..m], where prefix_sum_forward[i] = sum_{t=0}^{i-1} a[x_t].

4. For each position i, find the nearest j > i where a[x_j] = a_max (in the forward direction).

5. Similarly, find the nearest j < i where a[x_j] = a_max (in the backward direction).

6. For each position i, choose the path with the smallest l (distance to j), and compute sum(path a_x) accordingly.

7. If two paths have the same l, choose the one with the smaller sum(path a_x).

Wait, but actually, since l is minimized, and a_x are positive, the sum(path a_x) would be minimized by choosing the path with the smallest l.

Hence, I can just choose the path with the smallest l.

Now, to implement this, I can:

- For each cycle, represent it as a list: [x1, x2, ..., x_m].

- Find all positions j where a[x_j] = a_max.

- For each position i, find the nearest j in both directions and compute the sum along that path.

- Choose the path with the smallest l, and if l is the same, choose the one with the smaller sum(path a_x).

But since l is minimized, and a_x are positive, the sum(path a_x) would be minimized by choosing the path with the smallest l.

Hence, I can just choose the path with the smallest l.

To implement this, I can:

- For each cycle, linearize it into a list.

- Find all positions with a_y = a_max in that list.

- For each position, find the nearest a_max in both directions.

- Choose the one with the smallest l.

- Compute sum(path a_x) accordingly.

But this still seems time-consuming for large n.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that, in a cycle, the minimal l to reach a_max is min(l_forward, l_backward), where l_forward is the distance to the nearest a_max in the forward direction, and l_backward is the distance to the nearest a_max in the backward direction.

Similarly, sum(path a_x) would be sum_forward if l_forward <= l_backward, else sum_backward.

Hence, I can precompute for each position:

- l_min = min(l_forward, l_backward)

- sum_min = sum_forward if l_forward <= l_backward else sum_backward

Then, for each player, compute total_score = sum_min + (k - l_min) * a_max

Then, compare Bodya's and Sasha's total_scores to determine the winner.

Now, to compute l_forward and sum_forward for each position:

- For each cycle, iterate through the positions in order.

- Keep track of the positions where a_y = a_max.

- For each position i, find the next j > i where a[x_j] = a_max.

- Then, l_forward[i] = j - i

- sum_forward[i] = sum_{t=i}^{j-1} a[x_t]

Similarly, for l_backward and sum_backward.

Then, for each position, l_min = min(l_forward, l_backward)

sum_min = sum_forward if l_forward <= l_backward else sum_backward

This can be done in O(m) time per cycle.

Given that the sum of m across all cycles is O(n), this is acceptable.

Hence, the overall approach is:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, P_B, P_S.

b. Read the permutation p.

c. Read the array a.

d. Decompose the permutation into cycles.

e. For each cycle:

i. Identify the positions in the cycle.

ii. Find the maximum a_y in the cycle.

iii. For each position in the cycle, compute l_min and sum_min as described above.

f. For Bodya and Sasha, find their l_min and sum_min based on their starting positions.

g. Compute their total scores:

total_score = sum_min + (k - l_min) * a_max

h. Compare the total scores and output the result accordingly.

This seems correct and efficient enough.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -= 1

s -= 1

sp = a[s]

bp = a[b]

bm = a[b] * k

sm = a[s] * k

for i in range(n):

k -= 1

if k == 0:

break

b = p[b] - 1

s = p[s] - 1

bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)

sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

sp += a[s]

bp += a[b]

if bm > sm:

print('Bodya')

elif bm < sm:

print('Sasha')

else:

print('Draw')

This code seems to be attempting to simulate the game for both players simultaneously, iterating up to n steps.

It initializes sp and bp as a[s] and a[b], respectively.

Then, it iterates up to n steps, each time moving both players to their next positions (p[b] -1 and p[s] -1), and updating bp and sp accordingly.

In each iteration, it updates bm and sm to be the maximum of their current value and a[b] * k + bp and a[s] * k + sp, respectively.

Finally, it compares bm and sm to determine the winner.

This seems to be an attempt to find the maximum possible score for each player by considering different choices of staying or moving at each step.

However, it's not clear if this approach correctly captures the optimal strategy for each player.

Given the earlier analysis, I believe that the optimal strategy is to reach a position with a_y = a_max as quickly as possible and then stay there.

The provided code seems to be trying to simulate the game for up to n steps, but it's not clear if it correctly implements the optimal strategy.

Moreover, in the code, k can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5, so iterating up to n steps might not be sufficient if k > n.

Wait, in the code, it iterates up to n steps, but k is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and if k == 0, it breaks.

Hence, it seems to be iterating up to k steps, not n steps.

Wait, no, looking again:

for i in range(n):

k -= 1

if k == 0:

break

b = p[b] - 1

s = p[s] - 1

bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)

sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

sp += a[s]

bp += a[b]

So, it iterates from i=0 to i=n-1, but decrements k each time, and breaks when k == 0.

Hence, it's effectively iterating up to k steps, not n steps.

But in the problem, k can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5, so this loop could be too slow if k is large.

However, in the code, it iterates only up to n steps, because the loop is "for i in range(n)", but k can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but in the loop, k is decremented each time, and if k == 0, it breaks.

Hence, it will iterate up to k steps, but since k can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5, this loop could be too slow if k > n.

But in the code, it's looping up to n steps, because "for i in range(n)", but k is decremented each time, so if k < n, it will break earlier.

But in the problem, n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, so this loop would result in overall time complexity O(t * n), which is too slow for the time limits.

Hence, this approach is inefficient and likely incorrect.

Therefore, I conclude that the given code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
