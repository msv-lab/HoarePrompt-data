Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and understand what's being asked.

So, Rudolf has a set of n problems with distinct complexities that are already sorted in ascending order: a1 < a2 < ... < an. He's not happy with the balance of the complexities, and he wants to add at most one new problem to make the set more balanced. This new problem's complexity is determined by combining a model and a function, specifically by adding the complexity of a model di and a function fj, so the new problem's complexity would be di + fj.

After possibly adding this one new problem, he wants to calculate the imbalance of the set. The imbalance is defined as the maximum difference between consecutive complexities in the sorted list.

My task is to find the minimum possible imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at most one problem.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- There are t test cases, up to 10^4.

- For each test case:

- n can be up to 10^5.

- m and k can be up to 2*10^5 each.

- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

- The sum of m and k over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5 each.

So, efficiency is crucial here, especially since t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 10^5 per test case.

Let me think about the approach.

First, without adding any new problem, the current imbalance is the maximum difference between consecutive ai's.

I need to see if I can reduce this maximum difference by adding one new problem.

The new problem's complexity is di + fj for some i and j.

Since m and k can be up to 2*10^5, generating all possible di + fj values isn't feasible directly, as it could be up to 4*10^10, which is way too much.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive ai's.

Let's denote diff_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i = 1 to n-1.

The current imbalance is the maximum of these diff_i's.

I need to add one new problem, with complexity di + fj, such that it reduces the maximum diff_i.

Where should I add this new problem?

I should add it in a way that it splits one of the largest diff_i's into two smaller differences, thereby potentially reducing the maximum difference.

So, for each possible diff_i, I want to find if there's a di + fj that can be placed between a_{i-1} and a_i, splitting diff_i into two new differences, say x and diff_i - x, and then see if this reduces the overall maximum difference.

But checking this for each possible diff_i and each possible di + fj is too slow.

I need a better way.

An optimization is needed here.

Let me consider that I need to minimize the maximum difference after adding one element.

One standard approach in such problems is to iterate over the possible maximum differences and check if it's possible to achieve that difference with at most one addition.

But in this case, since I have to add exactly one element, I need to find the best place to add one element to minimize the maximum difference.

Let me think differently.

Let me find the largest difference between consecutive ai's, say max_diff.

I need to see if I can add a new element that reduces this max_diff.

But I need to consider all possible places to add the new element and see which one gives the best reduction in max_diff.

Wait, but I have constraints on what the new element can be; it has to be di + fj for some i and j.

So, I need to consider all possible di + fj and see where they can be inserted to reduce the max_diff.

Given that m and k can be up to 2*10^5, generating all di + fj is not practical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each di, I can sort the fj's and then for each di, find the fj that minimizes the max_diff when di + fj is added.

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the di's and fj's separately and then find combinations that could potentially minimize the max_diff.

Wait, maybe I can sort the di's and fj's and then compute di + fj using two pointers or something similar.

Let me think about the current differences.

Let me compute all diff_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i from 1 to n-1.

Then, the current max_diff is the maximum of these diff_i's.

I need to see if I can add one element such that the new max_diff is less than the current one.

Let me consider that the best possible max_diff after adding one element would be at least the second largest diff_i.

Because, by adding one element, I can potentially reduce one of the diff_i's, but the others remain.

So, the new max_diff should be at least the second largest diff_i.

Hence, I can find the second largest diff_i, and aim to achieve a max_diff that is as small as possible but not smaller than the second largest diff_i.

So, the answer should be the minimum max_diff that is at least the second largest diff_i.

Wait, but I need to find the actual minimal max_diff achievable by adding one element.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the list of diff_i's sorted in descending order.

Letâ€™s say diff_1 >= diff_2 >= ... >= diff_{n-1}.

Without adding any element, the max_diff is diff_1.

By adding one element, I can potentially split diff_1 into two smaller differences.

Suppose I split diff_1 into x and diff_1 - x.

Then, the new max_diff would be the maximum among diff_2, x, and diff_1 - x.

To minimize this, I need to choose x such that the larger of x and diff_1 - x is as small as possible.

This would be achieved when x = (diff_1)/2.

Hence, the new max_diff would be the maximum of diff_2 and diff_1 / 2.

Wait, but this is only if I split the largest diff.

But I need to consider that I can split any diff_i, not just the largest one.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider splitting the largest diff_i, and see what's the best x I can choose.

But in this problem, x has to be equal to di + fj for some i and j.

Hence, I cannot choose x arbitrarily; it has to be one of the possible di + fj.

This complicates things.

Let me consider that I need to find a value x = di + fj such that when I insert x into the array a, it splits some diff_i into two new differences, say x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x.

Then, the new max_diff would be the maximum of all the original diff_j's (for j != i) and the two new differences x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x.

I need to choose i and x to minimize this new max_diff.

My goal is to find the minimal possible new_max_diff over all possible choices of i and x.

This seems tricky because of the constraints on x.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over all possible x = di + fj and find the best place to insert x to minimize the max_diff.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, this would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each possible x = di + fj, I can find the position where x should be inserted to minimize the max_diff.

But again, this seems too slow.

An alternative approach is to iterate over the differences diff_i and see if I can reduce them by adding a new element.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each diff_i, I want to split it into two parts such that the larger part is as small as possible.

To do this, I need to choose x such that x is in [a_{i-1}, a_i], and then the two new differences are x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x.

To minimize the larger of these two, I should choose x as close as possible to the midpoint of a_{i-1} and a_i.

Hence, x should be as close as possible to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

But x has to be equal to di + fj for some i and j.

Hence, I need to find di + fj that is closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

Then, for each diff_i, I can compute the best x that minimizes the larger of x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x, and then find the minimal possible max_diff.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, this seems inefficient.

I need a way to efficiently find, for each diff_i, the best di + fj that can split it optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can preprocess the possible x values by computing all di + fj and storing them in a sorted list.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, the number of possible x is up to 4*10^10, which is infeasible.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each diff_i, the ideal x to insert is (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

But x has to be equal to di + fj for some i and j.

Hence, for each diff_i, I can compute the target x_i = (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2, and then find the di + fj that is closest to x_i.

Then, for each diff_i, I can compute the larger of |x - a_{i-1}| and |a_i - x|, and take the minimum over all such x for all diff_i.

Wait, but x has to be di + fj.

This still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over all possible x = di + fj and keep track of the best reduction in max_diff.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need to find a way to compute this more efficiently.

Let me think about the possible x values.

Given that di and fj can be up to 10^9, their sum can be up to 2*10^9.

But a_i can be up to 2*10^9.

Hence, x and a_i are in similar ranges.

I need to find a way to efficiently find, for each diff_i, the best x that minimizes the larger of x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x.

Wait, this is similar to finding x such that the maximum of x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x is minimized.

This is equivalent to minimizing the larger of x - a_{i-1} and a_i - x.

This is achieved when x is as close as possible to the midpoint of a_{i-1} and a_i, i.e., x = (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

Hence, for each diff_i, the optimal x to insert is (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2, if possible.

But x has to be equal to di + fj for some i and j.

Hence, I need to find, for each diff_i, the di + fj that is closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

Then, for each diff_i, I can compute the larger of di + fj - a_{i-1} and a_i - di - fj, for the di + fj closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

Then, the new max_diff would be the maximum over all other diff_j's and these two new differences for the chosen diff_i.

I need to find the minimal such max_diff over all possible diff_i and di + fj.

This still seems too slow.

I need to optimize this.

Let me consider that I can iterate over the possible diff_i's and for each diff_i, find the best di + fj that minimizes the larger of di + fj - a_{i-1} and a_i - di - fj.

Then, among all these possibilities, I can take the minimal max_diff.

But again, with n up to 10^5 and m*k up to 4*10^10, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can precompute all possible di + fj and store them in a sorted list.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, the number of possible di + fj is up to 4*10^10, which is too much.

Hence, I need a smarter way to handle this.

An idea: since I need to find di + fj closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2 for each diff_i, perhaps I can fix di and, for each di, find the fj that makes di + fj closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over di and, for each di, iterate over the diff_i's to see where di + fj can be inserted to minimize the max_diff.

But I still need to consider fj for each di.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that for each di, I can sort the fj's and then, for each diff_i, find the fj that makes di + fj closest to (a_{i-1} + a_i)/2.

But this is still too slow.

I need to find a way to compute, for each diff_i, the minimal possible max(x - a_{i-1}, a_i - x) over all possible x = di + fj.

Then, the new max_diff would be the maximum over all other diff_j's and these two new differences for the chosen diff_i.

I need to find the minimal such max_diff.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I can add at most one element, and I need to minimize the maximal difference after addition.

I need to find the minimal possible max_diff after adding at most one element.

Let me consider that the current max_diff is M, and I want to see if I can achieve a new max_diff of M' < M by adding one element.

I can perform a binary search on M', and check for each M' whether it's possible to achieve that max_diff by adding at most one element.

If I can perform this check efficiently, then the binary search can help me find the minimal M'.

Let's see.

In the binary search, I set a candidate M', and I need to check if it's possible to add at most one element such that all differences between consecutive elements are at most M'.

How can I check this efficiently?

I need to see if, by adding at most one element, I can make sure that no difference between consecutive elements exceeds M'.

This sounds promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given the sorted list a1 < a2 < ... < an, I need to add at most one element x such that for all i, a_i - a_{i-1} <= M'.

To achieve this, I need to ensure that for each gap a_i - a_{i-1} > M', I need to add an element x such that x - a_{i-1} <= M' and a_i - x <= M'.

Since I can add at most one element, I need to cover at most one gap that is larger than M', by adding x such that x - a_{i-1} <= M' and a_i - x <= M'.

Hence, for that gap, x needs to be in [a_{i-1} + M' - epsilon, a_i - M' + epsilon], where epsilon is a small positive number.

But since x has to be equal to di + fj for some i and j, I need to check if there exists a di + fj in that interval for at least one gap where a_i - a_{i-1} > M'.

Additionally, for all other gaps, a_i - a_{i-1} <= M'.

Hence, in the binary search, for a given M', I need to:

1. Find all gaps where a_i - a_{i-1} > M'.

2. Check if there exists at least one such gap where there exists a di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

3. If such a di + fj exists for at least one gap, and for all other gaps, a_i - a_{i-1} <= M', then it's possible to achieve max_diff <= M' by adding one element.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

This seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to perform this check for each M' in the binary search.

First, I need to perform a binary search on M'.


Let me outline the steps:

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k, the arrays a, d, f.

- Compute the differences diff_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i = 1 to n-1.

- Define the current max_diff as the maximum of diff_i.

- Perform a binary search on M' between the minimal possible difference and the current max_diff.

- For each candidate M', check if it's possible to achieve all diff_i <= M' by adding at most one element.

- If possible, go left in the binary search; else, go right.

- Output the minimal M' that satisfies the condition.

Now, the key is to efficiently check, for a given M', whether it's possible to achieve all diff_i <= M' by adding at most one element.

As discussed earlier, this involves:

- Identifying all gaps where diff_i > M'.

- Checking if there exists at least one such gap where there exists a di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

- Ensuring that for all other gaps, diff_i <= M'.

Given that m and k can be up to 2*10^5 each, generating all di + fj is not feasible.

Hence, I need a way to efficiently check if there exists a di + fj in a given interval.

This sounds like a range query problem.

One way to handle this is to sort all di's and fj's and then, for each gap where diff_i > M', check if there exists a di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is still too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

An idea is to fix the di's and, for each di, find fj's such that di + fj is in the required interval for some gap.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is not efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the di's and fj's and then use two pointers to find if there exists a di + fj in a given interval.

Let me think about that.

Suppose I sort the di's in ascending order and the fj's in ascending order.

Then, for a given interval [L, R], I can find the range of di's such that di + fj is in [L, R].

For each di, I can find the corresponding fj that makes di + fj in [L, R].

Specifically, for a fixed di, fj should be in [L - di, R - di].

Then, I can check if there exists an fj in that range.

If I have the fj's sorted, I can use binary search to find if any fj is in [L - di, R - di].

But doing this for each di is O(m log k), which is acceptable since m and k are up to 2*10^5.

Hence, for each gap where diff_i > M', I can check if there exists a di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] by iterating over di and performing a binary search on fj for each di.

Then, if at least one such di + fj exists for at least one gap, and all other gaps are <= M', then it's possible to achieve the max_diff <= M' by adding one element.

This seems feasible.

Let me outline the steps for the check function in the binary search:

def is_possible(M'):

# Find all gaps where diff_i > M'

gaps = [(a_i - a_{i-1}, a_{i-1}, a_i) for i where a_i - a_{i-1} > M']

if len(gaps) == 0:

# No gaps larger than M', so current max_diff <= M'

return True

else:

# Need to add one element to cover at least one of these gaps

# For each gap, check if there exists di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M']

for gap in gaps:

L = a_{i-1} + M'

R = a_i - M'

# Check if there exists di + fj in [L, R]

if check_interval(L, R):

return True

return False

def check_interval(L, R):

# Check if there exists di + fj in [L, R]

for di in sorted_d:

f_low = L - di

f_high = R - di

# Find if there exists fj in [f_low, f_high]

if bisect_left(sorted_f, f_low) <= bisect_right(sorted_f, f_high) - 1:

return True

return False

This seems correct, but I need to optimize it.

Given that m and k can be up to 2*10^5, and n can be up to 10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, I need to make this as efficient as possible.

In particular, performing a binary search on fj for each di for each gap for each M' for each test case would be too slow.

I need a better way.

An optimization is to preprocess the possible di + fj values.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, generating all di + fj is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the di's and fj's and then use a two-pointer approach to find if there exists di + fj in [L, R].

Let me think about that.

Suppose I sort the di's in ascending order and the fj's in ascending order.

Then, to find if there exists di + fj in [L, R], I can iterate through di and maintain a pointer for fj such that di + fj is in [L, R].

This can be done efficiently.

Let me try to implement this.

First, sort di and fj.

Then, for a given [L, R], initialize two pointers, say left and right.

Start with left = 0 and right = 0.

For each di, find the smallest fj such that di + fj >= L.

This is equivalent to fj >= L - di.

Similarly, find the largest fj such that di + fj <= R.

This is equivalent to fj <= R - di.

Hence, for each di, the range of fj that satisfy L <= di + fj <= R is fj in [L - di, R - di].

Since fj is sorted, I can use binary search to find the range of fj for each di.

But doing this for each di is O(m log k), which might be acceptable if I optimize it.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through di and fj in a two-pointer fashion.

Let me set pointer i for di and pointer j for fj.

Sort di and fj.

Initialize i = 0, j = 0.

While i < m and j < k:

Compute di[i] + fj[j].

If di[i] + fj[j] < L, increment i.

If di[i] + fj[j] > R, increment j.

If di[i] + fj[j] in [L, R], then return True.

Increment both i and j.

If no such pair is found, return False.

This seems efficient, O(m + k) per check.

Hence, for each gap where diff_i > M', I can perform this check.

But if I have multiple gaps, and t is up to 10^4, this might still be too slow.

I need a way to optimize this further.

Let me consider that for a given M', I need to check if there exists at least one gap where there exists a di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the union of all intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for gaps where diff_i > M', and then check if any di + fj falls into this union.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might still be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all possible di + fj and store them in a sorted list, and then for each gap, check if any di + fj is in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, storing all di + fj is not feasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each di, I can compute di + fj for all fj and see if any of them fall into the required intervals for the gaps.

But this is still too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over di and, for each di, find the intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] that contain di + fj for some fj.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each di, I can find the range of fj that make di + fj fall into any of the intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

Then, I can check if there's any fj that lies in the intersection of these ranges for some di.

This is getting too complicated.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the minimal possible max_diff.

I can observe that the minimal possible max_diff is at least the second largest diff_i.

Because, by adding one element, I can reduce only one diff_i, and the others remain.

Hence, the new max_diff should be at least the second largest diff_i.

Hence, I can set the lower bound of my binary search to be the second largest diff_i.

The upper bound can be the current max_diff.

Then, perform the binary search within this range.

This reduces the number of iterations in the binary search.

But I still need an efficient way to check for each M'.

Let me consider that for each M', I need to find if there exists a di + fj that can be inserted into one of the gaps to make sure that no diff_i > M'.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the set of possible di + fj and then find the best position to insert one of them to minimize the max_diff.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that I can sort the di + fj values and then, for each gap where diff_i > M', check if any di + fj lies within [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

To optimize this, perhaps I can sort all the gaps' intervals and the di + fj values and then perform a sweep line algorithm to see if any di + fj falls into any of the intervals.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might still be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a given M', the check can be performed as follows:

- Find all gaps where diff_i > M'.

- If there are no such gaps, return True.

- Otherwise, for each such gap, compute the interval [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

- Find the union of these intervals.

- Check if any di + fj falls into this union.

If at least one di + fj falls into the union of these intervals, then return True; else, return False.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need an efficient way to check if any di + fj falls into the union of these intervals.

Given that m and k are up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Perhaps I can sort all the intervals and all the di + fj values and then perform a sweep line algorithm to see if any di + fj falls into any of the intervals.

But again, with t up to 10^4, this might be too slow.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each di, I can compute di + fj for all fj and see if any of them falls into any of the intervals.

But this is still too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can fix fj and iterate over di.

For each fj, compute di = x - fj, where x is the target value.

Then, for each interval [L, R], I need to check if there exists di such that L <= di + fj <= R, which is equivalent to L - fj <= di <= R - fj.

Hence, for each fj, I can check if di is in [L - fj, R - fj].

But this seems similar to the earlier approach and is still too slow.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that the union of intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for all gaps where diff_i > M' can be merged into a single sorted list of intervals.

Then, I can iterate through the sorted di + fj and see if any of them falls into these merged intervals.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might still be too slow.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that for a given M', the check can be performed by finding the minimal position where I can insert one element to cover all gaps larger than M'.

But I need to make sure that by adding one element, I can cover at least one gap, and the remaining gaps are already <= M'.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over the gaps and see if there's at least one gap that can be covered by some di + fj.

This seems similar to earlier approaches.

I need to find a way to optimize this check.

Let me consider that I can sort all the intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for gaps where diff_i > M', and also sort all di + fj.

Then, I can perform a sweep line algorithm to see if any di + fj falls into any of these intervals.

This can be done by iterating through the sorted intervals and di + fj simultaneously.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, this might be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each gap, I can compute the required x to be in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

Then, I need to check if there exists a di + fj in this range.

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate over all di, and for each di, find if there exists an fj such that di + fj is in any of the required intervals.

But this seems similar to earlier approaches and is still too slow.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that I can sort all the intervals and all the di + fj values and then perform a sweep line algorithm to check for overlaps.

But again, with m and k up to 2*10^5, this might be too slow.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each gap, I can compute the required x to be in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

Then, I can take the union of all such intervals across all gaps.

Then, I need to check if any di + fj falls into this union.

To optimize this, perhaps I can represent the union of intervals as a sorted list of intervals without overlapping.

Then, for each di, I can check if there exists an fj such that di + fj falls into any of these intervals.

But this still seems too slow.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that I can sort the di's and fj's and precompute the possible di + fj values in a sorted manner.

Then, for the union of intervals, I can perform a binary search to see if any value in the sorted di + fj list falls into any of these intervals.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is still too slow.

I need to find a smarter way.

Let me consider that I can sort the di's and fj's and then, for a given M', sort all the required intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] and perform a sweep line algorithm to find if any di + fj falls into any of these intervals.

But again, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might be too slow.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that for a given M', the check can be performed by finding the minimal number of elements needed to cover all gaps where diff_i > M'.

If the minimal number of elements needed is <=1, then it's possible; else, it's not.

But finding the minimal number of elements needed is equivalent to covering all the gaps with the possible di + fj values.

This seems too involved.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that I can iterate over the possible x = di + fj and, for each x, find the gap it can cover, i.e., where a_{i-1} + M' <= x <= a_i - M'.

Then, I can mark that gap as covered.

Finally, I need to check if at least one gap is covered.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is still too slow.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that I can sort the di + fj values and then, for each gap, find if any di + fj falls into [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

To optimize this, perhaps I can sort all the gap intervals and all the di + fj values and then perform a sweep line algorithm to check for overlaps.

But again, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might be too slow.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given M', the check can be performed by finding the minimal number of di + fj values needed to cover all gaps where diff_i > M'.

If this minimal number is <=1, then it's possible; else, it's not.

But finding this minimal number efficiently is the challenge.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that I can sort the di's and fj's and then compute all possible di + fj values and sort them.

Then, for each gap where diff_i > M', I can find the number of di + fj in [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

If at least one such di + fj exists for at least one gap, then it's possible.

This can be done efficiently using binary search on the sorted di + fj list for each gap.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5 and n up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, this is still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can sort the di + fj values and then, for each M', find the union of intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for gaps where diff_i > M', and then check if any di + fj falls into this union.

To optimize this, perhaps I can represent the union of intervals as a single sorted list of intervals without overlaps and then perform a binary search to see if any di + fj is in these intervals.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might still be too slow.

I need to find a smarter way.

Let me consider that I can sort the di's and fj's and then precompute the possible di + fj values in a sorted list.

Then, for each M', I can find the union of intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for gaps where diff_i > M', and then perform a binary search to see if any di + fj falls into this union.

This is similar to earlier approaches and is still too slow.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that I can iterate over the di's and, for each di, iterate over the fj's to find if di + fj falls into any of the required intervals.

But with m and k up to 2*10^5, this is still too slow.

I need to find a way to handle this more efficiently.

Let me consider that I can sort the di's and fj's and then use a two-pointer approach to find if there exists di + fj in any of the required intervals.

This might work.

Let me try to implement this.

First, sort the di's and fj's.

Then, for each M', find the gaps where diff_i > M', and for each such gap, compute the interval [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

Then, merge these intervals into a single sorted list of non-overlapping intervals.

Then, use a two-pointer approach to see if any di + fj falls into these merged intervals.

This can be done efficiently.

Let me outline the steps:

- Sort the di's and fj's.

- For a given M', find all gaps where diff_i > M'.

- For each such gap, compute [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'].

- Merge these intervals into a list of non-overlapping intervals.

- Then, iterate through di and fj with two pointers to see if di + fj falls into any of these merged intervals.

This should be efficient enough.

Let me try to implement this in code.

But given the time constraints, I need to make sure that this is optimized.

Let me consider that for each M', merging the intervals can be done in O(g log g), where g is the number of gaps where diff_i > M'.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, this might still be too slow.

I need to find a way to optimize this further.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can precompute the differences and sort them.

Then, for the binary search on M', I can perform the check efficiently.

But I need to make sure that the check is efficient.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can sort the di's and fj's once and reuse them for all M' in the binary search.

This can save time.

Let me try to implement this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, m, k, a, d, f.

- Compute diff_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i = 1 to n-1.

- Sort d and f.

- Compute sorted di and fj.

- Perform a binary search on M' between the minimal possible difference and the current max_diff.

- For each M':

- Find all gaps where diff_i > M'.

- If there are no such gaps, return True.

- Else, merge the intervals [a_{i-1} + M', a_i - M'] for these gaps.

- Then, use two pointers to see if any di + fj falls into these merged intervals.

Implementing this should be efficient enough.

Let me try to code this.

But given the time constraints, I need to make sure that the merging of intervals is efficient.

I can sort the intervals by their start and then merge them.

Then, for the two-pointer approach:

- Initialize pointer i for di and j for fj.

- For each di, find the range of fj such that di + fj is in the merged intervals.

- Use binary search to find the range of fj for each di.

- If any di + fj falls into the merged intervals, return True.

This should
