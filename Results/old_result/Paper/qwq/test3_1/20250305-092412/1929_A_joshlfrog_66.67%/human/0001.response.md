Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them to maximize something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Another arrangement, say [3, 1, 2], would have beauty (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1, which is worse. So, rearranging can change the beauty.

I need to find the maximum possible beauty. Looking at the example, it seems that sorting the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. In the first example, sorting to [1, 2, 3] gives beauty 2, which is higher than other possible arrangements.

Wait, but in the second test case, all elements are 69, so no matter how you arrange them, each difference is 0, so total beauty is 0. That makes sense.

In the third test case, n=5 and the array is [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. If I sort it to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], the beauty would be (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=4 and the array is [3, 4, 3, 3]. Sorting it to [3, 3, 3, 4], the beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which again matches the sample output.

And in the fifth test case, n=2 and the array is [2, 1]. Sorting to [1, 2], beauty is (2-1) = 1, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty. But why is that?

Let's think about the sum: sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. This simplifies to a_n - a_1. Because when you write it out, it's a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + a4 - a3 + ... + a_n - a_{n-1}, and all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving a_n - a_1.

So, the beauty is simply a_n - a1, where a1 is the first element and a_n is the last element in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, I need to maximize a_n - a1. That means I should choose the largest possible value for a_n and the smallest possible value for a1.

So, to maximize a_n - a1, I should sort the array in ascending order, making a1 the smallest element and a_n the largest element. Then, a_n - a1 will be maximized.

Wait, but is that actually maximizing a_n - a1? Let's see.

Suppose I have elements [1, 2, 3]. If I arrange them as [1, 2, 3], then beauty is 3 - 1 = 2.

If I arrange them as [1, 3, 2], beauty is 3 - 1 + 2 - 3 = 2 - 1 = 1.

If I arrange them as [2, 1, 3], beauty is 1 - 2 + 3 - 1 = -1 + 2 = 1.

If I arrange them as [2, 3, 1], beauty is 3 - 2 + 1 - 3 = 1 - 2 = -1.

If I arrange them as [3, 1, 2], beauty is 1 - 3 + 2 - 1 = -2 + 1 = -1.

If I arrange them as [3, 2, 1], beauty is 2 - 3 + 1 - 2 = -1 -1 = -2.

So, indeed, the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, giving a_n - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2.

Similarly, in the second test case, all elements are equal, so a_n - a1 is always 0, which is correct.

In the third test case, sorted array is [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], so a_n - a1 = 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the beauty is simply the difference between the last and the first element after rearrangement, and to maximize it, we should sort the array in ascending order.

Wait a minute, but in the fourth test case, n=4, array [3, 4, 3, 3]. Sorted array is [3, 3, 3, 4], a_n - a1 = 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the sample output.

But, if I arrange it differently, say [3, 3, 4, 3], beauty is 3 - 3 + 4 - 3 = 0 + 1 = 1, same as sorted order.

Another arrangement [3, 4, 3, 3], beauty is 4 - 3 + 3 - 4 + 3 - 3 = 1 -1 + 0 = 0, which is less than 1.

So, again, sorted order gives the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and compute a_n - a1.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for e in range(t):

l = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0

y = 100000000

for i in range(l):

if nums[i] > x:

x = nums[i]

if nums[i] < y:

y = nums[i]

print(x - y)

So, in this program, for each test case, it reads n and then the array of n integers. Then, it finds the maximum value (x) and the minimum value (y) in the array by iterating through the array once.

Finally, it prints x - y, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the beauty is a_n - a1 after sorting the array in ascending order, which is exactly the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, this program is correct. It doesn't need to sort the array explicitly; it just finds the maximum and minimum values and computes their difference, which is equivalent to sorting the array and computing a_n - a1.

This is a more efficient approach, as finding the max and min in a single pass is faster than sorting the entire array.

So, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
