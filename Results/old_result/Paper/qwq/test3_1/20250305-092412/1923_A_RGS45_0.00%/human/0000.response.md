Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them. And I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "block" means in this context. It means that all the chips are together with no gaps between them. So, if I have chips at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6, I need to move them so that they are, say, at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, or maybe 2, 3, 4, and 5, as long as there are no gaps between them.

The operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left. I can do this any number of times, choosing any chip that has at least one free cell to its left.

I need to find the minimum number of such operations to make the chips form a single block.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to identify the current positions of the chips. Let's say I have an array a of size n, where a[i] is 1 if there's a chip at position i, and 0 if it's free.

I need to rearrange the chips so that they are all together without any gaps between them.

One way to think about this is to find the smallest possible range of positions that can contain all the chips without any gaps.

Let me consider the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip. The leftmost chip cannot be moved to the left since there are no cells left of the first cell. The rightmost chip cannot be moved to the right for similar reasons.

So, perhaps I need to move the chips towards each other to minimize the number of operations.

Wait, but the operations only allow moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left. So, I can only move chips to the left, not to the right.

Hmm, that changes things.

So, I need to move chips only to the left, and I need to make sure that all chips are together without any gaps.

Let me consider an example to understand this better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 8

arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

So, positions 2,3,4,6,7 have chips.

I need to move them so that there are no gaps between them.

One way is to move the chip from position 7 to position 5, so arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]. Now, all chips are together from position 2 to 6.

But in the example, it says that moving the chip from position 7 to position 5 is one operation, and after that, all chips are in a block from position 2 to 6.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says to move the chip from position 7 to position 5, which is the closest free cell to the left.

After this move, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0], and the chips are at positions 2,3,4,5,6, which is a block without any gaps.

So, in this case, only one operation is needed.

Another example:

n = 6

arr = [0,1,0,0,0,0]

Here, only one chip at position 2, and it's already in a block (since there's only one chip), so no operations are needed.

n = 6

arr = [1,1,1,1,1,1]

All chips are already in a block, so no operations are needed.

n = 5

arr = [1,0,1,0,1]

Here, chips are at positions 1,3,5.

To make them a block, I can move the chip from position 5 to position 2, and then from position 3 to position 4.

So, two operations: move position 5 to position 2, then position 3 to position 4.

After first move: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> but wait, after moving position 5 to position 2, arr becomes [1,1,0,1,0], assuming position 2 was free before the move, but in this case, position 2 already has a chip. Wait, maybe I need to choose different moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think differently.

Let me try to find a general approach.

I need to make all chips form a consecutive block without any gaps.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, I need to find the smallest window in which I can place all the chips by moving them to the left.

I need to find the minimal number of moves to gather all chips in a consecutive block.

One way to think about this is to find the range where the chips are currently located, and then see how much I need to shift the chips to make them consecutive.

Wait, perhaps I should find the position where the leftmost chip is, and the position where the rightmost chip is, and then determine how many chips are missing in between.

But it's not that straightforward because some chips might already be in the positions needed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have k chips in total.

I need to place these k chips in k consecutive positions.

I need to choose a block of k consecutive cells and move the chips there.

I need to choose the block such that the number of moves required is minimized.

Wait, but in the operations allowed, I can only move chips to the left.

So, I need to choose a block of k consecutive cells, all to the right of or including the current positions of the chips, and then move the chips to the left as needed to fill that block.

Wait, but I can only move chips to the left, so the block should be to the left of or including the current positions.

Wait, no, I can only move chips to the left, meaning I can only choose a block that is to the left of the current positions.

But that doesn't make sense because then I might not be able to include all chips.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a block that is as right as possible, so that I minimize the number of moves needed to shift the chips into that block.

Wait, maybe it's better to fix the block and see how many moves are needed to move the chips into that block.

But among all possible blocks of size k, I need to choose the one that minimizes the number of moves.

But given that I can only move chips to the left, I need to choose a block that is as right as possible, but still allows all chips to be moved into it by moving only left.

Wait, perhaps I should find the minimal number of moves to move all chips into the rightmost possible positions.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the positions of the chips.

Let's say I have chips at positions p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 < p2 < ... < pk.

I need to move them to q1, q2, ..., qk, where q1 < q2 < ... < qk, and qk - q1 + 1 = k (i.e., they are consecutive).

Given that I can only move chips to the left, qi <= pi for all i.

I need to minimize the sum of (pi - qi) over all i.

This is equivalent to maximizing the sum of qi over all i, since pi are fixed.

So, I need to choose qi as large as possible, but they have to be consecutive integers within the range of the current positions.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning the chips to positions in a block of size k, where the block is chosen to the rightmost possible position that allows all chips to be moved into it by moving only left.

Wait, maybe I should look for the block of size k where the maximum number of chips are already in place, and then move the remaining chips into the empty positions in that block.

But I need to make sure that the moves are only to the left.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me look at the first sample input again.

n = 8

arr = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Chips are at positions 2,3,4,6,7.

k = 5.

I need to choose a block of 5 consecutive cells.

Possible blocks:

Positions 1-5: [0,1,1,1,0] -> need to move chips from positions 6 and 7 into positions 1 and 5.

But position 1 is free, so I can move a chip to position 1, but only from positions to the right.

Wait, but I can only move chips to the left, so from position 7 to position 5.

Then arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0].

This is one move, which matches the sample.

So, in this case, choosing positions 2-6 for the block, and moving the chip from position 7 to position 5.

Similarly, in the fourth sample:

n = 5

arr = [1,0,1,0,1]

Chips at positions 1,3,5.

k = 3.

To choose positions 2-4 for the block.

Then, move position 5 to position 4, and position 3 to position 3.

Wait, position 5 to position 4 (since position 3 is already occupied, but in the initial state, position 3 has a chip, so maybe I need to move position 5 to position 2.

Wait, perhaps choosing positions 2-4.

Move position 5 to position 4 (since position 4 is free), and position 3 is already in position 3.

But position 1 has a chip, but in the block positions 2-4, so I need to move position 1 to position 2.

Wait, but position 1 is to the left of the block, and I can only move chips to the left, not to the right.

Wait, maybe choosing positions 1-3.

Then, move position 3 to position 2, and position 5 to position 3.

So, two moves.

Wait, but position 5 to position 3 involves moving two steps left.

Is there a better way?

Alternatively, choose positions 3-5.

But I can't move chips to the right, only to the left.

So, positions 1-3 seem the only possible block that can be filled by moving chips to the left.

Hence, two moves: position 3 to position 2, position 5 to position 3.

So, in this case, the answer is 2.

Looking back at the problem, it seems that the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, in the first sample, there is one zero between positions 4 and 6, and one between positions 7 and 8, but we only need to move one chip.

Wait, no, in positions 2,3,4 have chips, then position 5 is free, position 6 has a chip, position 7 has a chip, position 8 is free.

So, between position 4 and 6, there's one free position, and between 7 and 8, there's another free position.

But we only need to move one chip to position 5.

So, the number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not already part of the block.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of chips that are not in their final positions in the block.

Wait, maybe it's equal to the number of zeros within the range of the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, in the first sample, number of zeros between positions 2 and 7 is one (position 5), and we make one move.

In the fourth sample, positions 1,3,5 have chips, so between positions 1 and 5, there are two zeros (positions 2 and 4), and the answer is two moves.

So, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, but in the third sample, n=6, arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1], no zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips, and the answer is zero moves.

Similarly, in the second sample, n=6, arr=[0,1,0,0,0,0], leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 2, no zeros between them, answer is zero moves.

In the first sample, leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 7, number of zeros between them is one (position 5), answer is one move.

In the fourth sample, leftmost at position 1, rightmost at position 5, zeros between them are positions 2 and 4, so two zeros, answer is two moves.

So, it seems that the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, but in the first sample, there is only one zero between leftmost and rightmost chips, and the answer is one move.

But in the fourth sample, there are two zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips, and the answer is two moves.

Similarly, in other samples, it matches.

So, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Hence, the solution is to find the leftmost and rightmost chips, extract the subarray between them, and count the number of zeros in that subarray.

That seems to be a simple and efficient solution.

Let me verify this with another example.

Suppose n=9, arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 8.

Subarray from position 2 to 8: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Number of zeros in this subarray is three.

According to the solution, the minimal number of moves should be three.

Looking at the operations, I can move the chip from position 8 to position 5, then position 7 to position 6, and position 6 to position 4.

Wait, but perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Wait, in the first move, move position 8 to position 5 (since position 5 is free), arr becomes [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

Then, move position 7 to position 4, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]

So, two moves.

But according to the earlier logic, it should be three moves.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

In this case, the number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips is three, but I was able to form a block with only two moves.

So, perhaps the minimal number of moves is not equal to the number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in this example, n=9, arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 8.

Subarray from position 2 to 8: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Number of zeros in this subarray is three.

But with two moves, I was able to form a block.

So, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips minus the number of chips that can be used to fill those zeros.

Wait, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have leftmost chip at position L and rightmost at position R.

The number of cells between L and R is R - L + 1.

The number of chips between L and R is the sum of a[L] to a[R].

The number of zeros between L and R is (R - L + 1) - number of chips.

But in the operations, I can move chips to the left to fill those zeros.

Each move fills one zero.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between L and R.

Wait, but in the earlier example, that would be three moves, but I was able to do it with two moves.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, in the subarray from position 2 to 8: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Number of zeros is three.

But in reality, to form a block of chips from position 2 to 6: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]

I need to move the chip from position 7 to position 5, and the chip from position 8 to position 6.

But position 6 is already occupied by the chip moved from position 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to make three moves.

First, move position 8 to position 5 (since position 5 is free), arr becomes [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

Then, move position 7 to position 4, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]

Then, move position 6 to position 3, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]

Wait, but position 6 was already moved in the previous step.

I'm getting confused.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the positions that need to be filled.

Let me consider that I need to choose a block of k consecutive cells to place all the chips, where k is the number of chips.

I need to choose the block such that the number of moves to move the chips into that block is minimized.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, the block must be to the left of or including the current positions of the chips.

To minimize the number of moves, I should choose the block that is as right as possible, so that I have to move the fewest chips to fill the gaps.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the block starting from the leftmost chip to the leftmost chip plus k - 1 positions to the right.

Wait, but I need to choose k consecutive cells.

Wait, perhaps I should find the window of k consecutive cells that overlaps the current positions of the chips as much as possible.

This sounds similar to finding the optimal window to cover all the chips by moving them only to the left.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the positions of the chips and then find the minimal number of moves to make them consecutive.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, the minimal number of moves would be the number of chips that are not already in their required positions in the final block.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix the final positions and see how many moves are needed to reach those positions.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have chips at positions p1, p2, ..., pk, sorted in increasing order.

I need to move them to positions q1, q2, ..., qk, where q1 < q2 < ... < qk, and qk - q1 + 1 = k.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, qi <= pi for all i.

I need to minimize the sum of (pi - qi) over all i.

This is equivalent to choosing q1, q2, ..., qk such that qi <= pi for all i, and qi are consecutive integers.

This is similar to choosing q1 such that q1, q1+1, ..., q1+k-1 <= pi for all i.

Wait, but I need qi <= pi for all i.

So, for each i, qi <= pi.

Also, qi must be consecutive, i.e., qi = q1 + i - 1.

So, for each i, q1 + i - 1 <= pi.

Therefore, q1 <= pi - i + 1 for all i.

To maximize q1, we take the minimum of (pi - i + 1) over all i.

Then, the final positions are q1, q1+1, ..., q1+k-1.

The number of moves is sum(pi - qi) over all i.

This seems like the way to go.

Let me try this with the first sample.

n=8

arr=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Chips at positions 2,3,4,6,7 -> p1=2, p2=3, p3=4, p4=6, p5=7

Compute q1 <= pi - i + 1 for all i:

For i=1: q1 <= 2 -1 +1 = 2

For i=2: q1 <= 3 -2 +1 = 2

For i=3: q1 <= 4 -3 +1 = 2

For i=4: q1 <= 6 -4 +1 = 3

For i=5: q1 <= 7 -5 +1 = 3

So, q1 <= min(2,2,2,3,3) = 2

Choose q1=2

Then, q1=2, q2=3, q3=4, q4=5, q5=6

So, final positions are 2,3,4,5,6

Now, compare with initial positions:

p1=2 -> q1=2, no move

p2=3 -> q2=3, no move

p3=4 -> q3=4, no move

p4=6 -> q4=5, move from 6 to 5, one move

p5=7 -> q5=6, move from 7 to 6, one move

Total moves: 2

But in the sample, it says only one move is needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sample explanation, they moved the chip from position 7 to position 5, which is one move, and then the arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0], which is a block from position 2 to 6.

So, only one move.

But according to my earlier calculation, it should be two moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a different q1.

Wait, perhaps choosing q1=3.

If q1=3, then q1=3, q2=4, q3=5, q4=6, q5=7

Then, compare:

p1=2 -> need to move to q1=3, move from 2 to 3 (but can only move to the left, which contradicts, so q1 cannot be greater than p1.

Wait, but q1 must be <= p1 -1 +1 = p1

Wait, in my earlier calculation, q1 <= p1 -i +1 for all i.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the indices.

Let me look up the standard way to solve the minimal number of moves to make array elements consecutive.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the median of the positions.

In the array, moving elements to the median minimizes the total distance.

But in this case, since moves are only to the left, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should fix the rightmost position.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the rightmost position of the block, and then determine the positions of the other chips accordingly.

Given that the block has to be k consecutive cells, and I can only move chips to the left, I need to choose the rightmost position for the block and see how many moves are required.

Then, choose the block position that minimizes the number of moves.

Let me try this approach.

First, find the number of chips, k.

Then, find all possible blocks of k consecutive cells where I can place all the chips by moving them only to the left.

Then, among these possible blocks, choose the one that requires the minimal number of moves.

To compute the number of moves for a particular block, I need to see how many chips are already in the block and how many need to be moved from positions to the right of the block into the free positions in the block.

Wait, but the block has to be chosen such that all chips can be moved into it by moving only to the left.

So, the block has to be to the left of or including the current positions of the chips.

Wait, more precisely, since I can only move chips to the left, the block has to be entirely to the left of the rightmost chip.

Wait, but I need to include all chips in the block, which is not possible if the block is entirely to the left of some chips.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the block such that it includes the leftmost chip and is as right as possible.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Let me look back at the initial idea.

If I can find the leftmost and rightmost chips, and count the number of zeros between them, that seems to give the minimal number of moves in the samples.

But in one case, it didn't match, so perhaps it's not always correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not covered by any chip.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of gaps between the chips.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not already occupied by chips.

Wait, but in the first sample, there is one zero between positions 4 and 6, and one between 7 and 8, but we only need to move one chip.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not already part of the block.

Wait, maybe it's the number of zeros within the range of the leftmost and rightmost chips.

In the first sample, range is from 2 to 7, within which there are two zeros (positions 5 and 8), but position 8 is outside the range, so only one zero (position 5).

Hence, one move.

In the fourth sample, range is from 1 to 5, within which there are two zeros (positions 2 and 4).

Hence, two moves.

In the third sample, range is from 1 to 6, all positions are occupied, no zeros, hence zero moves.

Seems consistent.

So, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips inclusive.

Hence, the solution is to find the leftmost and rightmost chips, extract the subarray between them, count the number of zeros in that subarray, and that's the answer.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me try it with the example where n=9, arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 8.

Subarray from position 2 to 8: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Number of zeros in this subarray is three.

Earlier, I thought I could do it with two moves, but perhaps it requires three moves.

Maybe I was mistaken in thinking it could be done with two moves.

Let me try again.

First, move the chip from position 8 to position 5 (since position 5 is free), arr becomes [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

Then, move the chip from position 7 to position 4, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]

Then, move the chip from position 6 to position 3, arr becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]

So, three moves in total.

Wait, but earlier I thought I could do it with two moves, but actually, I need to make sure that there are no gaps between the chips.

In the first move, moving position 8 to position 5, arr becomes [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

Now, chips are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

There are no zeros between positions 2 and 7, so no more moves are needed.

Wait, but in the previous step, I thought I needed three moves, but actually, after one move, the chips are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7 with no zeros between them, so only one move is needed.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

So, in this case, number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips is three, but only one move is needed.

Hence, the initial assumption that the number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost chips is incorrect.

So, perhaps it's not that straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not covered by any chip.

Wait, but in this case, there are three zeros between positions 2 and 8, and I made one move.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of zeros that are not already part of the block.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the leftmost chip at position L and rightmost at position R.

The number of cells between L and R is R - L + 1.

The number of chips in this range is the number of chips that are between L and R, inclusive.

The number of zeros in this range is (R - L + 1) - number of chips in this range.

But in reality, to make all chips form a block in this range, I need to have all chips within this range without any zeros between them.

So, the number of moves required is equal to the number of zeros in this range.

Wait, but in the earlier example, number of zeros is three, but only one move is needed.

So, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of zeros in this range minus the number of chips that are already in their required positions.

Wait, but that seems vague.

Let me consider that the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros in the range from L to R minus the number of chips that can be placed in the zeros without moving other chips.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that I need to choose a block of k consecutive cells to place all the chips, and I can only move chips to the left.

So, I need to choose a block that is as right as possible, but still allows all chips to be moved into it by moving only left.

Hence, the block should be the rightmost possible block where the leftmost chip can reach.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the positions of the chips and choose the block starting from the smallest position to the smallest position plus k -1.

But since I can only move chips to the left, I need to adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the minimal number of moves to make the chips consecutive by only moving them to the left.

This seems similar to arranging them in a sliding window fashion.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of chips that are not in their final positions in the chosen block.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me look back at the problem.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, I need to choose a block where the rightmost position of the block is less than or equal to the rightmost chip's current position.

Then, I need to fill the block from left to right, moving chips to the left as needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the minimal number of moves by ensuring that the chips are placed in consecutive cells without gaps by moving them only to the left.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip.

- Count the number of zeros between them (inclusive).

- The minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between them.

But as per the earlier example, this doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of zeros between them minus the number of chips that can be placed in those zeros without moving other chips.

This seems too vague.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have the positions of the chips sorted: p1 < p2 < ... < pk.

I need to choose q1, q2, ..., qk where q1 < q2 < ... < qk and qk - q1 + 1 = k, and qi <= pi for all i.

I need to minimize the sum of (pi - qi) over all i.

This is similar to assigning each chip to its final position in the block, with the constraint that the final positions are consecutive and qi <= pi.

This is equivalent to assigning the final positions as left as possible, given the constraints.

So, to minimize the sum of (pi - qi), I should choose qi to be as large as possible, but qi <= pi.

Hence, qi should be equal to pi minus the number of chips that need to be placed to the left of qi.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use dynamic programming or some other method to assign the final positions.

But time is limited, and I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

In the first sample, it's one zero, and one move.

In the fourth sample, it's two zeros, and two moves.

In the example where n=9, arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0], it's three zeros, and one move.

Wait, but this doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips minus the number of chips that can be placed in those zeros without moving other chips.

But I need a more precise definition.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of zeros in the range minus the number of chips that are already in the positions that can be filled by moving other chips.

This is too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix the block where I want to place all the chips.

I need to choose a block of k consecutive cells, where k is the number of chips.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, the block must be to the left of the rightmost chip.

Then, among all possible blocks to the left of the rightmost chip, I need to choose the one that maximizes the number of chips already in the block, so that I have to move fewer chips.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is equal to k minus the maximum number of chips already in any block of size k to the left of the rightmost chip.

Wait, but this seems complicated.

Let me try to implement this idea in the first sample.

n=8

arr=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Chips at positions 2,3,4,6,7 -> k=5

I need to choose a block of 5 consecutive cells to the left of the rightmost chip, which is position 7.

Possible blocks:

Positions 1-5: [0,1,1,1,0] -> number of chips already in the block: 4

Hence, moves needed: 5 - 4 = 1

Positions 2-6: [1,1,1,0,1] -> number of chips already in the block: 4

Moves needed: 1

Positions 3-7: [1,1,0,1,1] -> number of chips already in the block: 4

Moves needed: 1

Positions 4-8: [1,0,1,1,0] -> number of chips already in the block: 3

Moves needed: 2

So, the minimal number of moves is 1, which matches the sample.

In the fourth sample:

n=5

arr=[1,0,1,0,1]

Chips at positions 1,3,5 -> k=3

Possible blocks:

Positions 1-3: [1,0,1] -> number of chips already in the block: 2

Moves needed: 1

Positions 2-4: [0,1,0] -> number of chips already in the block: 1

Moves needed: 2

Positions 3-5: [1,0,1] -> number of chips already in the block: 2

Moves needed: 1

So, the minimal number of moves is 1, but in the sample, it's 2.

Wait, but in the sample, it's 2 moves.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in positions 1-3: [1,0,1], have two chips already in the block, so need to move one chip from position 5 to position 2.

But position 2 is free, so move position 5 to position 2.

Then, arr becomes [1,1,1,0,0], which is a block from positions 1-3.

So, only one move.

But in the sample, it says 2 moves.

Wait, perhaps the operations are different.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that in the fourth sample, the answer is 2.

But according to this approach, it seems like only one move is needed.

Hence, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that moving a chip to a position that is already occupied is not allowed, so I need to make sure that the target position is free.

In the fourth sample, if I move position 5 to position 2, which is free, arr becomes [1,1,1,0,0], which is a block from positions 1-3.

Hence, only one move is needed, but the sample says 2 moves.

So, perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the operations are sequential, and moving one chip affects the positions available for the next moves.

In the fourth sample, if I move position 5 to position 2, arr becomes [1,1,1,0,0].

Now, all chips are in positions 1,2,3, which is a block.

Hence, only one move is needed.

But the sample says 2 moves.

Wait, perhaps the sample is wrong, or perhaps I misread it.

Wait, in the problem statement, for the fourth sample, it says:

n=5

arr=[1,0,1,0,1]

Output: 2

But according to this approach, it should be 1 move.

Hence, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips that are not covered by any chip.

In the fourth sample, number of zeros between positions 1 and 5 is two (positions 2 and 4), hence two moves.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

This matches the fourth sample (2 moves), first sample (1 move), third sample (0 moves).

In the earlier confusion, I thought that in the fourth sample, only one move is needed, but according to the problem, it's two moves.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of moves is indeed equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Hence, the solution is to find the leftmost and rightmost chips, extract the subarray between them, and count the number of zeros in that subarray.

This seems to be correct.

Let me confirm with the fifth sample.

n=9

arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 8.

Subarray from position 2 to 8: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Number of zeros: three.

According to the problem, the answer is 3 moves.

Wait, in my earlier attempt, I thought I could do it with one move, but perhaps I was wrong.

Let me see:

If I move position 8 to position 5, arr becomes [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

Now, chips are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

There are no zeros between positions 2 and 7, so it's a block.

Hence, only one move is needed.

But according to the problem, the answer is 3 moves.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the problem statement, the fifth sample is:

9

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output:

3

But according to my approach, it should be one move.

Hence, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts the number of chips that need to be moved to fill the zeros.

In this case, there are three zeros between positions 2 and 8, so perhaps three moves are needed.

But in reality, I can fill all three zeros with one move by moving position 8 to position 5.

Hence, perhaps the problem expects the number of chips that need to be moved, which is three, but in reality, I can do it with one move.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the operation.

The operation is to choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left.

You can only move to the closest free cell to the left, not to any free cell to the left.

Hence, in the fifth sample, to move position 8 to position 5, I need to move it step by step: from 8 to 7, then from 7 to 6, then from 6 to 5.

Hence, three moves.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is three.

Hence, the initial assumption is incorrect.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is not equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Hence, I need to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

In the fifth sample, number of zeros is three, and the minimal number of moves is three.

In the first sample, number of zeros is one, and minimal number of moves is one.

In the fourth sample, number of zeros is two, and minimal number of moves is two.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Hence, the solution is to find the leftmost and rightmost chips, extract the subarray between them, count the number of zeros in that subarray, and that's the answer.

Hence, the program provided seems to implement this logic.

It finds the first occurrence of '1' from the left, and the first occurrence of '1' from the right, then extracts the subarray between them, and counts the number of zeros in that subarray.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips on a ribbon such that they form a single block without any free cells between them. The operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Range of Chips:** 
   - Find the position of the leftmost chip (first '1' from the left).
   - Find the position of the rightmost chip (first '1' from the right).

2. **Extract the Subarray:**
   - Extract the subarray that includes all cells from the leftmost to the rightmost chip.

3. **Count the Free Cells:**
   - Count the number of free cells (zeros) in this extracted subarray. This count represents the number of operations needed because each zero needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = data[index]
        index += 1
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the input data in one go and split it into a list for easier access.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the number of cells `n` and the string `arr` representing the cells.
   
3. **Finding Leftmost and Rightmost Chips:**
   - Use `find('1')` to get the position of the leftmost chip.
   - Use `[::-1].find('1')` to get the position of the rightmost chip from the end.
   
4. **Extracting the Relevant Subarray:**
   - Extract the subarray from the leftmost to the rightmost chip inclusive.
   
5. **Counting Zeros:**
   - Count the number of zeros in this subarray, which corresponds to the number of operations needed.
   
6. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the count of
