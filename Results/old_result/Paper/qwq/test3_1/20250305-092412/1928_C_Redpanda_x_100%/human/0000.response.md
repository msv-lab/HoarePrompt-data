Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned positions based on some k. The problem is to find out how many natural numbers k (greater than 1) satisfy the condition that for a given position n, the student gets the number x in the settling.

First, I need to understand how the settling works. It says that the first k people get numbers 1 to k, then the next k-2 people get numbers k-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, for example, if k=3, the sequence would be 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,... and so on.

Given that, for a position n, the student gets number x, I need to find all possible k >1 that fit this scenario.

Looking at the example in the problem:

For n=10 and x=2, the possible k are 2,3,5,6.

Let's see:

- For k=2: sequence is 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2. At position 10, it's 2.

- For k=3: sequence is 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2. Position 10 is 2.

- For k=5: sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2. Position 10 is 2.

- For k=6: sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2. Position 10 is 2.

So, these k values satisfy the condition.

Another example: n=3, x=1. Only k=2 works.

For k=2: sequence is 1,2,1,2,1,2,... Position 3 is 1.

So, the task is to find all k >1 such that in the repeating pattern of length 2k-2, the number at position n is x.

First, I need to find a way to model this pattern mathematically.

Observation 1: The pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, the position n can be reduced modulo 2k-2 to find its position within one period.

Let’s denote p = 2k - 2.

Then, the position n mod p will give us the position within the current period.

Now, within one period:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k.

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2.

So, for position n within one period:

- If 1 <= n mod p <= k, number is n mod p.

- If k < n mod p <= 2k-2, number is 2k - (n mod p).

Wait, let's see:

For k=3, p=4.

- Position 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, etc.

So, for n mod 4:

- 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 0:2 (since 4 mod 4=0, which corresponds to position p=4, which is 2).

Wait, in Python, modulo operation for positive numbers is fine, but need to handle it carefully.

So, in general:

Let’s define m = n mod p.

If m == 0, it corresponds to position p.

So, in the pattern:

- For 1 <= m <= k, number is m.

- For k < m <= p, number is 2k - m.

So, for m=0 (which is m=p), it's 2k - p = 2k - (2k-2) = 2.

Which matches the earlier example.

So, the general formula for the number at position n is:

m = n mod p, where p = 2k - 2

if m == 0: number = 2k - p = 2

else: number = m if m <=k else 2k - m

But wait, p = 2k -2, so 2k - p = 2k - (2k -2) = 2.

So, for m=0, number=2.

Otherwise:

if m <=k, number=m

else, number=2k - m

Given that, we have:

number = m if m <=k else 2k - m

with m = n mod p, p=2k-2

And if m==0, number=2.

Now, we need number = x.

So, we need to solve for k in natural numbers >1 such that:

if m !=0, m <=k -> x=m <=k, else x=2k - m (for m >k)

or if m=0, x=2.

But m = n mod p, p=2k-2.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the repeating pattern has period p=2k-2.

So, n can be written as n = a*p + b, where 1 <= b <=p.

Or, b = n mod p.

If p doesn't divide n, then b = n mod p.

Else, b=p.

Wait, in programming terms, in Python, n % p is 0 when p divides n.

But in position terms, position p corresponds to m=0.

So, m = n mod p

if m ==0: number=2

else:

if m <=k: number=m

else: number=2k - m

We need number=x.

So, cases:

1. m=0: number=2

So, if m=0 and x=2, it's valid.

Else, if m=0 and x !=2, invalid.

2. m <=k: number=m=x

So, m=x <=k

3. m >k: number=2k - m =x

So, 2k - m =x => m=2k -x

But m >k, so 2k -x >k => k >x

Also, m <=p=2k-2, since m=n mod p, and m >k.

So, 2k -x >k and 2k -x <=2k-2

Which simplifies to x <k and x >=2.

Wait, 2k -x <=2k-2 => -x <= -2 => x >=2.

So, k >x >=2.

Wait, let's see:

From m=2k -x >k

2k -x >k => k >x

And m=2k -x <=p=2k-2

2k -x <=2k-2 => -x <=-2 => x >=2.

So, k >x >=2.

So, in this case, m=2k -x, which equals x.

Wait, no: number=2k -m =2k - (2k -x) =x.

Wait, no: number=2k -m =x, and m=2k -x.

So, yes, it's consistent.

So, to summarize:

- If m=0, number=2.

- If m <=k, number=m.

- If m >k, number=2k -m.

We need number=x.

So, cases:

1. m=0: number=2=x => x=2.

2. m <=k: m=x <=k.

3. m >k: 2k -m =x => m=2k -x >k.

Also, m <=p=2k-2.

So, for case 3:

m=2k -x >k and m <=2k-2.

Which implies:

2k -x >k => k >x

And 2k -x <=2k-2 => x >=2.

So, k >x >=2.

Now, m=n mod p, where p=2k-2.

So, m=n mod (2k-2).

Now, for each case:

1. If m=0, then x=2.

2. If m <=k, then m=x <=k.

3. If m >k, then m=2k -x, with k >x >=2.

Now, I need to find all k >1 that satisfy one of these cases for given n and x.

But m=n mod (2k-2).

So, m can be from 0 to 2k-2.

Wait, m can be from 1 to 2k-2, since mod operation gives from 0 to p-1, but in position terms, it's from 1 to p.

Wait, in programming, n mod p gives from 0 to p-1.

So, in position terms, m= n mod p.

If m=0, it corresponds to position p.

So, in the code, need to handle m=0 as m=p.

So, m = n mod p.

if m ==0: m =p.

Then, apply the above logic.

So, m = n mod p.

if m ==0: m=p.

if m <=k: number=m.

else: number=2k -m.

Set this equal to x and solve for k.

Now, the problem is to find all k >1 that satisfy this equation for given n and x.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to rearrange the equations.

Case 1: m=0, number=2=x.

So, x=2.

And p divides n, since m=0.

So, 2k -2 divides n.

So, 2k -2 divides n.

So, 2k -2 is a divisor of n.

Wait, no.

m = n mod p.

If p divides n, then m=0.

So, p divides n.

So, 2k -2 divides n.

So, 2k -2 is a divisor of n.

So, for x=2, k must satisfy 2k -2 divides n and k >1.

Wait, but k >1 implies 2k -2 >=2.

So, for x=2, k must be such that 2k -2 divides n and k >1.

Case 2: m <=k, m=x.

So, m=x <=k.

Also, m = n mod p, where p=2k -2.

So, n mod (2k -2) =x.

And x <=k.

So, n ≡x mod (2k -2).

And x <=k.

Case 3: m >k, m=2k -x, with k >x >=2.

Again, m = n mod p, p=2k -2.

So, n mod (2k -2) =2k -x.

And 2k -x >k, which is k >x.

And x >=2.

So, n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2).

And k >x >=2.

Now, I need to find all k >1 that satisfy either:

- x=2 and 2k -2 divides n.

- n ≡x mod (2k -2) and x <=k.

- n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2) and k >x >=2.

So, in code, for each possible k, check if any of these conditions hold.

But since k can be up to a certain value, and n can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to iterate over possible k.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that the answer is finite, so there are only finitely many k that satisfy the conditions.

So, I need to find all k >1 such that one of the above conditions holds.

Looking at the constraints, t <=100, and n <=1e9.

So, for each test case, I need an efficient way to find all such k.

Let me consider each case separately.

First, for x=2, k must satisfy 2k -2 divides n and k >1.

So, for x=2, find all k such that 2k -2 divides n.

Similarly, for other cases.

Wait, but x can be from 1 to n-1.

So, I need to handle x=1 separately.

Wait, in the problem, x <n, so x can be from 1 to n-1.

In the settling, x can be from 1 to k.

But in the settling, x can be from 1 to k, but in the repeating pattern, x can be from 1 to k.

Wait, but in the problem, x can be from 1 to n-1, but in the settling, x can be from 1 to k.

So, need to make sure that x is within the possible values in the settling.

Wait, but in the settling, x can be from 1 to k, but in the repeating pattern, x can be from 1 to k.

But in the problem, x can be from 1 to n-1.

So, need to find k such that x is within 1 to k.

Wait, but in case 3, x >=2 and k >x.

So, x can be from 2 to floor((n-1)/2).

Wait, need to think carefully.

Let me try to find a way to compute the number of k for each test case efficiently.

Looking at the code provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

ans = 1

h = n - x

ans = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans2 = set()

if x != 1:

h = n + x - 2

ans2 = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans = ans.union(ans2)

print(len(ans))

def func_1(n):

factors = {}

nn = n

i = 2

while i * i <= nn:

while nn % i == 0:

factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1

nn //= i

i += 1

if nn > 1:

factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1

primes = list(factors.keys())

for factor in generate(0):

yield factor

def generate(k):

if k == len(primes):

yield 1

else:

rest = generate(k + 1)

prime = primes[k]

for factor in rest:

prime_to_i = 1

for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):

yield (factor * prime_to_i)

prime_to_i *= prime

Okay, so the code is trying to find some k that satisfy certain conditions.

It defines a function func_1(n) that seems to generate all divisors of n.

The generate function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors, which are the divisors of n.

Then, in the main loop, for each test case, it computes h = n - x and h = n + x - 2, and finds the divisors of these h values, and selects k that are even and satisfy k / 2 + 1 >= x.

Then, it takes the union of these sets and outputs the length.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, let's see what h represents.

In the code, h is set to n - x and n + x - 2.

Then, it finds the divisors of h using func_1(h), and selects k that are even and satisfy k / 2 + 1 >= x.

Wait, why is it using h = n - x and h = n + x - 2?

I need to relate this to the earlier equations.

Looking back, in case 2: n ≡x mod (2k -2), x <=k.

In case 3: n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2), k >x >=2.

So, let's see:

Case 2: n ≡x mod (2k -2)

Which means n -x is divisible by 2k -2.

So, 2k -2 divides n -x.

Similarly, case 3: n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2)

Which means n - (2k -x) is divisible by 2k -2.

So, n -2k +x is divisible by 2k -2.

Rearranged: n + x -2k is divisible by 2k -2.

But this seems a bit messy.

Wait, perhaps we can express it differently.

Let me denote p = 2k -2.

Then, for case 2: p divides n -x.

For case 3: p divides n - (2k -x).

So, p divides n -x in case 2.

And p divides n -2k +x in case 3.

Now, in case 3, k >x >=2.

So, perhaps I can solve for k in terms of p.

But it's getting complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be considering h = n -x and h = n +x -2, and finding divisors of h that are even and satisfy k / 2 +1 >=x.

Wait, perhaps the author is considering p divides h, where h is n -x or n +x -2.

Then, p = 2k -2, so k = (p +2)/2.

Then, k must be an integer, so p must be even.

Wait, p =2k -2, which is even since 2k is even and -2 is even, so p is even.

So, p is even, and k = (p +2)/2.

Then, for p to divide h, p must be a divisor of h.

So, to find k, we can find all p that divide h, and then k=(p +2)/2.

But k must be an integer, so p +2 must be even, which it is since p is even.

Hence, for each h, find all p that divide h, then k=(p +2)/2.

Then, check if k >1.

Also, need to ensure that k satisfies the conditions for the specific case.

Now, in the code, h is set to n -x and n +x -2.

So, perhaps these correspond to h = n -x and h = n - (2k -x), which simplifies to h = n -2k +x.

Wait, but in the code, h = n +x -2.

So, perhaps they set h = n +x -2, and then p divides h.

Then, p=2k -2 divides h = n +x -2.

So, 2k -2 divides n +x -2.

Then, k=(p +2)/2.

Similarly, for h = n -x, p divides n -x.

So, for both cases, find p that divides h, then k=(p +2)/2.

Then, check if k satisfies the original conditions.

Also, in the code, it requires that k is even and k /2 +1 >=x.

Wait, why k is even?

From k=(p +2)/2, p=2k -2.

If p is even, which it is, then k is integer.

But the code requires that k is even.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Let me see.

If p=2k -2, then k=(p +2)/2.

Now, k needs to be integer, which it is, since p is even.

But why require that k is even?

Maybe that's incorrect.

Perhaps the code has an error.

Let me check the example.

Take n=10, x=2.

Possible k:2,3,5,6.

Now, for k=2: p=2*2-2=2.

So, p=2 divides h.

For h=n -x=8, and h=n +x -2=10.

So, p=2 divides both 8 and 10.

Then, k=(2+2)/2=2.

Similarly, for k=3: p=4.

4 divides 8, but not 10.

Wait, k=3: p=4 divides h=8, but h=10 is not divisible by 4.

So, k=3 is only considered for h=8.

Similarly, k=5: p=8 divides h=8, but not h=10.

k=6: p=10 divides h=10.

So, in the code, it's taking the union of k from h=8 and h=10.

For h=8, p=2,4,8 divide 8.

k=(2+2)/2=2, (4+2)/2=3, (8+2)/2=5.

For h=10, p=2,10 divide 10.

k=(2+2)/2=2, (10+2)/2=6.

So, k=2,3,5,6 are considered, which matches the expected answer.

Now, in the code, it also checks that k is even and k /2 +1 >=x.

For k=2: even, 2/2 +1=2 >=2.

For k=3: not even.

Wait, but in the code, it's selecting only even k.

But in the example, k=3 is valid.

So, there's an inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps the condition is incorrect.

Looking back, the condition k is even and k /2 +1 >=x comes from somewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

In the example, for k=3, which is odd, it's still accepted.

So, the condition that k is even seems incorrect.

Hence, the code is flawed because it only considers even k.

But in the example, k=3 is valid, which is odd.

So, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
