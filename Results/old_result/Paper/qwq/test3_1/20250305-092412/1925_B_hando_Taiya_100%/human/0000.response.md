Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Jay created a problem of difficulty x and wants to make it the second problem for a Codeforces round. But Yash is worried that it might make the contest unbalanced, so he decides to break it down into n sub-problems. Each sub-problem should have a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of all these sub-problems should equal x.

Now, the coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problem set as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of all the sub-problems. Yash wants to maximize this balance by choosing the difficulties optimally.

Okay, so given x and n, I need to find the maximum possible GCD of a set of n positive integers that sum up to x.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if all the sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of some number d, then d is a possible GCD. The goal is to make d as large as possible.

Given that, I need to find the largest d such that:

1. d divides x (since the sum of the sub-problems is x, and each sub-problem is a multiple of d, their sum must also be a multiple of d).

2. It's possible to split x into n parts, each at least d and multiples of d.

Wait, each sub-problem must have a difficulty of at least 1, but since we're dealing with positive integers, it's at least d.

So, to maximize d, it must be a divisor of x, and it must be possible to have n numbers, each at least d, that sum up to x.

Let me think about the constraints:

- x can be up to 10^8, which is 100 million.

- n can be up to x, which is up to 100 million.

- t, the number of test cases, is up to 1000.

So, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(t * sqrt(x)) or better, because otherwise, it might be too slow.

First, I need to find all divisors of x, because d must be a divisor of x.

Then, among these divisors, I need to choose the largest d such that it's possible to split x into n parts, each being a multiple of d, and each at least d.

So, what's the condition for it being possible to split x into n parts, each at least d and multiples of d?

Well, since each part is at least d, the sum of n parts is at least n*d.

But we have that the sum is exactly x.

So, for it to be possible, x must be at least n*d.

But since d divides x, and x >= n*d, then x >= n*d.

Wait, but d divides x, so x is a multiple of d.

So, x = k * d, for some integer k.

And we have x >= n*d, which implies k >= n.

But k is x/d, which is an integer since d divides x.

So, k = x/d.

So, x/d >= n, which means x >= n*d.

Wait, but x = k*d, and k >= n.

So, to maximize d, we need the largest d such that x/d >= n.

In other words, d <= x/n.

So, among all divisors d of x, we need the largest d that is less than or equal to floor(x/n).

Wait, but d must divide x, and d <= floor(x/n).

So, the largest such d is the greatest divisor of x that is less than or equal to floor(x/n).

So, to find this, I can iterate through all divisors of x and pick the largest one that is <= floor(x/n).

That seems efficient enough, since iterating through all divisors of x can be done in O(sqrt(x)) time, and t is up to 1000, x is up to 10^8, which should be acceptable.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case, read x and n.

Then, find all divisors of x.

To find all divisors of x, I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, add both i and x/i to the list of divisors.

Then, find the largest divisor that is <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but floor(x/n) is x//n in integer division.

So, I can compute d_max = x // n.

Then, among all divisors of x, find the largest one that is <= d_max.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the divisors in descending order and pick the first one that is <= d_max.

But iterating through all divisors and sorting them would take O(d), where d is the number of divisors, which can be up to around 100 for x up to 10^8.

But since t is up to 1000, and x is up to 10^8, and for each test case, finding divisors takes O(sqrt(x)), which is up to 10^4, so total time would be around 10^7 operations, which should be acceptable.

But actually, I can do better.

Instead of generating all divisors and sorting them, I can iterate through possible divisors up to sqrt(x), and keep track of the largest divisor <= d_max.

Wait, even better, since I'm iterating i from 1 to sqrt(x), I can check if i divides x, and then consider both i and x/i.

For each i that divides x, if x/i <= d_max, then x/i is a candidate, and I can take the maximum among them.

Similarly, if i <= d_max, then i is a candidate.

So, I can keep a variable 'ans' initialized to 0, and for each i from 1 to sqrt(x):

- if i divides x:

- if i <= d_max, set ans = max(ans, i)

- if x/i <= d_max and x/i != i, set ans = max(ans, x/i)

This way, I don't need to generate all divisors or sort them; I can just keep track of the maximum during the iteration.

That should be efficient enough.

Let me think about the example given:

First test case: x=10, n=3

d_max = floor(10/3) = 3

Find all divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10

Among these, the ones <=3 are 1 and 2.

So, the largest is 2, which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=5, n=5

d_max = floor(5/5)=1

Divisors of 5:1,5

Among these, <=1 is only 1.

So, ans=1, matches the sample output.

Third test case: x=420, n=69

d_max = floor(420/69)= floor(69*6)=414, but 69*6=414, which is less than 420, so floor is 6.

Wait, 69*6=414, 69*7=483 which is >420, so floor is 6.

Find divisors of 420 that are <=6.

Divisors of 420:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,12,14,15,20,21,28,30,35,42,60,70,84,105,140,210,420.

Among these, <=6 are:1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, ans=6, matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, edge cases:

- n=1: In this case, there's only one sub-problem, which has difficulty x.

So, GCD is x.

But according to the condition, n <=x, and x >=n*d, which is x >=1*x, which holds.

So, ans=x.

- n=x: In this case, each sub-problem has difficulty 1.

So, GCD is 1.

- x=1, n=1: ans=1

- x=1, n>1: not possible, since each sub-problem must have at least difficulty 1, and sum is x=1.

But n>1 would require sum >=n*1 =n >1, which is impossible.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that valid inputs are given, so n <=x.

So, no need to handle n>x.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the difficulties of all the sub-problems are positive integers and their sum is equal to x", and "1 <=n <=x".

So, n <=x is guaranteed.

Hence, no need to handle n>x.

Another thing to consider: when n=1, ans=x.

When n=x, ans=1.

For other values, it's somewhere in between.

Now, in the code provided, it seems to implement this logic.

Let's look at the code:

from math import *

tc = int(input())

for _ in range(tc):

func_1()

def func_1():

(x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0

for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

if n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

print(ans)

Wait, isqrt is not a standard function in math module.

In Python 3.8 and above, math.isqrt(x) returns the integer square root of x.

Assuming that's available, it's fine.

But in some environments, it might not be available.

Alternatively, one can use int(sqrt(x)).

But since sqrt(x) might not be exact, it's better to use math.isqrt(x).

Now, in the loop:

for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

if n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

Wait, I think there's a mistake here.

According to earlier reasoning, d_max = floor(x/n).

But here, it's checking if n <= x//i or n <=i.

That seems incorrect.

Wait, let's see.

We have d_max = floor(x/n).

But in the code, it's checking if n <= x//i or n <=i.

That seems inverted.

Wait, perhaps it's a different way to achieve the same thing.

Let me think.

If i is a divisor of x, then x//i is also a divisor.

We need to find the largest d such that d <= floor(x/n).

So, we need to consider d = i and d = x//i.

So, for each i from 1 to sqrt(x):

- if i divides x:

- if i <= d_max, set ans = max(ans, i)

- if x//i <= d_max, set ans = max(ans, x//i)

But in the code, it's:

if n <= x//i:

ans = max(ans, i)

if n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x//i)

Wait, that's not the same.

Wait, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose we fix d, and we want to check if it's possible to split x into n parts, each multiple of d, and sum to x.

As earlier, the condition is that n*d <=x, since each part is at least d.

But d must divide x.

So, d divides x and n*d <=x.

But in the code, it's checking if n <=x//i or n <=i.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Let me recast the conditions.

We need d <= floor(x/n).

So, in the code, d_max = floor(x/n).

Then, for each divisor d of x, if d <= d_max, keep it.

Then, take the maximum such d.

So, in the code, it should be:

for i in range(1, isqrt(x)+1):

if x % i ==0:

if i <= d_max:

ans = max(ans, i)

if (x//i <= d_max) and (x//i != i):

ans = max(ans, x//i)

But in the given code, it's:

if n <= x//i:

ans = max(ans, i)

if n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x//i)

Which is different.

Wait, perhaps the condition n <=x//i is equivalent to i <= floor(x/n).

Wait, let's see.

x//i >=n is equivalent to x >=n*i.

But we need d <= floor(x/n), which is d <= floor(x/n).

Wait, d = i or d =x//i.

Wait, perhaps it's a different way to achieve the same thing.

Wait, maybe it's correct, just not intuitive.

Let me test it with the sample input.

First test case: x=10, n=3

d_max = floor(10/3)=3

Iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(10))+1=4

i=1:

x%i==0 (10%1==0)

if 3 <=10//1=10: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 3 <=1: False

i=2:

x%2==0

if 3 <=10//2=5: ans=max(1,2)=2

if 3 <=2: False

i=3:

x%3!=0, skip

i=4:

x%4!=0, skip

So, ans=2, which is correct.

Second test case: x=5, n=5

d_max= floor(5/5)=1

Iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(5))+1=3

i=1:

x%1==0

if 5 <=10//1=10: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 5 <=1: False

i=2:

x%2!=0, skip

i=3:

x%3!=0, skip

So, ans=1, correct.

Third test case: x=420, n=69

d_max= floor(420/69)=6

Iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(420))+1=21

i=1:

x%1==0

if 69 <=420//1=420: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 69 <=1: False

i=2:

x%2==0

if 69 <=420//2=210: ans=max(1,2)=2

if 69 <=2: False

i=3:

x%3==0

if 69 <=420//3=140: ans=max(2,3)=3

if 69 <=3: False

i=4:

x%4==0

if 69 <=420//4=105: ans=max(3,4)=4

if 69 <=4: False

i=5:

x%5==0

if 69 <=420//5=84: ans=max(4,5)=5

if 69 <=5: False

i=6:

x%6==0

if 69 <=420//6=70: ans=max(5,6)=6

if 69 <=6: False

...

Continuing like this, but ans will stay at 6.

So, ans=6, correct.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, it should be checking if d <= d_max, where d_max= floor(x/n).

But in the code, it's checking if n <=x//i or n <=i.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent.

Wait, in the first condition: if n <=x//i, then ans=max(ans, i)

But x//i is d, so if n <=x//i, which is n <=x/d, which is d <=x/n.

Wait, x//i is d, so n <=x//i is n <= floor(x/d), which implies d <= floor(x/n).

Wait, that seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, but it's producing the correct answer in the sample inputs.

Wait, perhaps it's a different approach, but I'm not sure.

Let me try another test case.

Suppose x=6, n=2

d_max= floor(6/2)=3

Divisors of 6:1,2,3,6

Among these, <=3 are 1,2,3.

So, ans=3.

According to the code:

Iterate i from1 to floor(sqrt(6))+1=3

i=1:

x%1==0

if 2 <=6//1=6: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 2 <=1: False

i=2:

x%2==0

if 2 <=6//2=3: ans=max(1,2)=2

if 2 <=2: ans=max(2,6//2)=max(2,3)=3

i=3:

x%3==0

if 2 <=6//3=2: ans=max(3,3)=3

if 2 <=3: ans=max(3,6//3)=max(3,2)=3

So, ans=3, correct.

Another test case: x=7, n=1

d_max= floor(7/1)=7

Divisors:1,7

Both <=7, so ans=7.

Code:

i from1 to floor(sqrt(7))+1=3

i=1:

x%1==0

if 1 <=7//1=7: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 1 <=1: ans=max(1,7//1)=max(1,7)=7

i=2:

x%2!=0, skip

i=3:

x%3!=0, skip

So, ans=7, correct.

Another test case: x=7, n=7

d_max= floor(7/7)=1

Divisors:1,7

Among these, <=1 is only1.

So, ans=1.

Code:

i from1 to floor(sqrt(7))+1=3

i=1:

x%1==0

if 7 <=7//1=7: ans=max(0,1)=1

if 7 <=1: ans=max(1,7//1)=max(1,7)=7

But n=7, so d_max=1, but ans=7 is wrong.

Wait, no, according to earlier reasoning, ans should be1.

Wait, in this case, d must be <=1, but 7 is >1, so ans should be1.

But according to the code, ans=7.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is flawed.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if n <=x//i:

ans=max(ans,i)

if n <=i:

ans=max(ans,x//i)

So, in this case:

x=7, n=7

d_max=1

Iterate i from1 to3:

i=1:

x%1==0

if7 <=7//1=7: ans=max(0,1)=1

if7 <=1: ans=max(1,7//1)=max(1,7)=7

i=2:

x%2!=0, skip

i=3:

x%3!=0, skip

So, ans=7, but correct answer should be1.

Wait, but according to the condition, d must be <= d_max=1.

But the code is setting ans=7, which is >1.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to add a condition to ensure d <= d_max.

Wait, perhaps the code should be:

for i in range(1, isqrt(x)+1):

if x % i ==0:

if i <= d_max:

ans = max(ans, i)

if (x//i <= d_max) and (x//i != i):

ans = max(ans, x//i)

That would ensure that only divisors <= d_max are considered.

In the above code, it's not doing that; it's setting ans to max whenever n <=x//i or n <=i.

Which is incorrect, as shown in the x=7, n=7 test case.

So, the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it's producing correct outputs.

But in this particular test case, it's giving wrong output.

Wait, perhaps the problem constraints ensure that n <=x, and n >=1.

In the x=7, n=7 case, it should output1, but the code outputs7.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, it's allowed that n <=x.

In this case, n=7, x=7, d_max=1.

But the code is outputting7, which is wrong.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I need to fix it.

So, the correct approach is:

- Compute d_max = floor(x/n)

- Find the largest divisor of x that is <= d_max

Hence, the code should be:

for i in range(1, isqrt(x)+1):

if x % i ==0:

if i <= d_max:

ans = max(ans, i)

if (x//i <= d_max) and (x//i != i):

ans = max(ans, x//i)

Then, print ans.

In the given code, it's not doing that; it's using n <=x//i and n <=i, which is incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
