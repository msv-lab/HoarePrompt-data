Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n x n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. I can perform two types of operations on it. Each operation allows me to set an entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. My goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row i and set its elements to any permutation of 1 through n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column i and set its elements to any permutation of 1 through n.

Since the matrix is initially all zeros, every operation I perform will set the entire row or column to some permutation. Each permutation sums up to n*(n+1)/2, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Now, I need to maximize the sum of the entire matrix. To do this, I should aim to set as many cells as possible to the highest possible values. However, since rows and columns can overlap, I need to be careful not to overwrite values unnecessarily.

Let's think about how many operations I can perform. The constraint is that I can't use more than 2n operations. Since there are n rows and n columns, 2n operations give me enough flexibility to set all rows and columns if needed.

One straightforward approach is to set all rows using type 1 operations. That would require n operations, and the sum would be n * (n*(n+1)/2). Similarly, I could set all columns using type 2 operations, also requiring n operations and achieving the same sum.

But maybe I can do better by combining both types of operations. For example, set some rows and some columns in a way that maximizes the sum without too much overlap.

Wait a minute, when I set a row, I'm setting all its elements, and when I set a column, I'm setting all its elements. If I set a row and then set a column that intersects with that row, the cell at their intersection will be overwritten by the column operation.

So, overlapping operations will cause some cells to be overwritten. I need to minimize the overwriting of high values or maximize the overwriting of low values.

Let me try to think of an example. Suppose n=2.

If I set both rows using type 1 operations:

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [2,1]

Operation 2: Set row 2 to [2,1]

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum: 2+1+2+1=6

Alternatively, set both columns using type 2 operations:

Operation 1: Set column 1 to [2,1]

Operation 2: Set column 2 to [2,1]

Matrix:

2 2

1 1

Sum: 2+2+1+1=6

Another option: set one row and one column.

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [2,1]

Operation 2: Set column 2 to [2,1]

Matrix:

2 1 <- set by row 1

2 1 <- set by column 2

Wait, in this case, the intersection cell (1,2) is set by both operations. The column operation overwrites the row operation for that cell.

So, matrix becomes:

2 2

2 1

Sum: 2+2+2+1=7

That's higher than the previous sums of 6. So, by carefully choosing which rows and columns to set, I can achieve a higher sum.

In this example, with n=2, the maximum sum is 7, which matches the example provided.

So, the strategy seems to be: set some rows and some columns in a way that maximizes the sum, taking into account the overwriting that happens at the intersections.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n.

Let me think about what happens when I set a row and then set a column.

Each time I set a row, I'm setting n cells to a permutation of 1 to n. Similarly for columns.

But when a column operation overwrites a row operation on their intersection, the value in that cell becomes the one from the column operation.

So, to maximize the sum, I want the overwriting to be such that higher values are written over lower values.

Wait, but I'm using permutations, so each row or column has to contain all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to look at it.

Let's consider that each cell can be set only by either a row operation or a column operation, but not both, to avoid overwriting.

But that's not possible because if I set a row and a column, their intersection will be overwritten.

Alternatively, maybe I can accept that some overwriting happens and find a way to maximize the sum despite that.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Suppose I set all rows using type 1 operations. That would require n operations, and the sum would be n * (n*(n+1)/2).

But I can use up to 2n operations, so I can set n rows and n columns.

But as we saw in the n=2 example, setting one row and one column can give a higher sum than setting both rows or both columns.

So, perhaps I should set some rows and some columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

But how to determine how many rows and how many columns to set?

Let me consider the following:

Suppose I set r rows and c columns, with r + c <= 2n.

Each row set contributes n*(n+1)/2 to the sum, and each column set contributes n*(n+1)/2 to the sum.

But, for each pair of a set row and a set column, their intersection cell is overwritten by the column operation.

So, the total sum would be: sum = r * n * (n+1)/2 + c * n * (n+1)/2 - r * c * (n+1)/2

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.

Each row operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n*(n+1)/2 to the sum.

Each column operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n*(n+1)/2 to the sum.

But when a row and a column are both set, their intersection cell is set twice, once by the row operation and once by the column operation, with the column operation overwriting the row operation.

So, for each pair of a set row and a set column, the value in their intersection cell is from the column operation, and the value from the row operation is lost.

Therefore, the total sum should be: sum = (r * n + c * n - r * c) * (n+1)/2

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Because each row operation sets n cells, each contributing (n+1)/2 on average.

Similarly for column operations.

But when a cell is overwritten, the value from the column operation replaces the value from the row operation.

So, the sum should be: sum from row operations + sum from column operations - sum from the overwrites.

Specifically, for each cell that is overwritten, the value from the row operation is subtracted and the value from the column operation is added.

But since both are (n+1)/2 on average, perhaps it cancels out.

Wait, that can't be right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set r rows and c columns, with r + c <= 2n.

The total sum would be: sum = r * n * (n+1)/2 + c * n * (n+1)/2 - r * c * (n+1)/2

Because for each intersection of a set row and a set column, the cell is overwritten, so we subtract the value that was set by the row operation and add the value set by the column operation.

But both are (n+1)/2 on average, so the net effect is zero.

Wait, but that can't be, because in the n=2 example, setting one row and one column gives sum 7, which is more than setting just one row or one column alone.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the average value is incorrect.

Let me calculate it properly.

Suppose I set r rows and c columns.

The sum from the row operations is r * n * (n+1)/2.

The sum from the column operations is c * n * (n+1)/2.

But for each cell that is at the intersection of a set row and a set column, the value set by the row operation is overwritten by the column operation.

Therefore, the total sum should be: sum = (r * n - r * c) * (n+1)/2 + c * n * (n+1)/2

Because r * c cells are overwritten, so we subtract r * c * (n+1)/2 from the row operations' sum and add c * n * (n+1)/2 for the column operations.

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Let me think again.

Each row operation sets n cells to a permutation of 1 to n, contributing n*(n+1)/2 to the sum.

Each column operation does the same.

But when a cell is set by both a row operation and a column operation, the final value is from the column operation.

So, the total sum should be: sum from row operations for cells set only by row operations + sum from column operations for cells set only by column operations + sum from column operations for cells set by both.

So, sum = (r * n - r * c) * (n+1)/2 + c * n * (n+1)/2

Because the r * c cells that are set by both have their values from the column operations.

Wait, but this still seems off.

Let me try plugging in the n=2 example.

Set r=1 row and c=1 column.

sum = (1*2 - 1*1) * 3/2 + 1*2 * 3/2 = (2 - 1) * 1.5 + 2 * 1.5 = 1.5 + 3 = 4.5

But in reality, the sum is 7, which is 7.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Maybe this approach is incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

Let's consider that each cell can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, but if both are set, it's set by the column operation.

So, for each cell, if its row is set and its column is not set, its value is from the row operation.

If its column is set (regardless of whether its row is set), its value is from the column operation.

So, for each cell, its value is from the column operation if its column is set, otherwise from the row operation.

Therefore, the sum can be calculated as:

sum = sum over all cells (if column is set, value from column operation, else value from row operation)

But since we're dealing with permutations, the sum from the column operations is c * n * (n+1)/2, and the sum from the row operations is (n - c) * n * (n+1)/2.

Wait, no.

Actually, if a column is set, the values in that column are from the column operation, which is a permutation of 1 to n.

Similarly, if a column is not set, the values in that column are from the row operations.

Wait, but if a column is not set, the values in that column are from the row operations.

But if both a row and a column are set, the value is from the column operation.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different way to maximize the sum.

Let me think about the maximum possible sum.

If I could set every cell to n, the sum would be n^3, but that's not possible because permutations must contain all numbers from 1 to n.

So, the maximum sum is constrained by the fact that each row and each column must be a permutation of 1 to n.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true.

Because a row operation sets a row to a permutation, but a column operation sets a column to a permutation.

But a cell can be set by both, with the column operation overwriting the row operation.

So, it's possible for rows and columns to have duplicates if set independently.

Wait, no. Each row operation sets a row to a permutation, and each column operation sets a column to a permutation.

But when a cell is set by both, it's set by the column operation.

So, the rows that are set by row operations are permutations, and the columns that are set by column operations are permutations, and the intersections are set by the column operations.

But, in reality, the rows that are set by row operations but have some columns set by column operations will have some elements from the column operations, which may not maintain the permutation property.

Wait, but the problem doesn't require the rows and columns to be permutations; it just says that in each operation, you set a row or a column to a permutation.

The constraints are only on the operations, not on the final matrix.

So, the final matrix doesn't need to have all rows and columns as permutations; it just needs to be the result of the operations performed.

Therefore, I don't need to worry about the final matrix having rows and columns as permutations; I just need to maximize the sum of its elements.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as assigning values to the matrix in a way that each row and each column has at most one operation setting it.

Wait, but operations can overlap, and overwriting occurs.

Let me try to think in terms of assigning values to the matrix.

Initially, all cells are 0.

Each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

If a cell is set by both a row operation and a column operation, the column operation overwrites the row operation.

So, for each cell, its value is:

- If its column is set, then it's the value from the column operation.

- If its column is not set, then it's the value from the row operation, if the row is set.

- If neither row nor column is set, it remains 0.

Wait, no. If neither row nor column is set, it remains 0.

If only the row is set, the cell takes the value from the row operation.

If only the column is set, the cell takes the value from the column operation.

If both are set, the cell takes the value from the column operation.

So, the value of each cell is:

- If column is set, value from column operation.

- Else, if row is set, value from row operation.

- Else, 0.

Therefore, the sum of the matrix is:

sum = sum over all columns that are set of the sum of their permutation + sum over all rows that are not set of the sum of their permutation.

Since each permutation sums to n*(n+1)/2, this would be:

sum = c * n * (n+1)/2 + (r - c) * n * (n+1)/2

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Sum = sum over all columns set of sum of their permutation + sum over all rows not set of sum of their permutation.

But this double-counts the cells where both row and column are set.

Wait, no.

Actually, since the column operation overwrites the row operation for the intersection cells, those cells should only be counted once in the column's sum.

Therefore, the total sum is:

sum = sum over all columns set of sum of their permutation + sum over all rows not set of sum of their permutation.

Because for rows not set, their values are set by row operations, and for columns set, their values are set by column operations, overwriting any row operations.

So, sum = c * n * (n+1)/2 + (r - c) * n * (n+1)/2

Simplifying, sum = (c + r - c) * n * (n+1)/2 = r * n * (n+1)/2

Wait, that can't be right because it suggests that the sum only depends on r, which contradicts the example.

In the n=2 example, setting r=1 row and c=1 column gives sum=7, which is more than setting r=2 rows, which would give sum=6.

But according to this, sum = r * n * (n+1)/2 = 1 * 2 * 3/2 = 3, which doesn't match the example sum of 7.

So, clearly, this approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when a column is set, it overwrites the cells in the rows that are set.

So, perhaps the sum should be:

sum = sum over all rows set of sum over columns not set of the row's permutation values + sum over all columns set of sum over their permutations.

But this seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think in terms of maximizing the sum by prioritizing higher values in the matrix.

Given that permutations must contain all numbers from 1 to n, the highest possible sum is achieved by maximizing the number of high values in the matrix.

One way to do this is to set as many columns as possible, because columns affect all rows.

Wait, but I have a limit of 2n operations.

Wait, perhaps I can set all columns using type 2 operations, which would require n operations, and then set some rows using type 1 operations, up to n operations, totaling 2n operations.

But I need to find the optimal combination of row and column operations to maximize the sum.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Set all columns using type 2 operations, which would require n operations, and set each column to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], so that the highest values are placed in the first rows.

- Then, use the remaining operations to set rows that are not yet set, to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But I need to keep track of which rows have been set by column operations.

Wait, no. Actually, since column operations overwrite row operations, I need to ensure that the row operations are not overwritten by column operations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set rows first and then set columns on top of that.

Let me try that.

Suppose I set r rows using type 1 operations, and then set c columns using type 2 operations, with r + c <= 2n.

Then, the sum would be:

sum = sum over rows not set of sum of their permutations (which are zero, since they are not set) + sum over rows set of sum of their permutations minus the cells overwritten by column operations + sum over columns set of sum of their permutations.

But this seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that calculating the exact sum for arbitrary r and c is tricky, and instead look for a pattern or a formula that directly gives the maximum sum.

Looking back at the n=2 example, the maximum sum is 7, which is achieved by setting one row and one column.

Similarly, for n=1, the maximum sum is 1.

For n=3, let's see:

If I set all three rows, sum = 3 * (3*4/2) = 18.

If I set two rows and one column, sum = 2 * 6 + 3 - overlaps.

Wait, in n=2, setting one row and one column gave sum=7.

In n=1, setting one row gives sum=1.

Maybe there's a pattern here.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n * (n+1)/2 * something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n * n * (n+1)/2 - some overlaps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of operations.

Since I can perform up to 2n operations, I can set up to n rows and n columns.

But I need to maximize the sum, taking into account the overwriting.

Wait, perhaps I can set all columns using type 2 operations, which would require n operations, and then set the remaining n operations to set rows that are not yet "covered" by the column operations.

But I need a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the dual problem: minimizing the number of zeros in the matrix.

Each row operation sets its row to a permutation, eliminating zeros in that row.

Each column operation sets its column to a permutation, eliminating zeros in that column.

But in this problem, I need to maximize the sum, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the contribution of each cell.

Each cell can be set by its row operation or its column operation, with the column operation taking precedence.

Therefore, the sum is equal to the sum over all columns set of the sum of their permutation plus the sum over all rows not set of the sum of their permutation.

Wait, that seems plausible.

So, sum = c * n * (n+1)/2 + (r - c) * n * (n+1)/2

But earlier, this didn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust it.

Wait, in the n=2 example, if r=1 and c=1, then sum = 1*2*3/2 + (1-1)*2*3/2 = 3 + 0 = 3, but the example sum is 7.

So, clearly, this is incorrect.

I must be missing something.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I set r rows and c columns, with r + c <= 2n.

Then, the sum is:

sum = sum over all columns set of sum of their permutation + sum over all rows set minus the intersections.

Wait, more carefully:

sum = sum over all columns set of sum of their permutation + sum over all rows set of sum of their permutation minus sum over intersections of the row permutations (since they are overwritten).

But since the permutations are the same, this might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each column operation sets n cells to a permutation, and each row operation sets n cells to a permutation, but the intersections are only counted once.

So, total sum is:

sum = sum over all column operations of their permutations + sum over all row operations of their permutations minus sum over the intersections.

But calculating this seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for an upper bound on the sum and try to achieve that.

What's the maximum possible sum?

If I could set every cell to n, the sum would be n^3.

But due to the permutation constraints, I can't do that.

Each row or column can have each number from 1 to n exactly once.

But since operations can overwrite each other, perhaps I can arrange operations to maximize the number of high values in the matrix.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- Set all columns using type 2 operations, which would set all cells in those columns to permutations.

- Then, set as many rows as possible using type 1 operations, without overwriting the column operations too much.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me try to think in terms of graph theory.

Imagine the matrix as a bipartite graph, with rows and columns as two sets of vertices, and cells as edges.

Each operation corresponds to selecting a row or a column and assigning values to the corresponding cells.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Maybe I need to accept that finding the exact sum is tricky and instead focus on achieving the maximum possible sum by setting as many columns as possible.

Given that column operations overwrite row operations, perhaps setting as many columns as possible is beneficial.

But in the n=2 example, setting one column and one row gives a higher sum than setting two columns or two rows.

So, perhaps there's a trade-off.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to set all columns using type 2 operations, which would require n operations, and then set the remaining operations to set rows that are not yet "covered" by the column operations.

But in the n=2 example, setting one column and one row gives a higher sum than setting two columns.

So, maybe setting all columns isn't always optimal.

Wait, perhaps the optimal number of columns to set is when n * (n+1)/2 > i * n for some i.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the point where setting an additional row operation starts to decrease the marginal gain in the sum.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

(sum, r) = (0, 0)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:

r = i

sum += n * (n + 1) // 2

else:

sum += i * n

print(sum, n + r)

for j in range(1, n + r + 1):

if j <= n:

print(1, j, end=' ')

print(*range(1, n + 1))

else:

print(2, j % n, end=' ')

print(*range(1, n + 1))

So, it's taking t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n.

Then, it calculates sum and r in a loop from i=1 to n.

It seems to be trying to maximize the sum by choosing how many rows to set with row operations and how many columns to set with column operations.

It sets r to i where n * (n + 1)/2 > i * n.

Wait, n * (n + 1)/2 is the sum of a single permutation, and i * n is i times n.

Wait, i * n would be the sum if you set i rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], but I'm not sure.

This is confusing.

Then, it prints the sum and m = n + r operations.

Then, it performs operations:

- First n operations are setting rows 1 to n with permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

- Then, additional r operations are setting columns 1 to r with permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Wait, but in the n=2 example, setting one row and one column with [1,2], it achieves sum=7.

But according to this code, for n=2:

sum starts at 0, r=0.

for i=1:

2 * 3 / 2 = 3 > 1 * 2 = 2 → r=1, sum=3

for i=2:

3 > 2 * 2 = 4 → condition false, sum += 2 * 2 = 4 → sum=7, r=1

Then, m = 2 + 1 = 3 operations.

First operation: set row 1 with [1,2]

Second operation: set row 2 with [1,2]

Third operation: set column 1 with [1,2]

Which matches the example output.

Wait, but in the code, it sets the first n operations as type 1 operations (rows), and the next r operations as type 2 operations (columns).

In the n=2 example, it sets two rows and one column, which matches the example.

So, it seems to be correct for n=2.

Let me see for n=1.

sum=1, r=0 (since n*(n+1)/2=1 > 1*1=1 is false), so sum=1, m=1+0=1

Operation: set row 1 with [1]

Which matches the first test case.

Another test case, n=3.

According to the code:

for i=1:

3*4/2=6 > 1*3=3 → r=1, sum=6

for i=2:

6 > 2*3=6 → false, sum += 2*3=6 → sum=12, r=1

for i=3:

6 > 3*3=9 → false, sum += 3*3=9 → sum=21, r=1

m = 3 + 1 = 4 operations.

Operations:

Set row 1: [1,2,3]

Set row 2: [1,2,3]

Set row 3: [1,2,3]

Set column 1: [1,2,3]

What's the resulting matrix?

Initially:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

After setting row 1: [1,2,3]

1 2 3

0 0 0

0 0 0

After setting row 2: [1,2,3]

1 2 3

1 2 3

0 0 0

After setting row 3: [1,2,3]

1 2 3

1 2 3

1 2 3

After setting column 1: [1,2,3]

1 2 3

2 2 3

3 2 3

Sum: 1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+2+3 = 8 + 7 + 8 = 23

But according to the code, sum=21.

Wait, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, for n=3, it sets three rows and one column, totaling four operations.

But the sum according to the code is sum=12, but in reality, it's 23.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, let's see.

for i=1: 6 > 3 → r=1, sum=6

for i=2: 6 > 6 → false, sum += 6 → sum=12

for i=3: 6 > 9 → false, sum += 9 → sum=21

But in reality, the sum is 23.

So, the code is miscalculating the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
