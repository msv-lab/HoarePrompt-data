Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is just the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

I need to output the coordinates of these n cells for each test case, and there can be up to 50 test cases, with n ranging from 2 to 1000.

First, I need to understand what the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances is for a given n, and how to choose the cells to achieve that.

Let's look at the examples provided:

For n=2:

Output:

1 1

1 2

So, two cells in a 2x2 grid: (1,1) and (1,2). The distinct Manhattan distances are 0 (distance from a cell to itself) and 1 (distance between (1,1) and (1,2)).

For n=3:

Output:

2 1

2 3

3 1

The distinct distances are 0, 2 (between (2,1) and (2,3)), 1 (between (2,1) and (3,1)), and 3 (between (2,3) and (3,1)).

For n=4:

Output:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

Distances: 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5.

Wait, let's calculate:

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): |1-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): |4-4| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1

So, the distinct distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. That's 7 distinct distances.

But for n=4, the grid is 4x4, and we're choosing 4 cells.

I need to see what's the maximum number of distinct distances possible for a given n.

In general, for n cells, the number of unique distances can be up to C(n,2), which is n(n-1)/2, but in practice, due to the grid structure, it might be less.

But in the first example, for n=2, we have 2 distinct distances (0 and 1), which is C(2,2) = 1, plus 0.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the distance from a cell to itself is 0, and then the distances to other cells.

So, for n cells, there are n choose 2 pairs, plus n distances of 0.

But in the first example, they only listed distances between different cells, I think.

Wait, in the first example, they included distances from a cell to itself, but maybe it's not necessary to consider them, or maybe they are implicitly included.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on distances between distinct pairs only, as the problem mentions "any pair of cells", which might imply distinct pairs.

But in the first example, they have {0,1}, but 0 is the distance from a cell to itself.

Maybe it's acceptable to include it.

Anyway, perhaps it's safer to include distances from cells to themselves.

So, for n cells, there are n distances of 0, and then C(n,2) distances between distinct pairs.

But the key is to maximize the number of distinct values among these distances.

So, I need to choose n cells such that the set of Manhattan distances between any two cells (including themselves) has the maximum number of unique values.

Looking back at the examples:

For n=2:

- Chose (1,1) and (1,2)

- Distances: 0 (for each cell to itself), and 1 between them.

- Unique distances: 0,1

For n=3:

- Chose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances: 0, 2, 1, 3

- Unique distances: 0,1,2,3

For n=4:

- Chose (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

- Distances: 0,2,5,3,4,1,6

- Unique distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

It seems like they are trying to maximize the range of distances.

But what's the maximum possible distance in an n x n grid?

The maximum Manhattan distance is between two corners, say (1,1) and (n,n), which is |1-n| + |1-n| = 2(n-1).

So, for n=2, max distance is 2, but in the first example, they only achieved up to 1.

Wait, in n=2, the possible distances are 0,1,2.

With their choice: (1,1) and (1,2), the distances are 0,0,1.

Wait, but they could have chosen (1,1) and (2,2), which would give distances 0,0,2, and between (1,1) and (2,2) is 2.

But in their choice, they have distances 0 and 1.

So, perhaps there are multiple choices, but the goal is to maximize the number of unique distances, not necessarily to reach the maximum distance.

Wait, but in n=3, they have distances up to 3, which is less than the maximum possible of 4.

Wait, for n=3, the maximum Manhattan distance is |1-3| + |1-3| = 4.

But in their choice, the distances are 0,2,1,3.

So, they are missing distance 4.

But perhaps distance 4 is not achievable with their chosen cells.

Let's check:

Cells: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- (2,1) to (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Plus, each cell to itself: 0

So, indeed, they have distances 0,1,2,3.

Distance 4 is not achievable with this selection.

Is it possible to have distance 4 with n=3?

If I choose different cells, say (1,1), (1,2), (1,3):

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,2) to (1,3): 1

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,2

Still no 4.

Wait, but in a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance is 4, but to achieve distance 4, you need to have cells like (1,1) and (3,3), which are diagonally opposite.

But in their selection, they didn't include such cells, so they couldn't achieve distance 4.

But their goal is to maximize the number of unique distances, not necessarily to reach the maximum distance.

So, perhaps their selection is optimal in terms of the number of unique distances.

But in n=4, they have distances up to 6, which is the maximum possible: |1-4| + |1-4| = 6.

So, perhaps for n=4, their selection achieves all possible unique distances from 0 up to 6.

Wait, but is that the case?

Let's see:

Selected cells: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (4,3): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,3) to (4,3): 3 + 0 = 3

- (1,3) to (4,4): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,3) to (4,4): 0 + 1 = 1

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

So, they have 7 unique distances.

Is this the maximum possible?

In a 4x4 grid, the possible distances are from 0 up to 6.

So, they've covered all possible distances.

Therefore, for n=4, this selection is optimal in terms of covering all possible unique distances.

Similarly, for n=3, in their selection, they have distances 0,1,2,3, which seems to be the maximum possible, as distance 4 cannot be achieved with their selection.

Wait, but in n=3, is distance 4 achievable at all?

Let's see:

In a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance is |1-3| + |1-3| = 4.

So, if I choose cells (1,1) and (3,3), the distance is 4.

But in their selection, they have (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).

The distance between (2,1) and (3,3) is |2-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.

So, even if I add (3,3) to their selection, would that increase the number of unique distances?

Wait, but they are choosing only n=3 cells.

So, perhaps in n=3, it's not possible to have distance 4 with only 3 cells.

Wait, but if I choose (1,1), (1,3), (3,3):

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (1,3) to (3,3): 2

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,2,4

So, that's three unique distances.

But in their selection, they have four unique distances: 0,1,2,3.

So, their selection is better in terms of the number of unique distances.

Therefore, maximizing the number of unique distances doesn't necessarily mean covering the maximum possible distance.

It's about covering as many different distance values as possible.

So, perhaps their selection is optimal for n=3.

Similarly, for n=4, their selection covers distances from 0 to 6, which is 7 unique distances.

Is that the maximum possible?

Yes, because in a 4x4 grid, the possible distances range from 0 to 6, and they've covered all of them.

So, their selection is optimal.

Similarly, for n=2, choosing (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances 0 and 1, which is two unique distances.

Is that the maximum possible?

Yes, because in a 2x2 grid, the possible distances are 0,1,2.

But with only two cells, you can't achieve all three distances, because to get distance 2, you need to have cells at opposite corners, like (1,1) and (2,2), which would give distances 0,0,2.

So, unique distances: 0,2.

That's only two unique distances.

So, their selection of (1,1) and (1,2) gives two unique distances: 0 and 1.

Another selection gives 0 and 2.

So, both selections give two unique distances.

But the problem says "it can be shown that it is the greatest possible answer."

Wait, but in n=2, is two the maximum number of unique distances?

Yes, because you can't have three unique distances with only two cells.

So, their selection is correct.

Moving on, for n=5 and n=6, their selections seem to cover a range of distances.

So, the general approach seems to be choosing cells in such a way that the Manhattan distances between them cover as many unique values as possible.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for i in range(0, int(input())):

n = int(input())

print(1, 1)

print(1, 2)

for i in range(3, n + 1):

print(i, i)

So, for each test case, it reads n, and then outputs n cells:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

- ...

- (n,n)

Wait, but starting from i=3, it prints (i,i).

So, for n=2:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

For n=3:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

For n=4:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

Wait, but in the example for n=3, their selection is:

- (2,1)

- (2,3)

- (3,1)

Which is different from what the program is outputting.

Similarly, for n=4, their example selection is:

- (1,1)

- (1,3)

- (4,3)

- (4,4)

Which again is different from what the program is outputting.

So, the program's selection is not matching the example outputs.

Does that mean the program is incorrect?

Not necessarily, because the problem states that if there are multiple solutions, any one of them is acceptable.

So, as long as the program's selection achieves the maximum number of unique distances, it's acceptable.

Therefore, I need to verify if the program's selection achieves the maximum number of unique distances for each n.

Let's check for n=2:

Selection: (1,1), (1,2)

Distances: 0,0,1

Unique distances: 0,1

Which matches the example.

For n=3:

Selection: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,2) to (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,3,4

So, four unique distances.

In the example, they have four unique distances: 0,1,2,3.

So, both selections achieve four unique distances.

Different sets of distances, but the number is the same.

So, in terms of the number of unique distances, it's the same.

For n=4:

Program's selection: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2) to (3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (3,3) to (4,4): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Which is seven unique distances, same as in the example.

So, for n=3 and n=4, the program's selection achieves the same number of unique distances as in the examples.

For n=5:

Program's selection: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,2) to (3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2) to (5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (3,3) to (4,4): 1 + 1 = 2

- (3,3) to (5,5): 2 + 2 = 4

- (4,4) to (5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

That's nine unique distances.

Is that the maximum possible for n=5?

In a 5x5 grid, the maximum Manhattan distance is |1-5| + |1-5| = 8.

So, distances can range from 0 to 8.

With five cells, can we achieve all distances from 0 to 8?

In this selection, they have distances from 0 to 8, which is nine unique distances.

Is that possible?

Wait, with n=5 cells, the number of unique distances can be up to C(5,2) + 5 = 10, but some distances might coincide.

But in this selection, they have nine unique distances.

Is that the maximum possible?

I'm not sure, but it seems high.

For n=6:

Program's selection: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1) to (6,6): 5 + 5 = 10

- (1,2) to (3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2) to (5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2) to (6,6): 5 + 4 = 9

- (3,3) to (4,4): 1 + 1 = 2

- (3,3) to (5,5): 2 + 2 = 4

- (3,3) to (6,6): 3 + 3 = 6

- (4,4) to (5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- (4,4) to (6,6): 2 + 2 = 4

- (5,5) to (6,6): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus, each to itself: 0

Unique distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

That's eleven unique distances.

For n=6, the maximum Manhattan distance is |1-6| + |1-6| = 10.

So, distances can range from 0 to 10.

With six cells, is it possible to achieve all distances from 0 to 10?

In this selection, they have distances from 0 to 10, which is eleven unique distances.

Is that the maximum possible?

Again, with n=6 cells, the number of unique distances can be up to C(6,2) + 6 = 15, but some distances might coincide.

So, achieving eleven unique distances seems good.

Therefore, the program's selection seems to be achieving a high number of unique distances for each n.

Comparing to the example outputs, while the selections differ, the number of unique distances seems to be comparable or even higher in some cases.

Therefore, it's likely that the program's approach is correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Manhattan Distance**: The Manhattan distance between two cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

2. **Selection Strategy**:
   - For the first two cells, we select `(1,1)` and `(1,2)`. This ensures a distance of 1 and covers the minimum distance.
   - For the remaining cells, we select cells along the diagonal, i.e., `(i,i)` for `i` from 3 to `n`. This helps in achieving a variety of distances.

3. **Maximizing Distances**:
   - By choosing cells in this manner, we maximize the variety of distances because the diagonal cells contribute distances that are sums of differences in rows and columns, covering a wide range of possible values.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case:
    - Read the integer `n`.
    - Print the coordinates of the first cell: `(1,1)`.
    - Print the coordinates of the second cell: `(1,2)`.
    - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, print the coordinates of the cell: `(i,i)`.

- **Why This Works**:
  - The selection of `(1,1)` and `(1,2)` ensures that we start with distances 0 and 1.
  - Adding diagonal cells `(i,i)` for `i` from 3 to `n` introduces a variety of distances because the differences in row and column indices create distinct sums, thereby maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for the given constraints.
