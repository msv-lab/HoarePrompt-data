Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance is. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is simply the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So, for any two cells I choose, I can calculate this distance, and I need to make sure that as many of these distances as possible are unique.

The problem gives some examples for n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6, showing specific arrangements of cells that achieve a certain number of distinct distances. Looking at these examples, it seems like there's a pattern or strategy being used to select the cells.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it aligns with a good strategy for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads n and prints out coordinates for n cells. Specifically, it always prints (1,1), (1,2), and then for each subsequent cell (for i from 3 to n), it prints (i, i).

So, for n=2, it outputs (1,1) and (1,2). For n=3, it outputs (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). For n=4, it's (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), and (4,4), and so on.

I need to verify if this approach indeed maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let me try to compute the Manhattan distances for n=2:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |2-1| = 0 + 1 = 1

So, the set H = {1}, which has size 1. But in the example, they have H = {0,1}, which has size 2. Wait, why is there a 0 in their example? Oh, because in their first testcase for n=2, they have (1,1) and (1,2), which gives distances 0 (self-distance) and 1. But in the program, it only outputs two points, so the self-distances are included implicitly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "between any pair of cells," which includes the distance from a cell to itself, which is always 0. So, for n=2, the set H will always include 0 and at least one other distance.

In the program's output for n=2, H = {0,1}, which matches the example.

Now, for n=3:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): |1-1| + |2-1| = 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,2) to (3,3): |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

So, H = {0,1,3,4}. But in the example for n=3, they have H = {0,1,2,3}. So, their arrangement achieves a larger set with 2 included, whereas this program's output has H = {0,1,3,4}, which also has 4 elements. Is 4 the maximum possible for n=3? Maybe yes, but their example has {0,1,2,3}, which is different but also has 4 elements.

For n=4:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,2) to (3,3): 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 5

- (3,3) to (4,4): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which has 7 elements.

In the example for n=4, they have a different arrangement: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4). Let's compute their H:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (4,3): 5

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,3) to (4,3): 3

- (1,3) to (4,4): 4

- (4,3) to (4,4): 1

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, also 7 elements.

So, both arrangements achieve the same number of distinct distances.

For n=5:

Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Computing distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 8

- (1,2) to (3,3): 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 5

- (1,2) to (5,5): 7

- (3,3) to (4,4): 2

- (3,3) to (5,5): 4

- (4,4) to (5,5): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, which has 8 elements.

In the example for n=5, their arrangement is (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5). Let's compute their H:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (1,4): 3

- (1,1) to (2,1): 1

- (1,1) to (5,5): 8

- (1,3) to (1,4): 1

- (1,3) to (2,1): 3

- (1,3) to (5,5): 6

- (1,4) to (2,1): 4

- (1,4) to (5,5): 5

- (2,1) to (5,5): 7

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, which has 9 elements.

Therefore, for n=5, the program's output achieves 8 distinct distances, while the example achieves 9.

This suggests that the program's approach may not always achieve the maximum possible number of distinct distances.

Similarly, for n=6:

Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Computing distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 8

- (1,1) to (6,6): 10

- (1,2) to (3,3): 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 5

- (1,2) to (5,5): 7

- (1,2) to (6,6): 9

- (3,3) to (4,4): 2

- (3,3) to (5,5): 4

- (3,3) to (6,6): 6

- (4,4) to (5,5): 2

- (4,4) to (6,6): 4

- (5,5) to (6,6): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which has 11 elements.

In the example for n=6, their arrangement is (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). Let's compute their H:

- (1,4) to (1,5): 1

- (1,4) to (1,6): 2

- (1,4) to (5,2): 5

- (1,4) to (5,5): 5

- (1,4) to (6,1): 6

- (1,5) to (1,6): 1

- (1,5) to (5,2): 4

- (1,5) to (5,5): 4

- (1,5) to (6,1): 5

- (1,6) to (5,2): 3

- (1,6) to (5,5): 3

- (1,6) to (6,1): 4

- (5,2) to (5,5): 3

- (5,2) to (6,1): 2

- (5,5) to (6,1): 5

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which has 7 elements.

Comparing this to the program's output for n=6, which achieves 11 distinct distances, it seems that the program's approach is better than the example's arrangement.

Wait, but earlier for n=5, the program achieved 8, while the example achieved 9. So, it's inconsistent.

I need to find a general pattern or strategy that maximizes the number of distinct distances for any n.

Looking at the program, it always places the first two points at (1,1) and (1,2), and then for each subsequent point, it places it at (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

This seems to be a diagonal placement, starting from (3,3) up to (n,n), with the first two points fixed at (1,1) and (1,2).

I need to see if this strategy maximizes the number of distinct distances.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to place the points to get more distinct distances.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances.

The Manhattan distance can range from 0 up to 2(n-1), since the maximum possible |x1 - x2| is n-1 and similarly for |y1 - y2|, so their sum can be up to 2(n-1).

However, not all values between 0 and 2(n-1) may be achievable, depending on the placement of the points.

In the program's approach, for n=3, the distances are {0,1,3,4}, which are 0,1,3,4, missing 2. In the example, they achieved {0,1,2,3}, which includes 2.

So, their arrangement includes distance 2, which the program's doesn't.

For n=4, both achieve distances up to 6, which seems sufficient.

For n=5, the program achieves up to 8, but the example achieves up to 8 as well, but with different distances.

Wait, in n=5, the program achieves H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, missing 6, while the example achieves H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, including 6.

So, the example achieves more distinct distances.

Similarly, for n=6, the program achieves up to 10, while the example achieves up to 6.

Wait, but in n=6, the program achieves H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which is more than the example's H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

So, perhaps the program's approach is better for larger n, but not necessarily for smaller n.

I need to find a general rule that works for all n.

Looking at the pattern, the program places points along the diagonal starting from (3,3), which seems to increase the distances gradually.

However, in some cases, like n=5, it misses some intermediate distances.

Maybe there's a way to arrange the points to cover more distances.

Alternatively, perhaps placing points in a way that minimizes overlapping distances would be better.

Wait, actually, I need to maximize the number of distinct distances, not necessarily cover all possible distances.

So, even if some distances are skipped, as long as the number of unique distances is maximized, it's acceptable.

In that case, the program's approach seems reasonable, but the example for n=5 suggests that there might be a better arrangement.

Let me try to think of a better strategy.

One idea is to place the points in such a way that the differences in x and y coordinates are varied as much as possible.

For example, placing points along a diagonal might not cover all possible sums of differences.

Alternatively, placing points in a way that x and y coordinates have different differences.

Wait, perhaps placing points where x coordinates are increasing and y coordinates are either increasing or decreasing in a certain pattern.

Looking back at the examples, for n=3, their arrangement is (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).

Let's compute the distances:

- (2,1) to (2,3): 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): 3

So, H = {0,1,2,3}, which matches their example.

In the program's output for n=3, H = {0,1,3,4}, which also has 4 elements.

So, both achieve the same number of distinct distances, but with different distances included.

For n=4, both achieve 7 distinct distances.

For n=5, the example achieves 9, while the program achieves 8.

For n=6, the program achieves 11, while the example achieves 7.

So, overall, the program's approach seems better for larger n, but maybe not optimal for all n.

I need to see if there's a general formula or strategy that can be applied for any n to maximize the number of distinct distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the program's approach is acceptable, even if it's not always achieving the maximum possible.

But the problem says "Your task is to maximize the size of H", so we need to ensure that we're achieving the maximum possible number of distinct distances.

Given that for n=5, the example achieves 9, while the program achieves 8, which is less than 9, it seems that the program's approach is not always optimal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for some test cases, specifically when n=5.

Hence, the answer is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between chosen cells in an n x n grid. The provided program attempts to do this by selecting specific cells based on a certain pattern. However, upon analysis, we find that this approach does not always yield the maximum number of distinct distances for all values of n.

### Approach in the Program
The program selects cells as follows:
- Always includes cells (1,1) and (1,2).
- For each subsequent cell, from i=3 to n, includes cell (i,i).

This method works well for some values of n but fails to achieve the maximum number of distinct distances for others, such as n=5.

### Analysis
For n=5:
- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)
- Distances obtained: {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}
- Missing distance: 6

Example's output: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)
- Distances obtained: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
- Includes all distances from 0 to 8

The example achieves one more distinct distance (6) compared to the program's output.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not always maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all n, it is incorrect for some test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

### Final Solution Code
To solve this problem correctly, a more generalized approach is needed that ensures the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for any given n. This may involve a different selection strategy for the cells in the grid.

```python
def maximize_distinct_distances():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        # Implement a correct strategy here
        # For example, placing points in a way that minimizes distance overlaps
        # This is a placeholder for the correct approach
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            print(i, i)
```

In the correct solution, a different strategy should be employed to select the cells such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized for any n. This may involve placing points in a manner that their coordinate differences cover a wide range of possible sums.
