Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch. The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. Let's break it down.

For the first installation, it launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from the launch time up to m minutes after the launch time, inclusive. So, a firework launched at time x is visible from time x to x + m.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

Let me consider the visibility periods for each firework.

For the first installation, the visibility periods are:

- From a to a + m

- From 2a to 2a + m

- From 3a to 3a + m

- And so on.

Similarly, for the second installation:

- From b to b + m

- From 2b to 2b + m

- From 3b to 3b + m

- And so on.

Now, to find the maximum number of overlapping visibility periods, I need to find a time where the most of these intervals overlap.

I recall that in similar problems, like finding the maximum number of overlapping events, a sweep line algorithm is often used. However, since the input values can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(1) per test case.

Let me think differently. Maybe there's a mathematical way to calculate this without iterating through all possible times.

First, consider that fireworks from the first installation are launched periodically every 'a' minutes, and each is visible for 'm' minutes.

Similarly, for the second installation, every 'b' minutes, visible for 'm' minutes.

I need to find a time when the most of these visibility periods overlap.

Let me consider the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at a given time.

For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of integers k such that k*a <= t < k*a + m.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's the number of integers l such that l*b <= t < l*b + m.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of how many fireworks are launched within a certain time frame.

Let me consider the time line and see how the visibility periods overlap.

Suppose I pick a time t. The number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of launch times from both installations that satisfy launch_time <= t < launch_time + m.

So, for installation 1: number of k such that k*a <= t < k*a + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

But since a and b might be different, and m can be large, this seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for the time when the most visibility periods overlap.

I recall that in scheduling problems, the maximum number of overlapping intervals can be found by sorting the start and end times and keeping a count as we sweep through the time line.

But again, with large time values, I need a smarter approach.

Let's consider the possible overlaps.

First, consider that fireworks from the same installation don't overlap if m < a or m < b, but that's not necessarily the case here.

Wait, actually, if m < a, then no two fireworks from the first installation can overlap, since the launch intervals are a minutes apart, and m is the visibility duration.

Similarly for the second installation.

But in this problem, m can be larger than a or b.

So, if m >= a, then consecutive fireworks from the first installation can overlap.

Similarly, if m >= b, overlaps can occur in the second installation.

But the problem is to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time, from both installations.

I need to consider overlaps within each installation and between the two installations.

Let me consider the extreme case where m is very large compared to a and b.

In that case, many fireworks from each installation can be visible at the same time.

But I need a general formula.

Perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks for each installation separately and then sum them up, but that might not be accurate because there could be interference between the two installations' launch schedules.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a time t where the number of overlapping visibility periods from both installations is maximized.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a time t.

How many fireworks from installation 1 are visible at time t?

It's the floor division of t by a, let's say k = floor(t / a)

But actually, k should satisfy k*a <= t < k*a + m

Similarly for installation 2.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM would give me the interval at which the launch times of both installations align.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of fireworks visible from each installation within a certain time window, specifically within one LCM period.

But again, with a and b up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider that the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at time t is floor((t + m) / a) - floor(t / a)

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see: floor((t + m) / a) gives the number of launches up to t + m, and floor(t / a) gives the number up to t.

But actually, the number of fireworks still visible at time t is floor((t + m) / a) - ceil(t / a)

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

The number of fireworks from installation 1 that have been launched before or at t and have not yet disappeared at t + m.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a better approach.

I found that in similar problems, the maximum number of overlapping intervals can be found by considering the density of the intervals.

In this case, the density would be the number of intervals per unit time.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a rate problem.

The rate of fireworks launched by installation 1 is 1 every a minutes, and each stays for m minutes.

Similarly for installation 2.

The number of fireworks visible at any time would be the integral of the rates times the visibility.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me consider small examples to see a pattern.

Take the first test case:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, fireworks from installation 1 are visible from:

Launch at 6: visible from 6 to 10

Launch at 12: visible from 12 to 16

Launch at 18: visible from 18 to 22

And so on.

Similarly, installation 2:

Launch at 7: visible from 7 to 11

Launch at 14: visible from 14 to 18

Launch at 21: visible from 21 to 25

And so on.

Now, looking for a time when the most fireworks are visible.

Looking at time t = 14:

From installation 1: the firework launched at 12 is visible from 12 to 16

From installation 2: the firework launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 18

So, at t=14, two fireworks are visible.

Similarly, at t=18:

From installation 1: firework launched at 18 (18 to 22)

From installation 2: firework launched at 14 (14 to 18) and at 21 (21 to 25)

But at t=18, the firework from installation 2 launched at 14 is no longer visible, as 18 is equal to 14 + 4.

Wait, the problem says "visible from x to x + m, inclusive".

So, at t=18, the firework from installation 2 launched at 14 is visible up to t=18 inclusive.

So, at t=18, both fireworks from installation 1 and installation 2 are visible.

Wait, but according to the sample input, the maximum is 2.

But in this case, at t=18, two fireworks are visible.

But according to the note, in the third test case, 17 fireworks are visible after 112 minutes.

So, perhaps my approach is too simplistic.

Let me look at the third test case:

a=7, b=8, m=56

They say that at t=112, there are 17 fireworks visible.

Let's check:

For installation 1 (a=7):

Fireworks launched at 7,14,21,...,112

Number of fireworks launched before or at t=112: floor(112 / 7) = 16

Each is visible from t=k*7 to t=k*7 + 56

So, for k=16, launched at 112, visible from 112 to 112+56=168

Similarly, k=15: launched at 105, visible from 105 to 161

And so on, back to k=1: launched at 7, visible from 7 to 63

But at t=112, fireworks launched from k=16 (112 to 168)

k=15: 105 to 161

k=14: 98 to 154

k=13: 91 to 147

k=12: 84 to 140

k=11: 77 to 133

k=10: 70 to 126

k=9: 63 to 119

k=8: 56 to 112

k=7: 49 to 105

k=6: 42 to 98

k=5: 35 to 91

k=4: 28 to 84

k=3: 21 to 77

k=2: 14 to 70

k=1: 7 to 63

At t=112, which of these are visible?

Fireworks launched at:

112: visible from 112 to 168

105: 105 to 161

98: 98 to 154

91: 91 to 147

84: 84 to 140

77: 77 to 133

70: 70 to 126

63: 63 to 119

56: 56 to 112

49: 49 to 105

42: 42 to 98

35: 35 to 91

28: 28 to 84

21: 21 to 77

14: 14 to 70

7: 7 to 63

At t=112, the fireworks launched at 56 are just ending (112 == 56 + 56), so they are still visible.

Similarly, the ones launched at 112 are just starting.

So, from k=1 to k=16, all 16 fireworks are visible at t=112.

But according to the note, it's 17 fireworks.

Wait, maybe I'm missing one.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, for a=7, up to t=112, k=16, so 16 fireworks.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider overlapping from both installations.

Wait, in the note, it says:

- 9 fireworks from the first installation: 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112

- 8 from the second installation: 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112

So, total of 9 + 8 = 17 fireworks at t=112.

But wait, are they counting overlapping fireworks twice?

No, because they are counting distinct fireworks.

Wait, but the problem says "the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time."

So, if multiple fireworks are visible, even if they are from different installations, they are counted separately.

So, in this case, 17 is the maximum.

But according to my earlier calculation, for installation 1, there are 16 fireworks visible at t=112, but according to the note, it's 9.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the note, for installation 1, they list fireworks launched at 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112.

That's 9 fireworks.

Wait, but 7*16=112, so k=16: 112

k=15: 105

k=14: 98

k=13: 91

k=12: 84

k=11: 77

k=10: 70

k=9: 63

k=8: 56

That's 9 fireworks from installation 1.

Similarly, installation 2: launched at 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112, which is 8 fireworks.

Total 9 + 8 = 17.

Okay, I see my mistake earlier; I miscounted the number of fireworks from installation 1.

So, at t=112, installation 1 has fireworks launched at multiples of 7 up to 112, which is k=16, but since m=56, the earliest visible firework is at t=112 - 56 = 56, so from k=8 (56) to k=16 (112), which is 9 fireworks.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the total is 9 + 8 = 17.

Got it.

Now, I need a general formula to calculate this.

Let me try to generalize this.

For installation 1, the number of visible fireworks at time t is the number of launch times k*a such that t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly for installation 2.

Wait, no.

Actually, a firework launched at time k*a is visible from k*a to k*a + m.

So, at time t, a firework launched at k*a is visible if k*a <= t < k*a + m + 1 (since inclusive).

Wait, the problem says "visible from x to x + m, inclusive", so the condition is k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

So, for installation 1, the number of k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, for installation 1, the number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

To find the maximum t where the sum of these k's is maximized.

But m can be up to 1e18, and a and b can be up to 1e18, and t can be up to 1e4.

But t is the number of test cases, not the time.

Wait, no, in the input, t is the number of test cases, and each test case has a, b, m.

So, I need to process t test cases, each with a, b, m.

I need an efficient way to compute the maximum number of visible fireworks for each test case.

Let me think about how to compute the number of visible fireworks from each installation at time t.

For installation 1:

Number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Which is equivalent to t - m <= k*a <= t.

So, k >= ceil((t - m)/a) and k <= floor(t / a)

But k must be a positive integer, so k >=1.

Similarly for installation 2.

But I need to maximize the sum over both installations.

This seems tricky.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the maximum number of visible fireworks occurs when the visibility periods of both installations overlap as much as possible.

So, I need to find a time t where the number of overlapping visibility periods is maximized.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of overlapping visibility periods by considering the launch times and their visibility durations.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here.

Calculate the number of fireworks visible from installation 1 and from installation 2, and then consider their overlaps.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) + 1

Wait, no.

Actually, the number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m is floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) + 1

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks is sum of these for both installations.

But I need to maximize this over t.

But maximizing over t is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible sum by considering the densities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is the sum of the maximum number of overlapping fireworks from each installation.

But I need to consider if there are times when both installations have many fireworks visible simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b to find when both installations launch fireworks at the same time.

But with a and b up to 1e18, calculating LCM directly might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b to find the alignment of their launch schedules.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if a and b are co-prime, their launch times align every a*b minutes.

But again, with large a and b, this might not help directly.

Let me think about the formula for the maximum number of visible fireworks.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

6

6 7 4

3 4 10

7 8 56

5 6 78123459896

1 1 1

1 1 1000000000000000000

Sample Output:

2

7

17

28645268630

4

2000000000000000002

Looking at the first test case:

a=6, b=7, m=4

Output: 2

As I saw earlier, at t=14, two fireworks are visible.

Similarly, in the second test case:

a=3, b=4, m=10

Let's see:

Installation 1 launches at 3,6,9,12,...

Each visible from t=3 to t=13, t=6 to t=16, etc.

Installation 2 launches at 4,8,12,16,...

Each visible from t=4 to t=14, t=8 to t=18, etc.

At t=12:

From installation 1: firework launched at t=6 (6 to 16), and at t=9 (9 to 19), and at t=12 (12 to 22)

From installation 2: firework launched at t=8 (8 to 18), and at t=12 (12 to 22)

So, at t=12, there are 3 from installation 1 and 2 from installation 2, totaling 5 fireworks.

But according to the sample output, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, m=10, so each firework is visible for 11 minutes (since m+1=11).

Wait, the problem says "visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch", so from t to t + m inclusive, which is m+1 minutes.

So, for a=3, b=4, m=10, each firework is visible for 11 minutes.

At t=12:

From installation 1:

- Launched at t=0: visible from 0 to 10 (not visible at t=12)

- t=3: 3 to 13 (visible at t=12)

- t=6: 6 to 16 (visible at t=12)

- t=9: 9 to 19 (visible at t=12)

- t=12: 12 to 22 (visible at t=12)

So, 4 fireworks from installation 1.

From installation 2:

- t=0: 0 to 10 (not visible at t=12)

- t=4: 4 to 14 (visible at t=12)

- t=8: 8 to 18 (visible at t=12)

- t=12: 12 to 22 (visible at t=12)

So, 3 fireworks from installation 2.

Total: 4 + 3 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Okay, so at t=12, 7 fireworks are visible.

So, the formula seems to be adding the number of visible fireworks from each installation.

But is this always the case?

In the first test case, a=6, b=7, m=4, output=2.

At t=7:

Installation 1: t=6 (6 to 10), t=12 (12 to 16, not visible at t=7)

Installation 2: t=7 (7 to 11)

So, two fireworks visible at t=7.

Similarly, at t=14:

Installation 1: t=12 (12 to 16)

Installation 2: t=14 (14 to 18)

So, again two fireworks.

Hence, the maximum is 2.

So, in this case, summing the number of visible fireworks from each installation gives the correct maximum.

But in the second test case, it's 7.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

max over t of (number of visible fireworks from installation 1 + number of visible fireworks from installation 2)

And in practice, this maximum is achieved when t is such that both installations have their maximum visible fireworks.

But calculating this for large a, b, m is tricky.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the number of visible fireworks from each installation.

For installation 1:

Number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Which is floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) + 1

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) + 1 + floor((t + m)/b) - ceil(t / b) + 1

Simplify:

floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) + floor((t + m)/b) - ceil(t / b) + 2

Now, I need to maximize this expression over t.

But floor and ceil functions make this complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a t where both floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) is maximized and similarly for b.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that floor((t + m)/a) - ceil(t / a) is equal to floor(m / a)

Wait, is that true?

Let me check for a=6, m=4, t=7:

floor((7 + 4)/6) - ceil(7 / 6) = floor(11/6=1.833) - ceil(1.166) = 1 - 2 = -1

But according to earlier, at t=7, installation 1 has one firework visible (launched at t=6).

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Let me find a better way to express the number of visible fireworks from installation 1.

The number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Which is the number of k where k <= floor(t / a) and k >= ceil((t - m)/a)

So, the number is floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1

Similarly for installation 2.

Therefore, total visible fireworks at time t is:

[ floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 ] + [ floor(t / b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1 ]

Simplify:

floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + floor(t / b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 2

Now, I need to maximize this expression over t.

But again, it's not clear how to maximize this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for t >= m, the expression floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) is equal to floor(m / a) + 1

Wait, let's see.

For t >= m, floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a)

Let's see for t >= m.

Consider t = k*a + r, where 0 <= r < a.

Then floor(t / a) = k + floor(r / a) = k + 0 = k

ceil((t - m)/a) = ceil((k*a + r - m)/a) = ceil(k + r/a - m/a)

If r/a - m/a >= -1, then ceil(k + r/a - m/a) = k + ceil(r/a - m/a)

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me consider that for large t, the expression floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) stabilizes to floor(m / a) + 1

Similarly for b.

So, for t >= m, the total visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

And for t < m, it might be less.

Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But in the first test case, a=6, b=7, m=4

floor(4 / 6) = 0

floor(4 / 7) = 0

So, total would be 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a=3, b=4, m=10

floor(10 / 3) = 3

floor(10 / 4) = 2

So, 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, a=7, b=8, m=56

floor(56 / 7) = 8

floor(56 / 8) = 7

So, 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the note.

Similarly, for a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

floor(78123459896 / 5) = 15624691979

floor(78123459896 / 6) = 13020576649

Sum: 15624691979 + 13020576649 = 28645268628

Plus 2: 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

For a=1, b=1, m=1

floor(1 / 1) = 1

floor(1 / 1) = 1

Sum: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, matches the sample output.

Similarly, for a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000

Sum: 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time given the launch frequencies of two installations and the visibility duration of each firework.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Visibility**:
    - Each firework launched by the first installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, occurring every `a` minutes.
    - Similarly, the second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes, each visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - For large values of `t`, the number of visible fireworks from each installation stabilizes to `floor(m / a) + 1` for the first installation and `floor(m / b) + 1` for the second installation.
    - Hence, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2`.

3. **Efficiency**:
    - This approach ensures an efficient solution with O(1) complexity per test case, suitable for large input values.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index+1])
        m = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**:
    - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
    - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read `a`, `b`, and `m`.

- **Calculation**:
    - Use integer division to compute `floor(m / a)` and `floor(m / b)`.
    - Add 2 to account for the current fireworks from both installations.

- **Output**:
    - Print the result for each test case directly.

This approach ensures that we handle large inputs efficiently and compute the result quickly for each test case.
