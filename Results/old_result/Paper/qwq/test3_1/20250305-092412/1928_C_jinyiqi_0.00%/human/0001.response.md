Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this physical education lesson where students line up and are assigned positions based on a certain pattern involving a number k, where k > 1. The pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. The first k positions have numbers 1 to k, and the next k-2 positions have numbers k-1 down to 2. Then this repeats.

For example, if k=3, the sequence would be: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,...

Given that Vasya is in position n and has number x, I need to find how many natural numbers k > 1 satisfy this condition.

First, I need to understand the pattern properly.

Let's consider k=3:

Positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, 10:2, etc.

So, every 4 positions (2k-2=4), the pattern repeats.

Similarly, for k=2: 1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2,...

Pattern repeats every 2 positions.

For k=4: 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:3, 6:2, 7:1, 8:2, 9:3, 10:4, 11:3, 12:2,...

Repeats every 6 positions (2k-2=6).

So, the period is 2k - 2.

Given n and x, I need to find all k >1 such that in position n, the number is x.

Constraints: 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and t <=100 test cases.

First, I need to find a way to model this mathematically.

Let’s think about the pattern in one period:

For k:

Positions 1 to k: 1,2,3,...,k

Positions k+1 to 2k-2: k-1, k-2, ..., 2

So, in general, for any position p, we can find its value based on its position within the period.

Let’s define the period length as p = 2k - 2.

For any position n, its position within the period is r = n mod p.

If r ==0, it's at the end of the period, r=p.

Then, if r <=k, value is r.

Else, value is 2k - r.

So, for position n, value x should satisfy:

If r <=k, x =r

Else, x=2k -r

Wait, let's verify this.

Take k=3, p=4.

n=1, r=1<=3, x=1

n=2, r=2<=3, x=2

n=3, r=3<=3, x=3

n=4, r=4>3, x=2*3-4=2

n=5, r=1<=3, x=1

n=6, r=2<=3, x=2

n=7, r=3<=3, x=3

n=8, r=4>3, x=2

So, this seems correct.

Similarly, for k=2, p=2.

n=1, r=1<=2, x=1

n=2, r=2<=2, x=2

n=3, r=1<=2, x=1

n=4, r=0 (r=p=2), x=2

n=5, r=1<=2, x=1

n=6, r=0, x=2

And so on.

So, general formula:

p =2k -2

r = n mod p

if r ==0, r=p

if r <=k, x=r

else, x=2k -r

Now, given n and x, I need to find all k>1 such that this condition holds.

Let’s express this mathematically.

Given n, x, find k >1 such that:

If r <=k, x=r

Else, x=2k -r

Where r = n mod p, p=2k-2

First, since p=2k-2, k=(p+2)/2

But it's easier to keep it in terms of k.

Let’s consider two cases:

Case 1: r <=k => x=r

Case 2: r >k => x=2k -r

So, for each case, we can express it in terms of k.

But r = n mod p, where p=2k-2

Need to consider that n can be very large, up to 1e9, and t=100 test cases.

So, need an efficient way to compute this.

Let’s consider both cases.

Case 1: r <=k => x=r

Which means r=x

So, n mod p =x

Where p=2k -2

So, n ≡x mod p

But p=2k -2

So, n -x is divisible by p

Thus, p divides (n -x)

Similarly, since p=2k -2, we can write:

2k -2 divides n -x

So, 2k -2 | n -x

Similarly, since k >1, p >=2*2 -2=2, so p >=2

So, 2k -2 is a positive integer >=2

Now, 2k -2 divides n -x

Assuming n -x >=0, since n >x (given 1<=x <n)

So, n -x >=1

So, we need to find all k such that 2k -2 divides n -x

Let’s denote d=2k -2

Then, d divides n -x

Also, d=2k -2 => k=(d +2)/2

Since k must be integer >1, d must be even, because d=2k -2, and k integer.

So, d must be even.

Also, k=(d +2)/2 >1 => d +2 >2 => d >0, which is already true since d>=2.

So, for each divisor d of n -x that is >=2 and even, we can compute k=(d +2)/2

Now, let’s consider the other case.

Case 2: r >k => x=2k -r

But r =n mod p, p=2k -2

So, r >k and x=2k -r

So, r =2k -x

But r =n mod p

So, n mod p =2k -x

But p=2k -2

So, n ≡2k -x mod p

But p=2k -2, so 2k ≡p +2 mod p

So, n ≡p +2 -x mod p

Which simplifies to n ≡2 -x mod p

But p divides (n - (2 -x)), assuming 2 -x is adjusted properly.

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let’s recall that in this case, r >k, and r =n mod p

Given that p=2k -2, and r >k, we have k < r <=p

But p=2k -2, so k < r <=2k -2

Given that r =n mod p, which is between 1 and p

So, k < r <=2k -2

And x=2k -r

So, r=2k -x

But r <=2k -2, so 2k -x <=2k -2 => -x <=-2 => x >=2

Also, r >k, so 2k -x >k => k >x => k >x

Wait, but k >x is not possible because in the first case, r <=k, x=r <=k

In the second case, r >k, x=2k -r

But x >=1, and r >k, but r=2k -x, so 2k -x >k => k >x

But x >=1, so k >x >=1

But in the problem, x can be up to n-1, and n can be up to 1e9, so k can be up to n.

Wait, but in this case, k >x, and x is given.

So, for this case to hold, k >x

Whereas in the first case, r <=k, which corresponds to r=x <=k

So, in the first case, k >=x

In the second case, k >x

But in reality, in the second case, r >k, and r=2k -x, so 2k -x >k => k >x

So, the two cases are mutually exclusive: in one k >=x, in the other k >x

Wait, in the first case, r <=k, which is x <=k

In the second case, r >k, which is x <k (since x=2k -r, and r >k)

Wait, x=2k -r, and r >k, so x <k

So, in the first case, x <=k

In the second case, x <k

But in the first case, r <=k, which is x <=k

In the second case, r >k, which is x <k

So, combined, for all k >1, either x <=k or x <k, covering all k >1

But I need to make sure there's no overlap.

Wait, actually, in the first case, r <=k, which is x <=k

In the second case, r >k, which is x <k

But since r can't be both <=k and >k at the same time, these are disjoint cases.

Hence, for each k >1, either k >=x or k >x, but not both.

Wait, but k >x implies k >=x +1

So, the first case is k >=x, second case is k >x

But in practice, for each k >1, only one of the cases applies.

So, to find all k >1 that satisfy either of the cases.

Now, in the first case, 2k -2 divides n -x

In the second case, perhaps something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider both cases separately.

First case: r <=k => x=r => r=x

So, r =x

But r =n mod p, p=2k -2

So, n ≡x mod p

Hence, p divides n -x

So, 2k -2 divides n -x

Hence, for k >1 integer, k=(d +2)/2, where d divides n -x, and d >=2, even.

Similarly, in the second case, r >k => x=2k -r

And r =n mod p

So, n mod p =2k -x

But p=2k -2

So, n ≡2k -x mod p

But p=2k -2, so 2k ≡p +2 mod p

Hence, n ≡p +2 -x mod p

Which simplifies to n ≡2 -x mod p

So, p divides n - (2 -x)

Hence, 2k -2 divides n - (2 -x)

But n - (2 -x) =n -2 +x

So, 2k -2 divides n +x -2

Hence, in the second case, 2k -2 divides n +x -2

Similarly, in the first case, 2k -2 divides n -x

So, for each case, we have a different divisibility condition.

Hence, for k >1, integer k, we have:

Either 2k -2 divides n -x

Or 2k -2 divides n +x -2

And in both cases, k must be integer >1, and in the second case, k >x

Wait, in the second case, k >x, as established earlier.

But in the first case, k >=x

But since k must be integer, we can consider k >=x in the first case, and k >x in the second case.

But to avoid double-counting, we need to ensure that there's no overlap between the two cases.

Wait, but in the first case, k >=x, and in the second case, k >x

So, for k=x+1, it could be in both cases?

Wait, no, because in the first case, k >=x, and in the second case, k >x

But for k=x+1, it's only in the second case.

For k=x, it's only in the first case.

So, no overlap.

Hence, the total number of k is the number of k from the first case plus the number of k from the second case.

Now, to find the number of k for each case:

First case: 2k -2 divides n -x

Let d=2k -2, where d divides n -x, d >=2, even.

Then, k=(d +2)/2

So, for each even divisor d of n -x, where d >=2, k=(d +2)/2

Similarly, in the second case: 2k -2 divides n +x -2

Let d=2k -2, where d divides n +x -2, d >=2, even.

Then, k=(d +2)/2

So, similarly, for each even divisor d of n +x -2, where d >=2, k=(d +2)/2

But in the second case, we also have k >x

So, need to ensure that k >x

Hence, for the first case, k >=x

For the second case, k >x

To avoid overlap, we need to make sure that in the first case, k >=x, and in the second case, k >x

But in reality, since k is integer, and x is integer, and k >x in the second case, it's fine.

Now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and x can be up to 1e9, and t=100 test cases, we need an efficient way to find the divisors of n -x and n +x -2.

But n and x can be up to 1e9, so n -x and n +x -2 can be up to 2e9 -2, which is manageable.

But finding divisors of a number up to 2e9 needs to be optimized.

I recall that the number of divisors of a number is usually small, especially for numbers up to 2e9.

In fact, the maximum number of divisors for numbers up to 1e12 is around 200, but for 1e9, it's even less.

So, I can write a function to find all divisors of a number efficiently.

But first, I need to handle the cases where n -x or n +x -2 is zero or negative.

Wait, n >x, so n -x >=1

n +x -2 can be negative if n <2 -x, but since n >=x +1 >=2, n +x -2 >=0

Wait, n >=x +1 >=2, so n +x -2 >=x +1 +x -2 >=2x -1 >=1

Wait, if x=1, n >=2, then n +x -2 >=1

If x=2, n >=3, n +x -2 >=3

And so on.

So, n +x -2 >=1

Hence, n +x -2 >=1

Similarly, n -x >=1

So, in both cases, the numbers are positive integers.

Hence, we can find their divisors.

Now, for each test case, I need to:

1. Compute n -x and n +x -2

2. Find all even divisors d of n -x, d >=2, and compute k=(d +2)/2, where k >=x

3. Find all even divisors d of n +x -2, d >=2, and compute k=(d +2)/2, where k >x

4. Count the total number of such k, making sure there's no overlap.

Wait, but as established earlier, there's no overlap between the two cases.

Hence, total k is the sum of k from both cases.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need an efficient way to find all even divisors of a number.

I can write a function that finds all divisors of a number up to 1e9 efficiently.

Given that, I can filter out the even divisors >=2.

Then, for each even divisor d, compute k=(d +2)/2, and check if k >=x in the first case, and k >x in the second case.

Wait, but in the first case, k=(d +2)/2 >=x, where d divides n -x and d even >=2

Similarly, in the second case, k=(d +2)/2 >x, where d divides n +x -2 and d even >=2

But since d=2k -2, and k=(d +2)/2, then for the first case, k >=x implies d >=2x -2

Wait, let's see:

k >=x => (d +2)/2 >=x => d +2 >=2x => d >=2x -2

But d=2k -2 >=2*(x) -2 >=2x -2

But k >1, and k >=x, so d=2k -2 >=2x -2

But x >=1, so 2x -2 >=0, but d >=2, so effectively d >=max(2, 2x -2)

But 2x -2 >=0 only if x >=1, which it is.

Hence, d >=2

So, in practice, since d >=2, and 2x -2 <=d, but d >=2, so if 2x -2 <=2, i.e., x <=2, then d >=2x -2 is always true for d >=2.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to not add this condition, since d >=2 already.

Wait, no, because for x >=2, 2x -2 >=2, so d >=2x -2

But d >=2, so if 2x -2 >2, i.e., x >2, then d >=2x -2

Hence, for x >=2, need d >=2x -2

But in the first case, k >=x => d >=2x -2

Similarly, in the second case, k >x => d >2x -2

But d is even and >=2

Hence, in the first case, d is even, d >=max(2, 2x -2)

In the second case, d is even, d >=2x -2 +2=2x

Wait, k >x => (d +2)/2 >x => d +2 >2x => d >2x -2

But d is even and >=2, so d >=2x -2 +1, but d must be even, so d >=ceil(2x -2 +1) =2x -1, but d must be even, so d >=2x -2 +2 - (2x -2 +2) mod 2

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that d >2x -2, and d even >=2

So, d >=max(2, 2x -2 +1)=max(2, 2x -1)

But 2x -1 is odd, so d >=ceil(2x -1)=2x -1, but d must be even, so d >=2x -2 +2=2x

Hence, in the second case, d >=2x

So, summarizing:

First case: d divides n -x, d even, d >=2, and d >=2x -2

But since d >=2, and for x >=2, 2x -2 >=2, so d >=2x -2

But for x=1, 2x -2=0, so d >=2

Hence, for first case:

- If x >=2, d >=2x -2

- If x=1, d >=2

Similarly, for second case:

d divides n +x -2, d even, d >=2x

Hence, in code, for each test case, I need to:

- Compute n -x and n +x -2

- Find all even divisors d of n -x where d >=2x -2 (if x >=2) or d >=2 (if x=1)

- Find all even divisors d of n +x -2 where d >=2x

- For each valid d in the first case, compute k=(d +2)/2

- For each valid d in the second case, compute k=(d +2)/2

- Collect all such k and count them

But need to make sure that k is integer and k >1

Wait, since d=2k -2, and d even >=2, then k=(d +2)/2 is integer >=2

Hence, no need to worry about k being integer or >1

Now, to optimize, since n and x can be up to 1e9, and t=100, need an efficient way to find divisors.

I can write a function that finds all divisors of a number up to 1e9 by iterating up to sqrt(number), and adding both divisors when found.

Then, filter even divisors >=2

Then, for the first case, filter d >=2x -2 if x >=2, else d >=2

Similarly, for the second case, filter d >=2x

Then, compute k=(d +2)/2 for each valid d, and collect unique k

Finally, count the number of unique k

Wait, but k is uniquely determined by d, and d is unique for each divisor

Hence, no duplicates, so can collect them in a list and count the length

But to make it efficient, better to collect them in a set

But in practice, since t=100 and number of divisors is small, it's manageable

Now, let's consider the sample input:

5

10 2

3 1

76 4

100 99

1000000000 500000000

Sample output:

4

1

9

0

1

Let's verify for the first test case:

n=10, x=2

First case: d divides 10 -2=8, d even >=2

Divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8

Even divisors >=2: 2,4,8

Corresponding k: (2+2)/2=2, (4+2)/2=3, (8+2)/2=5

Second case: d divides 10 +2 -2=10, d even >=4 (since 2x=4)

Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10

Even divisors >=4:2,10

But 2 <4, so only 10

k=(10+2)/2=6

Hence, total k:2,3,5,6 =>4 values

Matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=3, x=1

First case: d divides 3-1=2, d even >=2

Divisors of 2:1,2

Even d >=2:2

k=(2+2)/2=2

Second case: d divides 3+1-2=2, d even >=2

Divisors of 2:1,2

Even d >=2:2

k=(2+2)/2=2

But k must be >x=1 in the second case

But in the first case, k >=x=1, which is k >=1, but k=(d+2)/2 >=2

Hence, in the first case, k=2

In the second case, k=2

But k=2 is already included in the first case, but since k >x in the second case, and k=2 >1, it's included in both.

But earlier I thought there's no overlap, but in this case, k=2 is in both cases.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, for k=x+1=2, it's only in the second case, and for k=x=1, it's only in the first case.

But x=1, so k >=1 in the first case, and k >1 in the second case.

But k=(d+2)/2 >=2 in both cases.

Hence, k=2 is only in the second case.

But in the first case, k=(2+2)/2=2 >=1, so it's included.

But according to the earlier analysis, there's no overlap.

But in this case, k=2 is in both cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the conditions to avoid double-counting.

Hence, perhaps in the first case, k >=x and k <=some value, but I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for k >=x in the first case, and k >x in the second case, but in reality, k=(d+2)/2, and d divides n -x or n +x -2.

Hence, perhaps I need to ensure that for each k, it's only counted once.

In this sample, k=2 is counted only once, even though it appears in both cases.

Hence, need to collect all k from both cases and take unique k.

Hence, in code, collect all k from both cases in a set to avoid duplicates.

Hence, in the first test case, k=2,3,5 from the first case, and k=6 from the second case, total 4 unique k.

In the second test case, k=2 from both cases, but only count once, total 1.

In the third test case, n=76, x=4

First case: d divides 76-4=72, d even >=2*4 -2=6

Divisors of 72:1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72

Even d >=6:6,8,12,18,24,36,72

k=(6+2)/2=4, (8+2)/2=5, (12+2)/2=7, (18+2)/2=10, (24+2)/2=13, (36+2)/2=19, (72+2)/2=37

Second case: d divides 76+4-2=78, d even >=8

Divisors of 78:1,2,3,6,13,26,39,78

Even d >=8:12,26,78

k=(12+2)/2=7, (26+2)/2=14, (78+2)/2=40

Hence, total k from both cases:4,5,7,10,13,19,37,14,40

Unique k:4,5,7,10,13,14,19,37,40 =>9 values

Matches the sample output.

Fourth test case: n=100, x=99

First case: d divides 100-99=1, d even >=2*99 -2=196

But d must divide 1, but 1 is odd, and d >=196, which is impossible, since 1 <196

Hence, no k in the first case

Second case: d divides 100+99 -2=197, which is prime, divisors:1,197

Even d >=2*99=198: only 198, but 197 is odd, so no even d

Hence, no k in the second case

Total k:0

Fifth test case: n=1000000000, x=500000000

First case: d divides 1000000000 -500000000=500000000, d even >=2*500000000 -2=999999998

Find even d >=999999998 that divides 500000000

But 500000000 <999999998, so no such d

Second case: d divides 1000000000 +500000000 -2=1500000000 -2=1499999998, d even >=1000000000

Find even d >=1000000000 that divides 1499999998

But 1499999998 <2*1000000000, so only d=1499999998

Check if 1499999998 divides 1499999998, which it does.

Hence, k=(1499999998 +2)/2=750000000

Wait, (1499999998 +2)/2=750000000?

Wait, 1499999998 +2=1500000000, divided by 2 is 750000000

But k must be >x=500000000, which it is.

Hence, k=750000000 is valid.

Hence, total k:1

Matches the sample output.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this in code:

- Read t

- For each test case:

- Read n, x

- If x >=2:

- First case: d divides n -x, d even, d >=2x -2

- Else (x=1):

- First case: d divides n -x, d even, d >=2

- Second case: d divides n +x -2, d even, d >=2x

- For each valid d in both cases, compute k=(d +2)/2

- Collect unique k in a set

- Output the size of the set

Now, to implement the divisor function efficiently:

- Function to find all divisors of a number up to 1e9:

- Iterate from 1 to sqrt(number)

- For each i that divides number, add i and number/i to the list

- Need to handle perfect squares correctly, to avoid adding sqrt twice

- Then, filter even divisors >=2

- Then, for the first case, filter d >=2x -2 if x >=2, else d >=2

- For the second case, filter d >=2x

- Compute k=(d +2)/2 for each valid d

- Collect unique k in a set

- Output the size of the set

Now, considering that t=100 and n and x up to 1e9, need to make sure it's efficient.

But since finding divisors takes O(sqrt(number)) time, and number up to 1e9, sqrt(number) is up to 31623, it's manageable for t=100 test cases.

Hence, this approach should work within time limits.

Now, looking at the given code:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

output = []

if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n + x - 2)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

if (n - x) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n - x)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):

output1 = []

output2 = []

for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

output1.append(i)

output2.append(int(x / i))

output1.reverse()

return output2 + output1

So, the code defines a function func_1(x) that returns all divisors of x in ascending order.

Then, for each test case, it checks two conditions:

1. If (n + x -2) % 2 ==0:

- Calls func_1(n + x -2) to get all divisors

- For each divisor s, if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x, append k=(s +2)/2 to output

2. If (n -x) % 2 ==0:

- Calls func_1(n -x) to get all divisors

- For each divisor s, if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x, append k=(s +2)/2 to output

Finally, converts output to a set and then to a list, but doesn't print anything.

Wait, the code doesn't have any print statements, and the last line is defining func_1, which is outside the loop.

Also, there might be some logical errors.

First, the function func_1(x) returns all divisors of x in ascending order.

Then, in the code:

- For the first case, it checks if (n + x -2) %2 ==0, which seems related to the second case where d divides n +x -2

- Then, it calls func_1(n +x -2) to get all divisors d

- For each d, if (d +2) %2 ==0 (i.e., d is even) and (d +2)/2 >=x, then append k=(d +2)/2 to output

Similarly, for the second case:

- If (n -x) %2 ==0, which seems related to the first case where d divides n -x

- Calls func_1(n -x) to get all divisors d

- For each d, if (d +2) %2 ==0 and (d +2)/2 >=x, append k=(d +2)/2 to output

Then, it converts output to a set and then to a list, but doesn't print anything.

First, the conditions (n +x -2) %2 ==0 and (n -x) %2 ==0 seem misplaced.

In my earlier analysis, the conditions were about d being even, which is already handled by filtering even divisors.

Hence, perhaps the checks (n +x -2) %2 ==0 and (n -x) %2 ==0 are unnecessary.

Wait, perhaps the author is trying to check if n +x -2 or n -x is even before finding their divisors.

But d is even, so perhaps they are trying to optimize by checking if n +x -2 or n -x is even.

But this might not be necessary, as func_1 returns all divisors, and then they filter even d.

Hence, perhaps redundant.

Moreover, in the first case, d should divide n -x and be even >=2x -2 if x >=2 or >=2 if x=1

In the code, they have:

if (n +x -2) %2 ==0:

sep = func_1(n +x -2)

for s in sep:

if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x:

output.append((s +2)/2)

if (n -x) %2 ==0:

sep = func_1(n -x)

for s in sep:

if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x:

output.append((s +2)/2)

Then, output = list(set(output))

But they are not printing anything.

Also, in the first part, they are considering (n +x -2), which corresponds to the second case where d divides n +x -2 and d >=2x

In this case, k=(d +2)/2 >x

But in the code, they are appending k=(s +2)/2 if (s +2)/2 >=x, which should be >x in the second case.

Wait, no, in the second case, k >x, but in the code, they have (s +2)/2 >=x

Hence, it's incorrect.

Similarly, in the first case, they have (s +2)/2 >=x, which corresponds to k >=x

But in the second case, it should be k >x

Hence, perhaps they need to adjust the condition in the second case to (s +2)/2 >x

But in the code, both cases have (s +2)/2 >=x

Hence, this is incorrect.

Moreover, in the sample input, for n=10 and x=2, output is 4, which matches my earlier calculation.

In the code, for n=10 and x=2:

(n +x -2)=10+2-2=10, which is even, so consider d divides 10, d even, and (d +2)/2 >=2

Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10

Even d:2,10

For d=2: k=(2+2)/2=2 >=2, append 2

For d=10: k=(10+2)/2=6 >=2, append 6

Then, (n -x)=10-2=8, which is even

Divisors of 8:1,2,4,8

Even d:2,4,8

For d=2: k=2 >=2, append 2

For d=4: k=3 >=2, append 3

For d=8: k=5 >=2, append 5

Hence, output=[2,6,2,3,5], then set(output)=[2,3,5,6], which has 4 elements, matching the sample.

But according to my earlier analysis, in the second case, k >x, which is k >2, so k=6 is valid, but k=2 is not.

But in the code, they have k >=x in both cases, which incorrectly includes k=2 in both cases.

But in the sample, it's correct because k=2 is only valid in the first case, but in the code, it's included in both but then removed in the set.

Hence, perhaps it's coincidentally correct in the sample.

But in general, it might include k=x in the second case, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the second case, k must be >x, but in the code, they have k >=x

Hence, for the second case, they need to have k >x, i.e., (s +2)/2 >x

Hence, the condition should be (s +2)/2 >x in the second case.

But in the code, both cases have (s +2)/2 >=x

Hence, it's incorrect.

Moreover, in the first case, it should be d >=2x -2 if x >=2, else d >=2

But in the code, they don't have any such condition.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
