Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The deck is divided between me and Nene, so each of us gets n cards.

The game proceeds with 2n turns, alternating between me and Nene, with me starting first. In each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at its number x, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played publicly, meaning both players can see all cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and the interactions between my moves and Nene's moves.

Let's think about how the game progresses:

1. **Initial Setup:**

- Total cards: 2n

- Each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

- Me and Nene each have n cards.

2. **Game Play:**

- 2n turns in total, alternating starting with me.

- On each turn:

- Select one card from your hand.

- If a card with the same number is already on the table, you get a point.

- Place the selected card on the table.

3. **Nene's Strategy:**

- Maximizes her score first.

- If multiple options for max score, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

Given that, I need to play in a way that maximizes my score, considering how Nene will react.

Let's consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

**Example 1:**

n = 1

My cards: [1]

Nene's cards: [1]

Turns:

1. Me: Play 1 (no previous 1 on table), score 0.

2. Nene: Play 1 (there is a 1 on table), score 1.

Final scores: Me = 0, Nene = 1.

In this case, me scoring any points is impossible because Nene has the second card.

**Example 2:**

n = 2

My cards: [1,1]

Nene's cards: [2,2]

Turns:

1. Me: Play 1, score 0.

2. Nene: Play 2, score 0.

3. Me: Play 1, now there is a 1 on table, score 1.

4. Nene: Play 2, now there is a 2 on table, score 1.

Final scores: Me = 1, Nene = 1.

But according to the problem's example, in some cases, me scoring more is possible or not.

Wait, in the first test case of the example:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

Looking back at the first test case explanation, it seems that in that scenario, I can get at most 1 point.

Given that, I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum points I can get, given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Let's think about the structure of the game.

Each number appears exactly twice. So, for each number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene, or both with me, or both with Nene.

Wait, no. Since we each have n cards, and there are 2n cards in total, with each number appearing exactly twice, it means:

- For each number, either:

- I have both cards.

- Nene has both cards.

- One card is with me, and the other is with Nene.

But wait, since there are 2n cards and each number appears exactly twice, and we each have n cards, it's possible to have:

- Some numbers where I have both cards.

- Some numbers where Nene has both cards.

- Some numbers where one card is with me and the other with Nene.

But actually, since there are 2n cards and each number appears exactly twice, and we each have n cards, it's possible to have any combination where for each number, the two cards are either both with me, both with Nene, or one with each.

Wait, no. Since the total number of cards is 2n, and we each have n cards, and each number appears exactly twice, it's possible to have:

- For some numbers, I have both cards.

- For some numbers, Nene has both cards.

- For the remaining numbers, I have one and Nene has the other.

But the sum of these should be n, since I have n cards.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total cards: 2n

Each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

I have n cards, Nene has n cards.

So, for each number from 1 to n:

- Both cards could be with me.

- Both cards could be with Nene.

- One card with me and one with Nene.

But since I have n cards, and there are n numbers, each appearing twice, the distribution must satisfy that I have n cards in total.

Wait, actually, since each number appears exactly twice, and there are n numbers, total cards are 2n, which is correct.

But the distribution of cards between me and Nene can be such that:

- For some numbers, I have both cards.

- For some numbers, Nene has both cards.

- For the remaining numbers, I have one and Nene has the other.

But the total number of cards I have should be n.

Wait, but in reality, if I have both cards for k numbers, and for the remaining (n - k) numbers, I have one card each, then the total number of cards I have is 2k + (n - k) = n + k.

But I have n cards, so n + k = n ⇒ k = 0.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, that means that if I have both cards for k numbers, and one card each for the remaining (n - k) numbers, then total cards I have is 2k + (n - k) = n + k.

But I have n cards, so n + k = n ⇒ k = 0.

That implies that I have exactly one card for each number, which contradicts the problem statement that each number appears exactly twice.

Wait, no, the problem says that each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, but it doesn't say that I have exactly one card per number.

Wait, actually, it's possible for me to have both cards of a number.

Wait, let's think differently.

Total cards: 2n

Numbers: 1 to n, each appearing twice.

I have n cards, Nene has n cards.

For each number, the two cards can be distributed as:

- Both with me.

- Both with Nene.

- One with me, one with Nene.

Let’s denote:

- Let s be the set of numbers for which I have both cards.

- Let t be the set of numbers for which Nene has both cards.

- Let u be the set of numbers for which I have one card and Nene has the other.

Then, |s| + |t| + |u| = n.

Also, the total number of cards I have is 2|s| + |u| = n.

Similarly, Nene has 2|t| + |u| = n.

From 2|s| + |u| = n and 2|t| + |u| = n, subtracting these equations gives 2|s| - 2|t| = 0 ⇒ |s| = |t|.

Let’s denote k = |s| = |t|.

Then, from 2k + |u| = n ⇒ |u| = n - 2k.

So, for a given n, k can range from 0 to floor(n/2).

Given that, the distribution is determined by k and u.

But in the problem, we are given my cards, so we can determine s and u.

Specifically:

- For numbers that appear twice in my hand, they are in s.

- For numbers that appear once in my hand, they are in u.

- For numbers that don't appear in my hand, they are in t.

Wait, let's see.

Given that I have n cards, and each number appears at most twice, then:

- If a number appears twice in my hand, then I have both cards (s).

- If a number appears once in my hand, then Nene has the other card (u).

- If a number doesn't appear in my hand, then Nene has both cards (t).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, from my hand, I can determine s, u, and t.

Given that, let's denote:

- Let d be the frequency dictionary of my cards.

- Then, s = {x | d[x] == 2}

- u = {x | d[x] == 1}

- t = {x | d[x] == 0}

Then, |s| + |u| = number of unique numbers in my hand.

And |t| = n - (|s| + |u|).

But wait, in the input, it's given that each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, so d[x] is either 0, 1, or 2.

But in the problem statement, it says "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, …, a_n at most 2 times."

Wait, no, n is the number of cards each player has, but the total number of unique integers is also n, since each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.

Wait, no, the problem says: "the deck with 2n cards is used to play this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1 through n appears exactly on 2 cards."

So, deck has 2n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.

Then, me and Nene each have n cards.

So, in my hand, I have n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing at most twice.

Hence, in my hand, for each number from 1 to n:

- It can appear 0, 1, or 2 times.

- If it appears 2 times, both cards are with me (s).

- If it appears 1 time, one card is with me and one with Nene (u).

- If it appears 0 times, both cards are with Nene (t).

Given that, I can count the frequency of each number in my hand to determine s, u, and t.

Now, the game proceeds with 2n turns, alternating starting with me.

On each turn:

- The player selects one card from their hand.

- If there is already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets a point.

- The selected card is placed on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and if multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, considering Nene's optimal play.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players are playing optimally, and I need to find the optimal strategy for myself.

Let's think about the game in terms of the sets s, u, and t.

- For numbers in s (both cards with me):

- I can play both cards, and since they are both mine, the second play will get a point.

- For numbers in u (one card with me, one with Nene):

- I have one card, Nene has the other.

- Depending on the order, if I play my card before Nene plays hers, I might not get a point, or vice versa.

- For numbers in t (both cards with Nene):

- Nene can play both cards and get a point on the second play.

The key is to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let's consider that the game is played in turns, with me and Nene alternating, and we need to model the interactions between our moves.

This seems complex, so maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs and singles.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that each number can be in one of three states:

- Both cards with me (s).

- Both cards with Nene (t).

- One card with me and one with Nene (u).

Given that, I can think about the game as a series of moves where we choose which card to play.

But it's too vague.

Maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let's try to define the state of the game.

State can be defined by:

- The set of numbers for which I still have cards in my hand.

- The set of numbers for which Nene still has cards in her hand.

- The current state of the table (which numbers have cards on the table).

But that seems too broad; with n up to 2e5, it's impractical.

Alternative approach: Since the game is played in a fixed number of turns (2n), and the players alternate turns, maybe I can think in terms of the sequence of moves.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial approach.

Let me try to think about the possible points I can get.

I can get a point only when I play a card and there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Similarly for Nene.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of times I play a card that matches a number already on the table.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let's consider that Nene will play in a way that maximizes her points, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my points.

Given that, I need to anticipate her moves and choose my moves accordingly.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and perhaps can be modeled using game theory, specifically minimax.

But with n up to 2e5, a minimax approach is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following:

- For numbers in s (both cards with me): When I play the second card, I will get a point, unless Nene plays a card with the same number in between.

Wait, but since Nene doesn't have any cards of those numbers, she can't interfere with my getting a point from playing the second card of s.

Hence, for each number in s, I can guarantee myself one point by playing the second card after the first one.

- For numbers in u (one card with me, one with Nene): When I play my card, if Nene hasn't played her card yet, I won't get a point. If I play after Nene has played her card, I will get a point.

Similarly, when Nene plays her card, if I have already played my card, she won't get a point, else she will.

- For numbers in t (both cards with Nene): I can't influence these, Nene will get one point from the second card.

Given that, perhaps I can focus on the numbers in u, since those are the ones where the order of plays between me and Nene matters.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote:

- Let m = |u|, the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other.

- Let k = |s|, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

From earlier, we have that |t| = n - k - m.

For each number in s, I can get one point by playing the second card after the first one.

For each number in t, Nene can get one point by playing the second card after the first one.

For each number in u, whether I get a point or Nene gets a point depends on the order in which we play our cards.

Now, the total number of points available in the game is equal to the number of numbers where at least one card is played after another card of the same number is on the table.

But to simplify, perhaps the total points available are equal to the number of numbers that have two cards played, which is n, since each number has exactly two cards.

Wait, no. Each number has two cards, but the points are only awarded when a card is played and there's already a card with the same number on the table.

So, for each number, exactly one of the two cards will give a point.

Hence, the total points available in the game are n.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no.

Let's consider:

- For each number, the second card played will give a point.

- But which player gets the point depends on who plays the second card.

Hence, the total points awarded in the game will be equal to the number of times a player plays the second card of a number.

But since each number has exactly two cards, and one player plays the first and the other plays the second, or the same player plays both.

Hence, the total points will be equal to the number of numbers where the second card is played by either player.

But in reality, the total points will be equal to the number of times a player plays a card and there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Which is equal to the number of numbers where the second card is played.

Hence, the total points in the game are equal to the number of numbers where the second card is played, which is equal to the number of numbers that have two cards played, which is n, since each number has two cards.

Wait, but that can't be, because in the first test case, n=4, and the total points are me:1, Nene:3, sum=4, which matches n.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=8, me:2, Nene:6, sum=8.

So, indeed, the total points in the game are n.

Hence, total points = n.

Given that, and I need to maximize my points, knowing that Nene will play to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate the number of points I can get based on the distribution of s, u, and t.

From earlier:

- For each number in s, I can get one point by playing the second card after the first one.

- For each number in t, Nene will get one point by playing the second card after the first one.

- For each number in u, it depends on the order of plays.

Hence, the points I can get are:

- k points from s.

- plus some points from u.

- and possibly some points from t, but since t is entirely with Nene, and she plays optimally against me, it's unlikely.

Wait, no. For t, Nene will get points from t, but I can't influence that.

Hence, my points come only from s and u.

I need to maximize the points from u.

Now, for u, each number in u can potentially give me one point if I play my card after Nene plays her card.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Hence, for each number in u, Nene will try to play her card before I play mine, so that I don't get a point from that number.

However, since we are alternating turns, and I start first, I can try to force Nene to play certain cards at certain times.

This seems complicated.

Let’s think differently.

Let’s consider that for each number in u, there is a potential point that I can get if I play my card after Nene plays hers.

But Nene will try to play her card late to prevent me from getting that point.

However, since she plays optimally to maximize her points first, and minimize mine second, I need to consider how she will prioritize her moves.

Wait, perhaps I can model the interaction between s and u.

Let’s consider that for each number in s, I can get a point by playing the second card after the first one.

For each number in u, I can get a point if I play my card after Nene plays her card.

But Nene will try to play her card in u as early or as late as possible to prevent me from getting that point.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get from u is equal to the number of u's where I can play my card after Nene plays hers, considering that Nene is trying to minimize that.

This seems tricky.

Let’s consider that the total points I can get are k (from s) plus some value from u.

I need to find the maximum number of points from u that I can get.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, perhaps the points I can get from u is floor((m - 1)/2) or something similar.

Wait, maybe not.

Let’s consider that for each number in u, Nene can choose to play her card at any time, but she will choose the time that minimizes my points.

Hence, for each number in u, Nene can choose to play her card either before I play mine or after.

If she plays before me, then I can play mine later and get a point.

If she plays after me, then I don't get a point.

Hence, to minimize my points, Nene will choose to play her card after I play mine, so that I don't get a point.

However, she has to play her card at some point, and I have to play my card at some point.

Given that, perhaps for each u, Nene can choose to play her card either before or after me.

But since she plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will choose to play her card in a way that prevents me from getting a point from u.

Hence, for each u, Nene can choose to play her card after I play mine, so that I don't get a point.

Therefore, from u, I can get 0 points, because Nene can always play her card after I play mine.

But that seems too pessimistic.

Wait, but in reality, I can force Nene to play her card in a certain way.

Let’s think about the sequence of plays.

I start first, then Nene, then me, and so on.

I need to arrange my plays in a way that forces Nene to play her u cards at certain times, allowing me to get points from u.

This seems complex.

Perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the number of "pairs" I can create.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a formula based on the counts of s, u, and t.

Let’s try to find a pattern from the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Hence, s={1}, u={2,3}, t={4}

From s, I can get 1 point.

From u, I need to see if I can get any points.

Nene has {4,4,2,3}

If I play 1 first, then Nene can play 4, then I play 1 and get a point, then Nene plays 2, I play 3, Nene plays 3 and gets a point, then Nene plays 4 and gets another point.

Total points: me=1, Nene=3.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first, then Nene can play 4, then I play 1, Nene plays 2 and gets a point, then I play 1 and get a point, then Nene plays 3, I play 3 and get a point.

Total points: me=2, Nene=2.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's me=1, Nene=3.

Hence, perhaps the first approach is the one Nene prefers.

Wait, Nene aims to maximize her score first, then minimize mine.

Hence, in the first scenario, she gets 3 points, and I get 1.

In the second scenario, she gets 2 points, and I get 2.

Hence, she prefers the first scenario where she gets 3 points.

Hence, in playing optimally, she will choose the moves that lead to her getting 3 points and me getting 1 point.

Hence, in this case, I can get at most 1 point.

Hence, the answer is 1.

Another sample input:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Hence, s={8,5}, u={7,4,1,2}, t={3,6}

From s, I can get 2 points.

From u, I need to see how many points I can get.

Nene has {3,3,6,6,7,1,4,2}

According to the answer, I can get 2 points.

Hence, total points: me=2, Nene=6.

Similarly, in another test case:

n=8

My cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

s={5,3,4,6}, u={7,1,2}, t={8}

From s, I can get 3 points.

From u, I can get 0 points.

Total points: me=3, Nene=5.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, no, in the sample input, it's:

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

Hence, my cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, frequencies:

- 4:2

- others:1

Hence, s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

From s, I can get 1 point.

From u, I can get some points.

But according to the sample output, it's 1, meaning I get only 1 point.

Hence, perhaps I can't get any points from u.

Hence, total points from s=1, from u=0.

Hence, me=1, Nene=7.

Wait, but n=8, total points=8.

Hence, if me=1, Nene=7.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Another sample input:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

Hence, s={}, u={1,2,3}, t={}

From s, I get 0 points.

From u, I need to see.

Nene has {1,2,3}

Total points: me=0, Nene=3.

Hence, sample output is 0.

Another sample input:

n=1

My cards:1

Hence, s={1}, u={}, t={}

From s, I get 1 point.

Nene has {1}, but since I have both, Nene has none.

Wait, no, with n=1, and I have {1}, Nene has {1}.

Hence, s={}, u={1}, t={}

From s, I get 0 points.

From u, I can't get any points, since Nene can play her 1 before I play mine.

Hence, me=0, Nene=1.

Sample output is 0.

Hence, from the sample inputs, it seems that I can get points only from s, and possibly some from u, but Nene can prevent me from getting points from u.

Hence, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of s.

In the first sample, s={1}, answer=1.

Second sample, s={8,5}, answer=2.

Third sample, s={4}, answer=1.

Fourth sample, s={}, answer=0.

Fifth sample, s={}, answer=0.

Hence, perhaps the answer is equal to the number of s.

But wait, in the second sample, s={8,5}, answer=2.

But in the explanation, me=2, Nene=6.

Hence, it matches.

In the third sample, s={4}, answer=1.

But according to the earlier assumption, from s I can get 1 point, and from u I can't get any points, since Nene can play her u cards before I play mine.

Hence, perhaps the answer is equal to the number of s.

But let's verify with the first sample.

First sample:

s={1}, answer=1.

Hence, yes.

Hence, perhaps the answer is equal to the number of s.

Wait, but why doesn't u contribute to my points?

Because Nene can always play her u cards before I play mine, thereby preventing me from getting points from u.

Hence, I can only get points from s.

Hence, the answer is equal to the number of s.

But in the second sample, s={8,5}, answer=2.

Hence, it matches.

In the third sample, s={4}, answer=1.

But according to the sample input, it's 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought s={4}, but looking back:

n=8

My cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Hence, frequencies:

- 4:2

- others:1

Hence, s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

Hence, s=1, answer=1.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's 8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

Hence, s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

Hence, s=1, answer=1.

Wait, but earlier I thought s={5,3,4,6}, but that's incorrect.

Wait, no, in this case, s={4}, because only 4 appears twice in my hand.

Hence, s=1, answer=1.

Hence, it matches.

Hence, perhaps the answer is equal to the number of s.

Wait, but in the second sample, s={8,5}, answer=2.

Hence, it seems that the answer is equal to the number of s.

Hence, perhaps I can conclude that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of s.

Hence, the solution is to count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Hence, the program should count the frequency of each number in my hand, count how many numbers appear twice, and output that count.

But looking back at the provided program, it seems more complicated.

The provided program uses a 2D DP array, which seems unnecessary if the answer is simply the count of s.

Hence, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me check the third sample again.

n=8

My cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

From s, I can get 1 point.

From u, can I get any points?

Nene has {8,7,1,3,4,2,6}

Wait, no, Nene has {8,8,7,1,3,4,2,6}, but 4 is already in my hand twice, so Nene only has one 4.

Wait, no, total cards: two of each number from 1 to 8.

I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Hence, Nene has 7,1,4,5,3,2,6,8

Wait, but 4 appears twice in my hand, so Nene has one 4.

Wait, no, total two 4's, I have two 4's, so Nene has no 4's.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, it was s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

Hence, Nene has {8,8,7,1,5,3,2,6}, but since I have one of each of 7,1,5,3,2,6, Nene has the other one.

Wait, no, I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Hence, for numbers:

- 4: both with me.

- 8: both with Nene.

- Others: one with me, one with Nene.

Hence, Nene has {8,8,7,1,3,5,2,6}

Wait, no, total two of each number.

I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Hence, Nene has the other cards: 7,1,5,3,2,6,8,8

Wait, but 4 is only with me.

Hence, Nene has {7,1,5,3,2,6,8,8}

Hence, in this case, s={4}, u={7,1,5,3,2,6}, t={8}

Now, if I play my 4 first, then Nene can play something else, say 7.

Then I play my 4 and get a point.

Then Nene plays 1, I play 5, Nene plays 3, I play 2, Nene plays 6, I play 8, Nene plays 8 and gets a point.

Total points: me=1, Nene=1 (from playing the second 8).

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, but in this sequence, me=1, Nene=1.

But earlier I thought Nene would get more points.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, Nene has {7,1,5,3,2,6,8,8}

If I play 4, Nene plays 7, I play 4 and get a point.

Then Nene plays 1, I play 5, Nene plays 3, I play 2, Nene plays 6, I play 8, Nene plays 8 and gets a point.

Total points: me=1, Nene=1.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Hence, it matches.

But according to the explanation in the first sample, Nene can get more points by playing differently.

Hence, perhaps in this case, Nene can't get more points.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can arrange her plays to maximize her points.

But in this case, she can get at least 1 point from playing the second 8.

Hence, me=1, Nene=1.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Hence, perhaps in this case, I can get 1 point, and Nene gets 1 point.

But in the first sample, me=1, Nene=3.

Hence, total points are n=4.

In this case, total points are me=1 + Nene=1 = 2, which is less than n=8.

Wait, no, in this sample, n=8, total points are me=1 + Nene=7.

Wait, no, in this particular sequence, me=1, Nene=1, but perhaps Nene can get more points by playing differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that for s, I can get one point per s.

For u, Nene can choose to play her u cards at times that prevent me from getting points from u.

Hence, I can only get points from s.

Hence, the answer is the number of s.

Hence, in the program, it should simply count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

But in the provided program, it's using a 2D DP array, which seems unnecessary.

Hence, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps there are cases where I can get points from u.

For example, if I have multiple s, I can arrange my plays to force Nene to play her u cards at times when I can get points from u.

Hence, perhaps I can get some points from u in addition to s.

Hence, the answer might be greater than just s in some cases.

Looking back at the second sample:

n=8

My cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Hence, s={8,5}, u={7,4,1,2}, t={3,6}

From s, I can get 2 points.

From u, perhaps I can get some points.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Hence, perhaps in this case, I can't get any points from u.

Hence, total points from s=2, from u=0.

Hence, me=2, Nene=6.

Another sample:

n=4

My cards:1,1,2,3

Hence, s={1}, u={2,3}, t={4}

From s, I can get 1 point.

From u, perhaps I can get 0 points.

Hence, me=1, Nene=3.

Hence, in all samples, it seems that I can only get points from s.

Hence, perhaps the answer is equal to s.

Hence, the program should count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Hence, the provided program seems overly complicated.

Perhaps it's wrong.

But according to the test cases, it might be correct.

Wait, in the provided program:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

dp[n - 1][0] = 0

dp[n - 2][0] = 0

for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):

for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:

dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]

elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)

else:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i +
