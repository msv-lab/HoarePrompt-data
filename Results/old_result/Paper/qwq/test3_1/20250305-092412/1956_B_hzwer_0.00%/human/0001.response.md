Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

The game proceeds in 2n turns, with me and Nene alternating turns, starting with me. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place the selected card on the table.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

So, there are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards.

During the game, we take turns playing one card at a time, alternating starts with me.

When I play a card, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, I get a point.

Similarly for Nene.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find out the maximum score I can achieve under these conditions.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it.

We have a set of cards, with numbers from 1 to n, each appearing twice. Me and Nene have n cards each.

We play 2n turns, alternating, starting with me.

On each turn:

- Player selects one card from their hand.

- If a card with the same number is already on the table, they get a point.

- The selected card is then placed on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among such options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find the maximum score I can achieve.

Alright, let's think about the game step by step.

First, since Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider her responses to my moves.

This sounds like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where both players are trying to maximize their own scores.

But it's not exactly zero-sum because points are earned based on whether a pair is already on the table, not directly at the expense of the other player.

Wait, actually, since points are earned independently based on the state of the table, it's not directly zero-sum. Both players can earn points independently.

However, the way Nene plays affects what I can do later, and vice versa.

I need to model this interaction.

Let's consider that the game is sequential, with perfect information, since all moves are public.

This means that at each step, both players know the entire history of the game, including which cards have been played so far.

Given that, I can model this as a tree of possible moves, with me and Nene alternating turns.

But with n up to 2*10^5, that's way too big to handle with a straightforward game tree approach.

So, I need a smarter way to compute the optimal score.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

Each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

Me and Nene have n cards each, so some numbers are split between us, and some might be both in my hand or both in Nene's hand.

Wait, no. Since there are exactly two cards for each number, it's possible that both cards of a number are in my hand, or both are in Nene's hand, or one in each.

But the problem says that each number from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, but since there are only two cards per number, that means that for some numbers, I have both cards, for some, only one, and for some, none.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "the integers on the cards in your hand have integers a1, a2, ..., an written on them, and it is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

So, in my hand, for each number from 1 to n, I have either 0, 1, or 2 cards.

But since I have n cards in total, and there are n numbers, some numbers might have both cards in my hand, some have one, and some have none.

Wait, but if some numbers have both cards in my hand, and some have none, then the total number of cards I have could be less than n, but the problem says I have n cards.

Wait, no. Wait, the deck has 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

Then, me and Nene each have n cards.

So, the sum of the cards I have and the cards Nene has is 2n cards.

Given that, for each number from 1 to n, the two cards are distributed between me and Nene in some way.

So, for each number, there are three possibilities:

1. Both cards are in my hand.

2. One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

3. Both cards are in Nene's hand.

Is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, each number appears exactly twice in the deck, and me and Nene have n cards each.

So, for each number, the two cards can be distributed as:

- Both in my hand.

- Both in Nene's hand.

- One in my hand, one in Nene's hand.

But the total number of cards I have is n, so the sum of the counts of cards per number in my hand must add up to n.

Given that, some numbers have one card in my hand and one in Nene's, and some have both cards in my hand or both in Nene's hand.

Wait, but since there are n numbers and I have n cards, and each number appears at most twice in my hand, then:

- If I have both cards of a number, that counts as 2 towards my n cards.

- If I have one card of a number, that counts as 1.

- If I have no cards of a number, that counts as 0.

So, the sum of these should be n.

Got it.

Now, the problem is to maximize my score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize my score.

I need to find the optimal strategy for both players and compute my score.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where I need to maximize my score considering that Nene is minimizing it, but only after maximizing her own score.

Wait, it's a bit more nuanced because Nene is trying to maximize her score first, and then minimize my score secondarily.

So, it's not a pure minimax situation.

I need to model this properly.

Let me try to think in terms of the game states.

At each turn, the state of the game can be described by:

- The set of cards I have in my hand.

- The set of cards Nene has in her hand.

- The set of cards already on the table.

Given that, each player, on their turn, chooses a card from their hand to play.

If the card's number is already on the table, they get a point.

Then, the card is placed on the table.

The game alternates between me and Nene, starting with me.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among such options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, considering Nene's behavior.

This seems complex, but maybe there's a smarter way to approach it.

Let me think about the pairs.

For each number, there are two cards.

If both are played during the game, the second one to be played will give a point to the player who plays it.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a card is played and there's already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets a point.

So, for each pair of cards with the same number, the player who plays the second card gets a point.

Because when they play the second card, there's already the first card on the table.

Hence, the player who plays the second card of a pair gets a point.

So, the problem reduces to determining, for each pair, who plays the second card.

If I play the second card, I get a point; if Nene plays the second card, she gets a point.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of pairs where I play the second card.

But Nene is trying to maximize the number of pairs where she plays the second card, and among those options, minimize the number of pairs where I play the second card.

Wait, more precisely, Nene is trying to maximize her score first, and then minimize my score secondarily.

So, in terms of pairs:

- For each pair, one of us will play the second card.

- If I play the second card, I get a point.

- If Nene plays the second card, she gets a point.

Given that, the total number of points that can be scored in the game is equal to the number of pairs, which is n, because there are n pairs.

Wait, no. Wait, there are n pairs, but points are only scored when the second card is played.

So, in total, n points will be scored in the game, one for each pair.

But actually, no. Wait, if both cards of a pair are played, then one point is scored by the player who plays the second card.

But it's possible that a pair is not fully played, but in this problem, since all cards are played, because all cards are played in the 2n turns, so each pair will have both cards played, so indeed, n points will be scored in total.

Therefore, my score plus Nene's score will always be n.

Given that, maximizing my score is equivalent to minimizing Nene's score, and vice versa.

Wait, but in this game, since the total points are fixed, maximizing my score is equivalent to minimizing Nene's score, and vice versa.

But in this problem, Nene is trying to maximize her score first, and secondarily minimize my score.

Wait, but since my score plus Nene's score is always n, minimizing Nene's score is equivalent to maximizing my score.

So, in this context, Nene's secondary goal to minimize my score is redundant because minimizing her score maximizes mine.

Wait, but given that my score plus Nene's score is always n, minimizing Nene's score is the same as maximizing mine.

So, perhaps it's sufficient to consider that Nene is simply trying to maximize her score, and I am trying to maximize mine, knowing that my score is n minus Nene's score.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, Nene is trying to maximize her score first, and among options that maximize her score, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

But since my score is n minus her score, minimizing my score is the same as maximizing her score.

Wait, but only if her score is already maximized.

Wait, perhaps there are cases where her score can be maximized in multiple ways, and among those, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

But in reality, since my score is n minus her score, minimizing my score is maximizing her score, which is already her primary goal.

Wait, perhaps in some scenarios, there might be dependencies, but in this specific game, since the total points are fixed, maybe it's sufficient to consider that Nene is simply trying to maximize her score.

Therefore, I need to maximize my score, knowing that Nene is trying to maximize her score.

Given that, and since my score is n minus her score, I need to minimize her score.

Wait, but no, because Nene is playing against me, trying to maximize her score, which is n minus my score.

Wait, I need to sort this out.

Let me think again.

Total points scored are n, since there are n pairs, and each pair contributes exactly one point to either me or Nene, depending on who plays the second card.

Therefore, my score + Nene's score = n.

Nene is trying to maximize her score, which is equivalent to maximizing n - my score, which means minimizing my score.

Wait, but that's not correct.

Wait, if Nene maximizes her score, which is n - my score, then she is minimizing my score.

But in reality, Nene wants to maximize her score, which is equivalent to maximizing n - my score, which is the same as minimizing my score.

But according to the problem, Nene first maximizes her score, and secondarily minimizes my score.

Given that my score is n - her score, minimizing my score is the same as maximizing her score.

Therefore, perhaps her secondary goal is redundant, and I can just consider that Nene is trying to minimize my score.

Wait, but that would make her primary and secondary goals aligned.

So, perhaps I can treat this as Nene trying to minimize my score.

Therefore, I need to find the maximum score I can get, given that Nene is trying to minimize my score.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where I need to maximize my score considering that Nene is trying to minimize it.

Yes, that seems appropriate.

So, I need to find the minimax value, where I maximize my score, knowing that Nene is going to play to minimize it.

Given that, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Given the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, I need to consider the pairs.

For each number, there are two cards, and they are distributed between me and Nene in some way.

Let me categorize the numbers based on who has their cards.

For each number, there are three possibilities:

1. Both cards are in my hand.

2. Both cards are in Nene's hand.

3. One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

Let's think about each case.

Case 1: Both cards are in my hand.

In this case, I can control when to play these two cards.

I can choose to play them in any order.

So, I can choose to play one first, then the other.

In this scenario, when I play the second card, there will already be the first card on the table, so I will get a point.

Therefore, for each pair where both cards are in my hand, I can always ensure that I get a point.

Case 2: Both cards are in Nene's hand.

In this case, Nene can control when to play these two cards.

She can choose to play them in any order.

So, she can choose to play one first, then the other.

When she plays the second card, there will already be the first card on the table, so she will get a point.

In this case, I have no control over when these cards are played, so I cannot get a point from this pair.

Case 3: One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

In this case, one of us will play their card first, and the other will play second.

The player who plays second will get a point.

So, the question is, who gets to play second.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize my score, she will try to play second if possible to get the point.

But I also want to play second to get the point.

So, in this case, since we are alternating turns, starting with me, the player who has the second turn for each pair can be determined by the sequence of plays.

Wait, but it's more nuanced because we are playing n turns each, alternating.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sequence of plays.

Let me consider that.

Let's model the game as a sequence of 2n turns, with me playing turns 1,3,5,... and Nene playing turns 2,4,6,...

Wait, no, the problem says that we take n turns each, alternating starts with me.

So, the sequence is me, Nene, me, Nene, ..., me, Nene.

But the total number of turns is 2n, with me playing n turns and Nene playing n turns.

Wait, but in reality, since n turns are played by me and n by Nene, and turns are alternating starting with me, the sequence is me, Nene, me, Nene, ..., me, Nene.

But the total number of turns is 2n, with me playing n turns and Nene playing n turns.

Wait, but in reality, in 2n turns, with alternating starts with me, I play turns 1,3,5,..., and Nene plays 2,4,6,...

But if n is even, then the last turn is Nene's, and if n is odd, the last turn is mine.

But perhaps that's not directly relevant.

Let me think differently.

I need to find, for each pair where one card is in my hand and one is in Nene's hand, who gets to play second.

Given that, and considering that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize my score, I need to determine, for each such pair, who will play second.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of such pairs.

Let me define:

- Let k be the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

- Let m be the number of pairs where both cards are in Nene's hand.

- Let p be the number of pairs where one card is in my hand and one is in Nene's hand.

Then, k + m + p = n, since there are n pairs in total.

From my hand, for each pair where both cards are in my hand, I have two cards.

For pairs where one card is in my hand, I have one card.

Given that, the total number of cards in my hand is:

total_cards_in_my_hand = 2k + p = n

Similarly, total cards in Nene's hand is:

total_cards_in_nene_hand = 2m + p = n

Because the total number of cards is 2n, divided equally between me and Nene.

So, 2k + p = n

And 2m + p = n

From these, we can derive that 2k + p = 2m + p, which implies k = m.

So, the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand is equal to the number of pairs where both cards are in Nene's hand.

That's an important observation.

Given that, k = m, and p = n - 2k.

Now, my score comes from:

- The k pairs where both cards are in my hand: I can always get a point from each of these pairs.

- Plus, from the p pairs where one card is in my hand and one is in Nene's hand, I can get a point if I play my card second.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score, which comes from:

- The m pairs where both cards are in her hand: she gets a point from each.

- Plus, from the p mixed pairs, she gets a point if she plays her card second.

Given that, in the p mixed pairs, for each pair, the player who plays second gets the point.

Given that, and considering that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize my score, I need to determine how many of these p pairs Nene can force me to let her play second.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of such pairs where Nene can play second.

Given that, and considering that Nene is trying to maximize her score, she will try to play second in as many mixed pairs as possible.

But I also have some control over the order in which cards are played.

Wait, but since turns are fixed, and we alternate, perhaps I can model this as a scheduling problem.

Let me consider that.

Let me consider that the game consists of n turns for me and n turns for Nene.

I play first, then Nene, and so on.

In each of my turns, I choose one of my remaining cards to play.

Similarly, Nene chooses one of her remaining cards to play.

Now, for the mixed pairs, where one card is in my hand and one is in Nene's hand, the player who plays second will get the point.

So, for each such pair, I need to determine who plays second.

Given that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize my score, she will try to play second in as many mixed pairs as possible.

But I can also strategize to force her to play first in some mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of mixed pairs p.

Given that, and knowing that Nene is trying to maximize her score, which includes maximizing the number of mixed pairs where she plays second.

But also, since I can choose when to play my cards, perhaps I can force some of these mixed pairs to be played in a way that I play second.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of mixed pairs p and the number of turns I have.

Wait, I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Given that, and since k + m + p = n, and k = m, then p = n - 2k.

Wait, but k = m = (n - p)/2.

Wait, but k and m are integers, so p must be even for k and m to be integers.

Wait, but p can be odd or even.

Wait, actually, from 2k + p = n, and k is an integer, so p must have the same parity as n.

But in any case, I need to find a way to maximize my score.

Let me consider that I get k points from the pairs where both cards are in my hand.

From the p mixed pairs, I can get some number of points, say q, by playing second in q of them.

Similarly, Nene will get p - q points from playing second in the remaining mixed pairs.

But Nene is trying to maximize her total score, which is m + p - q, and minimize my score, which is k + q.

Given that, I need to maximize k + q, knowing that Nene is trying to minimize it.

Wait, but Nene can choose q in a way that maximizes her score m + p - q and minimizes my score k + q.

But since m is fixed, and p is fixed, and k is fixed, the only variable is q.

Wait, but q is determined by the way we play the mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the p mixed pairs, Nene can choose to play first or second for each pair.

But actually, since turns are fixed, it's not exactly like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sequence of plays.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

I play first, then Nene, and so on.

Each turn, I choose one of my remaining cards to play, and Nene does the same.

For the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I can choose to play them in any order.

Similarly, for the m pairs where both cards are in Nene's hand, she can choose to play them in any order.

For the p mixed pairs, one card is in my hand and one in Nene's hand.

For these p mixed pairs, the player who plays second gets the point.

Given that, Nene will try to play second in as many of these p mixed pairs as possible.

But since turns are fixed, I need to see how many of these p mixed pairs I can force Nene to play first.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of mixed pairs p and the number of turns I have.

Wait, I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Given that, and considering that I can choose which cards to play in which turns, I need to schedule the play of the mixed pairs in a way that maximizes the number of times I play second.

But since Nene is also trying to maximize her score, she will try to play second in as many mixed pairs as possible.

Given that, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is limited by the number of turns I have beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs.

Let me consider that.

I have n turns.

Out of these n turns, k of them are dedicated to playing the pairs where both cards are in my hand.

In these k turns, I will play one card from each of these k pairs.

Wait, no, for the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I need to play both cards.

Wait, but I have n turns in total.

Wait, actually, for each of the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I need to play both cards in two separate turns.

But I only have n turns.

Wait, but I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Wait, but for the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I need to play both cards, which will take 2k turns.

But I only have n turns.

Wait, no, I have n turns, and Nene has n turns, totaling 2n turns.

Wait, but for the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I need to play both cards, which will take 2k turns.

But I only have n turns.

Wait, no, I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Wait, but in total, there are 2n turns.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the k pairs where both cards are in my hand, I need to play both cards, one in my turn and one in another turn.

Wait, but I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of scheduling the play of these cards.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to find a formula or a way to compute the minimax value.

Given that k + m + p = n, and k = m, p = n - 2k.

But k is the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

From my hand, I have 2k cards from these k pairs, and p cards from the mixed pairs.

So, total cards in my hand: 2k + p = n.

Similarly, Nene has 2m + p = n.

Given that k = m, p = n - 2k.

Wait, but k is the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

From the frequency of numbers in my hand, I can determine k.

Wait, let's see.

Given that in my hand, for each number, I can have 0, 1, or 2 cards.

Let me count how many numbers have 0, 1, or 2 cards in my hand.

Let me define:

- Let two_in_my_hand be the number of numbers that have both cards in my hand.

- Let one_in_my_hand be the number of numbers that have one card in my hand.

- Let zero_in_my_hand be the number of numbers that have no cards in my hand.

Then, two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand + zero_in_my_hand = n.

Also, the total number of cards in my hand is 2*two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand = n.

From these two equations, I can solve for two_in_my_hand and one_in_my_hand.

From:

two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand + zero_in_my_hand = n

2*two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand = n

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(2*two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand) - (two_in_my_hand + one_in_my_hand + zero_in_my_hand) = 0

Which simplifies to:

two_in_my_hand - zero_in_my_hand = 0

Therefore, two_in_my_hand = zero_in_my_hand.

So, the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand is equal to the number of pairs where both cards are in Nene's hand.

That makes sense because if some pairs are entirely in my hand and some are entirely in Nene's hand, and the rest are mixed.

Given that, I can compute two_in_my_hand as the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Similarly, zero_in_my_hand is the number of numbers that do not appear in my hand.

And one_in_my_hand is the number of numbers that appear once in my hand.

Given that, I can compute two_in_my_hand, one_in_my_hand, and zero_in_my_hand.

Now, my score is:

- two_in_my_hand (from the pairs where both cards are in my hand)

- plus the number of mixed pairs where I play second.

Similarly, Nene's score is:

- zero_in_my_hand (from the pairs where both cards are in her hand)

- plus the number of mixed pairs where she plays second.

Given that, and knowing that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize my score, I need to determine how many of the mixed pairs I can get to play second.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of mixed pairs where I can play second.

Given that, and considering that Nene is trying to minimize that number, I need to find the maximum number of mixed pairs where I can play second, given Nene's opposition.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a game where I need to schedule my plays to maximize the number of mixed pairs where I play second, and Nene is trying to minimize that number.

Given that, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is equal to the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs.

Let me consider that.

I have n turns.

Out of these n turns, I need to play the second card for the two_in_my_hand pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, no, for each of the two_in_my_hand pairs, I need to play two cards: the first and the second.

But in terms of turns, I have n turns to play my n cards.

Similarly, Nene has n turns to play her n cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sequence of plays.

Let me try to model the sequence.

Suppose I label the turns as follows:

Turn 1: Me

Turn 2: Nene

Turn 3: Me

Turn 4: Nene

...

Turn 2n: Nene (if n is even) or Me (if n is odd)

Wait, but n turns each.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs.

Given that Nene is trying to maximize her score, which comes from playing second in the mixed pairs, she will try to play second as much as possible in the mixed pairs.

But I can try to force her to play first in some mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of mixed pairs where I can play second.

Given that, I can play second in a mixed pair if Nene plays her card in that pair first.

So, if Nene plays her card in a mixed pair in one of her turns, and then I play my card in the next available turn.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score, so she will try to play her cards in such a way that she plays second in as many mixed pairs as possible.

Given that, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is equal to the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can force Nene to play first in the mixed pairs.

Given that, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is equal to the number of my turns minus the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

- k = two_in_my_hand

- p = one_in_my_hand

- m = zero_in_my_hand

We have k + m + p = n

And 2k + p = n

From which, p = n - 2k

Also, since two_in_my_hand = zero_in_my_hand, k = m

So, p = n - 2k

Now, my score is k + q, where q is the number of mixed pairs where I play second.

Nene's score is m + (p - q)

But m = k

So, Nene's score is k + p - q

And my score is k + q

Given that, and knowing that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize my score, I need to maximize q, considering that Nene will try to minimize q.

Wait, but Nene wants to maximize her score, which is k + p - q, and minimize my score, which is k + q.

Given that, Nene will try to minimize q.

Therefore, the game is that I want to maximize q, and Nene wants to minimize q.

Therefore, it's a zero-sum game in terms of q.

Hence, the minimax value of q is the value where, no matter how Nene plays, I can ensure at least that much q, and no matter how I play, Nene can ensure that I don't get more than that q.

Therefore, I need to find the minimax value of q.

Given that, I need to find the maximum q such that, even when Nene plays to minimize q, q is at least some value.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs.

Given that, and considering that Nene is trying to minimize q, perhaps q is equal to the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Wait, perhaps q is equal to the minimum between the number of my turns beyond k and p.

Wait, perhaps q = min(n - k, p)

But let me verify this.

I have n turns.

Out of these n turns, k of them are dedicated to playing the second card of the pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Therefore, I have n - k turns left to play the mixed pairs.

Similarly, Nene has n turns, and she has to play the second card for the m pairs where both cards are in her hand.

Wait, but m = k.

So, Nene has to play the second card for k pairs.

Therefore, she has n - k turns left to play the mixed pairs.

Given that, in the p mixed pairs, Nene can choose to play first or second.

But since she is trying to maximize her score, which is k + p - q, she wants to maximize p - q, which means minimizing q.

Therefore, she will try to play second in as many mixed pairs as possible.

Given that, the number of times she can play second in the mixed pairs is limited by her remaining turns.

She has n - k turns to play the mixed pairs.

Similarly, I have n - k turns to play the mixed pairs.

Therefore, the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is p - (n - k)

But that could be negative.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is min(p, n - k)

Because I have n - k turns to play the mixed pairs, and there are p mixed pairs.

Therefore, I can play second in up to n - k mixed pairs.

Similarly, Nene can play second in up to n - k mixed pairs.

But Nene is trying to minimize q, which is the number of mixed pairs where I play second.

Therefore, she will try to reduce q as much as possible.

Given that, the minimax value of q is n - k, but it cannot exceed p.

Therefore, q = min(n - k, p)

Hence, my total score is k + q = k + min(n - k, p)

Given that p = n - 2k, then:

q = min(n - k, n - 2k)

Therefore, my score is k + min(n - k, n - 2k)

Wait, but n - 2k = p

So, my score is k + min(n - k, p)

But p = n - 2k

Therefore, my score is k + min(n - k, n - 2k)

Which simplifies to k + min(n - k, n - 2k)

Now, let's see.

I need to compute k, which is the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

Given that, and p = n - 2k

So, my score is k + min(n - k, n - 2k)

Now, I need to compute k from the input.

Given that, I can count how many numbers appear twice in my hand.

That will be k.

Then, p = n - 2k

Then, my score is k + min(n - k, p)

Which is k + min(n - k, n - 2k)

So, I can implement this formula.

Wait, but let's verify this with the sample input.

In the first sample input:

n = 4

a = [1,1,2,3]

So, my hand has:

- 1 appears twice

- 2 appears once

- 3 appears once

Therefore, k = 1 (number 1)

p = n - 2k = 4 - 2*1 = 2

Therefore, my score = 1 + min(4 - 1, 2) = 1 + min(3,2) = 1 + 2 = 3

But in the explanation, the score is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, in the sample input, the output is 1, but according to this formula, it's 3.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can interfere with my ability to play second in the mixed pairs.

Let me think again.

Let me consider that in the mixed pairs, Nene can choose to play first or second.

But since turns are fixed, perhaps I need to consider the sequence of plays.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of free slots I have to play second in the mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs is equal to the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

But in the sample input, k = 1, n = 4, p = 2

Then, n - k = 3

So, min(3,2) = 2

Then, my score = k + q = 1 + 2 = 3

But the sample output is 1, which is different.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can force me to play first in some of the mixed pairs.

Given that, perhaps the number of mixed pairs where I can play second is min(n - k, p) - (n - k - m)

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me look for a different way to model this.

Let me consider that the game can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent pairs, and edges represent dependencies between pairs.

But that might be too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand plus the number of mixed pairs where I play second.

And Nene is trying to minimize the number of mixed pairs where I play second.

Given that, perhaps I need to find the difference between the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand and the number of mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum between the two.

Wait, perhaps my score is k + floor((n - k - m)/2)

But m = k, so n - k - m = n - 2k

So, my score is k + floor((n - 2k)/2)

Which simplifies to k + floor((n - 2k)/2)

Let me test this with the sample input.

n = 4, k = 1, p = 2

Then, my score = 1 + floor((4 - 2*1)/2) = 1 + floor(2/2) = 1 + 1 = 2

But in the sample, the output is 1.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps my score is k + ceil((n - 2k)/2)

Then, in the sample input:

1 + ceil((4 - 2*1)/2) = 1 + ceil(2/2) = 1 + 1 = 2

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's k + floor((n - k)/2)

Then, 1 + floor((4 - 1)/2) = 1 + floor(3/2) = 1 + 1 = 2

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can force me to play first in some mixed pairs.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs is equal to the number of my turns beyond the number of pairs where both cards are in my hand.

So, q = max(0, n - 2k)

Then, my score is k + q = k + max(0, n - 2k)

In the sample input:

k = 1, n = 4, q = max(0, 4 - 2*1) = max(0,2) = 2

Then, my score = 1 + 2 = 3

But sample output is 1, so still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to take into account that Nene can limit the number of times I can play second in the mixed pairs.

Given that, perhaps q = max(0, n - 2k - m)

But m = k, so q = max(0, n - 3k)

In the sample input, n=4, k=1, q = max(0,4-3*1)=1

Then, my score = 1 + 1 = 2

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that q is the minimum between n - k and p.

So, q = min(n - k, p)

In the sample input, n=4, k=1, p=2

q = min(3,2) = 2

my score = 1 + 2 = 3

But sample output is 1.

So, perhaps this is not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can force me to play first in some mixed pairs.

Given that, perhaps q = p - (n - k)

But in the sample input, q = 2 - (4 - 1) = 2 - 3 = -1

Then q = max(0, p - (n - k)) = max(0,2-3)=0

Then, my score = 1 + 0 =1, which matches the sample.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the formula should be:

q = max(0, p - (n - k))

Then, my score = k + q = k + max(0, p - (n - k))

In the sample input:

k=1, p=2, n=4

q = max(0,2 - (4 -1)) = max(0,2-3)=max(0,-1)=0

Then, my score =1 +0=1, which matches the sample.

Another test case:

n=8

a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

Count frequencies:

7:1,4:1,1:1,2:1,8:2,5:2

So, k=2 (pairs with both cards in my hand: 8 and 5)

p=n-2k=8-4=4

Then, q = max(0,4 - (8 -2))=max(0,4-6)=max(0,-2)=0

my score =2 +0=2, which matches the second sample output.

Another test case:

n=8

a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

Frequencies:

7:1,1:1,4:
