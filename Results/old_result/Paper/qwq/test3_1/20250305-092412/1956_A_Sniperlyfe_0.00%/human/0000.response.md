Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game that Nene invented, and it involves a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., ak. The game starts with n players lined up in a row. In each round of the game, Nene kicks out certain players based on their positions in the line, specifically the a1-th, a2-th, ..., ak-th players. If a player should be kicked out but there aren't enough players left in the line, that kick is skipped. This process repeats until no one is kicked out in a round, and those remaining players are the winners.

The task is to determine how many players will be winners for each given n_i, where q such n_i values are provided.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. Let's look at the example provided to get a clearer picture.

Example:

k = 2, q = 1

a = [3,5]

n = 5

Players: A, B, C, D, E

Round 1:

- Kick out 3rd (C) and 5th (E) players.

- Remaining: A, B, D

Round 2:

- Now, the line is A, B, D.

- Kick out the 3rd player (D), and there's no 5th player.

- Remaining: A, B

Round 3:

- No one is kicked out.

- Winners: A and B

So, for n=5, the number of winners is 2.

Another example in the second test case:

k=5, q=3

a=[2,4,6,7,9]

n1=1, n2=3, n3=5

Let's try to simulate this.

For n=1:

Players: A

Round 1:

- Try to kick out 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th players, but there's only 1 player.

- No one is kicked out.

- Winner: A

So, 1 winner.

For n=3:

Players: A, B, C

Round 1:

- Kick out 2nd (B) and 4th (no 4th player).

- Remaining: A, C

Round 2:

- Kick out 2nd (C).

- Remaining: A

Round 3:

- No one is kicked out.

- Winner: A

So, 1 winner.

For n=5:

Players: A, B, C, D, E

Round 1:

- Kick out 2nd (B), 4th (D), 6th (no), 7th (no), 9th (no).

- Remaining: A, C, E

Round 2:

- Kick out 2nd (C), 4th (no), 6th (no), 7th (no), 9th (no).

- Remaining: A, E

Round 3:

- Kick out 2nd (E), 4th (no), etc.

- Remaining: A

Round 4:

- No one is kicked out.

- Winner: A

Again, 1 winner.

So, for n=1, n=3, n=5, the number of winners is 1 each time.

Looking at the output for this test case: 1 1 1, which matches.

Another test case:

k=5, q=4

a=[3,4,5,6,7]

n1=1, n2=2, n3=3, n4=4

Let's simulate:

For n=1:

Players: A

Round 1:

- Try to kick out 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th – none exist.

- No one kicked out.

- Winner: A

So, 1 winner.

For n=2:

Players: A, B

Round 1:

- Kick out 3rd (none), 4th (none), etc.

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: A, B

So, 2 winners.

For n=3:

Players: A, B, C

Round 1:

- Kick out 3rd (C).

- Remaining: A, B

Round 2:

- Kick out 3rd (none).

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: A, B

So, 2 winners.

For n=4:

Players: A, B, C, D

Round 1:

- Kick out 3rd (C), 4th (D), 5th (none), etc.

- Remaining: A, B

Round 2:

- Kick out 3rd (none).

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: A, B

So, 2 winners.

Looking at the output: 1 2 2 2, which matches.

Another test case:

k=2, q=3

a=[69,96]

n1=1, n2=10, n3=100

Output: 1 10 68

Let's see:

For n=1:

Only 1 player, can't kick out 69th and 96th – both don't exist.

So, 1 winner.

For n=10:

Players: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Round 1:

- Kick out 69th (doesn't exist), 96th (doesn't exist).

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: all 10 players.

So, 10 winners.

For n=100:

Players: 1 to 100

Round 1:

- Kick out 69th and 96th players.

- Remaining: 1 to 68, 70 to 95, 97 to 100

Round 2:

- Now, total remaining players: 100 - 2 = 98

- Kick out 69th and 96th of the current line.

- Need to map the positions after removal.

Wait, this seems more complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Another test case:

k=1, q=1

a=[100]

n=50

Output: 50

For n=50:

Players: 1 to 50

Round 1:

- Try to kick out 100th player, which doesn't exist.

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: all 50 players.

So, 50 winners.

Last test case:

k=3, q=3

a=[10,20,30]

n1=1, n2=10, n3=100

Output: 1 9 9

For n=1:

Only 1 player, can't kick out 10th, 20th, 30th – all don't exist.

So, 1 winner.

For n=10:

Players: 1 to 10

Round 1:

- Kick out 10th player.

- Remaining: 1 to 9

Round 2:

- Try to kick out 10th player, which doesn't exist.

- No one kicked out.

- Winners: 1 to 9, so 9 winners.

For n=100:

Players: 1 to 100

Round 1:

- Kick out 10th, 20th, 30th players.

- Remaining: 1 to 9, 11 to 19, 21 to 29, 31 to 100

Round 2:

- Now, total remaining players: 100 - 3 = 97

- Kick out the 10th, 20th, 30th players of the current line.

- Current positions after removing 10th, 20th, 30th:

- Players: 1 to 9, 11 to 19, 21 to 29, 31 to 100

- So, 10th player now is player 11, 20th is player 21, 30th is player 31

- Kick out player 11, 21, 31

- Remaining: 1 to 9, 12 to 20, 22 to 30, 32 to 100

Round 3:

- Total remaining: 97 - 3 = 94

- Kick out the 10th, 20th, 30th of the current line.

- Current positions:

- 1 to 9: players 1 to 9

- 10th: player 12

- 11th: player 13

- ...

- 20th: player 22

- 30th: player 32

- Kick out player 12, 22, 32

- Remaining: 1 to 9, 13 to 21, 23 to 30, 33 to 100

Round 4:

- Total remaining: 94 - 3 = 91

- Kick out 10th, 20th, 30th of the current line.

- 10th: player 13

- 20th: player 23

- 30th: player 33

- Kick out player 13, 23, 33

- Remaining: 1 to 9, 14 to 21, 24 to 30, 34 to 100

This seems to be a pattern where every round, we're kicking out three players, shifting the positions each time.

However, this process would continue until the number of remaining players is less than the smallest a_i, which is 10 in this case.

So, when remaining players < 10, no one is kicked out.

Let's see how many rounds this would take.

Initially, n=100

After round 1: 100 - 3 = 97

After round 2: 97 - 3 = 94

...

We need to find how many rounds r until 100 - 3*r < 10

100 - 3*r < 10 => 90 < 3*r => r > 30

So, after 30 rounds, remaining players: 100 - 3*30 = 100 - 90 = 10

Then, in the 31st round, since remaining players = 10, which is equal to the smallest a_i, we need to check if we can kick out the 10th player.

But according to the rules, if there are exactly 10 players, we kick out the 10th player, leaving 9.

Then, in the next round, with 9 players, which is less than 10, no one is kicked out.

So, winners would be 9.

Which matches the sample output: 1 9 9

Seems consistent.

Now, from these examples, I need to generalize a solution for any k, q, a, and n_i.

Constraints:

- 1 <= k, q <= 100

- 1 <= a1 < a2 < ... < ak <= 100

- 1 <= n_i <= 100

- t <= 250 (number of test cases)

Given that n_i can be up to 100 and q up to 100, and t up to 250, the total computations should be manageable.

Approach:

I need to simulate the process for each n_i.

But simulating each round for each n_i could be inefficient if n_i is large and k is large, but since n_i <= 100 and k <= 100, it should be fine.

However, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the number of winners without simulating each round.

Let me think.

In each round, we're removing the a1-th, a2-th, ..., ak-th players from the current line, provided they exist.

After each removal, the line reindexes.

This is similar to removing positions a1, a2, ..., ak in each round, but the positions are based on the current line.

I need to find out how many rounds it takes until no more players are removed.

An alternative approach is to realize that in each round, we're removing up to k players, but the positions change after each removal.

Simulating this precisely could be time-consuming.

Is there a mathematical formula or pattern that can be exploited?

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For n=5, a=[3,5], winners=2

- For n=1, a=[3,5], winners=1

- For n=3, a=[3,5], winners=1

- For n=5, a=[3,5], winners=2

Wait, n=5 already is 2, but in another case, n=5 with a=[2,4,6,7,9] gives 1 winner.

Wait, in the second test case, for n=5, it's a=[2,4,6,7,9], and winners=1.

Wait, in the third test case, for n=3 with a=[3,4,5,6,7], winners=2.

Hmm, seems inconsistent at first glance, but perhaps there's a pattern based on how a compares to n.

Wait, maybe it's better to think recursively or iteratively, simulating the removal process.

Let me consider writing a function that, given n and a, simulates the process until no more players are removed.

But simulating each round one by one might be too slow for large t, q, n, k.

Wait, n is up to 100, q up to 100, t up to 250, k up to 100.

Total operations would be around 250 * 100 * 100 = 2.5e6 operations, which is acceptable for a programming problem.

So, perhaps a simulation approach is feasible.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that in each round, we're removing up to k players, specifically the ones at positions a1, a2, ..., ak in the current line, provided those positions exist.

After each removal, the line reindexes, so the positions shift.

This is similar to removing elements from a list, which can be time-consuming if done naively.

An optimization could be to realize that, in each round, the number of players removed is equal to the number of a_j such that a_j <= current n.

So, in each round, count how many a_j <= current n, remove that many players, and update n accordingly.

But, since after each removal, the positions shift, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it is.

Consider that in each round, the number of players removed is equal to the number of a_j such that a_j <= current n.

Then, the new n is n minus the number of a_j <= n.

This continues until in some round, no players are removed, i.e., no a_j <= n.

So, it's like repeatedly subtracting the count of a_j <= n from n until no more a_j <= n.

The number of winners is the final n.

Let me test this logic with the first sample:

n=5, a=[3,5]

Round 1: count of a_j <=5: 2 (3 and 5), so n=5-2=3

Round 2: count of a_j <=3: 1 (only 3), so n=3-1=2

Round 3: count of a_j <=2: 0, so stop

Winners: 2

Matches the sample.

Second test case:

n=1, a=[2,4,6,7,9]

Round 1: count of a_j <=1: 0, so stop

Winners:1

n=3, a=[2,4,6,7,9]

Round 1: count of a_j <=3:1 (only 2), so n=3-1=2

Round 2: count of a_j <=2:1 (only 2), so n=2-1=1

Round 3: count of a_j <=1:0, so stop

Winners:1

n=5, a=[2,4,6,7,9]

Round 1: count of a_j <=5:2 (2 and 4), so n=5-2=3

Round 2: count of a_j <=3:1 (only 2), so n=3-1=2

Round 3: count of a_j <=2:1 (only 2), so n=2-1=1

Round 4: count of a_j <=1:0, so stop

Winners:1

Matches the sample.

Third test case:

n=1, a=[3,4,5,6,7]

Round 1: count of a_j <=1:0, so stop

Winners:1

n=2, a=[3,4,5,6,7]

Round 1: count of a_j <=2:0, so stop

Winners:2

n=3, a=[3,4,5,6,7]

Round 1: count of a_j <=3:1 (only 3), so n=3-1=2

Round 2: count of a_j <=2:0, so stop

Winners:2

n=4, a=[3,4,5,6,7]

Round 1: count of a_j <=4:2 (3 and 4), so n=4-2=2

Round 2: count of a_j <=2:0, so stop

Winners:2

Matches the sample: 1 2 2 2

Another test case:

n=1, a=[69,96]

Round 1: count of a_j <=1:0, so stop

Winners:1

n=10, a=[69,96]

Round 1: count of a_j <=10:1 (only 69 doesn't qualify, but 69>10, so 0), so stop

Wait, a_j=[69,96], both >10, so count=0, stop

Winners:10

But according to the sample, output is 1 10 68, so for n=10, it's 10, but according to this, it should be 10, but in the sample, it's 10 for n=10.

Wait, but in the explanation earlier, for n=10, a=[69,96], since both 69 and 96 are greater than 10, no one is kicked out in the first round, so winners are all 10 players.

Matches the sample.

For n=100, a=[69,96]

Round 1: count of a_j <=100:2 (69 and 96), so n=100-2=98

Round 2: count of a_j <=98:2 (69 and 96 <=98), so n=98-2=96

Round 3: count of a_j <=96:2 (69 and 96 <=96), so n=96-2=94

...

Continue this until n <=68, where a_j > n.

So, n decreases by 2 each round until n <=68.

So, n starts at 100, subtract 2 each time:

100,98,96,94,..., until n <=68

Find how many steps until n <=68

100 -2*r <=68 => r >= (100-68)/2 = 16 steps

So, after 16 steps, n=100-32=68

Then, in the next step, since n=68, a_j=69 and 96, both >68, so no one is kicked out.

Thus, winners:68

Matches the sample:1 10 68

Another test case:

n=50, a=[100]

Round 1: count of a_j <=50:0 (100>50), so stop

Winners:50

Matches the sample.

Last test case:

n=1, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1: count of a_j <=1:0, so stop

Winners:1

n=10, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1: count of a_j <=10:1 (only 10), so n=10-1=9

Round 2: count of a_j <=9:0, so stop

Winners:9

n=100, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1: count of a_j <=100:3 (10,20,30), so n=100-3=97

Round 2: count of a_j <=97:3 (10,20,30 <=97), so n=97-3=94

...

Continue until n <=9, where a_j > n.

So, n decreases by 3 each time until n <=9.

100 -3*r <=9 => r >= (100-9)/3 = 91/3 =30.333, so 31 steps

After 30 steps: n=100-90=10

31st step: n=10-3=7

Then, since n=7 <10, no more removals.

So, winners:7

But according to the sample, it's 1 9 9, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the explanation earlier, it was 1 9 9, but according to this calculation, it should be 1 9 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the last test case, sample output is 1 9 9, but according to this logic, for n=100, a=[10,20,30], it should be 1 9 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify this.

Wait, in the sample input, for k=3, q=3, a=[10,20,30], n=[1,10,100], output is 1 9 9.

But according to my calculation, it should be 1 9 7.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the a_j are indices in the current line, not absolute positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate more carefully.

Let's simulate n=100, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1:

Remove players at positions 10,20,30.

Now, n=100-3=97

Round 2:

In the new line, positions 10,20,30 correspond to original positions 9,19,29 (since removal shifts indices)

Wait, perhaps it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps in each round, we can think of removing the players at positions a_j in the current line, which requires reindexing after each removal.

This seems too time-consuming to simulate manually for n=100.

Given that, perhaps the initial approach of repeatedly subtracting the count of a_j <=n is correct, and the sample output is incorrect, or perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, in the earlier test cases, this approach worked.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Looking back, in the last test case, sample output is 1 9 9, but according to my approach, it should be 1 9 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to accept that and proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:

- Nene finds the a1-th, a2-th, ..., ak-th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i-th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped."

So, in each round, we identify the a_j-th players in the current row and remove them simultaneously.

Crucial point: "simultaneously."

So, in each round, we look at the current number of players, n, and identify which a_j are <= n. For each such a_j, we remove the player at position a_j.

Then, the line is reindexed without those players.

This is equivalent to, in each round, removing the players at positions a_j where a_j <= n, all at once.

This is different from removing them one by one, which could cause index shifts.

Given that, perhaps we can model this by, in each round, identifying the set of positions to remove, removing them all at once, and updating n accordingly.

In code, this can be implemented by repeatedly:

- Counting how many a_j are <= n

- Subtracting that count from n

- Repeating until no a_j <= n

Finally, the value of n is the number of winners.

This seems to match the earlier test cases.

For n=100, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1: count of a_j <=100:3, n=100-3=97

Round 2: count of a_j <=97:3, n=97-3=94

...

Continue until n <10, which is n=7 after 31 rounds.

But according to the sample, it's 9.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify again.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of rounds.

Let's calculate how many rounds:

Start with n=100

Each round, n = n -3

So, n after r rounds: n =100 -3*r

Stop when 100 -3*r <10, i.e., r > (100-10)/3 =90/3=30

So, r=30 rounds bring n to 100-90=10

Then, r=31: n=10-3=7

But in r=31, n=7, which is less than the smallest a_j=10, so no removal.

Thus, winners:7

But sample output is 9, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the stopping condition is when n < min(a_j), which is 10.

So, when n=10, since a_j=10 <=n, another round is needed.

Round 31: n=10-3=7

Round 32: since n=7 <10, stop.

So, winners:7

But sample output is 9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the sample is wrong, or perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe in the last step, when n=10, a_j=10 <=n, so remove 3 players, n=7

But in n=7, no a_j <=7, so stop.

Hence, winners:7

But sample output is 9, which suggests a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the sample is misprinted, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps in the last step, when n=10, a_j=10 <=n, so remove the 10th player, but then n=9, and a_j=20 and 30 are >9, so stop, winners:9

Wait, that makes sense.

So, in the first round, n=100, remove a_j=10,20,30, n=97

Second round, remove a_j=10,20,30 in the new line, which correspond to original positions adjusted for previous removals.

But this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps it's better to assume that in each round, we remove floor(n / a_j) players, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to implement the simulation as described.

Given that, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the sample output is错误的.

But to be safe, perhaps I should follow the problem statement strictly and implement the simulation accordingly.

Given time constraints, perhaps implementing the function as described is the way to go.

So, in code, for each n_i, perform:

while n >= min(a):

n -= sum(1 for x in a if x <= n)

return n

This should work correctly.

In the earlier example, for n=100, a=[10,20,30]

while 100 >=10:

n=100-3=97

n=97-3=94

...

Continue until n=7 <10, stop

Winners:7

But sample says 9, so perhaps discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps in the last step, when n=10, a_j=10 <=n, so remove 3 players, n=7

But in n=7, a_j=10 >7, so stop

Hence, winners:7

But sample output is 9, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the sample is wrong, or perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps in the simulation, when n=10, remove a_j=10, but a_j=20 and 30 are >10, so only remove 1 player.

Wait, but a_j=10,20,30, so in n=10, only a_j=10 <=10, so remove 1 player, n=9

Then, in next round, n=9, a_j=10,20,30 >9, so stop

Hence, winners:9

Ah, I see the mistake in my earlier reasoning.

In each round, you remove all a_j <=n, not necessarily all a_j.

So, in n=10, a_j=10 <=10, so remove 1 player (a_j=10), n=9

Then, a_j=20 and 30 >9, so stop

Hence, winners:9

So, in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly assumed that all a_j are <=n if any one is, which is incorrect.

Each a_j is checked individually.

Hence, for n=100, a=[10,20,30]

Round 1: a_j=10,20,30 <=100, remove 3 players, n=97

Round 2: a_j=10,20,30 <=97, remove 3 players, n=94

...

Continue until n=10:

Remove a_j=10 <=10, remove 1 player, n=9

Then, a_j=20,30 >9, stop

Winners:9

Matches the sample:1 9 9

So, earlier mistake in counting.

Hence, the correct approach is:

while n >= min(a):

count = sum(1 for x in a if x <= n)

n -= count

return n

This should work correctly.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func_1(n, p):

while n >= min(p):

n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))

return n

This matches the approach I just described.

Hence, it should be correct.

In the main function, it reads t test cases, each with k, q, a, and q values of n.

It computes func_1 for each n and collects the results.

Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Seems correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\texttt{Correctness: True}}
