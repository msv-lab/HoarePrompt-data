Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, possibly rotating them. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

First, I need to understand what it means to cut the rectangle. Since the cut must be parallel to one of the sides, that means either parallel to the length or the width. So, for a rectangle of size a by b, if I cut parallel to the length, I'm cutting along the width, and vice versa.

Let's consider an example. Take a 2x6 rectangle. If I cut it parallel to the length (let's say cutting the width), I can cut it into two parts, each of size 2x3. Then, from these two 2x3 rectangles, I can arrange them differently to form a new rectangle. For instance, placing them side by side to make a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

Another example is a 2x1 rectangle. If I cut it parallel to the length, I get two 2x0.5 rectangles, but since the problem specifies integer sides, 0.5 isn't allowed. So, maybe I need to consider only cuts that result in integer dimensions. Wait, the problem says the sides must be integers, so I can only make cuts that result in integer dimensions.

So, for a 2x1 rectangle, possible cuts are:

- Cutting parallel to the length: cut the width (1) into two integers. But 1 can only be cut into 1 and 0, but 0 isn't allowed, or maybe I can't cut it that way.

- Cutting parallel to the width: cut the length (2) into two integers, say 1 and 1. So, I get two 1x1 rectangles. Then, from two 1x1 rectangles, I can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as 1x2. Since 1x2 is the same as 2x1, and it's the same as the original 2x1 after rotation, it doesn't count as a different rectangle.

So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

Another example is a 2x2 square. If I cut it parallel to the length, say cut the width (2) into 1 and 1, I get two 2x1 rectangles. Then, from two 2x1 rectangles, I can place them side by side to make a 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

Wait, but in the note, it says that from 2x2, I can cut into two 1x2 rectangles and form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

So, in general, I need to see if, after cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, I can arrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering rotations.

I need to find a general condition for any a and b.

Let's think about the total area. The area of the original rectangle is a*b. After cutting into two rectangles, the total area remains the same, so the new rectangle must also have area a*b.

So, any possible new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c*d = a*b, and c and d are integers.

Also, since rotations are considered the same, I can assume that c <= d.

Now, I need to check if there exists a pair (c, d) != (a, b) (up to rotation) such that c*d = a*b, and I can form this rectangle from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle.

But, I need to consider how the cutting and rearrangement works.

Let's consider the cutting process:

- If I cut parallel to the length, I'm cutting the width into two parts.

- If I cut parallel to the width, I'm cutting the length into two parts.

In either case, I get two smaller rectangles.

Then, I can arrange these two rectangles in different ways to form a new rectangle.

I need to see if there's any way to arrange them to form a rectangle that is different from the original one.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles, say of sizes a1 x b1 and a2 x b2, and a1*x b1 + a2*x b2 = c*x d, where c*d = a*b.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the perimeters or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical condition that can be derived.

Let me look for a pattern in the examples provided.

From the sample input and output:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Looking for a pattern:

- For 1x1: Can't be cut into two smaller integer-sided rectangles.

- For 2x1: Can be cut into two 1x1, but can only form 1x2, which is the same as original.

- For 2x6: Can be cut into two 2x3, and form 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

- For 3x2: Can be cut into two 3x1, and form 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

- For 2x2: Can be cut into two 1x2, and form 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

- For 2x4: Can be cut into two 2x2, and form 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

- For 6x3: Can be cut into two 3x3, and forming a new rectangle, but in this case, it seems not possible to form a different one.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for 6x3 it's "No".

Wait, but why is that? If I cut a 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles, then I can arrange them to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original when rotated.

Alternatively, if I cut it differently, say cutting the length: cut the 6 into 4 and 2, getting two rectangles of 4x3 and 2x3. Then, arranging them differently, say placing them side by side to make a 4+2=6 by 3, which is the same as original.

Alternatively, cutting the width: cut the 3 into 1 and 2, getting two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2. Then, arranging them differently, say placing them vertically to make a (6+6)=12 by 1 or 2, but that would be 12x1 or 12x2, which might be different from the original 6x3.

Wait, but 12x1 is different from 6x3.

So, why is the sample output "No" for 6x3?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in the case of 6x3 and 3x6, they are considered the same.

But in the 6x3 case, if I cut it into 6x1 and 6x2, and arrange them to make a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3 and 3x6, so it should be "Yes".

But the sample output is "No", so maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must be different from the original one, and in some cases, it's not possible to form a different one.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, if I cut it into 6x1 and 6x2, and arrange them to make a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3 and 3x6, so it should be "Yes".

But the sample output is "No", so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have integer sides, and in some cases, it's not possible to form a new rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original one.

Alternatively, maybe there's a condition based on the parity of a and b.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Looking for a pattern:

In the "Yes" cases:

- 2x6 can be cut into two 2x3 and formed into 4x3.

- 3x2 can be cut into two 3x1 and formed into 1x6.

- 2x2 can be cut into two 1x2 and formed into 1x4.

- 2x4 can be cut into two 2x2 and formed into 1x8.

In the "No" cases:

- 1x1: Can't be cut into two smaller integer-sided rectangles.

- 2x1: Can be cut into two 1x1, but can only form 1x2, which is the same as original.

- 6x3: Cutting into 6x1 and 6x2, can form 12x1, which is different, but sample output is "No".

Wait, maybe there's a condition based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

Let's compute GCD(a, b):

- 1x1: GCD=1

- 2x1: GCD=1

- 2x6: GCD=2

- 3x2: GCD=1

- 2x2: GCD=2

- 2x4: GCD=2

- 6x3: GCD=3

In the "Yes" cases, GCD is either 1 or 2.

In the "No" cases, GCD is 1 or 3.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on whether a or b is even.

Looking at the "Yes" cases:

- 2x6: a=2 (even), b=6 (even)

- 3x2: a=3 (odd), b=2 (even)

- 2x2: a=2 (even), b=2 (even)

- 2x4: a=2 (even), b=4 (even)

- 6x3: a=6 (even), b=3 (odd) -> but sample output is "No"

Wait, in the "Yes" cases, at least one of a or b is even.

In the "No" cases, both a and b are odd.

Wait, but in the sample input 6x3, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and output is "No".

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's whether both a and b are odd.

In the "No" cases:

- 1x1: both odd

- 2x1: one even, one odd

- 6x3: one even, one odd

In the "Yes" cases:

- 2x6: both even

- 3x2: one odd, one even

- 2x2: both even

- 2x4: both even

Wait, seems like whenever at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for 2x1 and 6x3.

Wait, 2x1 is "No", even though a=2 is even.

Similarly, 6x3 is "No", even though a=6 is even.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's whether both a and b are odd or both are even.

In the "Yes" cases:

- 2x6: both even

- 3x2: one odd, one even

- 2x2: both even

- 2x4: both even

In the "No" cases:

- 1x1: both odd

- 2x1: one even, one odd

- 6x3: one even, one odd

Wait, seems like when at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for some cases like 2x1 and 6x3.

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 is even, but output is "No".

Similarly, in 6x3, a=6 is even, but output is "No".

So, maybe it's "Yes" only when both a and b are even.

In that case:

- 2x6: both even -> "Yes"

- 3x2: one odd, one even -> "Yes"

- 2x2: both even -> "Yes"

- 2x4: both even -> "Yes"

- 1x1: both odd -> "No"

- 2x1: one even, one odd -> "No"

- 6x3: one even, one odd -> "No"

Wait, but in the sample input, 3x2 and 6x3 are different: 3x2 is "Yes", 6x3 is "No", even though both have one even and one odd dimension.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on whether a*b is even.

But in all cases where a or b is even, a*b is even, and when both are odd, a*b is odd.

But in the sample input, 2x1 has a*b=2, which is even, but output is "No".

Similarly, 6x3 has a*b=18, which is even, but output is "No".

So, that doesn't seem to be the deciding factor.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If I can form a new rectangle with different dimensions, but the same area, then the aspect ratio would be different.

But the problem considers rotations as the same, so I need to consider rectangles up to rotation.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a*b is a perfect square.

If a*b is a perfect square, then the rectangle can be rearranged into a square, which is the same as itself rotated.

But in the sample input, 2x6 has a*b=12, which is not a perfect square.

Similarly, 3x2 has a*b=6, not a perfect square.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a*b has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors.

No, that seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look at the possible cuts.

When I cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, I have to consider both possible cutting directions.

First, cutting parallel to the length:

- Cut the width into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b.

- Then, the two smaller rectangles are a x b1 and a x b2.

Second, cutting parallel to the width:

- Cut the length into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a.

- Then, the two smaller rectangles are a1 x b and a2 x b.

Then, from these two smaller rectangles, I need to arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle can be formed by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one above the other.

For example:

- If I have two rectangles of a x b1 and a x b2, I can place them side by side to form a rectangle of a x (b1 + b2) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- Or, I can place them one above the other to form a rectangle of (a + a) x max(b1, b2), which might be different.

Wait, but max(b1, b2) could be b, depending on how I cut.

This seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after cutting, I can rearrange the pieces in any way, as long as they form a rectangle.

Given that, perhaps the key is whether I can rearrange the pieces to form a rectangle with different aspect ratio from the original.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a divides b or b divides a.

In the sample input:

- 1x1: a=1, b=1 -> a divides b, b divides a -> "No"

- 2x1: a=2, b=1 -> a divides b? No, b divides a? Yes -> "No"

- 2x6: a=2, b=6 -> a divides b? Yes, b divides a? No -> "Yes"

- 3x2: a=3, b=2 -> a divides b? No, b divides a? No -> "Yes"

- 2x2: a=2, b=2 -> a divides b, b divides a -> "Yes"

- 2x4: a=2, b=4 -> a divides b? Yes, b divides a? No -> "Yes"

- 6x3: a=6, b=3 -> a divides b? No, b divides a? Yes -> "No"

Hmm, seems like when a divides b or b divides a, it's "Yes", except for 2x1 and 1x1.

Wait, 2x1: b divides a, but output is "No"

2x6: a divides b, output is "Yes"

3x2: neither divides, output is "Yes"

2x2: a divides b and b divides a, output is "Yes"

2x4: a divides b, output is "Yes"

6x3: b divides a, output is "No"

1x1: a divides b and b divides a, output is "No"

So, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" when a divides b or b divides a, and a != b.

In that case:

- 2x6: a divides b, a != b -> "Yes"

- 3x2: neither divides -> "Yes" (wait, no)

Wait, no, 3x2: neither divides, but output is "Yes"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" when a != b.

But in the sample input, 2x2 is "Yes", even though a = b.

Wait, no, in the sample input, 2x2 is "Yes".

Wait, in the note, it says that from 2x2, you can cut into two 1x2 and form a 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

So, in this case, a = b, but you can form a different rectangle.

So, a != b is not a necessary condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's always "Yes" except when a = b = 1.

But in the sample input, 1x1 is "No", and 2x2 is "Yes".

So, that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" when either a or b is even.

In the sample input:

- 1x1: both odd -> "No"

- 2x1: a even, b odd -> "No"

- 2x6: a even, b even -> "Yes"

- 3x2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

- 2x2: both even -> "Yes"

- 2x4: both even -> "Yes"

- 6x3: a even, b odd -> "No"

So, it seems that if at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for 2x1 and 6x3, where one is even and the other is odd, but output is "No".

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 is even, b=1 is odd, output is "No"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

In 2x6, a=2 even, b=6 even, output is "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

In 2x2, both even, output is "Yes"

In 2x4, both even, output is "Yes"

So, seems like when both a and b are even, it's "Yes"

When one is even and one is odd, it's "Yes" only if a divides b or b divides a.

Wait, but in 2x1, a divides b, but output is "No"

In 2x6, a divides b, output is "Yes"

In 6x3, b divides a, output is "No"

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" when both a and b are even, or when one divides the other.

But in the sample input, 2x1: a divides b, but output is "No"

2x6: a divides b, output is "Yes"

6x3: b divides a, output is "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" when both a and b are even, or when a divides b and a < b.

In 2x1: a divides b, but a = 2, b = 1, a > b, so "No"

In 2x6: a divides b, a = 2, b = 6, a < b, so "Yes"

In 6x3: b divides a, a = 6, b = 3, a > b, so "No"

In 3x2: neither a divides b nor b divides a, but output is "Yes" because both are even.

Wait, no, 3 is odd, 2 is even.

Wait, 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" when at least one of a or b is even, except for the cases where a=2 and b=1, or a=1 and b=1.

But in the sample input, 2x1 is "No", 1x1 is "No", 2x6 is "Yes", 3x2 is "Yes", 2x2 is "Yes", 2x4 is "Yes", 6x3 is "No"

So, seems like when at least one is even, it's "Yes", except for 2x1 and 6x3.

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 even, b=1 odd, output is "No"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

In 2x6, a=2 even, b=6 even, output is "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

In 2x2, both even, output is "Yes"

In 2x4, both even, output is "Yes"

So, seems like when at least one is even, it's "Yes", except when a is even, b is odd, and a is divisible by b.

Wait, in 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd, and a is divisible by b (2 divisible by 1), output is "No"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, and a is divisible by b (6 divisible by 3), output is "No"

In 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even, a divides b (2 divides 6), output is "Yes"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, a does not divide b (3 does not divide 2), b divides a (2 does not divide 3), output is "Yes"

Wait, 3 does not divide 2, and 2 does not divide 3.

Wait, 3x2: a=3, b=2; 3 does not divide 2, 2 does not divide 3, output is "Yes"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one of a or b is even, and a does not divide b and b does not divide a.

But in 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even, a divides b, output is "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, a divides b, output is "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to think about the greatest common divisor again.

If I compute GCD(a, b), then a/GCD and b/GCD are co-prime.

Then, perhaps if a/GCD or b/GCD is even, it's "Yes", else "No".

Wait, let's try:

For 2x6: GCD=2, a/GCD=1, b/GCD=3; a/GCD=1 is odd, b/GCD=3 is odd -> both are odd, so "Yes"? Wait, sample output is "Yes"

For 3x2: GCD=1, a/GCD=3, b/GCD=2; a/GCD=3 odd, b/GCD=2 even -> one is even, so "Yes"

For 2x1: GCD=1, a/GCD=2, b/GCD=1; a/GCD=2 even, b/GCD=1 odd -> "No"

For 6x3: GCD=3, a/GCD=2, b/GCD=1; a/GCD=2 even, b/GCD=1 odd -> "No"

For 2x2: GCD=2, a/GCD=1, b/GCD=1; both odd, so "Yes"

For 2x4: GCD=2, a/GCD=1, b/GCD=2; a/GCD=1 odd, b/GCD=2 even -> "Yes"

For 1x1: GCD=1, a/GCD=1, b/GCD=1; both odd, so "Yes"? Wait, sample output is "No"

Hmm, doesn't match for 1x1.

So, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one of a/GCD or b/GCD is even, or both are odd and a != b.

In 1x1: both a/GCD and b/GCD are 1, which are odd and a = b, so "No"

In 2x1: a/GCD=2 even, b/GCD=1 odd -> "No"

In 2x6: a/GCD=1 odd, b/GCD=3 odd, but a != b -> "Yes"

In 3x2: a/GCD=3 odd, b/GCD=2 even -> "Yes"

In 2x2: a/GCD=1 odd, b/GCD=1 odd, but a = b -> "Yes" (wait, sample output is "Yes")

Wait, but in the sample input, 1x1 is "No", which matches this condition.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" when at least one of a/GCD or b/GCD is even, or both are odd and a != b.

In 1x1: both odd, a = b -> "No"

In 2x1: a/GCD even, b/GCD odd -> "No"

In 2x6: a/GCD odd, b/GCD odd, a != b -> "Yes"

In 3x2: a/GCD odd, b/GCD even -> "Yes"

In 2x2: a/GCD odd, b/GCD odd, a = b -> "Yes"

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x2 is "Yes", but according to this condition, it should be "No" because both a/GCD and b/GCD are odd and a = b.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one of a/GCD or b/GCD is even, or a != b.

In that case:

- 1x1: a = b, both odd -> "Yes"

Wait, but sample output is "No"

Hmm, doesn't match.

I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, I need to have a way to arrange the two pieces such that their combined area forms a rectangle with different dimensions from the original, up to rotation.

Given that, perhaps it's about whether the original rectangle can be divided into two rectangles in such a way that their dimensions allow forming a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the original rectangle has an even side.

Wait, in the sample input, 2x1 has an even side, but output is "No"

Similarly, 6x3 has an even side, output is "No"

Wait, no, 6x3 has a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

2x6 has a=2 even, b=6 even, output is "Yes"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" only when both sides are even.

But in the sample input, 3x2 has a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" when at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd, and 2 is a multiple of 1, output is "No"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, and 3 is not a multiple of 2, output is "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, and 6 is a multiple of 3, output is "No"

In 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even, and 2 divides 6, output is "Yes"

Wait, but in 2x6, a=2 divides b=6, but output is "Yes"

In 6x3, b=3 divides a=6, output is "No"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd, and 2 is a multiple of 1 -> "No"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, and 3 is not a multiple of 2 -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, and 6 is a multiple of 3 -> "No"

In 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even, and 2 divides 6 -> "Yes"

Wait, but in 2x6, a=2 divides b=6, but output is "Yes"

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" when at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it, unless both are even and one divides the other.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Perhaps I should look for a mathematical condition.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two pieces must be arrangeable in a way that their combined dimensions form a new rectangle with different aspect ratio.

Given that, perhaps it's about whether the area can be factored into two different pairs of integers.

Wait, the area is a*b.

To form a new rectangle with different dimensions, I need to find c and d such that c*d = a*b, and (c,d) != (a,b) up to rotation.

But I need to ensure that such c and d can be formed from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle.

So, perhaps I need to see if there exists a way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then arrange them to form a rectangle with dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b and (c,d) != (a,b) up to rotation.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle.

First, cutting parallel to the length:

- Cut the width b into b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b.

- Then, the two pieces are a x b1 and a x b2.

- To form a new rectangle, I can place them side by side along their lengths or widths.

- If I place them side by side along their lengths, I get a rectangle of size a x (b1 + b2) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- If I place them one above the other, I get a rectangle of size (a + a) x max(b1, b2), but that might not be a valid rectangle because max(b1, b2) could be b, which would make it 2a x b, which is different from the original only if 2a != b and b != 2a.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2x6, cutting into two 2x3 pieces and forming a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, placing two 2x3 rectangles side by side to make 4x3.

Similarly, in 3x2, cutting into two 3x1 and forming a 1x6 rectangle by placing them in some way.

Wait, but how do you get from two 3x1 rectangles to a 1x6 rectangle? By placing them end to end to make a 3x2, which is the same as the original.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about tiling the new rectangle with the two pieces.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the two pieces can be arranged without overlapping to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two pieces must share a common side with the new rectangle.

Wait, perhaps it's about the perimeter or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the parity of the area.

Wait, the area is a*b.

In the "Yes" cases, a*b is even, which it is in all the sample inputs except 1x1.

But in the sample input, 2x1 has a*b even, but output is "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a*b is divisible by 4.

In the sample input:

- 1x1: 1, not divisible by 4 -> "No"

- 2x1: 2, not divisible by 4 -> "No"

- 2x6: 12, divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 3x2: 6, not divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 2x2: 4, divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 2x4: 8, divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 6x3: 18, not divisible by 4 -> "No"

So, when a*b is divisible by 4, it's "Yes", except for 3x2 where a*b=6 is not divisible by 4, but output is "Yes"

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 4.

In 2x6: a=2 not divisible by 4, b=6 not divisible by 4, output is "Yes"

In 3x2: a=3 not divisible by 4, b=2 not divisible by 4, output is "Yes"

In 2x2: a=2 not divisible by 4, b=2 not divisible by 4, output is "Yes"

In 2x4: a=2 not divisible by 4, b=4 divisible by 4, output is "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 not divisible by 4, b=3 not divisible by 4, output is "No"

In 2x1: a=2 not divisible by 4, b=1 not divisible by 4, output is "No"

In 1x1: neither divisible by 4, output is "No"

So, seems like when at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for 2x1 and 6x3.

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 is even, but output is "No"

In 6x3, a=6 is even, but output is "No"

In 2x6, a=2 is even, output is "Yes"

In 3x2, b=2 is even, output is "Yes"

In 2x2, both even, output is "Yes"

In 2x4, both even, output is "Yes"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one of a or b is even, except when a=2 and b is odd.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 2x3: a=2 even, b=3 odd -> "No" (though 2x3 is not in sample input)

In 2x4: a=2 even, b=4 even -> "Yes"

In 4x2: same as above

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" when at least one of a or b is even, and the other is not 1.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 2x3: a=2 even, b=3 odd -> "Yes" (assuming)

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

Wait, doesn't hold for 6x3.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" when at least one of a or b is even, and neither a nor b is 1.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even -> "Yes"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 2x2: a=2 even, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 2x4: a=2 even, b=4 even -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

In 1x1: a=1 odd, b=1 odd -> "No"

So, this matches the sample input.

Hence, the condition is: "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and neither a nor b is 1; else "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 has a=2 even and b=1 odd -> "No"

All other cases where at least one is even and neither is 1, it's "Yes"

So, perhaps the condition is: "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and b > 1, a > 1.

In the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')



This checks if at least one of a or b is even, and prints "Yes" if so, else "No"

But according to the sample input, for 2x1, which should be "No", but according to this program, it would print "Yes" because a=2 is even.

But in the sample input, 2x1 is "No"

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 is "No", but according to this condition, it should be "Yes"

So, perhaps there's something wrong with this condition.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, and a and b are not both odd.

But in the sample input, 2x1 is "No", which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if both a and b are even, or one is even and the other is greater than 1.

In 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even -> "Yes"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 2x2: a=2 even, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 2x4: a=2 even, b=4 even -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

In 1x1: a=1 odd, b=1 odd -> "No"

So, the condition is: "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and b >1, and a >1.

In code, it would be:

if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) and a >1 and b >1:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')



But in the provided program, it's:

if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')



So, it's missing the condition that a and b must be greater than 1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the correct condition is: "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and both a and b are greater than 1; else "No"

In that case, the program should be:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) and a >1 and b >1:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')



But the given program doesn't have the conditions a >1 and b >1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 has a=2 even, b=1 odd, and output is "No"

According to the given program, it would print "Yes", which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting his original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces.
   - We need to determine if the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are considered the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The key is to check if at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) is even, and both dimensions are greater than 1.
   - If these conditions are met, it is possible to cut and rearrange the rectangle to form a different one.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, read the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Check if at least one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even and both are greater than 1.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) and a > 1 and b > 1:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-step Reasoning**:
  - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, read the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
  - Check if at least one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even and both are greater than 1.
  - If the conditions are met, it is possible to form a different rectangle; hence, print "Yes".
  - If not, print "No".

- **Correctness**:
  - The condition ensures that the rectangle can
