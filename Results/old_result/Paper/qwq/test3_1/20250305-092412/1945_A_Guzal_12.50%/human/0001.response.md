Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people. There are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent. Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people. Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, we should return -1.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what they imply.

Let's denote:

- a: number of introverts

- b: number of extroverts

- c: number of universals

Since introverts need their own tents, the number of tents required for them is simply a.

For extroverts, each tent must have exactly three people, and at least one of them is an extrovert. So, each tent that includes extroverts must have:

- 1 extrovert + 2 universals

- 2 extroverts + 1 universal

- 3 extroverts

But wait, extroverts want to be with two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people, and at least one is an extrovert.

Universals can fill in the remaining spots in these tents.

Additionally, any remaining universals can be placed in tents together, as long as there are no more than 3 per tent.

So, the total number of tents needed would be the sum of tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts and universals.

But we need to minimize the number of tents, so we should maximize the number of people per tent where possible.

Let me think about how to allocate the extroverts and universals.

First, allocate all introverts their own tents: that's a tents.

Then, for the extroverts and universals, we need to form groups of three, where each group includes at least one extrovert.

Let's consider the number of extroverts, b, and universals, c.

We need to form groups of three containing at least one extrovert.

Let's see how many such groups we can form.

If b >= 3, we can have groups with 3 extroverts.

If b == 2, we can have a group with 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

If b == 1, we need 2 universals to form a group with that extrovert.

Any remaining universals can be placed in tents of up to 3 each.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is ceil((b + c)/3).

But we have to ensure that in each tent with extroverts, there is at least one extrovert.

Wait, but if we have tents with only universals, that's fine, as long as all extroverts are in tents with at least one extrovert and exactly three people.

So, perhaps it's better to first assign all extroverts to tents, ensuring each tent has at least one extrovert, and then assign universals to fill up the tents or create their own tents if needed.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

First, we need to form tents for extroverts, each tent having exactly one or more extroverts, but each tent must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

Wait, the problem says that each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, for each extrovert, they must be in a tent with exactly two others.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b/2), because each tent can take up to two extroverts.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a tent has one extrovert, it must have exactly two others, meaning two universals.

If a tent has two extroverts, it must have one universal.

If a tent has three extroverts, it's allowed, as long as it's exactly three people.

So, in general, for extroverts, we need to group them into tents of three people, each tent having at least one extrovert.

But since each tent must have exactly three people, and extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, and universals can be in any tent configuration.

So, perhaps the best way is to maximize the number of tents that include extroverts, each containing as many extroverts as possible, up to three.

Wait, but the condition is that each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, the tents can be:

- 1 extrovert + 2 universals

- 2 extroverts + 1 universal

- 3 extroverts

And tents with only universals can have 1, 2, or 3 universals.

Our aim is to minimize the total number of tents.

So, to minimize tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, up to three.

So, let's calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals together.

First, we can try to form as many tents as possible with 3 extroverts.

The number of such tents is floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts are b % 3.

If b % 3 == 1, we need to pair this single extrovert with two universals.

If b % 3 == 2, we need to pair these two extroverts with one universal.

So, for the remaining extroverts, we need additional tents.

Specifically:

- If b % 3 == 0: number of tents for extroverts is floor(b / 3)

- If b % 3 == 1: number of tents for extroverts is floor(b / 3) + 1

- If b % 3 == 2: number of tents for extroverts is floor(b / 3) + 1

In other words, ceil(b / 2)

Wait, no.

Wait, if b % 3 == 0: floor(b / 3)

If b % 3 == 1: floor(b / 3) + 1

If b % 3 == 2: floor(b / 3) + 1

So, ceil(b / 3 * 1), but since b / 3 may not be integer, it's better to use ceil(b / 3)

But in programming, we can calculate ceil without using ceil function by using (b + 2) // 3

So, the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3)

Then, after allocating these tents for extroverts, we have c - (number of universals used) left.

In the tents with extroverts, the number of universals used is:

- For each tent with 3 extroverts: 0 universals

- For each tent with 2 extroverts: 1 universal

- For each tent with 1 extrovert: 2 universals

So, if we have floor(b / 3) tents with 3 extroverts, then b % 3 tents with either 1 or 2 extroverts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of universals required for the extrovert tents.

Let me try to find a formula.

Total number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3)

Letâ€™s denote t = ceil(b / 3)

Then, the number of universals required for these tents is:

- For each tent with 3 extroverts: 0 universals

- For each tent with 2 extroverts: 1 universal

- For each tent with 1 extrovert: 2 universals

We need to find how many of each type of tent we have.

Letâ€™s find:

- Number of tents with 3 extroverts: floor(b / 3)

- Number of tents with 2 extroverts: floor((b - 3 * floor(b / 3)) / 2)

- Number of tents with 1 extrovert: b - 3 * floor(b / 3) - 2 * floor((b - 3 * floor(b / 3)) / 2)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in ceil(b / 3) tents, we can have:

- As many tents as possible with 3 extroverts

- Then, if b % 3 == 1, one tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals

- If b % 3 == 2, one tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal

So, the number of universals required is:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 universals

- If b % 3 == 1: 2 universals

- If b % 3 == 2: 1 universal

So, universals required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

Wait, in programming terms, it's:

universals_required = (b % 3 == 1) * 2 + (b % 3 == 2)

But in math terms, it's:

universals_required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

Wait, more accurately:

universals_required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

So, if b % 3 == 0: 0

if b % 3 == 1: 2

if b % 3 == 2: 1

Then, the remaining universals are c - universals_required

These remaining universals can be placed in tents of up to 3 each.

The number of additional tents needed for remaining universals is ceil((c - universals_required) / 3)

So, total tents = a (for introverts) + ceil(b / 3) (for extroverts) + ceil((c - universals_required) / 3)

But we need to make sure that c - universals_required >= 0

If c - universals_required < 0, it's impossible, so we return -1

So, the algorithm is:

1. Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: a

2. Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts: ceil(b / 3)

3. Calculate the number of universals required for extrovert tents: 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

4. Calculate the remaining universals: c - universals_required

5. If remaining universals < 0, return -1

6. Otherwise, calculate the number of tents needed for remaining universals: ceil(remaining_universals / 3)

7. Total tents = a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(remaining_universals / 3)

But wait, in the problem, it's mentioned that each tent must have exactly three people if it contains an extrovert.

But for universals, they can be in tents with 1, 2, or 3 universals.

But to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of people per tent.

So, we should fill the tents with as many people as possible.

Wait, but the constraint is that tents with extroverts must have exactly three people.

Tents without extroverts can have 1, 2, or 3 universals.

So, the tents for extroverts must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

The tents for universals can have up to three universals.

Our aim is to minimize the total number of tents.

So, we need to maximize the number of extroverts per tent, up to three, and minimize the number of tents for universals.

Wait, but extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, and universals can be in any size tent.

So, perhaps the formula I have earlier is correct.

Let me see an example.

Take the first test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

Tents for introverts: 1

Tents for extroverts: ceil(2 / 3) = 1

Universals required: 1 (since b % 3 == 2)

Remaining universals: 3 - 1 = 2

Tents for remaining universals: ceil(2 / 3) = 1

Total tents: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

Tents for introverts: 1

Tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2

Universals required: 2 * (4 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (4 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2

But c = 1 < 2, so impossible, output -1, which matches the sample.

Seems correct.

But wait, in the second test case, b = 4, b % 3 = 1, so universals_required = 2

But c = 1 < 2, so impossible.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

Tents for introverts: 1

Tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2

Universals required: 2 * (4 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (4 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2

Remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

Total tents: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

Tents for introverts: 1

Tents for extroverts: ceil(1 / 3) = 1

Universals required: 2 * (1 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (1 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2

Remaining universals: 1 - 2 = -1 < 0, impossible, output -1, matches sample.

Seems consistent.

So, the formula is:

tents = a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(max(c - universals_required, 0) / 3)

with universals_required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

If c < universals_required, output -1

But in programming, to compute ceil(x / 3), we can use (x + 2) // 3

Similarly, ceil(b / 3) = (b + 2) // 3

So, in code, it's straightforward.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

In my reasoning, the condition for impossibility is c < universals_required, where universals_required is 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

But in the given code, the condition for impossibility is:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0

This seems different.

Also, the calculation of k is k += a + (b + c) // 3, and if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k += 1

This seems like it's trying to calculate ceil(a + (b + c) / 3), but that's not what we need.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it's a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(max(c - universals_required, 0) / 3)

But in the given code, it's a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

This seems too simplistic and might not account for the universals_required correctly.

Let me check with the sample inputs.

First test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (2 % 3 != 0 and 3 < 3) -> (True and False) -> False

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (5) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, False and True -> False

So, it doesn't print -1

Then, k = 1 + (2 + 3) // 3 = 1 + 5 // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2

Then, since (5) % 3 != 0, k += 1 -> k = 3

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (4 % 3 != 0 and 1 < 3) -> (True and True) -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (5) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Which matches the sample.

Third test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (4 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> (True and True) -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (6) % 3 != 0 -> False

So, True and False -> False

Then, k = 1 + (4 + 2) // 3 = 1 + 6 // 3 = 1 + 2 = 3

Then, since (6) % 3 == 0, don't add 1

So, k = 3, which matches the sample.

Fourth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (1 % 3 != 0 and 1 < 3) -> (True and True) -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (2) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Which matches the sample.

Fifth test case:

a = 1, b = 3, c = 2

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (3 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> (False and True) -> False

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (5) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, False and True -> False

Then, k = 1 + (3 + 2) // 3 = 1 + 5 // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2

Then, since (5) % 3 != 0, k += 1 -> k = 3

But according to my earlier reasoning:

tents for introverts: 1

tents for extroverts: ceil(3 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 2 * (3 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (3 % 3 == 2) = 0

remaining universals: 2 - 0 = 2

tents for remaining universals: ceil(2 / 3) = 1

total tents: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Which matches.

So, perhaps the given code is correct.

But I'm still a bit uneasy because I don't fully understand why their condition works.

Let me try to understand their condition:

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

Else, calculate k = a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

So, they are treating b and c together, summing them up and dividing by 3.

But in my earlier reasoning, I separated the universals required for extroverts and then calculated remaining universals separately.

However, in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Let me think of a case where this might fail.

Suppose a = 0, b = 2, c = 1

According to my reasoning:

tents for introverts: 0

tents for extroverts: ceil(2 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 1 (since b % 3 == 2)

remaining universals: 1 - 1 = 0

total tents: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

According to the given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (2 % 3 != 0 and 1 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (3) % 3 != 0 -> False

So, True and False -> False

Then, k = 0 + (2 + 1) // 3 = 0 + 1 = 1

Since (3) % 3 == 0, don't add 1

So, k = 1, which matches my reasoning.

Another case: a = 0, b = 1, c = 2

My reasoning:

tents for introverts: 0

tents for extroverts: ceil(1 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 2 (since b % 3 == 1)

remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

total tents: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (1 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (3) % 3 != 0 -> False

So, True and False -> False

Then, k = 0 + (1 + 2) // 3 = 1

Since (3) % 3 == 0, don't add 1

k = 1, matches my reasoning.

Another case: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1

My reasoning:

tents for introverts: 0

tents for extroverts: ceil(1 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 2

remaining universals: 1 - 2 = -1 < 0, impossible -> -1

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (1 % 3 != 0 and 1 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (2) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Correct.

Another case: a = 0, b = 2, c = 0

My reasoning:

tents for introverts: 0

tents for extroverts: ceil(2 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 1

remaining universals: 0 - 1 = -1 < 0, impossible -> -1

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (2 % 3 != 0 and 0 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (2) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Correct.

Another case: a = 0, b = 4, c = 2

My reasoning:

tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2

universals_required = 2 (since b % 3 == 1)

remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

total tents: 0 + 2 + 0 = 2

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (4 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (6) % 3 != 0 -> False

So, True and False -> False

Then, k = 0 + (4 + 2) // 3 = 2

Since (6) % 3 == 0, don't add 1

k = 2, correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, it should be a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - universals_required) / 3)

But in this code, it's a + (b + c) // 3 + ((b + c) % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0)

Which seems to be working correctly in all the cases I've tested.

Is there a case where this would fail?

Let me think of larger numbers.

a = 0, b = 5, c = 2

My reasoning:

tents for extroverts: ceil(5 / 3) = 2

universals_required = 2 * (5 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (5 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 2 + 1 * 0 = 2

remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

total tents: 0 + 2 + 0 = 2

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (5 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> (True and True) -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (7) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Wait, but according to my reasoning, it should be possible, but the code says -1.

Wait, maybe my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, b = 5, c = 2

tents for extroverts: ceil(5 / 3) = 2

universals_required = 2 * (5 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (5 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 2 + 1 * 0 = 2

remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

So, total tents: 0 + 2 + 0 = 2

But according to the code, since (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

(5 % 3 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (7) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

This suggests that the code thinks it's impossible, but according to my reasoning, it's possible.

So, perhaps the code is wrong in this case.

Wait, maybe my reasoning is incorrect.

Let's think again.

For b = 5, we have floor(5 / 3) = 1 tent with 3 extroverts, and 2 extroverts left.

For the remaining 2 extroverts, we need to have a tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

But c = 2, so we have 2 universals.

So, we use 1 universal for the tent with 2 extroverts, and have 1 universal left.

But according to my earlier formula, universals_required = 2 * (5 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (5 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 2 + 0 = 2

Wait, but 5 % 3 == 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, 5 % 3 = 2

So, universals_required = 2 * (False) + 1 * (True) = 0 + 1 = 1

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

universals_required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

For b = 5, b % 3 == 2, so universals_required = 1

remaining universals = 2 - 1 = 1

Then, tents for remaining universals: ceil(1 / 3) = 1

Total tents: 0 + 2 + 1 = 3

But earlier, I thought it was 2, but actually it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct my formula.

Wait, for b = 5:

- One tent with 3 extroverts

- One tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal

- Remaining universals: 2 - 1 = 1

- Tent for remaining universals: 1

Total tents: 3

But according to the code:

k = 0 + (5 + 2) // 3 = 0 + 7 // 3 = 2

Since (7) % 3 != 0, k += 1 -> k = 3

Which matches my corrected reasoning.

But in the earlier case, I mistakenly calculated universals_required as 2 for b = 5, but it should be 1.

So, my formula was wrong.

Correct formula for universals_required is:

universals_required = 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

For b = 5, b % 3 = 2, so universals_required = 1

remaining universals = c - universals_required = 2 - 1 = 1

tents for remaining universals = ceil(1 / 3) = 1

total tents = 0 + ceil(5 / 3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

Given code:

k = 0 + (5 + 2) // 3 = 2

since (7) % 3 != 0, k += 1 -> k = 3

Which matches.

So, perhaps their formula is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier example, I thought it was incorrect, but actually, I miscalculated universals_required.

So, perhaps their formula works.

Let me see another example.

a = 0, b = 4, c = 1

According to my reasoning:

tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2

universals_required = 2 * (4 % 3 == 1) + 1 * (4 % 3 == 2) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2

remaining universals = 1 - 2 = -1 < 0 -> impossible -> -1

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (4 % 3 != 0 and 1 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> (5) % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

Correct.

Another example:

a = 0, b = 3, c = 0

My reasoning:

tents for extroverts: ceil(3 / 3) = 1

universals_required = 0

remaining universals: 0 - 0 = 0

total tents: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (0 and 0 < 3) -> False and True -> False

and (3 + 0) % 3 != 0 -> 0 != 0 -> False

So, False and False -> False

Then, k = 0 + (3 + 0) // 3 = 1

Since (3) % 3 == 0, don't add 1

k = 1, correct.

Seems consistent.

Another example:

a = 0, b = 0, c = 5

My reasoning:

tents for introverts: 0

tents for extroverts: ceil(0 / 3) = 0

universals_required = 0

remaining universals: 5 - 0 = 5

tents for remaining universals: ceil(5 / 3) = 2

total tents: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Given code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (0 % 3 != 0 and 5 < 3) -> (False and False) -> False

Then, k = 0 + (0 + 5) // 3 = 1

Since (5) % 3 != 0, k += 1 -> k = 2

Correct.

Seems like their formula works.

But why does it work?

Let me try to understand their condition:

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

Else:

k = a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

I think what they're doing is considering that b and c can be combined and divided by 3 to form tents, but with some constraints.

The condition (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0 seems to be checking if there are leftover extroverts that can't be accommodated with the available universals.

But honestly, I don't fully understand why this condition works in general.

In the earlier example where b = 5, c = 2:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) -> (2 != 0 and 2 < 3) -> True and True -> True

and (b + c) % 3 != 0 -> 7 % 3 != 0 -> True

So, True and True -> True -> print(-1)

But according to my corrected reasoning, it should be possible, with 3 tents.

Wait, but in my corrected reasoning, universals_required = 1, remaining universals = 1, total tents = 3

But according to the code, it prints -1

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe my reasoning is wrong.

Let's think again.

For b = 5, c = 2:

tents for extroverts:

- One tent with 3 extroverts

- One tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal

universals_required = 1

remaining universals = 2 - 1 = 1

tents for remaining universals: ceil(1 / 3) = 1

total tents: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, it should be possible.

But according to the code, it prints -1, which is incorrect.

So, in this case, the given code is wrong.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seemed to work.

But in this specific case, it fails.

So, the answer is Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants with different preferences for the hike, ensuring that all preferences are satisfied.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Preferences**:
   - **Introverts** need their own tent.
   - **Extroverts** must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - **Universals** can be in any tent configuration.

2. **Tent Allocation**:
   - Each tent can hold up to three people.
   - Tents with extroverts must have exactly three people, including at least one extrovert.

3. **Calculating Tents**:
   - Calculate tents needed for introverts: `a` tents.
   - Calculate tents needed for extroverts and universals:
     - Determine the number of tents required for extroverts: `ceil(b / 3)`.
     - Calculate the universals required to fulfill extroverts' tents.
     - Ensure there are enough universals to satisfy extroverts' preferences.
     - Calculate additional tents needed for remaining universals.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Check if it is impossible to accommodate all participants with their preferences.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[idx])
        b = int(data[idx+1])
        c = int(data[idx+2])
        idx += 3
        if b == 0:
            tents = a + ((c + 2) // 3)
            print(tents)
            continue
        if c < (2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)):
            print(-1)
            continue
        tents = a + ((b + c) // 3)
        if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            tents += 1
        print(tents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - If there are no extroverts (`b == 0`), calculate the tents needed for introverts and universals directly.
   - Check if the number of universals is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of extroverts.
   - Calculate the total number of tents required and output the result.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution handles large inputs efficiently by reading all data at once and processing each test case in constant time.
   - This approach ensures that the program runs within acceptable time limits for large input sizes.

### Correctness

- **Introverts** are always allocated their own tents.
- **Extroverts** are grouped in tents of three, with the necessary universals to fill the tents.
- **Universals** are used to fulfill the requirements of extroverts first and then accommodated in their own tents.
- The program checks for impossibility by ensuring there are enough universals to satisfy extroverts' preferences.
