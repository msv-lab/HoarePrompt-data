Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have participants going on a hike, and we need to calculate the minimum number of tents required. Each tent can hold up to 3 people. There are three types of participants:

1. **Introverts (a):** Each wants to be alone in a tent, so each introvert requires exactly one tent.

2. **Extroverts (b):** Each wants to be in a tent with exactly two other people, so each extrovert must be in a tent with two others.

3. **Universals (c):** They are flexible and can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

Our task is to fulfill everyone's preferences and find the minimum number of tents needed. If it's impossible, we should output -1.

First, let's understand the constraints and what needs to be done.

- Each introvert needs their own tent, so we can immediately allocate 'a' tents for them.

- Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, for 'b' extroverts, we need to have tents that have exactly three people, including the extrovert and two others.

- Universals are flexible and can fill in wherever needed.

Our goal is to minimize the number of tents, so we should try to maximize the number of people in each tent, especially for the extroverts and universals.

Let's think about how to allocate the universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

Each extrovert needs two others in their tent. So, for 'b' extroverts, we need a total of 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

But, these 'others' can be either universals or other extroverts.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem says each extrovert wants to be in a tent with two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people: the extrovert and two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each with exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

But, if we have multiple extroverts, we can put them in separate tents, each with two universals, for example.

Alternatively, we can have tents with one extrovert and two universals, or one extrovert and one extrovert and one universal, etc., as long as each extrovert's tent has exactly three people.

Wait, no. If we have a tent with two extroverts, that would mean each extrovert in that tent wants two others, so the tent must have exactly three people.

But if we have two extroverts in a tent, then there must be exactly three people, meaning one extrovert and two others, or two extroverts and one other.

Wait, but if we have two extroverts in a tent, do they both get what they want?

Let's clarify:

- Each extrovert wants to be in a tent with exactly two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people, including themselves.

So, if two extroverts are in the same tent, then there must be exactly one other person in that tent to make it three people.

Similarly, if we have one extrovert in a tent, they need exactly two others with them.

So, to satisfy 'b' extroverts, we need to have 'b' tents, each containing exactly one extrovert and two others.

Now, the question is, how do we allocate the universals to these tents?

The universals can be used to fill in the 'others' in the extroverts' tents.

Let's denote the number of extroverts as 'b'.

Each extrovert needs exactly two others in their tent.

So, total 'others' needed for extroverts are 2*b.

These 'others' can be either universals or other extroverts.

Wait, no. If we have multiple extroverts in the same tent, we need to make sure that each extrovert in that tent has exactly two others.

Wait, actually, if we have a tent with one extrovert and two universals, that satisfies the extrovert's preference.

Alternatively, if we have a tent with two extroverts and one universal, does that satisfy both extroverts?

Wait, no. Because each extrovert wants exactly two others in the tent.

In a tent with two extroverts and one universal, each extrovert has only one other extrovert and one universal, which is two others. So, that works.

So, both configurations are possible:

1. One extrovert + two universals.

2. Two extroverts + one universal.

We need to choose the configuration that minimizes the number of tents.

Additionally, any remaining universals can be placed in tents alone or with others, as per their flexibility.

Now, let's think about how to minimize the number of tents.

We already have 'a' tents for introverts.

For the extroverts and universals, we need to see how to group them into tents of up to three people, ensuring that each extrovert is in a tent with exactly three people.

Wait, no. The tents can have up to three people, but for extroverts, their tent must have exactly three people.

So, for the extroverts, we need to have 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

But, these 'b' tents are already accounted for, each containing one extrovert and two others.

Then, any remaining universals can be placed in additional tents, either alone or with others, as long as the tent doesn't exceed three people.

Wait, but we need to minimize the number of tents, so we should maximize the number of people in each tent.

So, first, allocate 'a' tents for introverts.

Then, allocate 'b' tents for extroverts, each with one extrovert and two others.

The 'others' are universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but if we have multiple extroverts, we can put two extroverts in one tent with one universal.

This way, we satisfy two extroverts with one tent.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents that contain two extroverts and one universal.

Let's calculate how many such tents we can have.

Let's denote the number of tents with two extroverts and one universal as 'x'.

Then, the number of extroverts used is 2*x.

The number of universals used is x.

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 2*x.

The remaining universals are c - x.

Now, for the remaining extroverts, we need to put them in tents with one extrovert and two universals.

So, the number of such tents is (b - 2*x) tents, each containing one extrovert and two universals.

For these tents, we need 2*(b - 2*x) universals.

So, the total universals used would be x (from the first type of tents) plus 2*(b - 2*x).

So, total universals used: x + 2*(b - 2*x) = x + 2*b - 4*x = 2*b - 3*x.

And the remaining universals are c - (2*b - 3*x).

Now, we need to choose 'x' such that:

1. 2*x <= b (since we can't have more extroverts than available).

2. 2*b - 3*x <= c (since we can't use more universals than available).

Our goal is to maximize 'x' to minimize the number of tents.

Wait, no. Actually, for each tent with two extroverts and one universal, we use x tents.

Then, the number of tents with one extrovert and two universals is (b - 2*x).

So, total tents for extroverts are x + (b - 2*x) = b - x.

Plus the 'a' tents for introverts.

So, total tents are a + b - x.

We want to minimize this, which means maximizing 'x'.

So, we need to maximize 'x' subject to:

- x <= floor(b / 2)

- 2*b - 3*x <= c

Let's solve for the maximum 'x':

x <= floor(b / 2)

and

x >= ceil((2*b - c)/3)

Wait, 2*b - 3*x <= c => -3*x <= c - 2*b => x >= (2*b - c)/3

Since x must be an integer, x >= ceil((2*b - c)/3)

So, x should be in the range:

ceil((2*b - c)/3) <= x <= floor(b / 2)

If this range is non-empty, then we can choose x to be the maximum possible in this range to minimize the number of tents.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Finally, after allocating the extroverts and universals, any remaining universals can be placed in additional tents, either alone, with one other, or with two others, depending on availability.

But to minimize the number of tents, we should pack as many universals as possible into each tent, up to three per tent.

So, the remaining universals after allocating to extroverts' tents would be c - (2*b - 3*x).

Then, the number of additional tents needed for these remaining universals is ceil((c - (2*b - 3*x))/3)

But since we want to minimize the total number of tents, we should maximize 'x' to minimize b - x, and then see the remaining universals.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

This seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to look at it.

Let's consider that each extrovert needs a tent with exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each with one extrovert and two others.

These 'others' can be universals or other extroverts.

But if we have multiple extroverts in one tent, say three extroverts in one tent, that would satisfy the condition for all three extroverts, as each would have exactly two others in the tent.

Wait, but the problem allows up to three people in a tent.

So, we can have tents with:

- One introvert (alone)

- One extrovert and two others (universals or extroverts)

- Universals: can be alone, with one other, or with two others.

Our goal is to minimize the number of tents.

So, to minimize tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts sharing tents with other extroverts.

Let's consider grouping extroverts in tents of three extroverts per tent.

Each such tent satisfies three extroverts, using one tent.

Then, the number of such tents is floor(b / 3).

Remaining extroverts: b % 3.

If b % 3 == 0, then we have exactly floor(b / 3) tents for extroverts.

If b % 3 == 1, then we have floor(b / 3) tents for three extroverts, and one extrovert left, who needs a tent with two others.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, then floor(b / 3) tents for three extroverts, and two extroverts left, who can share a tent with one universal.

Wait, but each extrovert must have exactly two others in their tent.

So, if b % 3 == 1, we can't just have one extrovert left; we need to pair them with two others.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, we need to have two extroverts with one universal.

But, we have universals who can be in tents with one or two others.

So, for b extroverts, we need ceil(b / 3) tents.

Each tent can have up to three people, including extroverts and universals.

But, to satisfy extroverts, each tent with extroverts must have exactly three people.

So, for ceil(b / 3) tents, each must have exactly three people: one or more extroverts and the rest universals to make up to three people per tent.

Wait, no. If we have a tent with three extroverts, that satisfies all three extroverts.

If we have a tent with two extroverts and one universal, that satisfies both extroverts.

If we have a tent with one extrovert and two universals, that satisfies the extrovert.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

Additionally, we have 'a' introverts, each needing their own tent.

Then, the remaining universals after satisfying the extroverts' tents can be placed in additional tents, up to three per tent.

So, total tents would be:

tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts + tents_for_remaining_universals

Where:

tents_for_introverts = a

tents_for_extroverts = ceil(b / 3)

remaining_universals = c - (number of universals used in extroverts' tents)

We need to calculate the number of universals used in extroverts' tents.

In each tent for extroverts:

- If the tent has three extroverts, it uses zero universals.

- If the tent has two extroverts and one universal, it uses one universal.

- If the tent has one extrovert and two universals, it uses two universals.

So, the total number of universals used depends on how we distribute the extroverts into tents.

To minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then tents with two extroverts and one universal, and minimize the tents with one extrovert and two universals.

Because, for each tent with three extroverts, we use zero universals.

For tent with two extroverts and one universal, we use one universal.

For tent with one extrovert and two universals, we use two universals.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then with two extroverts and one universal, and minimize the tents with one extrovert and two universals.

Let's formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Number of tents with three extroverts: x

- Number of tents with two extroverts and one universal: y

- Number of tents with one extrovert and two universals: z

Then:

3x + 2y + z = b (total extroverts)

y + 2z = c (total universals used)

We need to minimize the number of tents: x + y + z + a

Subject to:

x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0

And x, y, z are integers.

Our goal is to minimize x + y + z + a, given a, b, c.

But this seems complicated.

An easier approach might be:

- Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts: ceil(b / 3)

- Calculate the number of universals needed to fill these tents.

- Then, calculate the remaining universals and how many additional tents are needed for them.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of people that need to be accommodated in tents with extroverts.

Total extroverts: b

Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.

So, total people needed in extroverts' tents: 3*b

But, extroverts are already counted in this total.

So, the number of additional people needed is 2*b.

These additional people can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts can't be counted as additional people for other extroverts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of tents required for extroverts, considering that each tent can hold up to three people.

Wait, no. Each tent for extroverts must have exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need ceil(b / 1) tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

But that would be b tents, which is not efficient.

Wait, that can't be right.

Let me think differently.

If we have tents that hold three people, and each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others, then the tent must have exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need at least ceil(b / 1) tents, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Each tent can hold up to three people, but for extroverts, their tent must have exactly three people.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need at least ceil(b / 1) tents, but that's not optimal.

Wait, perhaps we can have tents with three extroverts, which would satisfy three extroverts at once.

Or tents with two extroverts and one universal.

Or tents with one extrovert and two universals.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Number of tents with three extroverts: x

- Number of tents with two extroverts and one universal: y

- Number of tents with one extrovert and two universals: z

Then:

3x + 2y + z = b (total extroverts)

y + 2z = c (total universals used)

We need to minimize x + y + z + a (total tents)

Subject to:

x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0

And x, y, z are integers.

We need to find non-negative integers x, y, z that satisfy these equations.

Let’s try to solve for y and z in terms of x.

From the first equation:

z = b - 3x - 2y

Substitute into the second equation:

y + 2*(b - 3x - 2y) = c

y + 2b - 6x - 4y = c

-3y = c - 2b + 6x

y = (2b - c - 6x)/3

Since y must be non-negative integer, (2b - c - 6x) must be divisible by 3 and non-negative.

Also, z = b - 3x - 2y must be non-negative.

Our goal is to maximize x to minimize the total number of tents.

Let’s consider x ranging from 0 to floor(b / 3)

For each x, check if y is integer and non-negative, and then check if z is non-negative.

Find the maximum x such that y is integer and non-negative, and z is non-negative.

If such an x exists, then the total tents are a + x + y + z

Otherwise, it's impossible.

This seems too complicated for implementation.

Perhaps there is a simpler way.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

This seems to suggest that the number of tents is a + ceil((b + c)/3)

But with some conditions.

Wait, perhaps the logic is that the extroverts and universals are combined and divided into groups of three, and introverts get their own tents.

But, extroverts need to be in tents with exactly three people, including themselves.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents with exactly three people each.

But, if we have 'b' tents for extroverts, each with three people, that would require 3*b people in total for extroverts' tents.

But, the extroverts are already counted in these tents, so we need 2*b additional people (universals or extroverts) to fill these tents.

Wait, no. Each extrovert tent has one extrovert and two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each requiring two additional people.

Thus, total additional people needed: 2*b

These additional people can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts need their own tent with exactly three people, including themselves.

So, extroverts can't be used as the 'additional people' for other extroverts' tents.

Wait, actually, if we have a tent with two extroverts and one universal, then each of those two extroverts has their tent with exactly three people.

So, extroverts can share tents with other extroverts.

So, in that case, for a tent with two extroverts and one universal, we are satisfying two extroverts with one tent.

Similarly, a tent with three extroverts satisfies three extroverts.

A tent with one extrovert and two universals satisfies one extrovert.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then with two extroverts and one universal, and minimize the tents with one extrovert and two universals.

Let’s define:

- Number of tents with three extroverts: x

- Number of tents with two extroverts and one universal: y

- Number of tents with one extrovert and two universals: z

Then:

3x + 2y + z = b (total extroverts)

y + 2z = c (total universals used)

We need to minimize x + y + z + a (total tents)

Our aim is to maximize x, then y, to minimize the total number of tents.

Let’s solve for y and z in terms of x.

From the first equation:

z = b - 3x - 2y

Substitute into the second equation:

y + 2*(b - 3x - 2y) = c

y + 2b - 6x - 4y = c

-3y = c - 2b + 6x

y = (2b - c - 6x)/3

For y to be integer and non-negative:

2b - c - 6x must be divisible by 3 and >=0

So, 2b - c - 6x >=0 and divisible by 3

Also, z = b - 3x - 2y = b - 3x - 2*(2b - c - 6x)/3

Simplify z:

z = b - 3x - (4b - 2c - 12x)/3

z = (3b - 9x - 4b + 2c + 12x)/3

z = (-b - 9x + 2c + 12x)/3

z = (-b + 2c + 3x)/3

For z to be non-negative:

(-b + 2c + 3x)/3 >=0

=> -b + 2c + 3x >=0

=> 3x >= b - 2c

=> x >= ceil((b - 2c)/3)

Also, x <= floor(b / 3)

So, x must be in the range:

ceil((b - 2c)/3) <= x <= floor(b / 3)

And 2b - c - 6x must be divisible by 3 and >=0

This seems too complicated.

Perhaps there is a better way.

Let’s consider that for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each with exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

So, total people needed: 3*b

But, extroverts are 'b' people, so additional people needed: 3*b - b = 2*b

These additional people must be universals.

So, we need at least 2*b universals.

But, in reality, universals can be shared among tents.

Wait, no. If we have tents with two extroverts and one universal, then for each such tent, we use one universal.

Similarly, for tents with one extrovert and two universals, we use two universals.

So, the total universals used is y + 2*z.

From earlier:

y = (2b - c - 6x)/3

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps another approach.

Let’s consider that the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of grouping extroverts.

If we group three extroverts in one tent, we satisfy three extroverts with one tent and use zero universals.

If we group two extroverts and one universal in a tent, we satisfy two extroverts with one tent and use one universal.

If we group one extrovert and two universals in a tent, we satisfy one extrovert with one tent and use two universals.

Our aim is to minimize the number of tents, so we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then with two extroverts and one universal, and minimize the tents with one extrovert and two universals.

Let’s denote the number of tents with three extroverts as x.

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3x.

These remaining extroverts must be placed in tents with two extroverts and one universal or one extrovert and two universals.

If b - 3x >= 0:

- If b - 3x is even, we can have (b - 3x)/2 tents with two extroverts and one universal.

- If b - 3x is odd, we can have (b - 3x - 1)/2 tents with two extroverts and one universal, and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

But, we need to ensure that we have enough universals.

Let’s calculate the number of universals used:

- For x tents with three extroverts: 0 universals

- For y tents with two extroverts and one universal: y universals

- For z tents with one extrovert and two universals: 2z universals

Total universals used: y + 2z

We need y + 2z <= c

Also, y = (b - 3x)/2 if b - 3x is even, else y = floor((b - 3x -1)/2)

And z = 0 if b - 3x is even, else z = 1

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate x from floor(b / 3) downto 0, and find the minimal x + y + z such that y + 2z <= c.

This seems too time-consuming for large b.

Given that a, b, c can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way.

Perhaps we can model this as linear programming, but that's not feasible for large inputs.

Let’s consider that the minimal number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3)

And the number of universals used is y + 2z, where y and z are determined by x.

This seems too convoluted.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

This suggests that the number of tents is a + ceil((b + c)/3)

But with some conditions.

Let’s verify this with the first test case:

1 2 3

a=1, b=2, c=3

ceil((2+3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

1 4 1

a=1, b=4, c=1

ceil((4+1)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3, but sample output is -1

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, the code seems to have some additional conditions.

Looking at the code:

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

In the second test case: a=1, b=4, c=1

b % 3 = 1 != 0, and c=1 < 3 → condition1: True

(b + c) % 3 = 5 % 3 = 2 != 0 → condition2: True

So, condition1 and condition2 are both True, so print -1, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third test case: a=1, b=4, c=2

b % 3 = 1 != 0, c=2 < 3 → condition1: True

(b + c) % 3 = 6 % 3 = 0 → condition2: False

So, condition1 and condition2: True and False = False

So, proceed to calculate k = a + floor((b + c)/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

Since (b + c) % 3 != 0 is False, no additional tent is needed.

So, total tents: 3, but according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, but in the second test case, with a=1, b=4, c=1, the output is -1, which matches the code.

So, perhaps this code is correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, a=1, b=4, c=1

According to the code:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0 → (1 !=0 and 1<3) and (5%3 !=0) → True and True → True, so print -1, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case: a=1, b=4, c=2

(b % 3 !=0 and c <3) and (b + c) % 3 !=0 → (1!=0 and 2<3) and (6%3 !=0) → True and False → False, so proceed to calculate k = 1 + floor(6/3) = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to understand why this condition works.

Let’s try to understand the condition:

if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

So, the condition for impossibility is:

(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0

What does this mean?

Let’s think about b and c in terms of groups of 3.

We need to accommodate b extroverts, each requiring a tent with exactly three people.

We can group extroverts into tents of three extroverts, using no universals.

Or, group two extroverts with one universal.

Or, group one extrovert with two universals.

Our aim is to minimize the number of tents, so we prefer to have as many tents with three extroverts as possible.

Let’s define:

Number of tents with three extroverts: x

Number of tents with two extroverts and one universal: y

Number of tents with one extrovert and two universals: z

Then:

3x + 2y + z = b

y + 2z = c

We need to minimize x + y + z + a

Our aim is to maximize x to minimize the total number of tents.

Let’s solve for y and z in terms of x.

From the first equation:

z = b - 3x - 2y

Substitute into the second equation:

y + 2*(b - 3x - 2y) = c

y + 2b - 6x - 4y = c

-3y = c - 2b + 6x

y = (2b - c - 6x)/3

For y to be integer and non-negative:

2b - c - 6x >=0 and divisible by 3

Also, z = b - 3x - 2y = b - 3x - 2*(2b - c - 6x)/3

Simplify z:

z = b - 3x - (4b - 2c - 12x)/3

z = (3b - 9x - 4b + 2c + 12x)/3

z = (-b + 2c + 3x)/3

For z to be non-negative:

- b + 2c + 3x >=0

=> 3x >= b - 2c

=> x >= ceil((b - 2c)/3)

Also, x <= floor(b / 3)

So, x must be in the range:

ceil((b - 2c)/3) <= x <= floor(b / 3)

And y = (2b - c - 6x)/3 must be non-negative
