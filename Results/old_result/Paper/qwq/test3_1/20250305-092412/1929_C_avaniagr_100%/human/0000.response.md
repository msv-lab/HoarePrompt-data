Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to earn a lot of money by going to a casino, but he has some constraints. The casino has specific rules for betting, and there's a promotion where he can't lose more than a certain number of times in a row. I need to figure out if, given these rules, Sasha can guarantee that he can reach any amount of money he desires through his betting strategy.

First, I need to understand the betting rules clearly. If Sasha bets y coins and wins, he gets y * k coins in return. So, his coins increase by y * (k - 1). If he loses, he loses y coins. Importantly, y has to be a positive integer and cannot exceed his current number of coins.

Also, there's this promotion: he can't lose more than x times in a row. That means after x consecutive losses, he has to win at least once. This seems like a crucial constraint because losing too many times in a row can deplete his coins quickly.

My task is to determine, for given values of k, x, and a (the initial number of coins), whether Sasha can have a betting strategy that guarantees he can reach any desired number of coins n, no matter the sequence of wins and losses that doesn't violate the rules.

Looking at the sample input and output, it seems that sometimes the answer is "YES" and sometimes "NO", depending on the values of k, x, and a.

I need to think about how Sasha can increase his coins indefinitely. To do that, he needs to have a strategy where, even in the worst-case scenario of losses, he doesn't run out of coins and can continue betting until he eventually wins enough to surpass any n.

One approach is to consider the maximum number of consecutive losses he can have, which is x. So, in the worst case, he can lose x times in a row before he has to win at least once.

I need to ensure that after x losses, he still has enough coins to continue betting in a way that can grow his total to at least n.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a formula that can determine whether a given a, k, and x can lead to any n.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

- For k=2, x=1, a=7: YES

- For k=2, x=1, a=1: NO

- For k=2, x=3, a=15: YES

- For k=3, x=3, a=6: NO

- For k=4, x=4, a=5: NO

- For k=5, x=4, a=7: YES

- For k=4, x=88, a=1000000000: NO

- For k=25, x=69, a=231: NO

- For k=13, x=97, a=18806: NO

I need to find a pattern or condition that matches these results.

Let me try to think about the relationship between k, x, and a.

First, for k=2:

- When k=2, doubling the bet on win.

- For x=1, a=7: YES

- For x=1, a=1: NO

- For x=3, a=15: YES

Perhaps for k=2, a needs to be greater than or equal to x + something.

Similarly, for k=3, x=3, a=6: NO

For k=5, x=4, a=7: YES

It's not immediately clear.

Let me see if I can derive a general condition.

I recall that in some betting strategies, like the martingale system, you double your bet after every loss, so you can recoup previous losses with one win. But here, k might not be 2, and x limits the number of consecutive losses.

Maybe I need to calculate the minimum a required based on k and x.

Let me consider the worst-case scenario: Sasha loses x times in a row, and then has to win at least once.

After x losses, his coins would have decreased by the sum of the bets he made in those x losses.

I need to ensure that after x losses, he still has enough coins to continue betting in a way that can grow to n.

But to guarantee reaching any n, he needs to have a strategy where, no matter how many times he loses up to x in a row, he can always recover and grow to n.

This seems complex. Maybe I should look for a mathematical condition that ensures a can cover the losses up to x times.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote the initial amount as a.

Let’s say he bets b1, and loses. Now he has a - b1.

Then he bets b2, and loses. Now he has a - b1 - b2.

This continues up to x losses: a - b1 - b2 - ... - bx.

After x losses, he must have at least enough coins to make a bet that, if wins, allows him to continue.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider the total amount he can lose in x consecutive losses.

Let’s denote the maximum amount he can lose in x consecutive losses as L.

Then, a must be greater than L to ensure he can continue betting after x losses.

But I need to find a condition that guarantees he can reach any n.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that after x losses, he still has enough to make a bet that, when won, more than compensates for the losses.

Let’s think about it differently.

Suppose Sasha has a initial coins.

He makes a series of bets, and in the worst case, he loses x times in a row.

After x losses, he has a - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx).

To continue, he needs to have enough coins left to make another bet.

But to guarantee reaching any n, he needs to have a strategy where, eventually, he can win enough to surpass n.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a condition where a is greater than some function of k and x.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

For k=2, x=1, a=7: YES

For k=2, x=1, a=1: NO

For k=2, x=3, a=15: YES

For k=3, x=3, a=6: NO

For k=4, x=4, a=5: NO

For k=5, x=4, a=7: YES

For k=4, x=88, a=1000000000: NO

For k=25, x=69, a=231: NO

For k=13, x=97, a=18806: NO

I need to find a pattern.

Let me see:

For k=2:

- x=1: a >= x + 1 (1 + 1 = 2) but sample has a=7: YES, a=1: NO

Wait, 1 < 2, so NO; 7 >= 2, YES.

For k=2, x=3: a >= 3 + 1 = 4, but sample has a=15: YES.

Wait, 15 >= 4, YES.

For k=3, x=3: a >= 3 + 1 = 4, but sample has a=6: NO.

Wait, 6 >= 4, but NO.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right condition.

Wait, perhaps for k=2, it's a >= x + 1, but for k > 2, it's different.

Looking at k=5, x=4, a=7: YES

If it were a >= x + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, and 7 >= 5, YES.

But for k=4, x=4, a=5: NO

If it were a >= x + 1 = 5, then a=5 should be YES, but sample is NO.

Wait, maybe it's a >= x + 1 for k=2, but different for k > 2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a >= x + (k - 1)

For k=2, x=1: a >= 1 + 1 = 2

For k=2, x=3: a >= 3 + 1 = 4

For k=3, x=3: a >= 3 + 2 = 5, but a=6: NO, which doesn't match.

Wait, a=6 >=5, but output is NO.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider more factors.

Let me think about the total amount that can be lost in x consecutive losses.

If each bet is b, then total loss is b * x.

But bets can be different each time.

Sasha can choose how much to bet each time, as long as it's a positive integer not exceeding his current coins.

So, to maximize the chance of reaching n, he should choose bet amounts strategically.

Perhaps he should bet minimally to stay in the game as long as possible.

Alternatively, bet more to grow faster.

But since he wants to guarantee reaching n for any n, he needs a strategy that ensures he can always continue betting despite losses.

So, perhaps he needs to have enough initial coins to withstand x consecutive losses, no matter how much he bets each time.

But he can choose his bet amounts strategically to minimize the risk.

Wait, maybe he should bet the minimal possible amount each time to maximize his longevity.

If he bets 1 each time, then after x losses, he loses x coins.

So, if he starts with a coins, after x losses, he has a - x coins left.

To continue betting, he needs a - x >=1.

But to guarantee reaching any n, he needs to be able to keep betting and eventually grow to n.

But with k=2, if he wins, he gets his bet doubled.

So, if he bets 1 and wins, he gains 1 coin.

This seems too slow to reach large n.

But if he bets more, he can gain more when he wins.

However, he risks losing more when he loses.

Given that he can't lose more than x times in a row, he needs to manage his bets so that after x losses, he still has enough to make meaningful bets.

This seems like a delicate balance.

Maybe I should consider the minimal a required based on k and x.

Let me try to find a formula.

Suppose he bets b1, b2, ..., bx and then has to win.

After x losses, he has a - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx).

Then, he wins a bet of y, and gets y * k.

So, his new total is a - (b1 + ... + bx) - y + y * k = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + y * (k - 1)

To maximize the growth, he should choose y as large as possible, but he needs to ensure that a - (b1 + ... + bx) >= y.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the worst-case scenario where he loses x times in a row, and then wins once.

After x losses, he has a - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx).

Then, he bets y and wins, getting y * k.

So, his new total is a - (b1 + ... + bx) - y + y * k = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + y * (k - 1)

To maximize this, he should choose y as large as possible, but y <= a - (b1 + ... + bx)

So, y_max = a - (b1 + ... + bx)

Then, new total = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + (a - (b1 + ... + bx)) * (k - 1) = a - (b1 + ... + bx) * k

Wait, simplifying:

new_total = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + (a - (b1 + ... + bx)) * (k - 1) = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + a*(k - 1) - (b1 + ... + bx)*(k - 1) = a * k - (b1 + ... + bx) * k

Wait, that seems off.

Let me recalculate.

He has a - (b1 + ... + bx) coins left after x losses.

Then he bets y <= a - (b1 + ... + bx), and wins, getting y * k.

So, his new total is a - (b1 + ... + bx) - y + y * k = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + y * (k - 1)

But y <= a - (b1 + ... + bx), so y can be up to a - (b1 + ... + bx).

Therefore, y_max = a - (b1 + ... + bx), and new_total = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + (a - (b1 + ... + bx)) * (k - 1) = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + a*(k - 1) - (b1 + ... + bx)*(k - 1) = a * k - (b1 + ... + bx) * k

Wait, that doesn't make sense because his total can't exceed a * k without considering the bets.

I must have messed up the calculation.

Let me think differently.

Suppose he bets b1, loses; bets b2, loses; ...; bets bx, loses; then bets y and wins.

So, his coins after x losses: a - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx)

Then, after winning the bet of y, he gets y * k, so his new total is a - (b1 + ... + bx) - y + y * k = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + y * (k - 1)

To maximize the new total, he should choose y as large as possible, which is y = a - (b1 + ... + bx), so new_total = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + (a - (b1 + ... + bx)) * (k - 1) = a * k - (b1 + ... + bx) * k

But this seems incorrect because it suggests his total is a * k - (b1 + ... + bx) * k, which depends on the bets he chose.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that the maximum amount he can lose in x consecutive losses is the sum of his bets, which he can control.

He needs to choose bets such that after x losses, he still has enough to make a meaningful bet that can grow his total significantly.

This seems too vague. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in some betting strategies, like the martingale system, you double your bet after each loss so that when you win, you recover your losses plus a profit.

But here, k might not be 2, and x limits the number of consecutive losses.

So, maybe I can adapt that idea.

Suppose Sasha bets b1, and if he loses, he bets b2, and so on up to bx, and then he has to win.

The total amount lost in x losses is b1 + b2 + ... + bx.

After x losses, he bets y and wins, getting y * k.

So, his net gain is y * (k - 1) - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx)

To make this strategy effective, he needs y * (k - 1) to be greater than the total losses plus some amount to grow towards n.

But this still doesn't give me a clear condition on a, k, and x.

Maybe I need to consider that the sum of the bets up to x losses should be less than a, and that after x losses and one win, he can make progress.

But I need to ensure that he can repeat this process indefinitely to reach any n.

This seems too abstract. Perhaps I should look for a mathematical condition or formula that relates a, k, and x.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, maybe there's a pattern based on k and x.

For k=2 and x=1, a=7: YES

For k=2 and x=1, a=1: NO

For k=2 and x=3, a=15: YES

For k=3 and x=3, a=6: NO

For k=4 and x=4, a=5: NO

For k=5 and x=4, a=7: YES

For k=4 and x=88, a=1000000000: NO

For k=25 and x=69, a=231: NO

For k=13 and x=97, a=18806: NO

I need to find a condition that matches these results.

Let me consider that for k=2, a needs to be greater than x + something.

In the first case, x=1, a=7: YES, which is a > x +1 =2, since 7>2.

Second case, x=1, a=1:1 not >2, so NO.

Third case, x=3, a=15:15 >3+1=4, YES.

For k=3 and x=3, a=6:6 >=3+1=4, but output is NO.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe for k=2, a needs to be greater than 2^x or something.

For x=1, 2^1=2, so a=7>2, YES; a=1<2, NO.

For x=3, 2^3=8, but a=15>8, YES.

But for k=3, x=3, a=6: 3^3=27, 6<27, NO.

But in the sample, for k=5, x=4, a=7:5^4=625, 7<625, but output is YES.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the sum of a geometric series.

For example, for k=2 and x=1, the sum is 1 + 2 =3, but a=7>3, YES.

For k=2 and x=3, sum is 1 + 2 + 4 =7, a=15>7, YES.

For k=3 and x=3, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 =13, a=6<13, NO.

Wait, but in the sample, for k=3, x=3, a=6: NO

But according to this, sum is 13, a=6<13, correctly NO.

For k=5, x=4, sum is 1 +5 +25 +125=156, a=7<156, but sample output is YES.

Wait, that contradicts.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal a required differently.

Let me think about it in terms of the maximal possible loss.

If Sasha can lose up to x times in a row, the maximal amount he can lose is the sum of his bets in those x losses.

To ensure he can continue, a - (sum of bets in x losses) >=1.

But to guarantee reaching any n, he needs to have a strategy where, after x losses and one win, he can make progress towards n.

Perhaps he needs to have a initial a that is larger than some threshold based on k and x.

Let me try to find a formula for the minimal a required.

Suppose he bets b1, b2, ..., bx, and then wins a bet of y.

After x losses, he has a - (b1 + b2 + ... + bx).

Then, he wins the bet of y, so his new total is a - (b1 + ... + bx) - y + y * k = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + y * (k -1)

To maximize the new total, he should choose y as large as possible, which is y = a - (b1 + ... + bx)

Then, new total = a - (b1 + ... + bx) + (a - (b1 + ... + bx)) * (k -1) = a * k - (b1 + ... + bx) * k

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the sum of the bets in x losses should be less than a, and that after x losses and one win, he can recover and make progress.

But I need a clearer condition.

Let me consider that the sum of the bets in x losses is S, and after x losses, he bets y and wins, getting y * k.

So, his new total is a - S + y * (k -1)

But y <= a - S, so y can be up to a - S.

So, new total is a - S + (a - S) * (k -1) = a * k - S * k

To make progress, a * k - S * k should be greater than a, i.e., a * k - S * k > a

Which simplifies to a * (k -1) > S * k

So, S < a * (k -1) / k

But S is the sum of the bets in x losses.

But bets can be chosen strategically.

Wait, maybe I need to choose bets in a way that minimizes S.

But to minimize S, he should bet the smallest possible amounts.

If he bets 1 each time, S = x, and a * (k -1) / k > x

So, a > x * k / (k -1)

But for k=2, a > x * 2 /1 = 2x

But in the sample, for k=2, x=1, a=7:7>2*1=2, YES

a=1:1<2, NO

For k=2, x=3, a=15:15>6, YES

But for k=3, x=3, a=6:6 > 3*3/2=4.5, which is 6>4.5, but sample is NO

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than some other function.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that after x losses, he has to win at least once.

So, his strategy should ensure that after x losses and one win, he can continue betting in a way that allows him to reach n.

Let me consider that the minimal a required is related to the maximal possible loss plus the minimal bet to make progress.

But I'm still stuck.

Maybe I need to look for a pattern in the sample inputs where the output is YES.

Looking at the sample:

YES for:

- k=2, x=1, a=7

- k=2, x=3, a=15

- k=5, x=4, a=7

NO for:

- k=2, x=1, a=1

- k=3, x=3, a=6

- k=4, x=4, a=5

- k=4, x=88, a=1000000000

- k=25, x=69, a=231

- k=13, x=97, a=18806

Wait, for k=4, x=88, a=1000000000: NO

But a is very large, yet it's NO.

Wait, maybe there's a specific condition where a needs to be greater than some value derived from k and x.

Looking back, perhaps a needs to be greater than or equal to some threshold related to k and x.

Let me consider that a needs to be greater than or equal to x + (k -1)

For k=2, x=1: a >=1 +1=2, which matches a=7>=2, YES; a=1<2, NO

For k=2, x=3: a >=3 +1=4, a=15>=4, YES

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +2=5, a=6>=5, but output is NO

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than x + (k -1)*something.

Looking at k=5, x=4: a >=4 +4=8, but a=7<8, which should be NO, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a needs to be greater than or equal to x + k.

For k=2, x=1: a >=1 +2=3, but a=7>=3, YES; a=1<3, NO

For k=2, x=3: a >=3 +2=5, a=15>=5, YES

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +3=6, a=6>=6, but output is NO

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than x * (k -1)

For k=2, x=1: a >1*1=1, a=7>1, YES; a=1 not >1, NO

For k=2, x=3: a >3*1=3, a=15>3, YES

For k=3, x=3: a >3*2=6, a=6 not >6, NO

For k=5, x=4: a >4*4=16, a=7<16, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider a more complex relationship.

Let me think about it in terms of the maximum possible loss and the recovery.

If Sasha can lose up to x times in a row, he needs to have enough initial coins to withstand those losses and still have enough to make a winning bet that propels him towards n.

Perhaps the minimal a required is related to the sum of a geometric series based on k and x.

For example, for k=2 and x=1, the sum is 1 + 2 =3, but a=7>=3, YES; a=1<3, NO

For k=2 and x=3, sum is 1 + 2 + 4 =7, a=15>=7, YES

For k=3 and x=3, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 =13, a=6<13, NO

For k=5 and x=4, sum is 1 +5 +25 +125=156, a=7<156, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, but in the sample, for k=5, x=4, a=7: output is YES, but according to this sum, a=7<156, which should be NO.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is a >= x * (k -1) +1

For k=2, x=1: a >=1*1 +1=2, matches a=7>=2, YES; a=1<2, NO

For k=2, x=3: a >=3*1 +1=4, a=15>=4, YES

For k=3, x=3: a >=3*2 +1=7, a=6<7, NO

But in the sample, for k=5, x=4: a >=4*4 +1=17, but a=7<17, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's a >= (k -1)^x

For k=2, x=1: a >=1^1=1, but a=7>=1, YES; a=1>=1, YES, but sample is NO for a=1

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than or equal to k^x

For k=2, x=1: a >=2^1=2, matches a=7>=2, YES; a=1<2, NO

For k=2, x=3: a >=8, but a=15>=8, YES

For k=3, x=3: a >=27, a=6<27, NO

But in the sample, for k=5, x=4: a >=625, a=7<625, but sample is YES.

Wait, that contradicts.

I need to find another approach.

Perhaps I should consider that for k=2, a needs to be greater than x +1, for k=3, a needs to be greater than something else, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for k=2, the minimal a is x +1, for k=3, it's x +2, and so on.

For k=2, x=1: a >=1 +1=2, matches sample

For k=2, x=3: a >=3 +1=4, matches sample

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +2=5, but sample is NO for a=6>=5

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than x + (k -1)

For k=2, x=1: a >1 +1=2, matches

For k=2, x=3: a >3 +1=4, matches

For k=3, x=3: a >3 +2=5, a=6>5, but sample is NO

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than or equal to x + k

For k=2, x=1: a >=1 +2=3, a=7>=3, YES; a=1<3, NO

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +3=6, a=6>=6, but sample is NO

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than x * (k -1) +1

For k=2, x=1: a >1*1 +1=2, matches

For k=2, x=3: a >3*1 +1=4, matches

For k=3, x=3: a >3*2 +1=7, a=6<7, NO, matches sample

For k=5, x=4: a >4*4 +1=17, a=7<17, should be NO, but sample is YES.

Wait, that contradicts.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for k=2, a needs to be greater than x +1, for k=3, a needs to be greater than x +2, and so on.

Wait, that seems similar to what I tried before.

For k=2, x=1: a >1 +1=2

For k=3, x=3: a >3 +2=5, but sample is NO for a=6>=5, which suggests that maybe it's a >= x + (k -1), but sample is NO for a=6>=5.

Wait, perhaps a needs to be strictly greater than x + (k -1)

For k=3, x=3: a >3 +2=5, a=6>5, but sample is NO.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than some function that involves k and x in a more complex way.

Let me consider that for k=2, a needs to be greater than 2^x -1

For x=1: a >2 -1=1, matches

For x=3: a >8 -1=7, but a=15>=7, YES

For k=3, x=3: a > (3^(x+1)-1)/(3-1) = (27 -1)/2=13, a=6<13, NO

For k=5, x=4: a > (5^5 -1)/(5 -1)=(3125 -1)/4=781, a=7<781, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series sum: S = (k^x -1)/(k -1)

For k=2, x=1: S=1, a needs to be greater than S, which is a>1, matches

For k=2, x=3: S=7, a>=7, but sample is YES for a=15>=7

For k=3, x=3: S=13, a>=13, but sample is NO for a=6<13

For k=5, x=4: S=156, a=7<156, but sample is YES.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the sample, for k=5, x=4, a=7: output is YES, but according to this, a=7 < S=156, which should be NO.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that for k=2, a needs to be greater than or equal to x +1, for k=3, a needs to be greater than or equal to x +2, and so on.

Wait, for k=2, it's x +1

For k=3, it's x +2

For k=4, it's x +3

And so on.

So, a >= x + (k -1)

For k=2, x=1: a >=1 +1=2, matches

For k=2, x=3: a >=3 +1=4, matches

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +2=5, but sample is NO for a=6>=5, which suggests that maybe it's a >= x + (k -1) +1

For k=3, x=3: a >=3 +2 +1=6, a=6>=6, but sample is NO.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe a needs to be greater than x + (k -1)

For k=3, x=3: a >3 +2=5, a=6>5, but sample is NO.

Wait, that doesn't match.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that if x >= k -1, then a needs to be greater than or equal to x +1, else, it's x + (k -1)

Wait, for k=2, x=1: x=1 >=2-1=1, so a >=1 +1=2, matches

For k=2, x=3: x=3 >=2-1=1, so a >=3 +1=4, matches

For k=3, x=3: x=3 >=3-1=2, so a >=3 +1=4, but sample is NO for a=6>=4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Let me think that if x >=k -1, then a >=x +1, else a >=x + (k -1)

For k=3, x=3: x=3 >=3-1=2, so a >=3 +1=4, but sample is NO for a=6>=4, which suggests this isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe if x <k -1, a >=x + (k -1), else a >=x +1

For k=2, x=1: x=1 <2-1=1? No, 1 not less than 1, so x >=k -1, a >=x +1=2, matches

For k=3, x=3: x=3 >=3-1=2, a >=3 +1=4, but sample is NO for a=6>=4

Wait, that doesn't match.

I need to find a better condition.

Looking back at the sample, perhaps for x >=k -1, a needs to be greater than or equal to x +1, else a >=x + (k -1)

But for k=4, x=4: x=4 >=4-1=3, a >=4 +1=5, sample is NO for a=5>=5, which is NO, but sample is NO.

Wait, but for k=5, x=4: x=4 >=5-1=4, a >=4 +1=5, sample is YES for a=7>=5.

Wait, but according to this, a=5 should be YES, but sample is YES for a=7.

Wait, perhaps it's a >=x +1 + something.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that there's a more complex relationship here and try to find a pattern based on the sample inputs.

Looking at the sample inputs where the output is YES:

- k=2, x=1, a=7

- k=2, x=3, a=15

- k=5, x=4, a=7

And
