Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has a word made up of exactly three lowercase Latin letters. Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, up to 'z' is 26. He encodes the word by summing up these numbers. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24.

But, the problem is that this encoding can be ambiguous because different words can have the same sum. For instance, "ava" also sums to 24. So, the task is, given the sum, to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have produced that sum.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible combinations of three letters that sum to the given number, I need to find the one that would come first in a dictionary. So, the word that starts with the smallest possible letter, and if there's a tie, the second letter is as small as possible, and so on.

Okay, so the input is a number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), and I need to output a string of three lowercase letters that sum to n, and it should be the smallest possible in lex order.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to assign values to three letters, a, b, and c, where each is between 1 and 26, inclusive, and a + b + c = n.

I want to minimize the word in lex order, which means minimizing the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, to minimize the first letter, I should set it to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then minimize the second letter, and so on.

Wait, but I need to consider that the sum of all three should be n.

So, perhaps I can set the first letter to 1, then set the second letter to 1, and set the third letter to n - 2.

But, I need to make sure that n - 2 is between 1 and 26.

Wait, n can be as small as 3 and as large as 78.

So, for n = 3, the only possible word is "aaa".

For n = 24, as in the example, there are multiple possibilities, and I need to choose the smallest one, which is "aav".

Okay, so my initial idea is to set the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and then calculate the third based on the remaining sum.

But, I need to ensure that the third letter doesn't exceed 26.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote the three letters as l1, l2, and l3, where each is between 1 and 26.

I need to minimize l1 first, then l2, then l3, such that l1 + l2 + l3 = n.

So, I can iterate l1 from 1 to 26, and for each l1, iterate l2 from 1 to 26, and set l3 = n - l1 - l2, and check if l3 is between 1 and 26.

But this seems inefficient, especially since t can be up to 100, and n up to 78.

I need a smarter way to do this.

Wait, since I need the lex smallest word, I should minimize l1 first, then l2, then l3.

So, I can set l1 to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then set l2 to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then set l3 to n - 2.

But, I need to make sure that l3 is between 1 and 26.

If n - 2 is less than 1, which can't happen since n is at least 3, or greater than 26, in which case I need to adjust l2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix l1 to the smallest possible value, then fix l2 to the smallest possible value given l1, and then set l3 accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as l1 is minimized, then l2 is minimized given l1, and l3 is then determined.

But, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me look at the example again.

For n = 24, the smallest word is "aav", which corresponds to 1 + 1 + 22 = 24.

Another possibility is "abx", which is 1 + 2 + 21 = 24, but "aav" comes before "abx" lexically.

So, why is "aav" chosen over "abx"?

Because 'a' is smaller than 'b', so the first difference is at the second letter, where 'a' is smaller than 'b'.

Similarly, "aab" would be 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is smaller than "aac", which is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, the output is "aaa", which is 1+1+1=3.

For n=70, it's "rzz", which is 18+26+26=70.

For n=3, "aaa".

For n=55, "czz", which is 3+26+26=55.

For n=48, "auz", which is 1+21+26=48.

Okay, so in "auz", 'a' is the smallest possible first letter for n=48.

If I set l1=1, then l2 can be as small as 1, and l3=46, but 46 is greater than 26, which is invalid.

So, l2 cannot be 1, it has to be higher.

What's the maximum l3 can be is 26, so l2 has to be at least n - l1 - 26.

Wait, perhaps I need to set l3 to 26 first, then set l2 to as small as possible, and l1 accordingly.

Wait, but that might not always give the lex smallest word.

Wait, maybe I need to maximize l3 and l2 to minimize l1 and l2.

No, I think I need to minimize l1 first, then l2, then l3.

Wait, perhaps I can fix l1 to 1, and then set l2 to 1, and see if l3 = n - 2 is ≤ 26.

If yes, then that's the smallest possible.

If not, then increment l2 until l3 ≤ 26.

Wait, but that might not be efficient.

Let me think differently.

To get the lex smallest word, I should minimize the first letter first.

So, set l1 to 1 if possible.

Then, minimize the second letter.

So, set l2 to 1 if possible.

Then, set l3 to n - l1 - l2.

But, only if l3 ≤ 26.

If l3 > 26, then I need to increase l2.

So, in code, it would be:

l1 = 1

l2 = 1

l3 = n - l1 - l2

if l3 > 26:

l2 += 1

l3 = n - l1 - l2

if l3 > 26:

l2 +=1

and so on, until l2 <=26 and l3 <=26.

But this could be time-consuming if n is large.

Wait, perhaps I can compute l2_min and l2_max.

Given l1=1, l2_min = max(1, n - l1 -26), and l2_max = min(26, n - l1 -1).

So, l2 should be in [l2_min, l2_max].

Then, set l2 = l2_min, and l3 = n - l1 - l2.

This should give the smallest possible l2.

Wait, let's try for n=48.

Set l1=1, l2_min = max(1, 48 -1 -26) = max(1,21)=21.

So, set l2=21, l3=48-1-21=26.

So, the word is "auz", which matches the sample input.

Another example, n=70.

Set l1=1, l2_min = max(1,70-1-26)=max(1,43)=43, but 43 >26, which is invalid.

So, l2 cannot be set to 43, which is invalid.

So, in this case, set l1=1 is invalid, need to set l1=2.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=70, it's "rzz", which is 18+26+26=70.

Wait, according to my earlier logic, if l1=1 is invalid, set l1=2.

Wait, but l1=1 is not invalid; it's l2 that cannot be 43.

So, perhaps I need to set l1 to a value where l2_min <=26.

So, l2_min = max(1, n - l1 -26).

I need l2_min <=26.

So, n - l1 -26 <=26.

Wait, n - l1 -26 <=26 implies n - l1 <=52, or l1 >= n -52.

Since l1 >=1, l1 = max(1, n-52).

So, set l1 = max(1, n -52).

Then, set l2 = max(1, n - l1 -26).

Then, l3 = n - l1 - l2.

This should ensure that l3 <=26.

Wait, let's test this for n=48.

l1 = max(1,48-52)=max(1,-4)=1

l2 = max(1,48-1-26)=max(1,21)=21

l3=48-1-21=26, which is valid.

For n=70.

l1=max(1,70-52)=max(1,18)=18

l2=max(1,70-18-26)=max(1,26)=26

l3=70-18-26=26, which is "rzz", matching the sample input.

For n=3.

l1=max(1,3-52)=max(1,-49)=1

l2=max(1,3-1-26)=max(1,-24)=1

l3=3-1-1=1, which is "aaa".

For n=55.

l1=max(1,55-52)=max(1,3)=3

l2=max(1,55-3-26)=max(1,26)=26

l3=55-3-26=26, which is "czz".

For n=48.

l1=1

l2=21

l3=26, which is "auz".

Seems correct.

So, in code, for each test case:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

l1 = max(1, n -52)

l2 = max(1, n - l1 -26)

l3 = n - l1 - l2

print(chr(l1 +96) + chr(l2 +96) + chr(l3 +96))

Wait, but in the given program, it's different.

It's:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for i in range(cases):

arr = []

lex = int(input())

for j in range(2):

if lex <= 26:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex - 1

elif lex < 52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

for k in range(3):

print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, then initializes an empty list arr.

Then, for j in range(2):

if lex <=26:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, appends lex to arr, sorts arr, and prints the corresponding characters.

Wait, let's see for n=24.

arr = []

lex=24

j=0:

lex=24 >=52? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=24-26=-2

j=1:

lex=-2 <26, append 1, lex=-2-1=-3

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(lex=-3), arr=[26,1,-3]

arr.sort() => [-3,1,26]

Then, print chr(-3+96), chr(1+96), chr(26+96)

Which would be chr(93), chr('a'), chr('z')

But chr(93) is '{', which is not a lowercase letter.

This doesn't match the expected output for n=24, which is "aav".

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding the code.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if lex <=26:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, arr.append(lex)

Then, arr.sort()

Then, print the characters corresponding to arr[0], arr[1], arr[2].

Wait, for n=24:

lex=24

j=0:

lex <=26: yes, append 1, lex=24-1=23

j=1:

lex=23 <=26: yes, append 1, lex=23-1=22

arr=[1,1]

arr.append(22), arr=[1,1,22]

arr.sort() => [1,1,22]

print 'a','a','v'

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in my earlier incorrect interpretation, I had lex=-2, which was wrong.

Let me try again.

For n=24:

arr=[]

lex=24

j=0:

lex <=26: yes, append 1, lex=24-1=23

j=1:

lex=23 <=26: yes, append 1, lex=23-1=22

arr=[1,1]

arr.append(22)

arr.sort() => [1,1,22]

print 'a','a','v'

Which is correct.

For n=70:

arr=[]

lex=70

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 70 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=70-26=44

j=1:

lex=44 <=26? No.

lex <52? 44<52? Yes, append 26, lex=44-26=18

arr=[26,26]

arr.append(18)

arr.sort() => [18,26,26]

print 's','z','z'

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=70, it's "rzz", which is 18,26,26.

But 'r' is 18, 'z' is 26.

So, 'rzz' corresponds to [18,26,26], but sorted it would be [18,26,26], which is 'rzz'.

Wait, but in the code, it appends 18, and then sorts to [18,26,26], which is correct.

Wait, but 's' is 19, not 18.

Wait, no, 'r' is 18, 's' is 19.

So, chr(18 +96) = chr(114) = 'r'

chr(26 +96) = chr(122) = 'z'

So, it's printing 'r','z','z', which is correct.

Wait, but according to the code, it's printing arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], which are 18,26,26, corresponding to 'r','z','z'.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=3

arr=[]

lex=3

j=0:

lex <=26: yes, append 1, lex=3-1=2

j=1:

lex=2 <=26: yes, append 1, lex=2-1=1

arr=[1,1]

arr.append(1)

arr.sort() => [1,1,1]

print 'a','a','a'

Correct.

n=55

arr=[]

lex=55

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 55<52? No.

So, append 26, lex=55-26=29

j=1:

lex=29 <=26? No.

lex <52? 29<52? Yes, append 26, lex=29-26=3

arr=[26,26]

arr.append(3)

arr.sort() => [3,26,26]

print 'c','z','z'

Which matches the sample output.

n=48

arr=[]

lex=48

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 48<52? Yes, append 26, lex=48-26=22

j=1:

lex=22 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=22-1=21

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(21)

arr.sort() => [1,21,26]

print 'a','u','z'

Which matches the sample output.

So, in all sample cases, it's producing the correct output.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's see.

The logic seems to be:

- For the first two letters, if lex <=26, set to 1 and subtract 1 from lex.

- Else if lex <52, set to 26 and subtract 26 from lex.

- Else, set to 26 and subtract 26 from lex.

- Then, set the third letter to the remaining lex.

- Sort the three letters to get the lex smallest word.

Wait, but why sort them? Because we want the smallest possible word, so arranging the letters in ascending order gives the lex smallest word.

But, is this logic always correct?

Let's consider n=78.

arr=[]

lex=78

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 78<52? No.

So, append 26, lex=78-26=52

j=1:

lex=52 <=26? No.

lex <52? 52<52? No.

So, append 26, lex=52-26=26

arr=[26,26]

arr.append(26)

arr.sort() => [26,26,26]

print 'z','z','z'

Which is correct, since "zzz" sums to 78.

Another test case: n=52

arr=[]

lex=52

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 52<52? No.

So, append 26, lex=52-26=26

j=1:

lex=26 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=26-1=25

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(25)

arr.sort() => [1,25,26]

print 'a','y','z'

Which sums to 1+25+26=52.

But is there a smaller word than 'ayz' for n=52?

Let's see, "axy": 1+24+25=50

"azz":1+26+26=53, which is invalid.

Wait, "ayz":1+25+26=52, which matches the output.

So, it's correct.

Another test case: n=27

arr=[]

lex=27

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

lex=1 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=1-1=0

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(0)

arr.sort() => [0,1,26]

print chr(96), 'a', 'z'

But chr(96) is '`', which is not a lowercase letter.

But according to the problem, letters are from 'a' to 'z', i.e., 1 to 26.

So, this seems invalid.

Wait, but n=27: we need three letters summing to 27, each between 1 and 26.

So, possible combinations:

"aa z":1+1+25=27

"a b y":1+2+24=27

But the smallest lex is "aa z".

But according to the code, it's producing [0,1,26], which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code to ensure that no letter is 0.

Wait, but in the code, arr.append(lex), which in this case is 0.

So, this is a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic to ensure that lex doesn't become 0 or negative.

Wait, in the earlier cases, it was handling negative lex by just appending the negative value, which is invalid.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect for some values of n.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, n starts from 3 to 78, and in the earlier cases, it seemed to work, but for n=27, it's producing an invalid letter.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, for n=27:

arr=[]

lex=27

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

lex=1 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=1-1=0

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(0)

arr.sort() => [0,1,26]

Which is invalid.

But, according to the problem, n=27 should correspond to "aaz", which is 1+1+25=27.

So, the code is incorrect here.

It should have appended 25 instead of 0.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be adjusted.

Wait, maybe instead of appending 1 when lex <=26, it should append lex if lex <=26, and set lex=0.

Wait, perhaps the logic needs to be:

for j in range(2):

if lex <=26:

arr.append(lex)

lex=0

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex=lex-26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex=lex-26

Then, append lex, which should be 0.

But in the case of n=27:

arr=[]

lex=27

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

lex=1 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=0

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(0)

arr.sort() => [0,1,26]

Still invalid.

Wait, perhaps after appending lex, ensure that it's at least 1.

So, arr.append(max(1, lex))

But lex is 0, which would become 1.

But then, it would be [26,1,1], which sorts to [1,1,26], corresponding to "a a z", which is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier code, it appends lex without ensuring it's at least 1.

So, perhaps that's the mistake.

Let me check the original code again.

The original code is:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for i in range(cases):

arr = []

lex = int(input())

for j in range(2):

if lex <= 26:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex - 1

elif lex < 52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

for k in range(3):

print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')

So, in the case of n=27:

arr=[]

lex=27

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

lex=1 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=1-1=0

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(0)

arr.sort() => [0,1,26]

Then, print chr(0+96), chr(1+96), chr(26+96)

chr(96) is '`', which is invalid.

But, if I modify the code to append max(1, lex):

arr=[]

lex=27

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

lex=1 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=1-1=0

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(max(1,0)=1)

arr.sort() => [1,1,26]

Which corresponds to "a a z", which is correct.

Similarly, for n=24:

arr=[]

lex=24

j=0:

lex <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=24-1=23

j=1:

lex=23 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=23-1=22

arr=[1,1]

arr.append(max(1,22)=22)

arr.sort() => [1,1,22]

Which is "a a v", correct.

For n=3:

arr=[]

lex=3

j=0:

lex <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=3-1=2

j=1:

lex=2 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=2-1=1

arr=[1,1]

arr.append(max(1,1)=1)

arr.sort() => [1,1,1]

Which is "a a a", correct.

For n=70:

arr=[]

lex=70

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? No.

append 26, lex=70-26=44

j=1:

lex=44 <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=44-26=18

arr=[26,26]

arr.append(max(1,18)=18)

arr.sort() => [18,26,26]

Which is "r z z", correct.

For n=55:

arr=[]

lex=55

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? 55<52? No.

append 26, lex=55-26=29

j=1:

lex=29 <=26? No.

lex <52? 29<52? Yes, append 26, lex=29-26=3

arr=[26,26]

arr.append(max(1,3)=3)

arr.sort() => [3,26,26]

Which is "c z z", correct.

For n=48:

arr=[]

lex=48

j=0:

lex <=26? No.

lex <52? Yes, append 26, lex=48-26=22

j=1:

lex=22 <=26? Yes, append 1, lex=22-1=21

arr=[26,1]

arr.append(max(1,21)=21)

arr.sort() => [1,21,26]

Which is "a u z", correct.

So, it seems that by modifying the code to append max(1, lex), it handles the case where lex is 0 correctly.

But in the original code, it appends lex without ensuring it's at least 1, which leads to invalid characters for certain n.

Therefore, the original code is incorrect for n=27, as it produces '` a z', which is invalid.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer value, based on the position of each letter in the Latin alphabet.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each letter from 'a' to 'z' corresponds to numbers 1 to 26.
   - We need to find three letters (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = n, where n is the given integer.
   - The word should be the smallest possible in lexicographical order.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To get the smallest lexicographical word, we should minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - For each test case:
     - Read the integer n.
     - Determine the values for the three letters ensuring they are between 1 and 26.
     - Adjust the letters to ensure their sum is n and they form the smallest possible word.
     - Sort the letters to form the smallest word and print it.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for _ in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex -= 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex -= 26
        arr.append(max(1, lex))
        arr.sort()
        for val in arr:
            print(chr(val + 96), end='')
        print()  # To ensure each word is on a new line

# To run the function

    func()
```

### Explanation
- **Step-by-step Execution:**
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the integer n.
  - Determine the values for the first two letters based on the value of n:
    - If n is small (<=26), set the letter to 'a' (1).
    - If n is medium (<52), set the letter to 'z' (26).
    - Adjust n accordingly.
  - Set the third letter to the remaining value, ensuring it is at least 1.
  - Sort the letters to form the smallest possible word and print it.

- **Correctness:**
  - By ensuring that we always try to set the letters to the smallest possible values and adjust accordingly, we maintain the lexicographical order.
  - Sorting the letters guarantees that the smallest possible combination is achieved.
  
This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the correct output for each test case.
