Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players playing a card game with a 32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. Suits are clubs (C), diamonds (D), hearts (H), and spades (S), and ranks are from '2' to '9'. So, each card is represented by two characters: the rank and the suit, like '8H' for 8 of Hearts.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit. In each round, the first player plays a card, and the second player has to beat it with one of their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile. There are rules for beating a card:

1. If both cards have the same suit, the one with the higher rank beats the lower one.

2. A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

3. Trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, after n rounds, there are 2n cards in the discard pile, and these cards are shuffled. My task is to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds based on the shuffled discard pile.

Input:

- t test cases.

- For each test case:

- n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16)

- trump suit (one character: C, D, H, S)

- 2n cards, all different, shuffled.

Output:

- For each test case, print n lines, each containing two cards: the first card played by the first player and the card used by the second player to beat it.

- If no solution exists, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

If multiple solutions exist, any one is acceptable.

Example is provided, but I need to focus on understanding the logic.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the rules of beating cards:

1. Same suit: higher rank beats lower rank.

2. Trump suit beats any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

3. Trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, in terms of strength:

- Highest are the trump cards, ordered by rank.

- Then, for non-trump suits, each suit has its own ordering based on rank.

But, trump cards can beat any non-trump card, and among trump cards, only higher-ranked trumps can beat lower-ranked trumps.

Given that, I need to group the cards into pairs where one card beats the other according to these rules.

Given that all cards are unique and provided in a shuffled order, I need to find a way to pair them such that in each pair, the second card beats the first.

First, I should separate the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards.

Let's denote:

- T: trump suit

- N: non-trump suits

For simplicity, let's assume T is 'S' (Spades), but it can be any of C, D, H, S.

So, separate the cards into:

- Trump cards: those with suit T.

- Non-trump cards: those with suit not T.

Now, among the non-trump cards, they are divided into different suits.

For each suit, the cards can be ordered by rank: '2' < '3' < '4' < '5' < '6' < '7' < '8' < '9'.

Similarly, trump cards are ordered by rank: '2' < '3' < '4' < '5' < '6' < '7' < '8' < '9'.

Now, according to the rules:

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card.

- Between two trump cards, the higher rank beats the lower rank.

- Between two non-trump cards of the same suit, the higher rank beats the lower rank.

- Non-trump cards of different suits cannot beat each other; they can only be beaten by trump cards.

Wait, no. The problem says:

- If both cards have the same suit, higher rank beats lower rank.

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card.

- Trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, non-trump cards of different suits cannot beat each other; only trump cards can beat them.

Wait, but the problem says: "the second player must beat this card with one of their cards."

So, if player 1 plays a non-trump card, player 2 can either play a higher non-trump card of the same suit or any trump card.

If player 1 plays a trump card, player 2 must play a higher trump card to beat it.

Given that, I need to pair the cards such that:

- For each pair, the second card beats the first card according to the rules.

Given that, I need to find a way to pair the cards accordingly.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Separate the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards.

2. For each non-trump suit, sort the cards in that suit by rank.

3. For trump cards, sort them by rank.

4. For each suit, pair the cards in a way that for non-trump suits, higher-ranked cards beat lower-ranked cards within the same suit.

5. For trump cards, pair them such that higher-ranked trumps beat lower-ranked trumps.

6. Additionally, any non-trump card can be beaten by any trump card.

Given that, perhaps I can:

- For each non-trump suit, pair the cards within the suit, ensuring that the beater has a higher rank.

- For trump cards, pair them among themselves, ensuring that the beater has a higher rank.

- If there are leftover non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suit, they must be beaten by trump cards.

- Ensure that there are enough trump cards to beat these non-trump cards.

Wait, but in the game, the sequence of plays matters because in each round, player 1 plays any card, and player 2 must beat it with one of their cards.

So, in terms of pairing, for each pair, the second card must beat the first card according to the rules.

But the order of pairing matters in the sense that in each round, player 1 can choose any card, and player 2 must choose a card that beats it.

But in our case, since we have all the cards in the discard pile, and we need to reconstruct any possible sequence of rounds, we can think of it as pairing each card played by player 1 with a card played by player 2 that beats it, regardless of the order, as long as the pairing satisfies the beating condition.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is:

- For each non-trump suit, pair the cards within the suit, ensuring that the beater has a higher rank.

- For trump cards, pair them among themselves, ensuring that the beater has a higher rank.

- Any non-trump card that cannot be beaten within its suit must be beaten by a trump card.

- Ensure that there are enough trump cards to beat the non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suits.

- After pairing, if there are leftover trump cards, they can be paired among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

Let me think about an example.

Suppose n=3, trump='S', and the cards are: 3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

First, separate into trump and non-trump:

Trump: 9S, 3S, 7S

Non-trump:

C: 3C, 4C

D: 6D

H: none

So, for suit C: 3C and 4C. 4C can beat 3C.

For suit D: only 6D, so it needs to be beaten by a trump card.

For trump suit S: 9S, 3S, 7S. Need to pair them such that higher beats lower: 9S beats 7S, and 7S beats 3S.

So, possible pairs:

- 3C 4C

- 6D 3S (since trump beats non-trump)

- 7S 9S

This seems to match the first example in the output.

Another example:

n=2, trump='C', cards: 3S 5D 9S 6H

Separate:

Trump: none? Wait, trump is 'C', but there are no 'C' cards in the list. Wait, looking back, the cards are 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H. So, trump is 'C', but there are no 'C' cards. So, trumps: none.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified that the deck has all 32 cards, but in this test case, n=2, so 4 cards are in the discard pile. It's possible that there are no trump cards in the discard pile.

So, in this case:

Trump suit: 'C'

Non-trump cards: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H

Need to pair them such that in each pair, the second card beats the first.

Possible pairings:

- 3S and 9S: both are S, so 9S beats 3S.

- 5D and 6H: different suits, cannot beat each other directly. But since there are no trump cards in the discard pile, it's impossible to pair them.

Hence, "IMPOSSIBLE"

Another example:

n=1, trump='H', cards: 6C 5D

Separate:

Trump: none

Non-trump:

C: 6C

D: 5D

Cannot pair them within their suits since they are different suits and cannot beat each other. No trump cards to beat them. So, "IMPOSSIBLE"

Another example:

n=1, trump='S', cards: 7S 3S

Separate:

Trump: 7S, 3S

Non-trump: none

Pair them: 3S beaten by 7S

So, output: 3S 7S

Another example:

n=1, trump='H', cards: 9S 9H

Separate:

Trump: 9H

Non-trump: 9S

Pair them: 9S beaten by 9H

Output: 9S 9H

Another example:

n=1, suit='S', cards: 9S 9H

Wait, trump='S', cards: 9S and 9H

So, trump is 'S', so 9S is trump, and 9H is non-trump.

9S can beat 9H.

Output: 9H 9S

Another example:

n=1, trump='C', cards: 9D 8H

Separate:

Trump: none

Non-trump: 9D, 8H

Cannot pair them since they are different suits and no trump cards. "IMPOSSIBLE"

Last example:

n=2, trump='C', cards: 9C 9S 6H 8C

Separate:

Trump: 9C, 8C

Non-trump: 9S, 6H

Pairing:

- 9S can be beaten by trump cards: 8C or 9C.

- 6H can be beaten by trump cards: 8C or 9C.

But we have two trump cards: 9C and 8C.

Option 1:

- Pair 9S with 9C

- Pair 6H with 8C

But 9C is a trump card and can beat 9S, and 8C can beat 6H.

Alternatively:

- Pair 9S with 8C

But 8C is a trump card and can beat 9S, even though 8 < 9, because trump beats non-trump.

But according to the rules, trump cards can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

So, 8C can beat 9S.

Similarly, 9C can beat 6H.

So, possible pairing:

- 9S 8C

- 6H 9C

Hence, the output is:

6H 9C

9S 8C

Wait, in the example output, it's:

6H 9C

9S 8C

Which matches this pairing.

So, the logic seems to hold.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

I need to process each test case separately.

For each test case:

- Read n, trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

- Separate the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards.

- For non-trump cards, group them by their suit.

- For each non-trump suit, sort the cards by rank and pair them accordingly.

- If there are an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card in that suit must be beaten by a trump card.

- Use the trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suits.

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

- If at any point there are not enough trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

- Otherwise, output the pairs in any order.

Edge cases to consider:

- All cards are trump cards.

- No trump cards in the discard pile.

- Suits with only one card.

- Suits with even or odd number of cards.

- Multiple suits with cards.

- All cards are from the same suit.

Let's think about the implementation in code.

First, read the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the trump suit.

- Read the list of 2n cards.

Then, separate the cards into trump and non-trump.

For non-trump cards, group them by suit.

For each suit, sort the cards by rank and try to pair them within the suit.

Ranks are ordered as '2' < '3' < '4' < '5' < '6' < '7' < '8' < '9'.

So, create a dictionary to map suit to list of ranks.

Then, for each suit, sort the ranks and pair them accordingly.

If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

Collect all the pairs formed within the suits.

Then, collect the remaining cards that need to be beaten by trump cards.

Use the trump cards to beat these remaining non-trump cards.

Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves.

If at any point there are not enough trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

Otherwise, output all the pairs.

Let me think about how to implement this step by step.

First, define the order of ranks:

rank_order = {'2': 0, '3': 1, '4': 2, '5': 3, '6': 4, '7': 5, '8': 6, '9': 7}

This will help in sorting the ranks.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n, trump, and the list of cards.

- Separate into trump and non-trump cards.

- For non-trump cards, group by suit.

- For each suit, sort the ranks and pair them.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

- Collect all pairs formed within suits.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trump cards.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Assign the lowest available trump card to beat each remaining non-trump card.

- If there are not enough trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

- Output all the pairs.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

Define rank_order as mentioned above.

For each test case:

- Read n, trump, and the list of cards.

- Separate into trump and non-trump cards.

- For non-trump cards, group by suit.

- For each suit, sort the ranks and pair them.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

- Collect all pairs formed within suits.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trump cards.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Assign the lowest available trump card to beat each remaining non-trump card.

- If there are not enough trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

- Output all the pairs.

Let me think about how to implement pairing within suits.

For a suit with even number of cards:

- Pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on.

For a suit with odd number of cards:

- Pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on, leaving the highest card to be beaten by a trump card.

Wait, but according to the rules, in each round, player 1 plays a card, and player 2 beats it.

So, in terms of pairing, for each pair, the second card beats the first card.

So, for same suit:

- Higher rank beats lower rank.

For trump cards:

- Higher trump beats lower trump.

- Any trump beats any non-trump.

So, in pairing within a suit:

- For same suit, pair higher rank with lower rank.

- For trump cards, pair higher rank with lower rank.

- For non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suit, they need to be beaten by trump cards.

Let me think about an example.

Take n=3, trump='S', cards: 3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

Separate:

Trump: 9S, 3S, 7S

Non-trump:

C: 3C, 4C

D: 6D

H: none

For suit C: 3C and 4C. Pair 3C with 4C, since 4C beats 3C.

For suit D: only 6D. Need to be beaten by a trump card.

For trump cards: 9S, 7S, 3S. Pair 3S with 7S, and 7S with 9S.

So, pairs:

- 3C 4C

- 6D 3S

- 7S 9S

This seems correct.

Another example: n=1, trump='S', cards: 7S 3S

Separate:

Trump: 7S, 3S

Non-trump: none

Pair 3S with 7S.

Output: 3S 7S

Another example: n=1, trump='H', cards: 9S 9H

Separate:

Trump: 9H

Non-trump: 9S

Pair 9S with 9H.

Output: 9S 9H

Another example: n=1, trump='S', cards: 9S 9H

Wait, trump='S', cards: 9S and 9H.

9S is trump, 9H is non-trump.

Pair 9H with 9S.

Output: 9H 9S

Another example: n=1, trump='C', cards: 9D 8H

Separate:

Trump: none

Non-trump: 9D, 8H

Cannot pair them within their suits, and no trump cards to beat them.

Output: "IMPOSSIBLE"

Another example: n=2, trump='C', cards: 9C 9S 6H 8C

Separate:

Trump: 9C, 8C

Non-trump: 9S, 6H

Pair 9S with 8C (since 8C is trump and beats 9S), and 6H with 9C.

Output:

6H 9C

9S 8C

Seems correct.

Now, think about implementation.

Define rank_order = {'2':0, '3':1, '4':2, '5':3, '6':4, '7':5, '8':6, '9':7}

For each test case:

- Read n, trump, and list of 2n cards.

- Separate into trump and non-trump.

- For non-trump cards, group by suit.

- For each suit, sort the ranks and pair them.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

- Collect all pairs formed within suits.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trump cards.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Assign the lowest available trump card to beat each remaining non-trump card.

- If there are not enough trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

- Output all the pairs.

Implementing this should solve the problem.

Let me think about how to implement pairing within suits.

For a suit with even number of cards:

- Sort the ranks in ascending order.

- Pair the first with the second, third with the fourth, and so on.

For a suit with odd number of cards:

- Sort the ranks in ascending order.

- Pair the first with the second, third with the fourth, and so on.

- The last card (highest rank) needs to be beaten by a trump card.

For trump cards:

- Sort the ranks in ascending order.

- Pair the first with the second, third with the fourth, and so on.

- If there's an odd number of trump cards, it's okay, because the highest trump can be left without a pair, but in this problem, since we have 2n cards, and we are pairing them, it should be even.

Wait, but n can be up to 16, so 2n=32, which is the total number of cards in the deck. So, it's possible to have an odd number of trump cards, but in this problem, since the total number of cards is even, and we are pairing them, we need to ensure that the number of trump cards is even after pairing the non-trump cards.

Wait, no, n is the number of rounds, so 2n is the total number of cards in the discard pile. Since each round involves two cards, total cards is 2n.

But the deck has 32 cards, so n can be up to 16.

In any case, we need to pair all 2n cards into n pairs, with each pair satisfying the beating condition.

So, in implementation, we need to:

- Separate trump and non-trump cards.

- For non-trump cards, group by suit.

- For each suit, sort the cards by rank and pair them within the suit.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

- Collect all pairs formed within suits.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trump cards.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Assign the lowest available trump card to beat each remaining non-trump card.

- If there are not enough trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE"

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

- Output all the pairs.

Implementing this logic should solve the problem.

Let me think about potential issues.

- If there are multiple suits with an odd number of cards, each of the highest cards in those suits needs to be beaten by a trump card.

- Ensure that there are enough trump cards to beat these remaining non-trump cards.

- If there are no trump cards, but there are non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suits, it's impossible.

- If there are trump cards, but not enough to beat all the remaining non-trump cards, it's impossible.

- If there are leftover trump cards after beating the remaining non-trump cards, pair them among themselves.

- Ensure that the pairing of trump cards is done correctly, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

Also, need to make sure that the ranks are compared correctly, using the rank_order dictionary.

Implementing this step by step should work.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

Let's analyze this.

First, it reads the input for t test cases, and for each test case, calls func_1().

In func_1():

- input(): probably reading n, but it's not assigned to any variable. Maybe assuming that n is not needed beyond this point.

- trump = input(): reads the trump suit.

- trumps = []: to hold the ranks of trump cards.

- answers = []: to hold the pairs of cards.

- suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}: to hold the ranks of non-trump cards, initialized to None.

- Loop through the cards:

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

So, for each card:

- If suit is trump, add its rank to trumps.

- Else, if there is already a card in that suit (suits[suit] is not None), create a pair with the current card and the existing card, sorted by rank, and add it to answers. Set suits[suit] to None.

- Else, set suits[suit] to the rank of the current card.

After processing all cards:

- For each suit, if suits[suit] is not None (i.e., there's an unpaired card in that suit):

- If trumps is not empty, pair it with the last trump card and add to answers, then pop the trump card.

- Else, print "IMPOSSIBLE" and return.

- Sort the remaining trumps.

- While there are trumps left, pair the last two trumps and print them.

- Then, print all the answers.

Let's see if this implements the required logic.

First, for non-trump suits:

- For each suit, if there are two cards, they are paired together, with the lower rank beating the higher rank? Wait, no.

Wait, in the code:

if suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

So, for the first card in a suit, it's stored in suits[suit]. For the second card in the suit, it pairs them in sorted order and adds to answers, and sets suits[suit] to None.

So, for same suit cards, it pairs the lower rank with the higher rank, with the lower rank first and higher rank second.

But according to the rules, in same suit, higher rank beats lower rank.

So, in the pair, the first card is the one played by player 1, and the second card is the one that beats it.

So, in same suit, lower rank should be paired with higher rank, with lower rank first and higher rank second.

Wait, but in the code, it's sorting the ranks and joining them with the suit.

So, if suits[suit] is '3' and rank is '4' for suit 'C', it will sort ['3','4'] to ['3','4'], so '3C 4C', which is correct: 3C beaten by 4C.

Similarly for other suits.

So, that seems correct.

Then, for suits with an odd number of cards, the remaining card is paired with a trump card.

If there are no trump cards left, it's impossible.

Then, the remaining trump cards are paired among themselves, with higher-ranked trumps beating lower-ranked trumps.

In the code, it sorts the trumps and pairs the last two, then pops them.

Wait, sorted(trumps) sorts the ranks in ascending order.

Then, while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

So, it's pairing the highest remaining trump with the next highest, and so on.

Which is correct, as higher trump beats lower trump.

Then, it prints all the answers.

Seems correct.

Let's check with an example.

Take n=3, trump='S', cards: 3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

Processing:

- trumps: ['9','3','7']

- suits: initialize to None

Loop through cards:

- 3C: suits['C'] is None, so suits['C'] = '3'

- 9S: trump, add '9' to trumps

- 4C: suits['C'] is '3', so answers.append('3C 4C'), suits['C'] = None

- 6D: suits['D'] is None, so suits['D'] = '6'

- 3S: trump, add '3' to trumps

- 7S: trump, add '7' to trumps

After loop:

suits: {'C': None, 'D': '6', 'H': None, 'S': None}

trumps: ['9','3','7']

Process suits:

- 'C': None, skip

- 'D': '6', need to pair with a trump card.

- trumps is not empty, so answers.append('6D 7S'), trumps.pop() is '7'

- 'H': None, skip

- 'S': None, skip

Now, trumps: ['9','3']

Sort trumps: ['3','9']

While trumps != []:

- print('9S 3S')

- pop '9' and '3'

Then, print answers:

- '3C 4C'

- '6D 7S'

Seems correct.

Another example: n=2, trump='C', cards: 3S 5D 9S 6H

Processing:

- trumps: [] (no 'C' cards)

- suits: initialize to None

- 3S: suits['S'] = '3'

- 5D: suits['D'] = '5'

- 9S: suits['S'] is '3', so answers.append('3S 9S'), suits['S'] = None

- 6H: suits['H'] = '6'

After loop:

suits: {'C': None, 'D': '5', 'H': '6', 'S': None}

trumps: []

Process suits:

- 'D': '5', need to pair with a trump card.

- trumps is empty, so print "IMPOSSIBLE"

Which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Another example: n=1, trump='H', cards: 9S 9H

Processing:

- trumps: ['9']

- suits: initialize to None

- 9S: suits['S'] = '9'

- 9H: trump, add '9' to trumps

After loop:

suits: {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': '9'}

trumps: ['9']

Process suits:

- 'S': '9', need to pair with a trump card.

- trumps is not empty, so answers.append('9S 9H'), trumps.pop() is '9'

Then, trumps is empty, so no pairing left.

Print answers: '9S 9H'

Which is correct.

Another example: n=1, trump='S', cards: 7S 3S

Processing:

- trumps: ['7','3']

- suits: initialize to None

- 7S: trump, add '7' to trumps

- 3S: trump, add '3' to trumps

After loop:

suits: all None

trumps: ['7','3']

Process suits: nothing left.

Sort trumps: ['3','7']

While trumps != []:

- print('7S 3S')

- pop '7' and '3'

Then, no answers to print.

Which is correct.

Another example: n=1, trump='C', cards: 9D 8H

Processing:

- trumps: [] (no 'C' cards)

- suits: initialize to None

- 9D: suits['D'] = '9'

- 8H: suits['H'] = '8'

After loop:

suits: {'C': None, 'D': '9', 'H': '8', 'S': None}

trumps: []

Process suits:

- 'D': '9', need to pair with a trump card.

- trumps is empty, so print "IMPOSSIBLE"

Which is correct.

Seems like the program correctly implements the required logic.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct possible rounds of a card game based on the provided discard pile, ensuring that the rules of the game are followed. The game involves trump cards and non-trump cards with specific beating conditions.

### Approach

1. **Separation of Cards**:
   - Separate the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards.
   
2. **Pairing Non-Trump Cards**:
   - For each non-trump suit, sort the cards by rank and pair them such that higher-ranked cards beat lower-ranked cards within the same suit.
   - If there is an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest card needs to be beaten by a trump card.

3. **Using Trump Cards**:
   - Use trump cards to beat any remaining non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suits.
   - If there are not enough trump cards to beat these remaining non-trump cards, it is impossible to reconstruct the rounds.

4. **Pairing Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - Pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, ensuring that higher-ranked trumps beat lower-ranked trumps.

5. **Output the Pairs**:
   - Print the pairs of cards for each round, ensuring the second card beats the first according to the game rules.

### Solution Code

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input()  # Read n, but not used beyond this point
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        (rank, suit) = card
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of rounds), the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

2. **Card Separation**:
   - Separate cards into trump and non-trump categories.
   - For non-trump cards, group them by their suit.

3. **Pairing Within Suits**:
   - For each non-trump suit, pair cards within the suit ensuring higher-ranked cards beat lower-ranked ones.
   - If a suit has an odd number of cards, the highest card is set to be beaten by a trump card.

4. **Using Trump Cards**:
   - Use trump cards to beat any remaining non-trump cards that couldn't be paired within their suits.
   - If there are not enough trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

5. **Pairing Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - Pair remaining trump cards among themselves, ensuring higher-ranked trumps beat lower-ranked ones.

6. **Output**:
   - Print the pairs for each round, ensuring the second card beats the first according to the game rules.

This approach ensures that the card game rounds are reconstructed correctly based on the provided discard pile and game rules.
