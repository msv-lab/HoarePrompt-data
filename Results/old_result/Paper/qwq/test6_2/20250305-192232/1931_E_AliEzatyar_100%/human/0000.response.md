Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins in a game between Anna and Sasha based on a list of integers and some parameters. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, Anna and Sasha are playing a game with a list of integers. The list has 'n' integers, and there's this parameter 'm' that's used to decide the winner.

The game works like this:

- Anna goes first.

- On Anna's turn, she chooses one number from the list and reverses its digits, removing any leading zeros.

- On Sasha's turn, he chooses two different numbers from the list, concatenates them in any order, and puts the result back into the list.

- They keep taking turns until there's only one number left in the list. At that point, if the remaining number is greater than or equal to 10^m, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

I need to determine, for multiple test cases, who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the operations each player can make:

- Anna reverses a single number's digits.

- Sasha takes two numbers, concatenates them, and puts the result back.

I need to see how these operations affect the list and the final number.

Let's think about the game progression:

1. The game starts with 'n' numbers.

2. On each of Sasha's turns, he reduces the number of elements in the list by 1 because he removes two and adds one.

3. Anna, on her turn, doesn't change the number of elements; she just modifies one of them.

4. The game ends when there's only one number left, and based on its value, we decide the winner.

I need to find out how many turns each player gets and how their actions influence the final number.

Let's consider the total number of moves:

- Each Sasha's move reduces the list size by 1.

- Anna's move doesn't change the list size.

- The game ends when there's only one number left.

So, the number of Sasha's moves possible is (n - 1), because each of his moves reduces the count by 1, and he needs to reduce from n to 1.

Anna's moves can be interleaved between Sasha's moves.

Since Anna goes first, the sequence of moves would be:

- Anna's turn: chooses one number to reverse.

- Then Sasha's turn: chooses two numbers to concatenate.

- This alternates until only one number remains.

Wait, but Anna can choose to reverse any number on her turn, and Sasha concatenates two numbers into one.

I need to see how many total moves there are.

Let's think about the number of Sasha's moves:

- Sasha can make at most (n - 1) moves, each reducing the list size by 1.

- But Anna can make moves in between.

Actually, thinking more carefully:

- The game starts with n numbers.

- On each of Sasha's moves, he removes two numbers and adds one, reducing the list by 1.

- Anna, on her turn, reverses one number without changing the list size.

- The game ends when there's only one number left.

So, the total number of Sasha's moves is (n - 1), because each move reduces the list by 1, from n to 1.

Anna can make moves in between Sasha's moves, but she doesn't change the list size.

So, the total number of Sasha's moves is fixed at (n - 1), and Anna can make up to (n - 1) moves as well, but it's not clear yet how their moves alternate.

Wait, the problem says: "Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e., after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list."

So, the sequence is:

- Anna makes a move (reverses one number).

- Then Sasha makes a move (concatenates two numbers).

- This alternates until Sasha can't make a move, which is when there's only one number left.

So, the game ends when there's only one number left, and at that point, we check if it's >= 10^m.

I need to find out who can control the final number to be >= 10^m or < 10^m.

To determine who wins, I need to see who can force the final number to be >= 10^m or < 10^m, based on their moves.

Given that both play optimally, I need to find out under what conditions Sasha can make the final number >= 10^m, and under what conditions Anna can make it < 10^m.

First, I need to understand how the operations affect the final number.

Let's consider that Sasha wants the final number to be large, while Anna wants it to be small.

Wait, actually, Anna wins if the final number is < 10^m, and Sasha wins if it's >= 10^m.

So, Anna wants the final number to be as small as possible, while Sasha wants it to be as large as possible.

Given that, Anna will try to reverse numbers to make them smaller, and Sasha will try to concatenate numbers in a way that makes the concatenated number as large as possible.

But, reversing a number doesn't necessarily make it smaller; sometimes it makes it larger.

For example, reversing 12 becomes 21, which is larger.

Reversing 21 becomes 12, which is smaller.

So, Anna has to choose which number to reverse to minimize the final number.

Similarly, Sasha will choose which two numbers to concatenate and in what order to maximize the final number.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to find a way to calculate the minimal possible final number given optimal play.

If Anna can make choices that lead to a final number < 10^m, she wins; otherwise, Sasha wins.

I need to find a strategy for Anna to minimize the final number and see if it's less than 10^m.

Alternatively, think in terms of the number of moves and who has the last move.

Given that Anna starts, and they alternate moves, with Anna going first, and the game ends when there's only one number left, which happens after (n - 1) Sasha's moves.

Wait, let's think about the total number of moves:

- Sasha makes (n - 1) moves, each reducing the list by 1.

- Anna makes moves in between.

Wait, no. The problem says Anna makes the first move, then Sasha, then Anna, and so on, until Sasha can't make a move.

But Sasha can't make a move when there's only one number left.

So, the sequence is:

- Anna reverses one number.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers.

- Anna reverses one number.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers.

- And so on, until there's only one number left.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is (n - 1), since each Sasha's move reduces the list by 1, from n to 1.

The number of Anna's moves is equal to the number of Sasha's moves, which is (n - 1), because she goes first and then alternates with Sasha.

Wait, but in the last step, after Anna's move, there's only one number left, so Sasha can't make a move.

So, the total number of Anna's moves is (n - 1), and Sasha's moves are (n - 1).

Wait, no. Let's think about it differently.

Start with n numbers.

Anna makes a move: reverses one number. List still has n numbers.

Then Sasha makes a move: concatenates two numbers, reduces the list to (n - 1).

Then Anna makes a move: reverses one number. List has (n - 1) numbers.

Then Sasha makes a move: concatenates two numbers, reduces the list to (n - 2).

And so on, until there's only one number left.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is (n - 1), and the number of Anna's moves is also (n - 1).

Each Sasha's move reduces the list by 1, and Anna's move doesn't change the list size.

So, after (n - 1) Sasha's moves, the list has 1 number left.

Now, I need to see how their moves affect the final number.

This seems quite involved. Maybe I need to find a way to calculate the minimal possible final number given optimal play by Anna.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine who wins based on n and m.

Looking at the sample input and output might help.

Looking at the first test case:

2 2

14 2

Anna can reverse 2 to 2, or 14 to 41.

If she reverses 2 to 2, Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to get 214 or 142. Both are >=100, so Sasha wins.

If she reverses 14 to 41, Sasha concatenates 41 and 2 to get 412 or 241. Both are >=100, so Sasha wins.

So, in this case, Sasha wins.

Second test case:

3 5

9 56 1

Possible sequences:

Anna reverses one number.

Let's say she reverses 9 to 9, 56 to 65, or 1 to 1.

Suppose she reverses 56 to 65.

Then Sasha concatenates two numbers. He can choose 65 and 1 to make 651 or 165.

Then Anna reverses one number: reverses 9 to 9.

Then Sasha concatenates the remaining two: say 9 and 651 to make 9651 or 6519, both >=100000, but m=5, so 10^5=100000. So, if the number is >=100000, Sasha wins.

But the output is Anna, so Sasha doesn't win in this case.

Wait, the output is Anna, meaning she can force the final number to be <100000.

So, perhaps there's a way for Anna to make choices that result in a final number less than 100000.

I need to see how.

Let's think about the operations in more detail.

I need to find a pattern or a formula that can determine the winner based on n and m.

Looking at the constraints:

- n can be up to 2*10^5, and m up to 2*10^6.

- t, the number of test cases, is up to 10^4.

So, any solution needs to be efficient, probably O(t*n) time.

Looking at the provided program:

It reads t, then for each test case, reads n and m, then reads the array of n integers.

Then, it calculates total_digits, which is the sum of the lengths of the numbers in the array.

It also calculates zeros, which is a list of the counts of trailing zeros in each number.

Then, it sorts zeros in reverse order and subtracts every other zero count starting from the first.

Then, it checks if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1, and if so, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

I need to understand if this logic is correct.

First, let's understand what total_digits is: it's the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the array.

For example, for numbers 14 and 2, total_digits = 2 + 1 = 3.

For numbers 9, 56, 1, total_digits = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Now, zeros is a list of the counts of trailing zeros in each number.

For example, for 14, trailing zeros are 0; for 2, trailing zeros are 0; for 9, 0; for 56, 0; for 1, 0.

For numbers like 100, it would be 2 trailing zeros.

Then, it sorts zeros in reverse order and subtracts every other zero starting from the first.

Wait, in the code, it's defined as subtract_zero = 0, then for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2): subtract_zero += zeros[i]

So, it's summing every second element in the sorted (descending) zeros list.

Then, it checks if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1.

If so, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

I need to see if this logic correctly determines the winner.

Looking back at the sample input:

First test case:

n=2, m=2

array: 14, 2

total_digits = 2 + 1 = 3

zeros: func_1(14)=0, func_1(2)=0 => zeros=[0,0]

sorted descending: [0,0]

subtract_zero = 0 + 0 = 0

abs(3 - 0) = 3 >= 2 + 1 => 3 >= 3 => true, so Sasha wins.

Which matches the first sample.

Second test case:

n=3, m=5

array: 9,56,1

total_digits = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

zeros: func_1(9)=0, func_1(56)=0, func_1(1)=0 => zeros=[0,0,0]

sorted descending: [0,0,0]

subtract_zero = 0 + 0 = 0

abs(4 - 0) = 4 >= 5 + 1 => 4 >= 6? False, so Anna wins.

Which matches the second sample.

Third test case:

n=4, m=10

array:1,2007,800,1580

total_digits =1 +4 +3 +4=12

zeros: func_1(1)=0, func_1(2007)=0, func_1(800)=2, func_1(1580)=1 => zeros=[2,1,0,0]

sorted descending: [2,1,0,0]

subtract_zero = 2 + 0 = 2

abs(12 - 2) =10 >=10 +1 =>10 >=11? False, so Anna wins.

But the sample output is Anna, which matches.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's Anna, but according to the code, it's Anna.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says Anna wins, which matches the code's output.

Wait, but in the sample input, the third test case has output "Anna", but according to the code, it should be "Anna".

Wait, but according to my calculation, 12 - 2 =10 >=11 is false, so Anna wins, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the code, it's answers[test] = 'Sasha' if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

So, in this case, 10 >=11 is false, so 'Anna', which matches the sample.

Ok, seems correct so far.

Looking at the fourth test case:

n=4, m=5

array:5000,123,30,4

total_digits=4 +3 +2 +1=10

zeros: func_1(5000)=3, func_1(123)=0, func_1(30)=1, func_1(4)=0 => zeros=[3,1,0,0]

sorted descending: [3,1,0,0]

subtract_zero=3+0=3

abs(10 -3)=7 >=5 +1 =>7 >=6? True, so Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Fifth test case:

n=10, m=10

array:6,4,6,2,3,1,10,9,10,7

total_digits=1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+2+1=12

zeros: func_1(6)=0, func_1(4)=0, func_1(6)=0, func_1(2)=0, func_1(3)=0, func_1(1)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(9)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(7)=0 => zeros=[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

sorted descending: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

subtract_zero=1+0=1

abs(12 -1)=11 >=10 +1 =>11 >=11? True, so Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Sixth test case:

n=1, m=1

array:6

total_digits=1

zeros: func_1(6)=0 => zeros=[0]

sorted descending: [0]

subtract_zero=0

abs(1 -0)=1 >=1 +1 =>1 >=2? False, so Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Seventh test case:

n=1, m=1

array:10

total_digits=2

zeros: func_1(10)=1 => zeros=[1]

sorted descending: [1]

subtract_zero=1

abs(2 -1)=1 >=1 +1 =>1 >=2? False, so Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Eighth test case:

n=8, m=9

array:1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2

total_digits=1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=11

zeros: func_1(1)=0, func_1(2)=0, func_1(9)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0 => zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

sorted descending: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

subtract_zero=1+0+0=1

abs(11 -1)=10 >=9 +1 =>10 >=10? True, so Sasha wins.

Wait, but sample output is "Anna", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, subtract_zero=1+0+0=1

abs(11 -1)=10 >=10? True, so Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which doesn't match.

Hmm, so maybe the logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m, not m + 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's m + 1.

In this case, 10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna", meaning the code is incorrect in this case.

So, perhaps the condition should be abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m, not m + 1.

Wait, but in the first test case, 3 >=2 +1 =>3 >=3 is True, which matches Sasha wins.

In the second test case, 4 >=5 +1 =>4 >=6 is False, which matches Anna wins.

In the third test case, 10 >=5 +1 =>10 >=6 is True, which matches Sasha wins.

Wait, but in the eighth test case, 11 -1 =10 >=9 +1 =>10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, n=8, m=9

array:1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2

total_digits=1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=11

zeros: func_1(1)=0, func_1(2)=0, func_1(9)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0 => zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

sorted descending: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

subtract_zero=1+0+0=1

abs(11 -1)=10 >=9 +1 =>10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which contradicts.

So, perhaps the condition should be abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m, not m + 1.

If m +1 is changed to m, then 10 >=9 is True, Sasha wins, which still contradicts the sample output "Anna".

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the logic.

Alternatively, maybe it's total_digits - subtract_zero >=m, without the abs.

Wait, in the code, it's abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1.

But in this case, 11 -1=10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

Hmm, perhaps the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero >=m.

Then, 11 -1=10 >=9 is True, Sasha wins, which again contradicts the sample "Anna".

Wait, perhaps it's total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

Wait, but in the code, it's abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1.

Wait, perhaps the logic is flawed.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=2, m=2

total_digits=3

subtract_zero=0

abs(3 -0)=3 >=2 +1 =>3 >=3 is True, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Second test case:

n=3, m=5

total_digits=4

subtract_zero=0

abs(4 -0)=4 >=5 +1 =>4 >=6 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Third test case:

n=4, m=10

total_digits=12

subtract_zero=2

abs(12 -2)=10 >=10 +1 =>10 >=11 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Fourth test case:

n=4, m=5

total_digits=10

subtract_zero=3

abs(10 -3)=7 >=5 +1 =>7 >=6 is True, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Fifth test case:

n=10, m=10

total_digits=12

subtract_zero=1

abs(12 -1)=11 >=10 +1 =>11 >=11 is True, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Sixth test case:

n=1, m=1

total_digits=1

subtract_zero=0

abs(1 -0)=1 >=1 +1 =>1 >=2 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Seventh test case:

n=1, m=1

total_digits=2

subtract_zero=1

abs(2 -1)=1 >=1 +1 =>1 >=2 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Eighth test case:

n=8, m=9

total_digits=11

subtract_zero=1

abs(11 -1)=10 >=9 +1 =>10 >=10 is True, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the logic for this specific case.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero >=m.

In this case, 11 -1=10 >=9 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

So, perhaps the logic is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero <m.

Then, 11 -1=10 >=9 is True, so Sasha wins, which contradicts the sample "Anna".

Wait, but in the sample, it's "Anna", meaning Anna wins, which would correspond to total_digits - subtract_zero <m.

But in this case, 10 >=9 is True, so Sasha wins, which doesn't match the sample "Anna".

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input:

8 9

1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2

Output: Anna

But according to the code's logic, total_digits=11, subtract_zero=1, 10 >=9 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating subtract_zero.

Wait, zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

sorted descending: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

subtract_zero=1 +0=1

So, total_digits - subtract_zero=11-1=10 >=9 +1=10? 10>=10 is True, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", so perhaps the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero >=m +1.

Wait, but in this case, 10 >=10 is True, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which suggests that Anna wins when total_digits - subtract_zero < m +1.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero < m +1 for Anna to win.

Then, 10 <10 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins, which contradicts the sample.

Wait, perhaps it's total_digits - subtract_zero < m for Anna to win.

Then, 10 <9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins, which again contradicts the sample.

Wait, maybe the condition is total_digits - subtract_zero <=m for Anna to win.

Then, 10 <=9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins, which contradicts the sample.

Hmm, seems like there's confusion here.

Looking back at the code, it has abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1 for Sasha to win.

In this case, abs(11 -1)=10 >=9 +1=10 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna", suggesting that Anna wins when abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) < m +1.

So, perhaps the condition should be:

If abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1, Sasha wins.

Else, Anna wins.

But in the sample, for n=8, m=9, total_digits=11, subtract_zero=1, abs(11-1)=10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

So, perhaps the condition is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it should be total_digits - subtract_zero < m for Anna to win.

Then, 11 -1=10 <9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins, which again contradicts the sample.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way subtract_zero is calculated.

Looking back at the code, subtract_zero sums every second element in the sorted descending zeros list.

In this case, zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0], sorted descending [1,1,1,0,0,0,0], subtract_zero=1+0=1.

Is this the correct way to calculate subtract_zero?

I need to understand what subtract_zero represents.

Looking back at the problem, Anna can reverse numbers, which can affect the number of trailing zeros.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that Anna can reduce the number of trailing zeros in some way.

But in this calculation, it's summing every second largest number of trailing zeros.

I think there's a mistake in the logic.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the key is to calculate the minimal possible final number's digit count.

Anna wants to minimize the final number, while Sasha wants to maximize it.

Given that, Anna will try to reverse numbers to make them smaller, and Sasha will concatenate numbers to make the final number larger.

But reversing a number doesn't necessarily make it smaller; sometimes it makes it larger.

So, it's not straightforward.

Perhaps the critical factor is the total number of digits in the final number.

Since concatenation preserves the digit count (concatenating two numbers with a and b digits results in a number with a+b digits), the final number's digit count is equal to the sum of the digit counts of the initial numbers.

Wait, but reversing a number can change its digit count if it has leading zeros, but in this problem, leading zeros are removed after reversing.

But since the numbers are positive integers, reversing and removing leading zeros won't change the digit count.

For example, reversing 100 becomes 001, which becomes 1, so the digit count changes from 3 to 1.

Similarly, reversing 123 is 321, same digit count.

So, reversing a number can reduce its digit count if it has trailing zeros.

Wait, trailing zeros become leading zeros after reversing, which are then removed.

So, reversing a number with k trailing zeros reduces its digit count by k.

Therefore, Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros to reduce their digit count.

So, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to reduce their digit counts by their trailing zeros.

Sasha, on the other hand, concatenates two numbers, which combines their digit counts.

So, the total digit count of the final number is the sum of the digit counts of the initial numbers minus the total trailing zeros that Anna chooses to eliminate.

Wait, more precisely, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers, thereby reducing their digit counts by their trailing zeros.

So, the final digit count of the list is the total digit counts minus the sum of trailing zeros of the numbers Anna chooses to reverse.

Anna wants to minimize the final number, which is achieved by minimizing its digit count.

Sasha wants to maximize the final number, which is achieved by maximizing its digit count.

But, Anna goes first and chooses to reverse one number each time.

So, Anna can choose to reverse numbers with the most trailing zeros to minimize the final digit count.

Similarly, Sasha concatenates two numbers each time, which combines their digit counts.

So, the minimal final digit count is the total digit counts minus the sum of trailing zeros of the numbers Anna chooses to reverse.

Given that Anna plays optimally to minimize the final digit count, she will choose to reverse numbers with the most trailing zeros.

Given that there are n moves for Anna, she can reverse n numbers.

But, in reality, she can reverse the same number multiple times, but since reversing twice returns the number to its original state, it's sufficient to consider each number reversed at most once.

Wait, no, because reversing a number once reduces its digit count by its trailing zeros, and reversing it again would bring it back to original.

So, Anna can choose to reverse each number at most once.

Therefore, the minimal final digit count is total_digit_counts - sum of trailing zeros of the numbers Anna chooses to reverse.

Anna can choose up to n numbers to reverse.

But, in the code, it's summing every second largest trailing zero count.

I'm getting confused.

Perhaps a better approach is to sort the trailing zeros in descending order and subtract every other one starting from the first.

Wait, in the code, subtract_zero = sum(zeros[0::2])

Which is sum of zeros[0], zeros[2], zeros[4], etc.

I don't understand why.

Perhaps it's because Anna can choose to reverse the numbers with the highest trailing zeros, and Sasha can counter by reversing others.

But it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of moves Anna can make.

Given that there are (n-1) moves for Anna and Sasha each, but Anna goes first.

Wait, no, Anna has n moves because she goes first and makes a move before each of Sasha's moves.

Wait, but in reality, Anna makes n-1 moves, and Sasha makes n-1 moves.

Because starting with n numbers, after n-1 Sasha's moves, only one number remains.

Each Sasha's move reduces the list by 1, starting from n to 1.

Anna makes n-1 moves, one before each of Sasha's moves.

So, Anna can choose to reverse n-1 numbers.

Therefore, she can choose to reverse n-1 numbers to minimize the final digit count.

So, to minimize the final digit count, she should choose to reverse the n-1 numbers with the highest trailing zeros.

Wait, no, to minimize the final digit count, she should reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros.

But, she can only reverse n-1 numbers.

So, if there are k numbers with trailing zeros, and n-1 >=k, then she can reverse all of them.

Otherwise, she reverses the n-1 numbers with the highest trailing zeros.

Therefore, subtract_zero should be sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

Wait, but in the code, it's sum of every other trailing zero in the sorted list.

This seems incorrect.

Perhaps it's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum of the top floor((n-1)/2) trailing zeros.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the eighth test case:

n=8, m=9

array:1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2

total_digits=1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=11

zeros: func_1(1)=0, func_1(2)=0, func_1(9)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0, func_1(10)=1, func_1(2)=0 => zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

sorted descending: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

subtract_zero =1 +0 +0=1

So, total_digits - subtract_zero=10

Then, 10 >=9 +1 =>10 >=10 is True, so Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which suggests Anna wins.

So, perhaps the condition is total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

Then, 10 <9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins.

Which matches the earlier conclusion.

But sample output is "Anna", so perhaps the condition is total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

Wait, but in this case, 10 <9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which suggests that Anna wins when total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

So, perhaps the condition should be:

If total_digits - subtract_zero < m, Anna wins.

Else, Sasha wins.

In this case, 10 <9 is False, so Anna doesn't win, Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

So, perhaps the condition is total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

But in this case, it's not holding.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input:

8 9

1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2

Output: Anna

But according to the logic, it should be Sasha wins.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the way subtract_zero is calculated is wrong.

Perhaps Anna can only reverse a subset of numbers, not necessarily n-1.

Wait, Anna makes n-1 moves, each time reversing one number.

But she can choose to reverse the same number multiple times, but since reversing twice returns it to original, it's sufficient to consider each number reversed at most once.

Therefore, Anna can choose up to n-1 numbers to reverse.

So, to minimize the final digit count, she should choose to reverse the n-1 numbers with the highest trailing zeros.

In the eighth test case, zeros=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]

So, she can reverse three numbers with trailing zeros=1.

So, subtract_zero=1+1+1=3

Then, total_digits - subtract_zero=11-3=8

Then, 8 <9, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output "Anna".

Wait, but in the code, subtract_zero=1 +0 +0=1, because it's summing every other element starting from index 0.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to sum the top n-1 trailing zeros.

In this case, n=8, n-1=7, so sum all zeros=[1+1+1+0+0+0+0]=3

Then, total_digits - subtract_zero=11-3=8 <9, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output.

But in the code, it's summing zeros[0], zeros[2], zeros[4], etc., which is 1+0+0=1.

This seems incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct way is to sum the top n-1 trailing zeros.

In this case, n-1=7, so sum all zeros=3.

Then, total_digits - subtract_zero=11-3=8 <9, Anna wins.

In the first test case:

n=2, m=2

total_digits=3

zeros=[0,0]

subtract_zero=0

3 -0=3 >=2, Sasha wins.

Wait, but condition is total_digits - subtract_zero >=m.

In the code, it's abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1.

Which in this case, 3 -0=3 >=2 +1=3, which holds.

In the second test case:

n=3, m=5

total_digits=4

subtract_zero=0

4 -0=4 <5, Anna wins.

In the code, 4 >=5 +1=6 is False, so Anna wins.

Wait, but 4 -0=4 >=5 is False, so Anna wins.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be total_digits - subtract_zero >=m for Sasha to win.

Then, in this case, 4 -0=4 >=5 is False, so Anna wins.

Similarly, in the eighth test case:

total_digits - subtract_zero=11-3=8 >=9 is False, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output.

But in the code, subtract_zero is calculated as sum(zeros[0::2]), which is incorrect.

It should be sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

In this case, n-1=7, so sum all zeros=3.

Then, total_digits - subtract_zero=11-3=8 >=9 is False, so Anna wins.

Similarly, in the fourth test case:

n=4, m=5

total_digits=10

zeros=[3,1,0,0]

sorted descending: [3,1,0,0]

subtract_zero=3+0=3

10 -3=7 >=5, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

In the third test case:

n=4, m=10

total_digits=12

zeros=[2,1,0,0]

subtract_zero=2+0=2

12-2=10 >=10, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to cap the number of reversals Anna can make.

Anna can make n-1 moves, and each move she reverses one number.

So, she can reverse up to n-1 numbers.

Therefore, if there are more numbers with trailing zeros than n-1, she can only reverse n-1 of them.

In this case, n=4, n-1=3, zeros=[2,1,0,0]

She can reverse up to 3 numbers, so subtract_zero=2+1+0=3

total_digits - subtract_zero=12-3=9 >=10 is False, Anna wins.

But according to the code, subtract_zero=2+0=2

12-2=10 >=10 is True, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which suggests Anna wins when total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

So, perhaps Anna can only reverse up to n-1 numbers, and subtract_zero should be the sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

In this case, n-1=3, sum of top 3 trailing zeros is 2+1+0=3

12-3=9 <10, Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output "Anna".

So, the correct way is:

subtract_zero = sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

Then, if total_digits - subtract_zero < m, Anna wins.

Else, Sasha wins.

In the code, it's summing zeros[0], zeros[2], zeros[4], etc., which is incorrect.

It should be sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

In the fourth test case:

n=4, m=5

zeros=[3,1,0,0]

subtract_zero=3+1+0=4

total_digits=10 -4=6 >=5? False, Anna wins.

But sample output is "Sasha", which is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, n=4, m=5

total_digits=10

subtract_zero=3+1+0=4

10 -4=6 >=5, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should be Anna wins when total_digits - subtract_zero < m.

But in this case, 6 >=5 is True, so Sasha wins.

Which matches the sample output "Sasha".

Wait, but in the third test case:

n=4, m=10

total_digits=12

subtract_zero=2+1+0=3

12 -3=9 >=10 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

In the eighth test case:

n=8, m=9

total_digits=11

subtract_zero=1+1+1+0+0+0+0=3

11 -3=8 >=9 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

In the first test case:

n=2, m=2

total_digits=3

subtract_zero=0+0=0

3 -0=3 >=2, Sasha wins.

Sample output is "Sasha", which matches.

In the second test case:

n=3, m=5

total_digits=4

subtract_zero=0+0+0=0

4 -0=4 >=5 is False, Anna wins.

Sample output is "Anna", which matches.

So, perhaps the condition is:

If total_digits - sum of top n-1 trailing zeros >= m, Sasha wins.

Else, Anna wins.

In the code, it's using abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m +1.

Which coincidentally matches in some cases but not all.

So, the code is incorrect.

The correct way is:

subtract_zero = sum of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m:

Sasha wins

else:

Anna wins

Therefore, the given code is incorrect because it sums every other trailing zero instead of the top n-1 trailing zeros.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
