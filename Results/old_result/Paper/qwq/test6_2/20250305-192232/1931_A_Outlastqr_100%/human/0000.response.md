Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has a word made up of exactly three lowercase Latin letters. Each letter has a position in the alphabet from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, and so on up to 'z' being 26. He encodes the word by summing up the positions of its letters. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24.

But the problem is that this encoding can be ambiguous because different words can have the same sum. For instance, "ava" also sums to 24. So, given a sum n, I need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to that sum.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible words that could have the same sum, I need to pick the one that would come first in a dictionary. So, for example, "aav" comes before "ava" because the first two letters are 'a' and 'a', and the third letter 'v' comes before 'v' in the alphabet.

Okay, so my task is, for a given sum n (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78), to find the smallest possible word of three letters that sums to n.

Let me think about the constraints. The smallest possible sum is 3, which would be "aaa" (1+1+1=3), and the largest possible sum is 78, which would be "zzz" (26+26+26=78).

Now, I need to find, for any n between 3 and 78, the smallest word that sums to n.

I should probably start by trying to minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

Let me consider that. To make the word lex smallest, I should make the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

So, for example, if n=24, possible words are "cat" (3+1+20=24) and "ava" (1+22+1=24). But "aav" would be even smaller because 'a' is smaller than 'c' and 'v' is smaller than 't'.

Wait, but in "ava", the second letter is 'v', which is larger than 'a', so "aav" would be smaller than "ava".

Wait, but "aav" sums to 1+1+22=24, which is the same as "ava". So both are valid, but "aav" is lex smaller.

Wait, no, "aav" is "a","a","v", which is "aav", and "ava" is "a","v","a". So "aav" comes before "ava" because the second letter 'a' is smaller than 'v'.

So, to make it lex smallest, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, I should try to make the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to iterate through all possible three-letter combinations, calculate their sums, and find the one with the smallest lex that sums to n.

But that's inefficient, especially since t can be up to 100 and n up to 78.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the constraints again.

Each letter is from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to 1 to 26.

So, for three letters, the sum is between 3 and 78.

I need to find the smallest lex word that sums to n.

To make it lex smallest, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, I should set the first letter to 'a' if possible, then the second to 'a' if possible, and so on.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the sum is n.

So, let's consider that.

Let me denote the three letters as l1, l2, l3, where each is between 1 and 26.

I need l1 + l2 + l3 = n.

And I need to minimize l1, then l2, then l3.

So, to minimize l1, I should set l1 to the smallest possible value, which is 1 ('a'), as long as l2 + l3 can make up the remaining sum.

Similarly for l2 and l3.

Wait, but I need to ensure that l2 and l3 can reach the remaining sum without exceeding their maximum value of 26.

So, let's think step by step.

First, set l1 to the smallest possible value, which is 1.

Then, set l2 to the smallest possible value, which is 1.

Then, set l3 to n - l1 - l2.

But I need to make sure that l3 is between 1 and 26.

If l3 is greater than 26, then I need to increase l2.

So, starting with l1=1, l2=1, l3=n-2.

If l3 > 26, then set l2=1 + (l3 - 26), and l3=26.

Wait, that might not be the right way.

Let me think differently.

I need to distribute the sum n among three letters, minimizing the first letter, then the second, then the third.

This sounds like a standard problem of distributing indistinct items into distinct bins with limits.

In this case, the bins are the three letters, and each bin has a capacity from 1 to 26.

So, I need to minimize l1, then l2, then l3, such that l1 + l2 + l3 = n, and each l is between 1 and 26.

This is similar to distributing n-3 units into three bins, each bin can hold from 0 to 23 extra units (since minimum is 1).

Wait, because if I set each l to at least 1, then I have n-3 units to distribute among three bins, each of which can hold up to 25 extra units (since 26-1=25).

But I need to maximize l3, because to have the smallest lex order, l1 should be as small as possible, then l2, then l3.

Wait, no, to have the smallest lex order, l1 should be minimized, then l2 given l1, then l3 given l1 and l2.

So, I need to minimize l1, then l2, then l3.

Wait, but in practice, to make it lex smallest, I should minimize l1 first, then for the remaining sum, minimize l2, and then l3 is determined.

So, set l1 to 1, then set l2 to 1, then l3 to n-2.

If l3 > 26, then increase l2 by (l3 - 26), and set l3 to 26.

If l2 exceeds 26, then increase l1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to iterate through l1 from 1 to 26, and for each l1, iterate l2 from 1 to 26, and set l3 = n - l1 - l2, and check if l3 is between 1 and 26.

But that's inefficient for large t.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that to minimize l1, I should set it to the smallest possible value, which is 1, as long as l2 and l3 can sum to n - 1, with each being at least 1 and at most 26.

So, l2 + l3 = n - 1.

And l2 and l3 are between 1 and 26.

So, the minimum sum l2 + l3 can be is 2 (1+1), and the maximum is 52 (26+26).

So, if n - 1 >= 2 and n - 1 <= 52, then l1 can be 1.

Otherwise, l1 needs to be higher.

Wait, n is between 3 and 78, so n - 1 is between 2 and 77.

But l2 + l3 can be up to 52, so if n - 1 > 52, then l1 needs to be at least n - 52.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If l1 + l2 + l3 = n, with each li between 1 and 26.

Then, to minimize l1, set l1 = max(1, n - 52).

Because l2 + l3 can be at most 52.

So, if n - 52 > 1, then l1 must be at least n - 52.

Otherwise, l1 can be 1.

Wait, let's verify this.

Suppose n = 55.

Then, l1 >= 55 - 52 = 3.

So, l1 = 3, l2 + l3 = 52, which is achievable with l2=26, l3=26.

So, the word would be 'czz'.

Similarly, for n=24, l1 can be 1, since 24 - 1 = 23, which is less than or equal to 52.

So, l1=1, l2=1, l3=22, which is 'aav'.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=24, the output is 'aav'.

Similarly, for n=70, it's 'rzz'.

Wait, but according to my previous logic, for n=70, l1 >=70-52=18, which corresponds to 'r', and l2 and l3 are both 'z'.

So, 'rzz'.

Yes, that matches the sample output.

Similarly, for n=3, it's 'aaa'.

For n=55, it's 'czz'.

For n=48, it's 'auz'.

Wait, according to my earlier logic, for n=55, l1 >=55-52=3, which is 'c', and l2 and l3 are both 'z'.

So, 'czz'.

But in the sample output, for n=48, it's 'auz'.

Let me check that.

If n=48, l1 >=48-52, but that's negative, so l1 starts at 1.

Wait, my earlier logic seems flawed.

If n - 52 > 1, then l1 >= n - 52.

Otherwise, l1 =1.

But if n - 52 <=1, then l1=1.

Wait, for n=48, n-52= -4, which is less than 1, so l1=1.

Then, l2 + l3 =47.

Which can be achieved with l2=1, l3=46, but 46 is greater than 26.

So, l2=1, l3=26, and the remaining is l2=1 + (47-26)=21, so l2=21, l3=26.

So, l1=1, l2=21, l3=26, which is 'a u z'.

Yes, that matches the sample output.

So, the general approach is:

- Set l1 to the maximum of 1 and n - 52.

- Then, set l2 to the maximum of 1 and n - l1 - 26).

- Then, set l3 to n - l1 - l2.

This should give the lex smallest word.

Wait, but I need to ensure that l2 is minimized as well, given l1.

So, to minimize l2, set l2 to 1, as long as l3 is between 1 and 26.

So, for a given l1, set l2=1, and l3=n - l1 -1.

If l3 >26, then increase l2 by (l3 -26), and set l3=26.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Set l1 to max(1, n -52).

- Set l2 to max(1, n - l1 -26).

- Set l3 to n - l1 - l2.

- Convert l1, l2, l3 to corresponding letters.

- Print the word.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=24, it's 'aav', which is l1=1, l2=1, l3=22.

According to my logic, l1=max(1,24-52)=1, l2=max(1,24-1-26)=max(1,-3)=1, l3=24-1-1=22, which is 'aav'. Correct.

For n=70, l1=max(1,70-52)=18, which is 'r', l2=max(1,70-18-26)=max(1,26)=26, l3=70-18-26=26, which is 'rzz'. Correct.

For n=3, l1=max(1,3-52)=1, l2=max(1,3-1-26)=max(1,-24)=1, l3=3-1-1=1, which is 'aaa'. Correct.

For n=55, l1=max(1,55-52)=3, 'c', l2=max(1,55-3-26)=max(1,26)=26, l3=55-3-26=26, which is 'czz'. Correct.

For n=48, l1=max(1,48-52)=1, l2=max(1,48-1-26)=max(1,21)=21, l3=48-1-21=26, which is 'a u z'. Correct.

So, this logic seems to work.

Now, in the code provided, it seems to handle different cases based on the value of n.

Let me look at the code.

The function func() reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, and then constructs the word based on certain conditions.

It uses string.ascii_lowercase to get the letters.

Then, for n >52, it sets word to alphabet[n-53] + 'zz'.

Wait, for n=53, alphabet[53-53]=alphabet[0]='a' + 'zz' = 'azz', which sums to 1 + 26 + 26 =53. Correct.

For n=54, 'bzz' sums to 2 + 26 + 26=54. Correct.

And so on up to n=78, 'zzz'.

For n >27 and n <=52, it sets word to 'a' + alphabet[n-28] + 'z'.

Wait, for n=28, 'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z' = 'aaz', which sums to 1 +1 +26=28. Correct.

For n=29, 'aabz'. Wait, alphabet[1]= 'b', so 'abz' sums to 1+2+26=29. Correct.

Up to n=52, 'azz' sums to 1+26+26=52. Correct.

For n=27, it sets word to 'aay', which sums to 1+1+25=27. Correct.

For n <=27, it sets word to 'aa' + alphabet[n-3]. For n=3, 'aaa'. For n=4, 'aa b'. Correct.

So, this code seems to handle all cases correctly.

But is there a better way?

Well, perhaps, but this seems to work.

Now, to make it more efficient or cleaner, but since t is up to 100 and n is up to 78, and the operations are simple, it's fine.

I think the code is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given value `n`, where each letter's position in the alphabet corresponds to its value (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

## Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), which is the sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. We need to find the smallest possible word (in lexicographical order) that adds up to this sum.
2. **Minimizing Lexicographical Order:** To achieve the smallest lex order, we should minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
3. **Handling Constraints:** Each letter must be between 'a' (1) and 'z' (26). We need to ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `n`.

## Solution Code
```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        if n > 52:
            l1 = alphabet[n - 53]
            l2 = l3 = 'z'
        elif n > 27:
            l1 = 'a'
            l2 = alphabet[n - 28]
            l3 = 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            l1 = l2 = 'a'
            l3 = 'y'
        else:
            l1 = l2 = 'a'
            l3 = alphabet[n - 3]
        word = l1 + l2 + l3
        print(word)

# Assuming this function is called appropriately in the main section
```

## Explanation
- **For n > 52:** The first letter is set to the letter corresponding to `(n - 53)`, and the next two letters are 'z'. This is because 'zz' contributes 52 to the sum, so the first letter should be `(n - 52)`.
- **For 27 < n ≤ 52:** The first letter is 'a', the second letter is adjusted to `(n - 28)`, and the third letter is 'z'. Here, 'az' contributes `(1 + 26) = 27`, so the second letter is adjusted for the remaining sum.
- **For n = 27:** The word is 'aay' since 'aa' contributes 2, and 'y' contributes 25, totaling 27.
- **For n ≤ 27:** The first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is adjusted to `(n - 3)`. For example, 'aaa' for n=3, 'aab' for n=4, etc.

This approach ensures that we always get the smallest possible word in lex order for the given sum `n`.
