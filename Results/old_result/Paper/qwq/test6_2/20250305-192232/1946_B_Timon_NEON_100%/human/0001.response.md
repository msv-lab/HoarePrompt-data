Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform exactly k operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after k such operations, and I need to output this sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation does. When I select a subarray, calculate its sum, and insert that sum back into the array, where can I insert it? The problem says "anywhere in the array," so I can choose any position to insert this new element. This means that I can effectively add the sum of the subarray to the array, potentially creating new elements that can be part of future subarrays.

I need to think about how to maximize the sum of the array after k operations. Since I can choose any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere, I should look for a way to repeatedly add large positive sums to the array.

But wait, the array can contain negative numbers as well. So, I need to be careful about which subarrays I choose to sum and insert. Including negative subarrays could decrease the total sum.

Let me consider the properties of the operations:

1. Selecting an empty subarray gives a sum of 0, which I can insert anywhere. This doesn't change the sum of the array.

2. Selecting a subarray with positive sum and inserting it increases the total sum by that positive amount.

3. Selecting a subarray with negative sum and inserting it decreases the total sum by that negative amount.

So, to maximize the sum, I should aim to insert subarrays with the largest possible positive sums, and avoid inserting subarrays with negative sums.

But I have to perform exactly k operations. So, I need a strategy to choose which subarrays to insert in each of the k operations to maximize the total sum.

I recall that in problems involving maximizing the sum of subarrays, the maximum subarray sum is often a key component. Maybe I can find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and keep inserting that sum in each operation.

But wait, there might be overlapping subarrays or something like that. I need to think carefully.

Let me consider a simple example to get some intuition.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 2

a = [-4, -7]

In this case, all elements are negative. The maximum sum of any subarray is 0, which corresponds to choosing an empty subarray. So, in each operation, I can choose an empty subarray, insert 0 into the array, and the sum increases by 0 each time. After two operations, the sum is still -4 + -7 + 0 + 0 = -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

This matches the first output in the example.

Another example:

n = 3, k = 3

a = [2, 2, 8]

Here, all elements are positive. The maximum sum subarray is the entire array, sum = 12.

In the first operation, I can choose the entire array and insert 12, making the array [2, 2, 8, 12].

In the second operation, the maximum sum subarray is still the entire array, sum = 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 = 24. Insert 24, making the array [2, 2, 8, 12, 24].

In the third operation, the maximum sum subarray is the entire array again, sum = 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 48. Insert 48, making the array [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48].

The total sum is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96, which matches the second output in the example.

From these examples, it seems that in each operation, choosing the sum of the entire array and inserting it maximizes the sum. This is because the array contains only positive numbers, so each insertion adds the maximum possible value.

But what if the array has both positive and negative numbers?

Take the fourth test case:

n = 5, k = 1

a = [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]

Here, I can choose different subarrays. If I choose the subarray [4, -2, 8], its sum is 10. Inserting 10 at the beginning makes the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9], with sum 17.

Alternatively, choosing the subarray [8], sum is 8, and inserting it elsewhere might not give a better sum.

So, in this case, choosing the maximum sum subarray and inserting it once gives the optimal sum.

This suggests a general strategy: in each operation, choose the maximum sum subarray and insert its sum into the array.

But is this always optimal? Let's think about it.

Suppose I have an array with both positive and negative numbers. If I choose the maximum sum subarray in each operation and insert its sum, I'm adding the largest possible positive sum each time.

However, by inserting a large positive sum, I'm creating a new element that can be part of future subarrays. This new element can be included in the next maximum sum subarray, potentially allowing me to add even larger sums in subsequent operations.

Wait, but in the example above with [4, -2, 8, -12, 9], after inserting 10 at the beginning, the new array is [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9]. The maximum sum subarray is now [10, 4, -2, 8], sum = 20. If I insert 20, the array becomes [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9, 20], with sum = 37.

But the problem allows only k = 1 operation in this test case, so I can't perform multiple operations here.

Anyway, the general idea seems to be to always choose the maximum sum subarray and insert its sum in each operation.

But how do I efficiently compute the maximum sum subarray in each operation? Computing it from scratch each time would be too slow if n and k are large.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, n and k can be up to 2*10^5, and the total sum of n and k across all test cases is also up to 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum sum subarray efficiently, and since I have to perform this k times, I need to find a way to do it in O(1) time per operation or something similar.

Let me think differently. Suppose I find the maximum sum subarray once, and then in each operation, I insert its sum into the array. But since inserting a new element changes the array, the maximum sum subarray might change.

However, in the example with all positive numbers, inserting the sum of the entire array keeps increasing the sum, and the maximum sum subarray is always the entire array.

Wait, but in that case, the sum after k operations is sum(a) + sum(a) * (2^k - 1). Wait, let's think carefully.

If I start with sum S, and in each operation, I insert S, then the new sum becomes S + S = 2S. In the next operation, I insert 2S, making the sum 2S + 2S = 4S. And so on. So after k operations, the sum is S * 2^k.

But in the example, starting with [2,2,8], sum=12. After first insertion, sum=24. Second insertion, sum=48. Third insertion, sum=96, which matches the example.

So, in this case, the sum after k operations is sum(a) * 2^k.

But in the first test case, with sum(a) = -11, and k=2, the sum after k operations is -11 * 2^2 = -44, but in the explanation, it's -11, which is different. Wait, in that case, they are inserting 0 in each operation, so the sum remains -11.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1). Wait, let's see.

In the positive sum case, sum(a)=12, max_subarray_sum=12. So, sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1) = 12 + 12*(2^3 -1) = 12 + 12*7 = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches the example.

In the first test case, sum(a)=-11, max_subarray_sum=0 (from empty subarray). So, sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1) = -11 + 0*(2^2 -1) = -11 + 0 = -11, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1).

But wait, in the fourth test case, n=5, k=1, a=[4,-2,8,-12,9]. sum(a)=4-2+8-12+9=7. max_subarray_sum=10 (from [4,-2,8]). According to the formula, sum(a) + max_subarray_sum*(2^1 -1) = 7 + 10*(1) = 17, which matches the fourth output in the example.

So, it seems that the formula is sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1), and the answer is this sum modulo 10^9+7.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, n=6, k=1000, a=[-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000], sum(a)=-6000000000, max_subarray_sum=0 (from empty subarray). So, sum(a) + max_subarray_sum*(2^k -1) = -6000000000 + 0*(2^1000 -1) = -6000000000, which modulo 10^9+7 is (-6*(10^9+7) + 42) = -6000000000 + 42 = -5999999958. But in the example, the output is 42.

Wait, but -6*(10^9+7) + 42 = -6000000000 + 42 = -5999999958, but modulo 10^9+7, it should be equivalent to -5999999958 mod (10^9+7). But 10^9+7 is 1000000007, so -5999999958 mod 1000000007.

Wait, -5999999958 divided by 1000000007 is -6 with a remainder of 42, because -6*1000000007 = -6000000042, and -5999999958 - (-6000000042) = 84, which doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, to compute -5999999958 mod 1000000007, I can add 1000000007 until I get a positive number.

-5999999958 + 6*1000000007 = -5999999958 + 6000000042 = 84.

Wait, but the example output is 42, not 84. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute (sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1)) mod (10^9+7), but considering that sum(a) and max_subarray_sum can be negative, I need to handle negative numbers correctly in the modulo operation.

In Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a negative remainder, so I need to adjust it to get a positive remainder between 0 and 10^9+6.

So, to compute x mod m, I can use (x % m + m) % m to ensure it's positive.

So, in this case, -5999999958 mod 1000000007 would be (-5999999958 % 1000000007 + 1000000007) % 1000000007.

Let's compute -5999999958 % 1000000007.

First, 5999999958 / 1000000007 = 5.999999958, so floor division is 5.

So, 1000000007 * 5 = 5000000035

5999999958 - 5000000035 = 999999923

So, -5999999958 % 1000000007 = -999999923

Then, (-999999923 + 1000000007) % 1000000007 = 84

But the example output is 42, which doesn't match. So perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, in the seventh test case, the output is 42, but according to my formula, it should be 84. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in that test case, max_subarray_sum is not 0, but something else.

Wait, if all elements are negative, the maximum sum subarray is the largest single element, which is -1000000000, but if I choose the empty subarray, sum is 0.

So, in this case, choosing to insert 0 in each operation would keep the sum as sum(a), which is -6000000000, which modulo 10^9+7 is 42, as per the example.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it should be 84, but the example shows 42.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the seventh test case, sum(a) = -6000000000, max_subarray_sum = 0.

So, sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1) = -6000000000 + 0*(2^1000 -1) = -6000000000.

Now, to compute -6000000000 mod 1000000007.

First, 6000000000 / 1000000007 = 5.999999958, so floor division is 5.

1000000007 * 5 = 5000000035

6000000000 - 5000000035 = 999999965

So, -6000000000 % 1000000007 = -999999965

Then, (-999999965 + 1000000007) % 1000000007 = 42

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct way to compute the modulo is to add m and take modulo m if the result is negative.

Therefore, the formula is sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1), and then take modulo 10^9+7, ensuring a positive result.

So, to implement this, I need to:

1. Compute sum(a).

2. Compute the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, which could be the empty subarray with sum 0 if all elements are negative.

3. Use the formula sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1), and take modulo 10^9+7.

But, I need to handle negative sums correctly in the modulo operation.

Also, since n and k can be up to 2*10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n and k across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum sum subarray for each test case.

The standard way to compute the maximum sum subarray is Kadane's algorithm, which runs in O(n) time, which is acceptable here.

So, in code, I can:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array a.

- Compute sum_a = sum(a).

- Compute max_subarray_sum using Kadane's algorithm.

- If max_subarray_sum is negative, set it to 0, because choosing the empty subarray is better in that case.

- Compute the answer as (sum_a + max_subarray_sum * (pow(2, k, 1000000007) - 1)) % 1000000007.

- But need to handle negative sums correctly.

Wait, but pow(2, k, 1000000007) computes 2^k mod 10^9+7, which is fine for large k.

But I need to compute sum_a + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1), and then take modulo 10^9+7.

But sum_a can be negative, so I need to ensure that the final result is positive.

In Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a negative remainder, so I need to adjust it.

I can compute (sum_a + max_subarray_sum * (pow(2, k, 1000000007) -1)) % 1000000007, and if the result is negative, add 1000000007 and take modulo again.

Alternatively, I can compute it as (sum_a % 1000000007 + max_subarray_sum % 1000000007 * (pow(2, k, 1000000007) -1) % 1000000007) % 1000000007.

But since sum_a can be negative, I need to compute sum_a modulo 10^9+7 correctly.

In Python, to handle negative numbers correctly, I can use (x % m + m) % m.

So, I can compute sum_a_mod = (sum_a % 1000000007 + 1000000007) % 1000000007

Similarly for max_subarray_sum_mod = (max_subarray_sum % 1000000007 + 1000000007) % 1000000007

Then compute (sum_a_mod + max_subarray_sum_mod * (pow(2, k, 1000000007) -1)) % 1000000007

This should give the correct result.

Now, let's think about implementing Kadane's algorithm.

Kadane's algorithm works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current sum and the maximum sum found so far.

Initialize current_sum = 0, max_sum = -infinity

For each element in the array:

current_sum += element

if current_sum > max_sum, set max_sum = current_sum

if current_sum < 0, set current_sum = 0

But in this problem, if all elements are negative, choosing the empty subarray is better, so max_subarray_sum should be 0 in that case.

So, after running Kadane's algorithm, if max_sum is negative, set max_subarray_sum = 0; else, set it to max_sum.

Wait, but in the standard Kadane's algorithm, if all elements are negative, max_sum is the largest single element, which is negative. So, in that case, we should set max_subarray_sum = 0.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in code, after running Kadane's algorithm, if max_sum < 0, set max_subarray_sum = 0; else, set it to max_sum.

Then, proceed with the formula as above.

I think this should work.

Let me verify with the seventh test case.

sum_a = -6000000000

max_subarray_sum = 0

So, answer = (-6000000000 + 0 * (2^1000 -1)) % 1000000007

Which is -6000000000 % 1000000007

As computed earlier, it's 42, which matches the example output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2, a=[-4,-7]

sum_a = -11

max_subarray_sum = 0

answer = (-11 + 0*(2^2 -1)) % 1000000007 = -11 % 1000000007 = 999999996, which matches the first output in the example.

Another test case:

n=3, k=3, a=[2,2,8]

sum_a = 12

max_subarray_sum = 12

answer = (12 + 12*(2^3 -1)) % 1000000007 = 12 + 12*7 = 96, which matches the second output.

Seems correct.

So, in terms of implementation, I need to:

- Implement a function to compute sum(a) modulo 10^9+7, handling negative sums correctly.

- Implement Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray, and set it to 0 if it's negative.

- Compute the formula as described, using modular arithmetic.

- Make sure that the operations are efficient, given the constraints.

I need to be careful with overflow, but since we're dealing with modulo 10^9+7, which is a common prime modulus in programming problems, I can use the properties of modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so I don't have to worry about overflow, but it's still good to use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable.

Also, since k can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n and k across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

I think this approach should work.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray (which could be empty) and inserting its sum back into the array.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Read the number of test cases, t.
   - For each test case, read n (length of the array), k (number of operations), and the array a.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the sum, identify the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (using Kadane's algorithm). If all elements are negative, choosing an empty subarray with sum 0 is beneficial.
   - The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum in each operation.

3. **Formula:**
   - Compute the sum of the array, sum_a.
   - Find the maximum subarray sum, max_subarray_sum.
   - If max_subarray_sum is negative, set it to 0 (choosing the empty subarray).
   - The final sum after k operations is given by: 
     \[
     \text{sum\_a} + \text{max\_subarray\_sum} \times (2^k - 1)
     \]
   - Take this result modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers.

4. **Modulo Handling:**
   - Ensure the sum is correctly handled modulo 10^9 + 7, especially considering negative sums.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    MOD = 1000000007
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Compute sum of the array
        sum_a = sum(a)
        
        # Compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_ending_here = max_so_far = a[0]
        for x in a[1:]:
            max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
        # If max_so_far is negative, set max_subarray_sum to 0
        max_subarray_sum = max_so_far if max_so_far > 0 else 0
        
        # Compute the answer
        sum_a_mod = (sum_a % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        max_subarray_sum_mod = (max_subarray_sum % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        two_power_k_mod = pow(2, k, MOD)
        answer = (sum_a_mod + max_subarray_sum_mod * (two_power_k_mod - 1)) % MOD
        print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of the array, sum_a.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - If this sum is negative, set it to 0 since choosing an empty subarray is more beneficial.

3. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - Use the formula to compute the final sum after k operations.
   - Ensure all operations are taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers and negative values correctly.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the final sum modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required result for each test case within the given constraints.
