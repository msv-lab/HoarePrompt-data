Alright, so I've got this problem here. It's about finding an integer y, where 1 â‰¤ y < x, such that the sum of y and the greatest common divisor of x and y (gcd(x, y)) is maximized. I need to determine if the provided Python program correctly solves this problem for multiple test cases.

First, let's understand the problem statement clearly. I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y that is less than x, such that when I add y to its gcd with x, the result is as large as possible. And I have to do this for multiple test cases.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

So for x=10, y=5 gives gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10.

For x=7, y=6 gives gcd(7,6)=1, so 6 + 1 = 7.

For x=21, y=18 gives gcd(21,18)=3, so 18 + 3 = 21.

For x=100, y=98 gives gcd(100,98)=2, so 98 + 2 = 100.

For x=2, y=1 gives gcd(2,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2.

For x=1000, y=750 gives gcd(1000,750)=250, so 750 + 250 = 1000.

For x=6, y=3 gives gcd(6,3)=3, so 3 + 3 = 6.

Interesting, in all these cases, y + gcd(x, y) equals x. Is that always the case?

Wait, no. For x=10, y=5: 5 + 5 = 10.

For x=7, y=6: 6 + 1 = 7.

For x=21, y=18: 18 + 3 = 21.

For x=100, y=98: 98 + 2 = 100.

For x=2, y=1: 1 + 1 = 2.

For x=1000, y=750: 750 + 250 = 1000.

For x=6, y=3: 3 + 3 = 6.

So in every case, y + gcd(x, y) = x.

Is this always possible? Let's see.

Suppose y + gcd(x, y) = x.

Then, gcd(x, y) = x - y.

But gcd(x, y) also divides both x and y.

So, gcd(x, y) divides x and y, hence it should divide x - y.

Wait, but x - y = gcd(x, y).

So, gcd(x, y) divides itself, which is always true.

But also, since gcd(x, y) divides y, and x - y = gcd(x, y), then gcd(x, y) divides y.

Wait, gcd(x, y) divides y, and x - y = gcd(x, y), so gcd(x, y) divides y and x.

This seems consistent.

So, y + gcd(x, y) = x seems achievable.

But is this always the maximum possible?

Let's consider if there exists a y where y + gcd(x, y) > x.

Is that possible?

Let's suppose y < x, as per the constraints.

Then y + gcd(x, y) > x implies gcd(x, y) > x - y.

But gcd(x, y) divides both x and y, and hence divides x - y.

So, gcd(x, y) divides x - y, and gcd(x, y) > x - y.

But gcd(x, y) is at least 1, and x - y is positive since y < x.

Wait, but if gcd(x, y) divides x - y and gcd(x, y) > x - y, then gcd(x, y) must be at least x - y + 1.

But gcd(x, y) divides x - y, so if gcd(x, y) > x - y, then x - y must be a multiple of gcd(x, y), but x - y < gcd(x, y), which is only possible if x - y = 0, but y < x, so x - y >=1.

Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible for y + gcd(x, y) > x.

Let me think of an example.

Take x=10.

Possible y values: 1 to 9.

Compute y + gcd(10, y):

y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

y=4: 4 + 2 = 6

y=5: 5 + 5 = 10

y=6: 6 + 2 = 8

y=7: 7 + 1 = 8

y=8: 8 + 2 = 10

y=9: 9 + 1 = 10

So, the maximum is 10, achieved by y=5, y=8, and y=9.

So, y + gcd(x, y) cannot exceed x in this case.

Another example: x=7.

Possible y: 1 to 6.

y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

y=2: 2 + 1 = 3

y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

y=4: 4 + 1 = 5

y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

y=6: 6 + 1 = 7

Again, maximum is 7.

Similarly for x=21.

So, it seems that y + gcd(x, y) cannot exceed x.

Hence, the maximum possible value is x, and we need to find any y < x such that y + gcd(x, y) = x.

Is this always achievable?

Yes, because at least y= x -1 can be chosen.

For y= x -1, gcd(x, x-1) =1, since consecutive integers are coprime.

So, y + gcd(x, y) = (x -1) +1 = x.

Hence, y= x -1 always works.

But the problem says "any y that satisfies the condition", so y= x -1 is always a valid choice.

But looking back at the example, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which also satisfies y + gcd(x, y)=10.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which also satisfies y + gcd(7,6)=7.

For x=21, y=18 is chosen, which y + gcd(21,18)=18 + 3=21.

So, in each case, y is chosen such that y + gcd(x, y)=x.

Hence, the program seems to be aiming for y + gcd(x, y)=x.

But in the program provided:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

x = int(input())

y = x - 1

print(y)

So, it simply chooses y= x -1 for each test case.

Is this always correct?

Well, as I reasoned earlier, y= x -1 always satisfies y + gcd(x, y)=x, since gcd(x, x-1)=1.

Hence, it seems correct.

But let's check if there are cases where y= x -1 is not the best choice.

Wait, in the example, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which also gives y + gcd(x, y)=10, same as y=9.

So, y=9 is also a valid choice, as is y=5.

The problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

Hence, y= x -1 is always a valid choice.

Is there any x where y= x -1 does not work?

Let's think about x=2.

y=1, gcd(2,1)=1, y + gcd(x, y)=1 +1=2, which is correct.

Another example: x=6.

y=5, gcd(6,5)=1, y + gcd(x, y)=5 +1=6.

But in the example, y=3 is chosen, which also gives y + gcd(6,3)=3 +3=6.

So, both y=3 and y=5 are valid.

Hence, y= x -1 is always a valid choice, and the program is correct in choosing y= x -1 for each test case.

Hence, the program is correct.
