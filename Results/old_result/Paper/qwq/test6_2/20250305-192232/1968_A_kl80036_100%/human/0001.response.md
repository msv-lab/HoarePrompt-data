Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x and at least 1, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, the result is as large as possible. Basically, I need to maximize gcd(x, y) + y.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. The greatest common divisor of x and y is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, because 2 is the biggest number that divides both 6 and 4.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to choose y in a way that this sum is as big as possible, given that y is less than x.

Let me think about how gcd(x, y) relates to y. If y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is equal to y, because y divides both x and itself. In that case, gcd(x, y) + y would be y + y = 2y. So, if y divides x, the sum is 2y.

If y does not divide x, then gcd(x, y) is some number less than y, let's say d. So, the sum would be d + y. Since d is less than y (because y doesn't divide x), this sum would be less than y + y, which is 2y.

Wait a minute, if y divides x, then gcd(x, y) = y, so gcd(x, y) + y = 2y. If y does not divide x, then gcd(x, y) < y, so gcd(x, y) + y < 2y. Therefore, to maximize gcd(x, y) + y, I should choose y that divides x, because that makes the sum equal to 2y, which is larger than anything I'd get if y didn't divide x.

So, the best y is a divisor of x, and among all divisors of x that are less than x, I should pick the one that makes 2y as large as possible. That means I should pick the largest divisor of x that is less than x.

For example, if x is 10, the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since y must be less than x, the possible y values are 1, 2, and 5. The largest among these is 5, so y should be 5. Indeed, in the sample input, for x=10, the output is 5.

Similarly, for x=7, which is a prime number, the divisors are 1 and 7. Since y must be less than x, y=1 is the only option. And in the sample input, for x=7, the output is 6. Wait, that doesn't match my expectation. According to my reasoning, y should be 1, but the sample output is 6.

Hmm, maybe my initial reasoning is incomplete. Let's check another sample input. For x=21, the divisors are 1, 3, 7, 21. y must be less than x, so y can be 1, 3, or 7. The largest is 7, so according to my reasoning, y should be 7. But the sample output is 18. That's not a divisor of 21. So, my initial assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that y doesn't have to be a divisor of x. Maybe sometimes, even if y doesn't divide x, gcd(x, y) + y can be larger than 2y for some y that does divide x.

Let me try y=6 for x=10. gcd(10,6)=2, so 2 + 6 = 8. Compare this to y=5, which is a divisor: gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10. 10 is larger than 8, so in this case, choosing a divisor is better.

For x=7, y=1: gcd(7,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2. But the sample output is y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, so 1 + 6 = 7, which is larger than 2. So, in this case, choosing y=6 is better than choosing y=1.

Wait, but y=6 does not divide x=7, so according to my initial assumption, I thought choosing a divisor would be best, but in this case, choosing a non-divisor gives a better result.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect. Choosing y to be a divisor of x is not always the best choice.

Let me think differently. I need to maximize gcd(x, y) + y. Let's consider that gcd(x, y) is some divisor d of x and y. So, d divides both x and y.

Let me express x and y in terms of d. Let x = d * k, and y = d * m, where k and m are coprime integers (since d is the greatest common divisor).

Then, gcd(x, y) + y = d + d * m = d(1 + m).

I need to maximize d(1 + m), given that y = d * m < x = d * k, and m < k (since y < x).

So, d(1 + m) is to be maximized, with d being a divisor of x, and m being an integer such that m < k and gcd(m, k) = 1.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for a fixed d, which is a divisor of x, I can choose m such that y = d * m < x, and m and k are coprime.

Given that, for a fixed d, m can be up to floor((x - 1)/d), and m must be such that gcd(m, k) = 1.

So, for each possible d (divisor of x), I can find the maximum m such that m < k and gcd(m, k) = 1, then y = d * m.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can simplify this.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- x=10, y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, 5+5=10

- x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, 1+6=7

- x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, 3+18=21

- x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, 2+98=100

- x=2, y=1: gcd(2,1)=1, 1+1=2

- x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, 250+750=1000

- x=6, y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, 3+3=6

In all these cases, gcd(x,y) + y equals x. Is that always the case?

Wait, in all these samples, gcd(x,y) + y = x.

Let me check if that's possible in general.

gcd(x,y) + y = x

Then, gcd(x,y) = x - y

But gcd(x,y) divides both x and y, so it must divide x - y.

Wait, actually, gcd(x,y) divides any linear combination of x and y, including x - y.

But in this case, gcd(x,y) = x - y, which means that x - y divides both x and y.

Let me see if x - y divides x and y.

If d = x - y, then d divides x and d divides y.

Since d divides x and d divides y, then d divides x - y, which is d, which is trivial.

But also, if d divides x and y, then d divides gcd(x,y).

But in this case, d = gcd(x,y), so it's consistent.

So, in these samples, choosing y such that x - y divides both x and y.

Wait, in the sample where x=7 and y=6, x - y =1, which divides both 7 and 6.

Similarly, for x=10 and y=5, x - y=5, which divides both 10 and 5.

For x=21 and y=18, x - y=3, which divides both 21 and 18.

For x=100 and y=98, x - y=2, which divides both 100 and 98.

For x=2 and y=1, x - y=1, which divides both 2 and 1.

For x=1000 and y=750, x - y=250, which divides both 1000 and 750.

For x=6 and y=3, x - y=3, which divides both 6 and 3.

So, in all these cases, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Wait, d = x - y, and d divides x and y.

Since d divides x and y, and y = x - d, then d divides x - y = d, which is true.

So, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Then, gcd(x,y) = d, and y = x - d.

So, gcd(x,y) + y = d + (x - d) = x.

Therefore, in these cases, gcd(x,y) + y = x.

Is it always possible to choose y such that gcd(x,y) + y = x?

Well, in the sample inputs, it seems possible.

But is this always the case?

Let me try x=4.

Possible y values: 1,2,3.

Compute gcd(4,1)+1=1+1=2

gcd(4,2)+2=2+2=4

gcd(4,3)+3=1+3=4

So, for y=2 and y=3, gcd(x,y)+y=4.

So, in this case, multiple y values give the maximum sum of 4.

Similarly, for x=5:

y=1: gcd(5,1)+1=1+1=2

y=2: gcd(5,2)+2=1+2=3

y=3: gcd(5,3)+3=1+3=4

y=4: gcd(5,4)+4=1+4=5

So, y=4 gives the maximum sum of 5.

Again, y=4, x-y=1, which divides both 5 and 4.

So, it seems that choosing y = x - d, where d is the smallest possible divisor of x (which is 1), gives y = x - 1.

But in some cases, like x=4, y=2 also gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but in x=4, y=2 and y=3 both give sum=4, which is equal to x.

But y=3 is not x - d where d is a divisor of x.

Wait, x=4, d=1, y=3 = 4 -1.

Wait, d=1 is a divisor of 4.

So, y=3 = 4 -1, where d=1 divides 4.

Similarly, y=2: x - y = 2, which is a divisor of 4.

So, y=2: d=2, which divides 4.

y=3: d=1, which divides 4.

So, in this case, both choices give the maximum sum equal to x.

Therefore, it seems that choosing y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, maximizes gcd(x,y) + y, and this sum equals x.

Is this always the case?

Let me try x=9.

Possible y values: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Compute:

y=1: gcd(9,1)+1=1+1=2

y=2: gcd(9,2)+2=1+2=3

y=3: gcd(9,3)+3=3+3=6

y=4: gcd(9,4)+4=1+4=5

y=5: gcd(9,5)+5=1+5=6

y=6: gcd(9,6)+6=3+6=9

y=7: gcd(9,7)+7=1+7=8

y=8: gcd(9,8)+8=1+8=9

So, y=6 and y=8 both give sum=9.

In this case, y=6 corresponds to d=3 (x - y = 3, which divides 9), and y=8 corresponds to d=1 (x - y=1, which divides 9).

So, again, choosing y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, gives sums equal to x.

Therefore, it seems that the maximum possible sum is x, and to achieve this, I can choose y such that x - y is a divisor of x.

In other words, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Given that, to maximize gcd(x,y) + y, which equals x, I can choose y = x - d, where d is the smallest possible divisor of x.

Wait, but d is a divisor of x, and y = x - d.

To maximize y, I should choose the smallest d, which is d=1.

Therefore, y = x - 1.

In the sample inputs, for x=10, y=5, but according to this, y=9 would give gcd(10,9)+9=1+9=10, which is equal to x.

Wait, but in the sample input, for x=10, y=5 is given, which also gives sum=10.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 gives sum=7.

For x=21, y=18 gives sum=21.

For x=100, y=98 gives sum=100.

For x=2, y=1 gives sum=2.

For x=1000, y=750 gives sum=1000.

For x=6, y=3 gives sum=6.

Wait, for x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, 250+750=1000.

But according to my earlier reasoning, y = x - 1 would also give sum=x.

So, why not choose y = x - 1 always?

In the sample input for x=10, y=5 is given, but y=9 would also give sum=10.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 gives sum=7.

So, y= x -1 seems to work in these cases.

Wait, but for x=21, y=18 is given, which is not x -1 =20.

Wait, gcd(21,20)=1, so gcd(21,20)+20=1+20=21.

But in the sample, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, 3+18=21, same as y=20.

So, y=18 and y=20 both give sum=21.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is given: gcd(100,98)=2, 2+98=100.

But y=99: gcd(100,99)=1, 1+99=100.

So, y=98 and y=99 both give sum=100.

For x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, 250+750=1000.

But y=999: gcd(1000,999)=1, 1+999=1000.

So, y=750 and y=999 both give sum=1000.

Therefore, it seems that choosing y = x -1 always gives sum=x, which is the maximum possible.

So, why not always choose y = x -1?

It seems to work in all the sample inputs provided.

In the sample inputs:

- For x=10, y=5 is given, but y=9 would also give sum=10.

- For x=7, y=6 gives sum=7.

- For x=21, y=18 is given, but y=20 would also give sum=21.

- For x=100, y=98 is given, but y=99 would also give sum=100.

- For x=2, y=1 gives sum=2.

- For x=1000, y=750 is given, but y=999 would also give sum=1000.

- For x=6, y=3 is given, but y=5 would give sum=6.

So, in all these cases, y = x -1 gives sum=x.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x,y) + y, choosing y = x -1 seems to be a valid and simple approach.

Is there any x where y = x -1 does not give sum=x?

Let me check x=4:

y=3: gcd(4,3)+3=1+3=4, which equals x.

Another example, x=5:

y=4: gcd(5,4)+4=1+4=5, which equals x.

x=6:

y=5: gcd(6,5)+5=1+5=6, which equals x.

x=8:

y=7: gcd(8,7)+7=1+7=8, which equals x.

x=9:

y=8: gcd(9,8)+8=1+8=9, which equals x.

So, in all these cases, y = x -1 gives sum=x.

Is there any x where y = x -1 does not give sum=x?

Let me think about x=3:

y=2: gcd(3,2)+2=1+2=3, which equals x.

Another example, x=2:

y=1: gcd(2,1)+1=1+1=2, which equals x.

So, it seems consistent.

Wait, is there any x where y = x -1 does not give sum=x?

Let me consider x=1, but x starts from 2, as per the problem constraints.

Wait, in the problem description, x is at least 2.

So, for all x >= 2, y = x -1 is at least 1, which satisfies the condition y >=1.

Also, y < x is satisfied since y = x -1.

Therefore, y = x -1 is always a valid choice, and it always gives sum=x.

Moreover, in all the sample inputs, sum=x is achieved.

Therefore, the maximum possible sum is x, and y = x -1 is always a valid choice to achieve this sum.

Hence, the program provided, which simply outputs y = x -1 for each test case, is correct.

It always chooses y = x -1, which, as I've shown, achieves the maximum sum of x.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness: True**
