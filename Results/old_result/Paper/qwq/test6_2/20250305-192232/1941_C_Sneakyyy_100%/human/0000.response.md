Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has a string, and he thinks it's ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Otherwise, it's beautiful. My task is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters possible.

First, I need to understand what makes a string ugly. If it has "pie" or "map" anywhere in it, it's ugly. So, to make it beautiful, I need to eliminate all occurrences of these substrings by removing the least number of characters.

Looking at the examples:

- "ppiee" is ugly because it contains "pie".

- "mmap" contains "map".

- "dfpiefghmap" has both "pie" and "map".

- "mathp" is beautiful because it doesn't have "pie" or "map".

- "ppiiee" is also beautiful, probably because the letters are separated in a way that doesn't form "pie" or "map".

So, my goal is to remove characters to break up any "pie" or "map" sequences.

The straightforward approach might be to scan through the string and look for these substrings. Whenever I find one, I need to decide which character(s) to remove to break the sequence.

But, the problem is asking for the minimum number of deletions required. So, I need to be strategic about which characters to remove to minimize the total deletions.

Let me think about how "pie" and "map" can overlap or interact in the string.

For example, in "mmap", it has "map" starting at the second character. So, to make it beautiful, I need to remove at least one character from this "map". Similarly, in "ppiee", I need to break the "pie" substring.

What if there are multiple overlapping instances? For example, in "mappppie", there might be "map" and "pie" close to each other or overlapping.

I need a way to handle overlapping patterns efficiently.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the string and look for "pie" or "map". Whenever I find one, I can remove one character from it and continue checking the remaining string.

But, I need to ensure that removing one character doesn't create a new "pie" or "map" elsewhere.

Wait, but the problem allows me to remove any characters, not just from specific positions. So, I can remove characters from anywhere to break these substrings.

I need an efficient way to do this, especially since the string can be up to 10^6 characters long, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, with the total sum of n across all test cases being up to 10^6.

So, time efficiency is crucial here.

Let me consider a greedy approach. I can iterate through the string and try to build the longest possible beautiful substring by skipping "pie" and "map" sequences.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum number of deletions, not necessarily the longest beautiful substring.

Another idea: use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of deletions needed up to each position in the string.

But dynamic programming might be too slow for the constraints, especially with n up to 10^6 in some test cases.

Let me think of a smarter way.

I recall that in string problems where we need to remove characters to avoid certain substrings, we can use a state machine approach or keep track of the last few characters to decide what to do.

Given that the substrings are of length 3, I can keep track of the last two characters seen. Then, for each new character, I can check if the last three characters form "pie" or "map". If they do, I need to remove one character to break this sequence.

But how do I decide which character to remove to minimize the total deletions?

Maybe I can always remove the current character whenever a forbidden substring is formed. But I need to ensure that this is indeed the optimal choice.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window of size 3 and check for "pie" or "map" in every window. For each occurrence, I can decide to remove one character and adjust the window accordingly.

But I need to make sure that removing one character breaks all occurrences of "pie" and "map" without creating new ones.

Let me consider an example.

Take "mmap":

- Check positions 0-2: "mm a" → not "pie" or "map".

- Positions 1-3: "m a p" → "map" found.

So, I need to remove one character from positions 1, 2, or 3 to break "map".

If I remove the 'a', the string becomes "mpp", which is beautiful.

If I remove 'm' at position 1, it becomes "m a p", still "map".

Wait, no: removing 'm' at position 1 would make it "m a p", which is "m a p", still "map" if read consecutively.

Wait, no, removing 'a' at position 2 would make it "mpp", which doesn't contain "pie" or "map".

Removing 'p' at position 3 would make it "mma", which also doesn't contain "pie" or "map".

So, in this case, removing one character is sufficient.

Another example: "ppiee"

- Check positions 0-2: "ppi" → not "pie" or "map".

- Positions 1-3: "pie" → "pie" found.

So, I need to remove one character from positions 1, 2, or 3 to break "pie".

If I remove 'i', it becomes "ppee", which doesn't contain "pie" or "map".

If I remove 'p' at position 1, it becomes "piee", which still contains "pie".

Wait, no: removing 'p' at position 1 makes it "piee", which still has "pie" from positions 0-2.

Wait, actually, "piee" has "pie" from positions 0-2.

So, removing 'p' at position 1 isn't sufficient; I need to remove at least one character that breaks the "pie" sequence.

Similarly, removing 'e' at position 4 doesn't help because "pie" is still present.

So, in this case, removing 'i' at position 2 breaks the "pie" sequence.

Hence, one deletion is sufficient.

But the answer in the first test case is 2, which suggests that there might be overlapping or multiple occurrences that need to be handled.

Wait, in the first test case, "mmapnapie", the output is 2.

Let's see:

- "mmap" has "map" starting at position 1.

- "napie" has "pie" starting at position 5.

So, I need to handle both "map" and "pie" occurrences.

If I remove one character from "map" and one from "pie", that makes two deletions.

Hence, the output is 2.

Another test case: "azabazapi"

Output is 0, meaning no "pie" or "map" present.

Next: "mappppie"

- "map" at position 0.

- "ppp i e" → no "pie" or "map".

- "pppie" at position 3: "pppie" has "pie" at position 5.

So, need to remove one character from "map" and one from "pie", total 2 deletions.

Another test case: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"

Each "map" needs one deletion, but they overlap, so perhaps fewer deletions are needed.

Wait, the output is 6, and there are 6 "map"s, but they overlap in a way that each deletion might break multiple "map"s.

Wait, no. "mapmapmapmapmapmap" has "map" starting at positions 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.

If I remove one character from each "map", that's 6 deletions.

Alternatively, maybe removing one character can break multiple "map"s if they overlap.

But in this case, they are non-overlapping, so 6 deletions are needed.

Next test case: "p" → already beautiful, so 0 deletions.

Last test case: "pppiepieeee"

- "pppie" has "pie" at position 2.

- "pieie" has "pie" at position 5.

So, need to remove one character from each "pie", totaling 2 deletions.

Hence, the output is 2.

From these observations, it seems that each "pie" or "map" needs at least one deletion to break it.

But if there are overlapping "pie" or "map", maybe one deletion can handle multiple occurrences.

Wait, in the last test case, "pppiepieeee", there are two "pie"s: at positions 2 and 5.

Removing one 'i' at position 3 breaks the first "pie" and the second "pie" is still present.

So, need to remove at least two characters.

Hence, in general, each "pie" or "map" needs at least one deletion, and if they overlap, perhaps fewer deletions can handle multiple occurrences.

But in the given examples, overlaps don't seem to be handled in a way that one deletion can break multiple forbidden substrings.

Wait, in "pppiepieeee", removing 'i' at position 3 breaks the first "pie", but the second "pie" at position 5 is still present, so another deletion is needed.

Hence, in this case, deletions are additive.

Given that, a simple approach would be to scan the string and count the number of "pie" or "map" substrings, and sum up the deletions needed for each.

But I need to ensure that overlapping substrings are handled correctly, i.e., that one deletion doesn't accidentally break multiple substrings.

Wait, but in "pppiepieeee", the two "pie"s don't overlap in a way that one deletion can break both.

Hence, deletions are additive in this case.

Similarly, in "mapmapmapmapmapmap", each "map" is separate, so deletions are additive.

Hence, perhaps a sliding window approach where I look for "pie" or "map" and count the number of such occurrences, considering that each requires one deletion.

But I need to make sure that I don't double-count overlapping substrings.

Wait, in "ppiee", there is "pie" starting at position 1 and potentially at position 2 ("pie") and position 3 ("iee" isn't "pie").

So, there might be overlapping "pie"s.

Wait, in "ppiee", "p i e" and "p i e", but they overlap by two characters.

But in this case, one deletion can break both "pie"s.

For example, removing 'i' at position 1 breaks both "pie"s.

Hence, in such cases, one deletion can handle multiple overlapping "pie"s.

Hence, my previous approach of counting each "pie" or "map" separately and summing deletions might overcount in cases where deletions can break multiple substrings.

Hence, I need a way to handle overlapping substrings efficiently.

Let me consider a different approach.

I can iterate through the string and keep track of forbidden substrings.

Whenever I find a "pie" or "map", I increment the deletion count and skip ahead by one character, as removing one character would break this substring.

But I need to ensure that this doesn't miss any overlapping substrings.

Wait, for example, in "ppiee":

- At position 1: "pie" found, delete one character, say position 1 ('i').

- Now, the string becomes "ppee", which doesn't contain "pie" or "map".

Hence, one deletion suffices.

Similarly, in "pppiepieeee":

- At position 2: "pie" found, delete one character, say position 2 ('i').

- Now, the string becomes "pppepieeee".

- At position 3: "pep" isn't "pie" or "map".

- At position 4: "eie" isn't "pie" or "map".

Hence, one deletion suffices, but according to the example, it's 2 deletions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in "pppiepieeee", if I delete 'i' at position 2, the string becomes "pppepieeee", which still contains "pie" starting at position 5.

Hence, I need to delete again at position 5.

Hence, total deletions are 2.

Hence, in this approach, I need to iterate through the string and whenever I find a "pie" or "map", I increment the deletion count and skip ahead by three characters, because removing one character breaks the substring, and I need to check the next potential substring starting after the removed character.

Wait, perhaps I need to skip ahead by two characters, as removing one character breaks the current substring and the next substring would start after the removed character.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me think differently.

I can model this as finding the minimum number of deletions to break all "pie" and "map" substrings.

This sounds similar to interval covering problems, where each "pie" or "map" is an interval of three characters that needs to be broken.

To break an interval, I need to delete at least one character from it.

If intervals overlap, sometimes one deletion can break multiple intervals.

Hence, I need to find a set of positions to delete such that every "pie" or "map" substring has at least one of its characters deleted.

This is akin to a hitting set problem, where the goal is to find the smallest set of positions that "hits" all intervals.

The hitting set problem can be solved optimally for intervals, especially when they are intervals on a line.

In this case, the intervals are of length three, corresponding to the positions of "pie" or "map" substrings.

To solve this efficiently, I can collect all the intervals where "pie" or "map" occurs, and then find the minimum number of positions to "hit" all these intervals.

An efficient way to do this is to sort the intervals and greedily select positions that cover the most intervals at each step.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n) solution.

Here's how I can implement it:

1. Find all positions where "pie" or "map" occurs.

2. For each such occurrence, record the interval [i, i+2] where i is the starting index of the substring.

3. Sort these intervals by their end positions.

4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of deletions.

5. Initialize a variable to keep track of the last position where a deletion was made.

6. Iterate through the sorted intervals:

- If the current interval starts after the last deletion position, increment the deletion count and set the last deletion position to the end of this interval.

- Otherwise, do nothing, as this interval is already "hit" by a previous deletion.

7. The deletion count is the minimum number of deletions needed.

This approach ensures that each deletion covers as many intervals as possible, especially when intervals overlap.

Let's test this approach with the first test case: "mmapnapie"

Find all "map" or "pie" substrings:

- "mmap": "map" at positions 1-3.

- "napie": "pie" at positions 5-7.

So, intervals: [1,3], [5,7]

Sort by end positions: [1,3], [5,7]

Initialize deletions = 0, last_deletion = -1

- First interval [1,3]: start=1 > last_deletion=-1 → delete at position 3 → deletions=1, last_deletion=3

- Second interval [5,7]: start=5 > last_deletion=3 → delete at position 7 → deletions=2, last_deletion=7

Hence, total deletions=2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case: "pppiepieeee"

Find all "pie" or "map" substrings:

- "pppie": "pie" at positions 2-4

- "pie" at positions 5-7

Intervals: [2,4], [5,7]

Sort by end positions: [2,4], [5,7]

Initialize deletions=0, last_deletion=-1

- First interval [2,4]: start=2 > last_deletion=-1 → delete at position 4 → deletions=1, last_deletion=4

- Second interval [5,7]: start=5 > last_deletion=4 → delete at position 7 → deletions=2, last_deletion=7

Hence, total deletions=2, matching the sample output.

Another test case: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"

Find all "map" substrings:

- "map" at positions 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17

Intervals: [0,2], [3,5], [6,8], [9,11], [12,14], [15,17]

Sort by end positions: [0,2], [3,5], [6,8], [9,11], [12,14], [15,17]

Initialize deletions=0, last_deletion=-1

- [0,2]: start=0 > last_deletion=-1 → delete at position 2 → deletions=1, last_deletion=2

- [3,5]: start=3 > last_deletion=2 → delete at position 5 → deletions=2, last_deletion=5

- [6,8]: start=6 > last_deletion=5 → delete at position 8 → deletions=3, last_deletion=8

- [9,11]: start=9 > last_deletion=8 → delete at position 11 → deletions=4, last_deletion=11

- [12,14]: start=12 > last_deletion=11 → delete at position 14 → deletions=5, last_deletion=14

- [15,17]: start=15 > last_deletion=14 → delete at position 17 → deletions=6, last_deletion=17

Hence, total deletions=6, matching the sample output.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Find all "pie" and "map" substrings and record their positions as intervals of length 3.

- Sort these intervals by their end positions.

- Iterate through the sorted intervals, keeping track of the last deletion position, and count the deletions needed.

This should be efficient enough, as finding the intervals is O(n), sorting them is O(k log k) where k is the number of intervals (up to n-2), and the iteration is O(k), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = input()

ans = 0

i = 0

while i < len(a) - 2:

s = a[i:i + 3]

if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':

i += 3

ans += 1

else:

i += 1

print(ans)

This program iterates through the string, checking for "map" or "pie" substrings. Whenever it finds one, it skips ahead by 3 characters and increments the deletion count.

This approach assumes that removing one character from the substring breaks it, and by skipping ahead by 3, it moves to the next potential substring.

However, this might not always be correct, especially when substrings overlap.

For example, in "ppiee":

- "ppi" ≠ "map" or "pie" → i +=1 → i=1

- "pie" == "pie" → i +=3 → i=4

- Loop ends

Hence, ans=1, but the correct answer is 1, which matches.

Another example: "pppiepieeee"

- "ppp" ≠ → i=1

- "ppp" ≠ → i=2

- "ppp" ≠ → i=3

- "ppi" ≠ → i=4

- "pie" == "pie" → i +=3 → i=7

- "iee" ≠ → i=8

- "eee" ≠ → i=9

Hence, ans=1, but the correct answer is 2, which suggests that this approach is incorrect in some cases.

Wait, in this case, the program outputs 1, but the correct answer is 2, indicating that this approach is flawed.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to make sure that the given string does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". If these substrings are present, we have to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate them.

## Approach

1. **Identify Forbidden Substrings:** We will scan the string to find all occurrences of "pie" or "map". Each occurrence is represented as an interval of three consecutive characters.

2. **Interval Representation:** For each forbidden substring found, we record the interval [start, end], where the end is start + 2.

3. **Sort Intervals:** We sort these intervals based on their end positions. This helps in applying a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of deletions.

4. **Greedy Deletion Strategy:** 
    - We initialize a counter for deletions and a variable to track the position of the last deletion.
    - We iterate through the sorted intervals. For each interval:
        - If its start is after the last deletion position, we perform a deletion at the end of this interval and update the last deletion position.
        - This ensures that we cover as many overlapping intervals as possible with each deletion.

5. **Output the Result:** The deletion counter will hold the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

## Solution Code

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = data[index]
        index += 1
        intervals = []
        for i in range(n - 2):
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                intervals.append((i, i + 2))
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        ans = 0
        last_deletion = -1
        for start, end in intervals:
            if start > last_deletion:
                ans += 1
                last_deletion = end
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_deletions_to_beautiful()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input:** We read all input at once for efficiency, split it into a list, and process it step by step.

2. **Finding Intervals:** For each string, we look for "pie" or "map" substrings and record their positions as intervals.

3. **Sorting Intervals:** We sort these intervals by their end positions to facilitate the greedy deletion strategy.

4. **Greedy Deletion:** By iterating through the sorted intervals and deleting characters strategically (i.e., at the end of each non-overlapping interval), we ensure that each deletion covers as many forbidden substrings as possible.

5. **Output:** For each test case, we output the number of deletions made.

This approach ensures that we handle overlapping substrings efficiently and minimize the number of deletions required.
