Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, and he wants to be among the first m people.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to swap places with someone ahead of him (some person j where j < i), he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

He can do this swapping any number of times, and he wants to spend as little as possible, but he must end up in one of the first m positions.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position between 1 and m.

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. He can choose any person j in front of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

Wait, let's clarify: when he swaps with j, he pays a_j to j, and for each k between j and i, he pays b_k.

So, if Kirill is at position i, and he swaps with j (j < i), his new position is j, and the cost is a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

He can do this multiple times, choosing different j each time, to move closer to the front.

I need to find the minimum total cost to get to a position <= m.

Let me think about this step by step.

One way to approach this is to consider the possible positions Kirill can be in, starting from position n, and find the minimum cost to reach a position <= m.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to n, and then take the minimum of dp[1] to dp[m].

But I need to consider the operations he can perform.

Wait, actually, the problem allows Kirill to perform swaps any number of times, but each swap has a specific cost.

I need to model how Kirill can move from position i to position j (j < i) with a cost of a_j + sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

This seems a bit tricky for a straightforward DP, because from each position i, Kirill can potentially go to any position j < i, with a cost that depends on j and the sum between j and i.

This might not be efficient, as n can be up to 200,000, and t can be up to 10,000, but the total n across all test cases is up to 200,000.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position j, where j <= m.

To get to j, he needs to perform a series of swaps to move from n down to j.

Each swap from i to some j < i costs a_j + sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost path from n to j, for j from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among those.

This sounds like a graph where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

But building such a graph explicitly is not feasible due to the large n.

I need a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider the cumulative sum of b_k.

Define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

This might help in simplifying the expression.

Now, I need to find the minimal total cost to go from n to some j <= m, summing up these costs along the path.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to directly jump from n to some j <= m, performing a series of swaps.

The total cost would be the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for all the positions between the swaps.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Another approach: consider that Kirill can choose a sequence of positions j1, j2, ..., jt, where each j is less than the previous, and finally reach j <= m.

The total cost would be sum of a_jk plus sum of b_k for all positions between the swaps.

This seems too general.

Maybe I need to find a way to express the total cost in terms of a and b.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the minimal cost as the minimal a_j plus the sum of b_k from j to n, for some j <= m.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to bribe someone directly to jump to their position, considering the costs involved.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Kirill can choose to move to any position j < i by paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any j <= m.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a specific structure.

Let me try to find a recursive formula for dp[j], the minimal cost to reach position j.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each position j <= m, the minimal cost to reach j is the minimal over all possible paths from n to j.

But that's too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider starting from position n and considering positions one by one, moving towards position 1.

For each position i from n down to 1, I can compute the minimal cost to reach position i.

At each step, for position i, the minimal cost to reach it is the minimal over all j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1).

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a way to optimize this.

Let me see if I can express dp[i] in a better way.

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

Because sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rearranged as:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i-1]

So, dp[i] = min_val + prefix_b[i-1], where min_val is the minimum over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)

This is interesting because now I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Let me define a variable, say, min_val, that keeps track of the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) for j from 1 to i-1.

Then, dp[i] = min_val + prefix_b[i-1]

This seems efficient, as I can compute prefix_b first, then iterate from i=1 to i=n, keeping track of min_val.

Yes, this should work.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4 + 3 = 7

prefix_b[3] = 7 + 8 = 15

prefix_b[4] = 15 + 5 = 20

Now, initialize dp[1] = 0, since to reach position 1 without any swaps.

Wait, no. If Kirill starts at position 4, and wants to reach position 1, he needs to perform swaps.

Wait, actually, dp[1] would be the cost to reach position 1 from position 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[n] = 0, and compute dp[i] for i from n-1 down to 1.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Let me think again.

If I consider positions from 1 to n, and Kirill starts at position n.

I need to compute dp[i], the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

So, dp[n] = 0, since he's already there.

Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from j-1 down to i)

Wait, maybe I need to reverse the indices.

Let me try to redefine.

Let me consider positions from n down to 1.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0.

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_i + sum of b_k from i to j-1)

Wait, if he swaps from j to i, he pays a_i (since he's paying a_j, but j is greater than i, but in this case, it's confusing.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to model it differently.

Suppose Kirill is at position i, and he can choose to stay at i or swap with some j < i.

If he stays at i, then his cost is dp[i].

If he swaps with j < i, his cost is dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

He wants to choose the option with the minimal cost.

Wait, perhaps I need to use DP where dp[i] is the minimal cost to be at position i.

Starting from position n with dp[n] = 0.

Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, dp[i] = min over j = i to n of (dp[j] + a_i + sum of b_k from i+1 to j-1)

Wait, this still seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me consider that sum of b_k from i+1 to j-1 is prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i]

Assuming prefix_b[0] = 0, prefix_b[1] = b[1], prefix_b[2] = b[1] + b[2], etc.

So, sum of b_k from i+1 to j-1 is prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i]

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j = i+1 to n of (dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

This still seems too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each position i, dp[i] = a_i + min over j = i+1 to n of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this.

dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + min over j = i+1 to n of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

So, dp[i] = (a_i - prefix_b[i]) + min_val, where min_val is the minimum of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) for j from i+1 to n.

If I can precompute the minimum of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) for j from i+1 to n, then I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

This way, I can compute dp[i] in O(1) per i, after precomputing the minimum values.

To do this, I can compute a suffix array where suffix_min[k] = min over j from k to n of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

But to compute suffix_min[k], I need dp[j], which depends on suffix_min[j+1], creating a circular dependency.

Wait, perhaps I need to solve for dp[i] in terms of suffix_min.

Let me try to define suffix_min[k] = min over j from k to n of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

But dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + suffix_min[j+1]

So, suffix_min[k] = min over j from k to n of (a_j - prefix_b[j] + suffix_min[j+1] + prefix_b[j-1])

This seems too recursive and complicated.

Maybe I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill moves from position n to position m or less.

He can make multiple swaps, each time choosing to swap with someone ahead, paying a_j and sum of b_k between them.

But maybe there's a way to calculate the total cost in one go, without considering intermediate steps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total cost is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for each position between the swaps.

But I need to minimize this.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose a set of people to bribe directly, and pay the a_j for each, plus the b_k for the positions in between.

Maybe I need to select a subset of positions from m to n, inclusive, and calculate the total cost accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Kirill can choose to go directly to some position j <= m, and calculate the minimal cost for that.

But how?

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps in such a way that he moves from n to some j <= m in a sequence of swaps, and I need to find the minimal total cost for such a sequence.

This seems similar to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges are directed from higher positions to lower positions, with costs defined as a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But again, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position j is the minimal cost among all possible sequences of swaps that lead from n to j.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the cost to go from i to j is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1, and find a way to combine these costs optimally.

Let me consider that sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, cost from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Then, the total cost to go from n to j via some sequence of swaps is the sum of such costs for each swap.

I need to minimize this total cost.

This seems complex.

Maybe I need to find a way to express the total cost in terms of a and b in a way that allows for efficient computation.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to jump to position j, and then pay the sum of b_k for the positions he skips.

But I need to find a way to minimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as choosing a path where each step involves paying a_j and sum of b_k for the intermediate positions.

This sounds similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but implementing it directly would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position j is the minimal cost among all possible previous positions k, where k > j, of dp[k] + a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to k-1.

So, dp[j] = min over k > j of (dp[k] + a_j + prefix_b[k-1] - prefix_b[j])

This seems similar to what I had before.

Let me try to rearrange this:

dp[j] = a_j + min over k > j of (dp[k] + prefix_b[k-1] - prefix_b[j])

Now, if I fix j, then dp[j] = a_j + (min over k > j of (dp[k] + prefix_b[k-1])) - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over k > j of (dp[k] + prefix_b[k-1])

This is similar to what I had earlier.

Now, if I can precompute the suffix minimum of (dp[k] + prefix_b[k-1]) for k from j+1 to n, then I can compute dp[j] efficiently.

But to compute dp[j], I need the suffix minimum starting from j+1, which depends on dp[k] for k > j.

This seems like a circular dependency because dp[j] depends on dp[k] for k > j.

Wait, perhaps I can compute dp[j] in decreasing order of j, from n down to 1.

Start with dp[n] = 0, then compute dp[n-1], dp[n-2], and so on, down to dp[1].

Let me try that.

Initialize dp[n] = 0.

Compute suffix_min[k] for k from n down to 1, where suffix_min[k] = min over j from k to n of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

So, I can iterate from i = n-1 down to 1:

Compute dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

Then update suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Wait, let's see.

Set suffix_min[n+1] = infinity or zero, depending on how we handle it.

Actually, suffix_min[n+1] shouldn't exist, so we can set it to zero or handle it appropriately.

Let me try with the first sample input to see if this works.

Sample Input 1:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4 + 3 = 7

prefix_b[3] = 7 + 8 = 15

prefix_b[4] = 15 + 5 = 20

Initialize dp[4] = 0

suffix_min[5] = infinity or zero

Then, for i = 3 down to 1:

dp[3] = a[3] - prefix_b[3] + suffix_min[4]

a[3] = 6, prefix_b[3] = 15, suffix_min[4] = dp[4] + prefix_b[3] = 0 + 15 = 15

So dp[3] = 6 - 15 + 15 = 6

Then suffix_min[3] = min(suffix_min[4], dp[3] + prefix_b[2]) = min(15, 6 + 7) = min(15, 13) = 13

Then i = 2:

dp[2] = a[2] - prefix_b[2] + suffix_min[3] = 3 - 7 + 13 = 9

suffix_min[2] = min(suffix_min[3], dp[2] + prefix_b[1]) = min(13, 9 + 4) = min(13, 13) = 13

Then i = 1:

dp[1] = a[1] - prefix_b[1] + suffix_min[2] = 7 - 4 + 13 = 16

suffix_min[1] = min(suffix_min[2], dp[1] + prefix_b[0]) = min(13, 16 + 0) = 13

Now, Kirill wants to be in positions 1 or 2 (m=2), so we take the min of dp[1] and dp[2], which is min(16,9) = 9.

But according to the sample output, it's 14.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Maybe I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it's 14, but according to my calculation, it's 9 and 16.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the approach.

Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, a[1] = 7, a[2] = 3, a[3] = 6, a[4] = 9

b[1] = 4, b[2] = 3, b[3] = 8, b[4] = 5

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 7

prefix_b[3] = 15

prefix_b[4] = 20

dp[4] = 0

suffix_min[5] = infinity

i=3:

dp[3] = a[3] - prefix_b[3] + suffix_min[4] = 6 - 15 + 0 = -9 + 0 = -9. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me double-check the formula.

I thought dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

But in the sample, the expected output is 14, but I'm getting dp[2] =9 and dp[1]=16, which doesn't match.

Maybe my formula is incorrect.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that dp[i] represents the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0.

For dp[i], it's the minimal over all j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from j-1 down to i).

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Let me consider that to move from j to i, where j > i, the cost is a_j + sum of b_k from i to j-1.

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from i to j-1)

Which is dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1])

Assuming prefix_b[i] is the sum from b[1] to b[i].

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I had prefix_b[0] = 0, prefix_b[1] = b[1], etc.

But in the formula above, sum from i to j-1 would be prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1]

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1])

This seems different from what I had before.

Let me try to define suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1])

Then dp[i] = suffix_min[i] - prefix_b[i-1]

Wait, let's see:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1])

Which is min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1]) - prefix_b[i-1]

So, dp[i] = [min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1])] - prefix_b[i-1]

Define suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1])

Then dp[i] = suffix_min[i] - prefix_b[i-1]

Now, to compute suffix_min[i], it's the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1]) for j > i.

We can compute suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1]) for j = i+1 to n.

But dp[j] depends on suffix_min[j], so we need to compute dp[j] first.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from i = n down to 1, computing dp[i] and suffix_min[i] simultaneously.

Initialize dp[n] = 0

suffix_min[n+1] = infinity

Then, for i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + suffix_min[i+1] - prefix_b[i-1]

suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], dp[i] + a_i + prefix_b[i-1])

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1])

Which is dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) - prefix_b[i-1]

Set suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Then dp[i] = a_i + suffix_min[i+1] - prefix_b[i-1]

And suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Wait, this still seems inconsistent.

Let me try with the sample input again.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix_b = [0,4,7,15,20]

Initialize dp[4] = 0

suffix_min[5] = infinity

Then i=3:

dp[3] = a[3] + suffix_min[4] - prefix_b[2] = 6 + 0 - 7 = -1

Wait, that can't be right.

But in reality, the minimal cost to reach position 3 is 0, since dp[4]=0 and no swaps are needed if he's already at position 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me consider that dp[i] is the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

To reach position i, Kirill can choose to swap with someone at position j > i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=i to j-1.

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from i to j-1)

Which is dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1])

Let me try to define suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1])

Then dp[i] = suffix_min[i] - prefix_b[i-1]

Then, to compute suffix_min[i], it's the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1]) for j > i.

But dp[j] is dp[j] = suffix_min[j] - prefix_b[j-1]

So, suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (suffix_min[j] - prefix_b[j-1] + a_j + prefix_b[j-1]) = min over j > i of (suffix_min[j] + a_j)

Wait, this seems better.

So, suffix_min[i] = min over j > i of (suffix_min[j] + a_j)

Then dp[i] = suffix_min[i] - prefix_b[i-1]

Now, I can compute suffix_min[i] by iterating from i = n down to 1.

Initialize suffix_min[n+1] = 0

Then for i from n down to 1:

suffix_min[i] = a[i] + suffix_min[i+1]

dp[i] = suffix_min[i] - prefix_b[i-1]

Wait, but in the sample input, with n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 7

prefix_b[3] = 15

prefix_b[4] = 20

Initialize suffix_min[5] = 0

Then:

i=4:

suffix_min[4] = a[4] + suffix_min[5] = 9 + 0 = 9

dp[4] = suffix_min[4] - prefix_b[3] = 9 - 15 = -6

Wait, that can't be right.

In reality, dp[4] should be 0, since he's already there.

Maybe I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps suffix_min[i] should be the minimal cost to reach position i from n, considering the costs.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from n to any j <= m.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

An alternative approach is to consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to jump to position j, and pay the sum of b_k for the positions he skips.

To minimize the total cost, he should choose the path where he pays the least for the jumps and the intermediate positions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total cost to go from n to j is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if he goes directly from n to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Wait, let's see.

Wait, if he swaps from n to j, he pays a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n-1.

Then, he can repeat this process from j to some k < j, paying a_k + sum of b_l from k+1 to j-1.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total cost to reach j is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Then, from j, he can go to k < j, paying a_k + sum of b_l from k+1 to j-1.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the total cost to reach j is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Then, the minimal cost to reach any position <= m is the minimum of (a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n) for j from 1 to m.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me see.

If Kirill goes directly from n to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Then, the total cost is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

He can choose any j from 1 to m, and the minimal cost would be the minimum over j from 1 to m of (a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n).

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

sum of b_k from j+1 to 4:

For j=1: sum from 2 to 4: 3 + 8 + 5 = 16

Total cost: a[1] + 16 = 7 + 16 = 23

For j=2: sum from 3 to 4: 8 + 5 = 13

Total cost: a[2] + 13 = 3 + 13 = 16

So, the minimal cost is 16, but according to the sample output, it's 14.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

For example, go from 4 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Cost from 4 to 3: a[3] + sum of b_k from 4 to 4 (since j=3, i=4): a[3] + b[4] = 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from 3 to 2: a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: a[2] + b[3] = 3 + 8 = 11

Total cost: 11 + 11 = 22, which is higher than 16.

Wait, but the sample output is 14, which is less than 16.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 2 directly: a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 4: 3 + 8 + 5 = 16, same as above.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when Kirill swaps from i to j, he pays a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in the earlier case, from 4 to 2: a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

Then, from 2 to 1: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 1: 7 + 3 = 10

Total cost: 11 + 10 = 21, which is still higher than 16.

But the sample output is 14, so there must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to go from 4 to 3, paying a[3] + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from 3 to 1, paying a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 2: 7 + 3 = 10

Total cost: 11 + 10 = 21, still higher.

Wait, maybe going from 4 to 1 directly: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 3: 7 + 3 + 8 = 18, which is higher than 16.

So, how can the minimal cost be 14?

Maybe I need to consider that sum of b_k is only for the positions between j and i, not including j.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill pays b_k to the person at position k.

So, when swapping from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In the earlier calculation, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

In the sample input, going from 4 to 2: a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

Then, from 2 to 1: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 1: but 2 to 1, j=1, i=2, so sum from 2 to 1 is empty? Wait, j=1, i=2, sum from j+1 to i-1 is from 2 to 1, which is empty, so sum is 0.

So, cost from 2 to 1 is a[1] + 0 = 7

Total cost: 11 + 7 = 18, which is higher than 16.

Wait, but the sample output is 14, so there must be a better sequence.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 3, paying a[3] + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from 3 to 2, paying a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

Total cost: 11 + 11 = 22, which is higher.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the understanding.

Wait, perhaps Kirill can perform multiple swaps, and the sum of b_k is only for the positions skipped in each swap.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when Kirill swaps from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

Then, in the sample input:

From 4 to 2: a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

From 2 to 1: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 1: but from 2 to 1, sum from 3 to 1, which is empty, so 0.

So, total cost: 11 + 7 = 18

But sample output is 14, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 1 directly: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 3: 7 + 3 + 8 = 18, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 3, paying a[3] + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from 3 to 2, paying a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

Total: 11 + 11 = 22

Or from 4 to 2, paying a[2] + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: 3 + 8 = 11

Then from 2 to 1, paying a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 1: 7 + 0 = 7

Total: 11 + 7 = 18

But sample output is 14, which is less than both of these.

Wait, perhaps there is a better sequence.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 3, paying a[3] + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: 6 + 5 = 11

Then from 3 to 1, paying a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 2: 7 + 3 = 10

Total: 11 + 10 = 21

Still higher.

Wait, maybe Kirill can go from 4 to 1 directly: a[1] + sum of b_k from 2 to 3: 7 + 3 + 8 = 18

Still higher than 14.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum of b_k is only for k from j+1 to i-1, and that k increases from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in the problem statement, for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill pays b_k to the person at position k.

So, when swapping from i to j, k goes from j+1 to i-1.

In the sample input, from 4 to 2: j=2, i=4, so k=3, sum of b_k = b[3] = 8

So, cost is a[2] + b[3] = 3 + 8 = 11

Then, from 2 to 1: j=1, i=2, so k=1+1 to 2-1, which is k=2 to 1, but k increases from left to right, so k=2 only.

But position k=2 has b[2] = 3

So, cost is a[1] + b[2] = 7 + 3 = 10

Total cost: 11 + 10 = 21, still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the indices.

Wait, positions are from 1 to 4.

From 4 to 2: j=2, i=4, sum of b_k from k=3 to 3, which is b[3]=8

So, cost is a[2] + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11

From 2 to 1: j=1, i=2, sum of b_k from k=2 to 1, which is b[2]=3

So, cost is a[1] + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10

Total: 11 + 10 = 21

But sample output is 14.

Wait,
