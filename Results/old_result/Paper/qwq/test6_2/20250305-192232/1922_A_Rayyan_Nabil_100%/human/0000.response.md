Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, while c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. The rules are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

For example, if the template has 'A' at position i, then the string must have a character that is not 'a' at that position.

My task is to find such a template t where both a and b match it, but c does not.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make the template's character at that position lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose to make the i-th character of the template lowercase, then both a and b must have the same character at that position as the template. For c, if the template's character is lowercase, c must have that same character to match, but I want c to not match the template, so I don't want c to have that character.

If I choose to make the i-th character of the template uppercase, then both a and b must have a character different from the lowercase version of the template's character. For c, if the template's character is uppercase, c can have any character except the lowercase version of the template's character to match, but I want c to not match, so c must have the lowercase version of the template's character.

Wait, let's clarify:

- For the template's i-th character being uppercase:

- a and b must have a character different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

- c must have the lowercase version of the template's character to not match.

- For the template's i-th character being lowercase:

- a and b must have the same character as the template.

- c must have a different character to not match.

So, for each position i, I have two choices for the template: make it lowercase or uppercase.

If I make it lowercase, then:

- a[i] must equal t[i] (lowercase)

- b[i] must equal t[i]

- c[i] must not equal t[i]

Therefore, for this choice, a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

If I make it uppercase, then:

- a[i] must not equal t[i].lower()

- b[i] must not equal t[i].lower()

- c[i] must equal t[i].lower()

So, for this choice, a[i] must not equal t[i].lower(), b[i] must not equal t[i].lower(), and c[i] must equal t[i].lower().

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so t[i].lower() is the lowercase version of that letter.

So, for uppercase choice:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

Therefore, for each position, I have two possibilities:

1. Make t[i] lowercase:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. Make t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower() and c[i] == t[i].lower()

But in the second case, since t[i] is uppercase, t[i].lower() is just the lowercase version of that letter.

Wait, but in the second case, I need to choose what uppercase letter to use for t[i]. However, the specific uppercase letter I choose affects what a[i], b[i], and c[i] must be.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that for each position i, I need to choose whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, and then set t[i] appropriately.

If I choose to make t[i] lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from t[i].

So, for lowercase choice:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

If a[i] != b[i], I can't choose lowercase for t[i], because t[i] can't be equal to both a[i] and b[i] if they are different.

Similarly, if a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i], I can't choose lowercase for t[i], because c[i] must be different from t[i].

For the uppercase choice:

- t[i] is an uppercase letter.

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, for uppercase choice:

- a[i] != some lowercase letter (which is t[i].lower())

- b[i] != that same lowercase letter

- c[i] == that lowercase letter

Therefore, for uppercase choice, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from c[i], because c[i] == t[i].lower(), and a[i] != t[i].lower(), b[i] != t[i].lower().

So, for each position i, to choose uppercase:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

Because t[i].lower() == c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but t[i].lower() is c[i], so t[i] is c[i].upper().

So, for uppercase choice:

- t[i] is c[i].upper()

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

So, for uppercase choice, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

For lowercase choice:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

So, for each position i, I have to choose between two options:

1. Lowercase: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. Uppercase: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

In both choices, I need to ensure that a and b match the template, and c does not.

Wait, but in the uppercase choice, I'm setting t[i] to c[i].upper(), so c[i] == t[i].lower(), which makes c not match the template because the condition is that c must have a different character from t[i].lower() if t[i] is uppercase. Wait, no: if t[i] is uppercase, c must have a different character from t[i].lower() to match the template, but I want c to not match, so c must have the same character as t[i].lower().

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me rephrase:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower() (to not match the template)

So, for uppercase choice:

- t[i] = some uppercase letter, say X, where X.lower() == c[i]

- Therefore, t[i] = c[i].upper()

- And a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i]

So, for uppercase choice, I set t[i] = c[i].upper(), and require that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

For lowercase choice:

- t[i] = a[i] (which must equal b[i]), and c[i] != a[i]

So, for each position i, I can choose to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, with the constraints:

- Lowercase: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Uppercase: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Now, to have a valid template t, I need to choose for each position i either lowercase or uppercase, such that all these conditions are satisfied.

But actually, since the choices for each position are independent, I can check for each position if at least one of the two choices is possible.

Wait, but the template t is a combination of choices for all positions. So, I need to find a combination where for each position, the chosen type (lowercase or uppercase) satisfies the conditions for a and b to match, and c to not match.

But to make it simpler, perhaps I can look at it this way: for each position i, if I can choose a type (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the conditions, and across all positions, there exists a consistent template.

But maybe I can think of it position by position, and ensure that for each position, at least one of the two choices is possible based on the characters in a, b, and c at that position.

Wait, but there might be dependencies between positions.

Wait, but actually, since the template t is a string of length n, and the conditions for each position are independent of each other, I can treat each position separately.

Wait, no, the conditions for each position are independent in terms of the choices, but the overall template is the combination of all positions.

However, since the problem is to determine if such a template exists, and the choices for each position don't affect each other, I can check for each position if at least one of the two choices is possible.

Wait, but actually, I need to ensure that there exists a template where for all positions, the conditions are satisfied.

So, for the entire template to satisfy the conditions, each position must satisfy its own condition, regardless of the choices made for other positions.

Therefore, I can check for each position if at least one of the two choices is possible.

If for every position, at least one choice is possible, then such a template exists.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible that for some positions, neither choice is possible, which would mean that no template exists.

So, to rephrase:

For each position i:

- If choosing lowercase is possible (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]), then that's one option.

- If choosing uppercase is possible (a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]), then that's another option.

- If at least one of these two is true, then this position is fine.

- If for all positions, at least one of these two is true, then such a template exists.

- Otherwise, if there exists at least one position where neither choice is possible, then no such template exists.

Wait, but in the problem, it's "determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not."

So, I need to check if there exists at least one template where a and b match, and c does not.

From the above, it seems that if for every position i, at least one of the two choices is possible, then such a template exists.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for the positions where I choose lowercase, a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], and for the positions where I choose uppercase, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

But actually, in the problem, it's sufficient to check that for each position, at least one of the two choices is possible.

Because if that's the case, I can choose for each position the appropriate type (lowercase or uppercase) that satisfies the conditions for that position, regardless of the other positions.

Wait, but there might be a dependency if the choices for one position affect the choices for another position.

But in this problem, the choices for each position are independent, so I can make the choice per position.

Therefore, if for every position i, at least one of the following is true:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i] (lowercase choice)

- a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] (uppercase choice)

Then, such a template exists.

Otherwise, if there exists at least one position where neither choice is possible, then no such template exists.

Therefore, I can iterate through each position and check these conditions.

Wait, but in the sample input and output, let's verify this logic.

Sample Input 1:

1

a

b

c

n=1, a='a', b='b', c='c'

Check position 1:

- Lowercase choice: a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1]

  - a[1] == 'a' != b[1] == 'b', so False

- Uppercase choice: a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1]

  - a[1] == 'a' != c[1] == 'c', and b[1] == 'b' != 'c', so True

Therefore, at least one choice is possible, so "YES", which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

2

aa

bb

aa

n=2, a='aa', b='bb', c='aa'

Position 1:

- Lowercase: a[1] == 'a' != b[1] == 'b', so False

- Uppercase: a[1] == 'a' != c[1] == 'a' (False), and b[1] == 'b' != 'a' (True), but since a[1] == 'a' == c[1] == 'a', the condition a[1] != c[1] is False, so uppercase choice is False

Therefore, neither choice is possible for position 1, so "NO", matching the sample.

Sample Input 3:

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

n=10, a='mathforces', b='luckforces', c='adhoccoder'

Let's check position 1:

a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l', c[1] = 'a'

- Lowercase: 'm' == 'l'? No, so False

- Uppercase: 'm' != 'a' (True) and 'l' != 'a' (True), so True

Position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'u', c[2] = 'd'

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'u'? No, so False

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'd' (True) and 'u' != 'd' (True), so True

...

Position 10:

a[10] = 's', b[10] = 's', c[10] = 'r'

- Lowercase: 's' == 's' and 'r' != 's', so True

- Uppercase: 's' != 'r' and 's' != 'r', so True

Since for all positions, at least one choice is possible, "YES", matching the sample.

Sample Input 4:

3

acc

abd

abc

n=3, a='acc', b='abd', c='abc'

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a'

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'a' and 'a' != 'a'? No, because c[1] == a[1]

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'a' (False) and 'a' != 'a' (False), so False

Therefore, neither choice is possible for position 1, so "NO", matching the sample.

Therefore, my logic seems correct.

So, to implement this, for each test case, I need to iterate through each position from 1 to n and check for each position if at least one of the two choices is possible.

If for all positions, at least one choice is possible, then "YES"; else, "NO".

Now, looking at the given program:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1(n, a, b, c):

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

return 'YES'

return 'NO'

def func_2():

t = int(input().strip())

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input().strip())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))

for result in results:

print(result)

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

In func_1, it's checking for each position i if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and if that's true for any position, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, 'NO'.

But according to my earlier reasoning, for each position, at least one of the two choices must be possible.

In other words, for each position, either:

- (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]) or

- (a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i])

If this is true for all positions, then "YES"; else, "NO".

But in the given code, it's checking if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and if so, returns 'YES'. Otherwise, 'NO'.

This seems different from what I derived.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think again.

In my earlier reasoning, for each position, at least one of the two conditions must hold:

1. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And all positions must satisfy at least one of these.

In the given code, it's checking if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, that's not the same.

In fact, the given code seems to be checking if there exists at least one position where the uppercase choice is possible.

But according to my earlier reasoning, for all positions, at least one of the two choices must be possible.

So, the given code is insufficient because it only checks if there's at least one position where the uppercase choice is possible, but it doesn't ensure that for all positions, at least one choice is possible.

Let me consider the sample input 1:

n=1, a='a', b='b', c='c'

For position 1:

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'b' and 'c' != 'a'? 'a' != 'b', so False

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'c' and 'b' != 'c'? 'a' != 'c' and 'b' != 'c', so True

So, at least one choice is possible for this position, so "YES".

The given code checks if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which is true for position 1, so it returns 'YES'. This matches.

Sample input 2:

n=2, a='aa', b='bb', c='aa'

Position 1:

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'b' and 'a' != 'a'? 'a' != 'b', so False

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'a' and 'b' != 'a'? 'a' == 'a', so False

Neither choice is possible, so "NO"

Position 2:

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'b' and 'a' != 'a'? 'a' != 'b', so False

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'a' and 'b' != 'a'? 'a' == 'a', so False

Neither choice is possible, so "NO"

But the given code would check if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. For position 2: 'a' != 'a' (False), so no. For position 1: 'a' != 'a' (False). So, it would return 'NO', which matches.

Sample input 3:

n=10, a='mathforces', b='luckforces', c='adhoccoder'

For each position, at least one choice is possible, as per earlier analysis.

The given code would check if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. Looking at position 1: 'm' != 'a' and 'l' != 'a', so True, so it would return 'YES', which matches.

Sample input 4:

n=3, a='acc', b='abd', c='abc'

Position 1:

- Lowercase: 'a' == 'a' and 'a' != 'a'? 'a' == 'a' and 'a' == 'a', so False

- Uppercase: 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'a', both False, so neither choice is possible

Position 2:

- Lowercase: 'c' == 'b' and 'b' != 'c'? 'c' != 'b', so False

- Uppercase: 'c' != 'b' and 'b' != 'b'? 'c' != 'b' and 'b' != 'b' (False), so False

Position 3:

- Lowercase: 'c' == 'd' and 'c' != 'c'? 'c' != 'd', so False

- Uppercase: 'c' != 'c' (False) and 'd' != 'c', so False

So, for all positions, neither choice is possible, so "NO"

The given code would check if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. For position 2: 'c' != 'b' and 'd' != 'b', so True, so it would return 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO'.

Wait, this is a mistake in the given code.

In sample input 4, the given code would return 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO', as per the sample output.

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

So, the given program is incorrect because it only checks if there exists at least one position where the uppercase choice is possible, but it doesn't ensure that for all positions, at least one choice is possible.

To fix this, I need to check for each position if at least one of the two choices is possible, and ensure that this is true for all positions.

So, the correct approach is:

- For each position i from 1 to n:

- Check if (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]) or (a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i])

- If for all positions, at least one of these is true, then "YES"; else, "NO"

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
