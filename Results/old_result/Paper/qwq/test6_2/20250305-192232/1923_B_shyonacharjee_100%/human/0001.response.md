Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a straight line, and I'm at point 0. There are n monsters, each with some health a_i and initial positions x_i. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 per bullet. After I shoot, any monster with health <=0 dies. Then, all alive monsters move one step closer to me. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

My goal is to figure out if I can kill all the monsters before any of them reach me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, subtracting 1 health per bullet per monster.

2. Any monster with health <=0 dies.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

4. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

I need to make sure that before any monster reaches me, I've killed it.

Looking at the positions, x_i can be negative or positive, but they're all sorted in increasing order, and none are zero.

I need a strategy to allocate my bullets each second to ensure that I can kill all monsters before they reach me.

Let me think about the monsters that are closest to me, as they pose the greatest threat because they'll reach me sooner.

So, maybe I should prioritize shooting at the monsters that are closest to me.

Wait, but I also need to consider their health. A monster that's close but has low health might be easier to handle than one that's farther away but has high health.

Hmm.

I need a way to calculate, for each monster, how many seconds it will take to reach me, and ensure that I can reduce its health to zero within that time frame.

Let's define the time a monster has before it reaches me as t = |x_i|, since each second it moves one step closer.

So, for each monster, I have t_i = |x_i| seconds to kill it.

During these t_i seconds, I can shoot at it up to t_i * k bullets, since I can shoot k bullets per second.

Wait, no. Actually, I can shoot k bullets per second, but I have to分配这些子弹到各个怪物上。

I need to make sure that for each monster, the total bullets I shoot at it over the remaining seconds before it reaches me is at least its health.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the monsters by their distance from me, i.e., by |x_i| in increasing order.

Then, I process them one by one, starting from the closest one.

For each monster, I calculate how many bullets I need to shoot at it before it reaches me, and subtract those bullets from my total available bullets.

If at any point I don't have enough bullets to kill a monster before it reaches me, then it's game over.

Wait, but I need to consider that shooting at one monster affects my ability to shoot at others.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the monsters in order of increasing |x_i|.

For each monster, I have t_i = |x_i| seconds to kill it.

In those t_i seconds, I can shoot at it a maximum of t_i * k bullets.

But I might choose to shoot fewer bullets at it and allocate the remaining bullets to other monsters.

The challenge is to分配我的子弹，在保证每个怪物都在它到达我之前被杀死。

This seems similar to scheduling problems, where I have to allocate resources (bullets) over time to handle tasks (killing monsters) with deadlines (the time before they reach me).

Maybe I can think of it as having a pool of bullets that accumulates over time, and I need to use them to meet the health requirements of each monster before their deadline.

Wait, but actually, the bullets are spent in real-time; I don't accumulate them.

Let me try to think in terms of the total bullets I can fire up to each second.

Suppose I simulate the game second by second.

Each second, I can fire up to k bullets.

I need to decide which monsters to shoot at each second.

But simulating second by second would be too slow for the given constraints (n up to 3*10^5 per test case).

I need a smarter way.

Let's consider the monsters in order of their distance from me, i.e., sorted by |x_i| ascending.

For each monster, I need to make sure that by the time it reaches me, I have fired enough bullets at it to kill it.

Since the monsters are sorted by their distance, the closer ones have smaller |x_i|.

Wait, but in terms of time, the closer monsters have less time to be killed.

So, if I process them in order of increasing |x_i|, I can keep track of the total bullets I've used so far, and check if, given the time remaining, I can allocate enough bullets to each monster.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

Initialize bullets_used = 0.

Then, for each monster in this order:

- Let t = |x_i| (time before it reaches me)

- Let h = a_i (health to be reduced to <=0)

- To kill this monster before it reaches me, I need to allocate h bullets to it within the next t seconds.

- But I can fire up to k bullets per second, and I have to share these bullets among all monsters.

Wait, actually, I can choose to shoot any number of bullets at any monster each second, as long as the total bullets per second don't exceed k.

This seems complicated to simulate directly.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of the cumulative bullets needed versus the cumulative bullets available.

Let's think about it this way:

- For each monster, I need to have fired at least h bullets at it before its t seconds are up.

- The latest I can start firing bullets at this monster is when t seconds remain.

- So, for each monster, I have t seconds to allocate h bullets to it.

- But during these t seconds, I can also be allocating bullets to other monsters.

- So, I need to make sure that the total bullets allocated to all monsters don't exceed k bullets per second.

This sounds like a problem of scheduling tasks with deadlines.

In particular, it's similar to the classic problem of interval scheduling, where each monster has an interval of time in which bullets can be allocated to it, and I have to make sure that the total bullets allocated in any second don't exceed k.

But interval scheduling algorithms are typically O(n log n), which might be too slow for n up to 3*10^5, unless I can optimize it.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the monsters in order of their distance from me.

For each monster, I can calculate the latest time I can start shooting it, which is t_i seconds before it reaches me.

Then, I need to allocate h_i bullets to it within the next t_i seconds.

But I have to share the k bullets per second among all monsters that are still alive at any second.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate through the monsters in order of increasing |x_i|, and keep track of the total bullets needed so far, and see if I can meet that with the available bullets based on the time remaining.

Let me try to formalize this.

Sort the monsters by |x_i| ascending.

Initialize bullets_used = 0.

For each monster in this order:

- Let t = |x_i|

- Let h = a_i

- If bullets_used + h > t * k, then it's impossible, because even if I allocate k bullets per second for t seconds, I can't provide h bullets to this monster without exceeding the available bullets.

- Otherwise, set bullets_used += h.

The idea is that by the time this monster reaches me (after t seconds), I need to have used at least h bullets on it.

But since I've sorted the monsters by their t_i, and I'm accumulating bullets_used, this should ensure that I'm not overcommitting my bullet allocation.

Wait, is this correct?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have two monsters:

- Monster A: t=2, h=3

- Monster B: t=3, h=4

k=2.

Sort them by t ascending: A then B.

Process A: bullets_used = 0 + 3 = 3.

Check if 3 > 2*2 = 4? No, 3 <= 4, so okay.

Then, process B: bullets_used = 3 + 4 = 7.

Check if 7 > 3*2 = 6? Yes, 7 > 6, so impossible.

But is this correct?

Wait, in this scenario, for monster A, I need to allocate 3 bullets within 2 seconds.

With k=2, I can allocate 2 bullets in the first second and 1 in the second second, for example.

Meanwhile, for monster B, which has t=3 seconds, I need to allocate 4 bullets within 3 seconds.

But by the time monster B is considered, I've already used 3 bullets on monster A.

So, I have 3 seconds to allocate bullets to monster B, but I've already used 3 bullets on A.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the total bullets allocated per second doesn't exceed k.

In this case, for monster A, I allocate:

- Second 1: 2 bullets to A

- Second 2: 1 bullet to A

For monster B, I have 3 seconds:

- Second 1: 0 bullets (since I'm allocating to A)

- Second 2: k - bullets to A = 2 - 1 = 1 bullet to B

- Second 3: k bullets to B

So, total bullets to B: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than h=4.

So, I can't allocate enough bullets to B.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, in this case, the algorithm correctly identified it as impossible.

Another test case:

Monsters:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

Sort by t ascending: A, B.

Process A: bullets_used = 0 + 1 =1. Check 1 > 1*1=1? No.

Process B: bullets_used=1+2=3. Check 3 > 2*1=2? Yes.

So, impossible.

But wait, is it really impossible?

Let's see:

- Second 1: shoot 1 bullet to A, A dies. Shoot 0 to B.

- Second 2: B moves closer, now t=1. Shoot 1 bullet to B.

- Second 3: B moves closer, now t=0. Shoot 1 bullet to B.

Total bullets to B: 1 + 1 = 2, which is exactly h=2.

So, possible.

But the algorithm says impossible.

So, there's a mistake in the algorithm.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the algorithm.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I should sort the monsters by their position in decreasing order of |x_i|.

Wait, no, that would prioritize farther monsters, which might not be good because closer monsters are more urgent.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize monsters with smaller t_i, i.e., closer ones.

But in the previous example, the algorithm failed.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to track the cumulative bullets needed versus the cumulative bullets available over time.

Let me try to iterate through time steps.

But with n up to 3*10^5, I can't simulate each second.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets over t_i seconds.

The total bullets I can allocate over t_i seconds is t_i * k.

But I have to make sure that for all monsters, the sum of h_i <= sum of t_i * k.

But that's not sufficient, because the t_i vary.

Wait, no, it's more nuanced than that.

I need to make sure that at any point in time, the total bullets allocated don't exceed k.

But tracking this directly is too slow.

Maybe I can use a priority queue to always handle the monster that is closest to me.

Wait, but priority queues are also too slow for n=3e5.

Let me think about the first algorithm again.

In the first algorithm, I sort the monsters by |x_i| ascending, and keep a running sum of bullets_used.

Then, for each monster, I check if bullets_used > t * k.

In the previous example where it failed, we had:

Monsters:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

Process A: bullets_used=1. Check 1 > 1*1=1? No.

Process B: bullets_used=3. Check 3 > 2*1=2? Yes.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, the algorithm is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Perhaps I need to consider the sum of h_i and the sum of t_i * k.

But that's not precise enough.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal required k to handle all monsters.

But the problem is that k is given, and I need to determine if I can handle all monsters with that k.

I need to find a way to check if the given k is sufficient.

Let me try to think in terms of the maximum required bullet allocation at any time.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the cumulative health that needs to be dealt with up to each time step.

Let me sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I need to make sure that the total bullets allocated to all monsters with t_j <= t_i is less than or equal to sum_{t=1 to t_i} min(t*k, sum of h_j for j where t_j <= t_i).

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me look at the reference solution.

In the reference solution, it sorts the monsters by |x_i| ascending.

Then, it keeps a running sum of bullets_used, and for each monster, it checks if bullets_used > t * k.

If yes, then it's impossible.

Otherwise, it adds the health of the current monster to bullets_used.

Finally, if all monsters pass this check, it's possible.

But as shown in the earlier example, this algorithm fails.

So, perhaps the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3e5, which suggests that an O(n log n) solution is expected.

So, maybe the first algorithm is correct, and my counterexample is invalid.

Let me re-examine the counterexample.

In the second example:

Monsters:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

According to the algorithm:

- Process A: bullets_used=1. Check 1 > 1*1=1? No.

- Process B: bullets_used=3. Check 3 > 2*1=2? Yes.

So, the algorithm says impossible.

But in reality, as I simulated earlier, it's possible.

So, the algorithm is incorrect.

Therefore, the reference solution is flawed.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a timeline from second 0 to second T, where T is the maximum t_i.

At each second t, I can fire up to k bullets.

I need to allocate these bullets to the monsters that are still alive at that second.

Each monster has a health h_i that needs to be reduced to 0 or below before it reaches me at second t_i.

So, for each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets to it before its t_i second.

This sounds like a scheduling problem where I have to allocate resources (bullets) over time to meet certain deadlines (t_i).

In particular, it resembles a cumulative scheduling problem, where I need to ensure that the cumulative bullet allocation does not exceed the available bullet capacity per second.

To solve this, I can use the concept of prefix sums.

Let me sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets in the first t_i seconds.

So, the total bullets allocated in the first t seconds should be at least the sum of h_i for all monsters with t_i <= t.

Wait, that might be the way to go.

Let me formalize this.

Sort the monsters by t_i ascending.

Compute the cumulative sum of h_i up to each monster.

For each monster, check if the cumulative sum of h_i up to that monster is less than or equal to the sum of k * t_i.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the cumulative sum of h_i up to a certain time t is less than or equal to the sum of k over the seconds up to t.

But this seems similar to checking if the cumulative h_i up to each t_i is less than or equal to k * t_i.

Wait, that's what the reference solution does.

But as my counterexample shows, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate the h_i and check against the cumulative k * t_i.

Let me try with the counterexample.

Monsters:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

Cumulative h_i:

- After A: 1

- After B: 1 + 2 = 3

Cumulative k * t_i:

- After A: 1 * 1 = 1

- After B: 1 * 2 = 2

But 3 > 2, so the algorithm says impossible, but in reality, it's possible.

So, perhaps this approach is too pessimistic.

Maybe I need to consider that in the first second, I can allocate bullets to both A and B, as long as I don't exceed k.

Wait, in the first second, I can allocate up to k=1 bullet.

I allocate 1 bullet to A, so A dies at the end of the first second.

In the second second, I can allocate up to k=1 bullet to B.

So, total bullets to B: 1.

But B has h=2, so I need to allocate another bullet.

Wait, but in the second second, B has moved closer, and I can allocate another bullet to B.

So, total bullets to B: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches h=2.

So, it's possible.

But the algorithm says impossible because 3 > 2.

So, the algorithm is too restrictive.

It's summing up the h_i and comparing it to k * t_i for each monster, which doesn't account for the fact that bullets allocated to different monsters can be distributed over time in a way that doesn't exceed k per second.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider the maximum number of bullets needed per second.

I need to find the minimal k such that I can allocate the required bullets to all monsters without exceeding k per second.

This sounds like finding the maximum over all seconds of the total bullets required in that second.

But calculating this directly is too slow.

Perhaps I can use a sweep line algorithm.

Imagine a timeline from second 0 to second T.

For each monster, I have a demand of h_i bullets over the first t_i seconds.

I need to allocate these demands without exceeding k bullets per second.

To find the minimal k, I would need to find the maximum cumulative demand per second.

But again, calculating this directly is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the monsters by t_i and keep track of the total h_i that need to be allocated up to each t_i.

Then, for each t_i, the average allocation per second needed is (cumulative h_i) / t_i.

I need to make sure that this average does not require more than k bullets per second.

But this still doesn't account for the distribution of bullets over time.

I need a way to check if the total bullets allocated up to any second t is less than or equal to k * t.

Wait, that might be the way to go.

Let me sort the monsters by t_i ascending.

Compute the cumulative sum of h_i up to each monster.

For each monster, check if cumulative h_i <= k * t_i.

If this holds for all monsters, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in my earlier counterexample, this fails.

In the counterexample:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

Cumulative h_i:

- A: 1 <= 1 * 1 = 1: okay

- A + B: 1 + 2 = 3 <= 1 * 2 = 2: fails

But in reality, it's possible, as I showed earlier.

So, this approach is too restrictive.

Hence, it's incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Suppose I consider the monsters in order of their distance from me, i.e., sorted by |x_i| ascending.

For each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets within the next t_i seconds.

But I can allocate bullets to multiple monsters each second, as long as the total bullets per second don't exceed k.

So, I need to distribute the bullets over time to meet the health requirements of each monster before their deadlines.

This sounds like the classic scheduling problem where I have tasks with deadlines and processing times, and I need to schedule them on a machine with a certain capacity.

In this case, the "processing time" for a monster is its health h_i, and the deadline is t_i seconds.

The machine capacity is k bullets per second.

The standard way to check if such a schedule exists is to use the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm, which schedules tasks based on their deadlines.

But implementing that directly might be too slow for the constraints.

Alternatively, there's a well-known algorithm for checking if a set of tasks can be scheduled within their deadlines based on their capacities.

One way is to sort the tasks by their deadlines and then check if the cumulative workload satisfies the condition.

Wait, in the book "Operating System Concepts," there's a section on real-time scheduling, where they discuss how to schedule tasks with deadlines and periods.

But I need a simpler approach.

Let me try to think in terms of maximum bullet allocation required at any second.

If I can find the maximum number of bullets needed in any second, and ensure that it doesn't exceed k, then it's possible.

But again, calculating this directly is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use a difference array or prefix sums to calculate the required bullets per second.

Let me try to model it.

Initialize an array of size T+1, where T is the maximum t_i, with all elements set to 0.

For each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets in the first t_i seconds.

So, for each monster, add h_i to the first t_i seconds.

Then, for each second, ensure that the total allocation doesn't exceed k.

To do this efficiently, I can use a prefix sum array.

But with n up to 3e5 and T up to, say, 3e5, it's too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the monsters sorted by t_i ascending.

Then, for each monster, I need to allocate h_i bullets in the first t_i seconds.

I need to make sure that the total bullets allocated in any second doesn't exceed k.

This sounds like a feasibility check for scheduling tasks with deadlines.

I can model this as a scheduling problem where each task has a processing time h_i and a deadline t_i.

The goal is to schedule all tasks without exceeding the capacity k per second.

There's a known algorithm for this: the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm.

In EDF, you always work on the task with the earliest deadline.

In terms of feasibility, if the sum of the processing times of all tasks with deadline t is less than or equal to k * t for all t, then the schedule is feasible.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, for each time t, sum the h_i of all monsters with t_i <= t.

Then, check if this sum is less than or equal to k * t.

If this holds for all t, then it's possible.

Let me try this with the counterexample.

Monsters:

- A: t=1, h=1

- B: t=2, h=2

k=1.

At t=1:

Sum of h_i for monsters with t_i <=1: h_A=1

Check 1 <= 1*1=1: yes.

At t=2:

Sum of h_i for monsters with t_i <=2: h_A + h_B =1+2=3

Check 3 <=1*2=2: no.

So, it's impossible.

But earlier, I thought it was possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier simulation.

Let me re-simulate:

- Second 1: shoot 1 bullet to A. A's health=0, dies.

- Second 2: shoot 1 bullet to B. B's health=1.

- Second 3: shoot 1 bullet to B. B's health=0, dies.

But in this simulation, at second 2, I've only shot 1 bullet to B, but B has h=2, so it still has 1 health left.

Then, at second 3, I shoot another bullet to B, killing it.

But at second 3, B has moved to t=0, which means it's reached me.

But in the problem statement, it says:

- After moving, if any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

So, in this simulation, B reaches me at second 3, which means I lose.

Therefore, it's actually impossible, and the algorithm correctly identifies it as impossible.

I must have miscounted the positions earlier.

Hence, the algorithm is correct.

So, in the earlier step-by-step reasoning, I mistakenly thought it was possible, but actually, it's impossible because B reaches me before I can kill it.

Therefore, the reference solution is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reaches our character in a game scenario. We achieve this by strategically allocating bullets to monsters each second, considering their health and positions.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of monsters (`n`), the maximum bullets we can fire per second (`k`), the health of each monster (`a`), and their initial positions (`x`).

2. **Sorting Monsters**:
   - Sort the monsters based on their distance from the character (absolute value of their positions). This helps in prioritizing monsters that pose the greatest threat first.

3. **Bullet Allocation Check**:
   - Initialize a variable `bullets_used` to keep track of the cumulative bullets needed.
   - Iterate through each monster in order of increasing distance.
   - For each monster, check if the cumulative bullets needed exceed the bullets we can allocate given the time (distance) available. If so, we cannot survive.
   - Update the `bullets_used` with the health of the current monster.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print "YES" if we can kill all monsters before they reach us, otherwise "NO".

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the input values for the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case, and the data for monsters.
- **Step 2**: Sort the monsters based on their distance from the character to prioritize those closer to us.
- **Step 3**: For each monster, calculate the cumulative bullets needed and check if it exceeds the bullets we can allocate given the time (distance) available. If at any point it does, we cannot survive. Otherwise, continue until all monsters are processed.
- **Step 4**: Output "YES" if we can kill all monsters before they reach us; otherwise, output "NO".

This approach ensures that we efficiently manage our bullet allocations to handle the threats posed by the monsters, ensuring our survival.
