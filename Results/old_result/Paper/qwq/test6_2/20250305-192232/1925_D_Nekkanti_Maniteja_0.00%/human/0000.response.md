Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with some friendship value. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children. If the pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The task is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen, considering the time of being chosen.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and some of them are friends with a given friendship value. The teacher chooses k pairs randomly, with replacement, meaning the same pair can be chosen multiple times.

Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all future excursions. Pairs that are not friends have a friendship value of 0, and this doesn't change.

I need to find the expected sum of the friendship values at the time each pair is chosen.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's consider the total number of possible pairs. Since the order doesn't matter, it's combinations of n children taken 2 at a time, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Now, among these, m pairs are friends with given friendship values.

The teacher chooses k pairs randomly, each time picking any of these n*(n-1)/2 pairs with equal probability.

For each chosen pair:

- If they are friends, their friendship value at the time of choice is their initial value plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

- If they are not friends, their friendship value is always 0.

Since the choices are independent and with replacement, the number of times a specific pair is chosen follows a binomial distribution.

But calculating the expected sum directly seems complicated because the friendship values can increase based on how many times a pair is chosen.

Let me see if there's a smarter way to compute the expected sum.

Perhaps I can think about the contribution of each pair to the total sum.

For each pair:

- If they are friends, their contribution to the sum depends on how many times they are chosen, since each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future choices.

- If they are not friends, their contribution is always 0.

Wait, but the problem says that if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, the friendship value at the time of choice is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

But this seems tricky to compute directly.

Maybe I can model this differently.

Let me consider the sequence of k choices.

For each choice, the sum of friendship values at that choice is the sum over all pairs chosen up to that point, of their friendship values at the time of choice.

Wait, no, I need to sum the friendship values of the pairs chosen in each excursion.

Moreover, the friendship values increase only for friends pairs, and only when they are chosen.

This seems like a dynamic process where the friendship values change over time based on previous choices.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to think about the expected value differently.

Let me consider the linearity of expectation.

Linearity of expectation holds even for dependent random variables, so maybe I can use that.

Let me define X_j as the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion, at the time of choice.

Then, the total sum S = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_k.

The expected value of S is E[S] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_k].

So, if I can compute E[X_j] for each j, then sum them up.

Now, for each E[X_j], it's the expected friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion.

But the friendship values can change based on previous choices, so it seems that E[X_j] depends on what happened in the previous j-1 excursions.

This dependency is making it complex.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each friends pair is chosen up to each excursion.

Let me denote N_i(j) as the number of times the i-th friends pair is chosen in the first j excursions.

Then, the friendship value at the time of the j-th excursion for the i-th friends pair is f_i + N_i(j-1).

Because it increases by 1 each time it's chosen before j.

But this seems too involved.

Maybe I need to find a recursive relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each friends pair, the expected increase in their friendship value per excursion they are chosen.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to get some intuition.

First sample input:

100 0 24

Since m=0, there are no friends, so all pairs have friendship value 0, and the sum is 0, which matches the output.

Second sample input:

2 1 10

Pairs: 1-2 with f=1

Total possible pairs: only 1 pair since n=2.

So, in each excursion, the same pair is chosen every time, and their friendship value increases by 1 each time.

So, the friendship value at each choice is 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

Sum is 55, which matches the output.

Third sample input:

3 1 2

Pairs: 2-1 with f=1

Total possible pairs: 3 (1-2, 1-3, 2-3)

Only one pair is friends: 1-2 with f=1.

For k=2 excursions.

Possible choices:

- Choose (1,2):

First choice: f=1

Second choice: f=2 (if chosen again)

- Choose (1,3) or (2,3): f=0 always

Need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for two excursions.

This seems a bit more involved.

Fourth sample input:

5 2 4

Pairs:

1-2 with f=25

3-2 with f=24

Total possible pairs: 10 (n=5)

Need to calculate the expected sum for k=4 excursions.

This seems even more complex.

I need a general approach.

Let me try to model this differently.

Let me consider that for each friends pair, their contribution to the total sum is their initial friendship value times the number of times they are chosen, plus the number of times they are chosen before each choice they are selected again.

Wait, that sounds messy.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each friends pair is chosen.

Let R_i be the number of times the i-th friends pair is chosen across the k excursions.

Then, the total sum S is the sum over all friends pairs of f_i * R_i + (R_i * (R_i - 1)/2).

Because each time a friends pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

Wait, is that accurate?

Wait, no.

Actually, each time a friends pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, the first time they are chosen, their friendship value is f_i.

The second time, it's f_i + 1.

The third time, f_i + 2, and so on.

So, for a friends pair chosen R_i times, their contribution to the sum is f_i + (f_i + 1) + (f_i + 2) + ... + (f_i + R_i - 1) = R_i * f_i + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (R_i - 1)) = R_i * f_i + R_i * (R_i - 1) / 2.

Therefore, their total contribution is R_i * f_i + R_i * (R_i - 1) / 2.

So, for all friends pairs, the total sum S is the sum over all friends pairs of R_i * f_i + R_i * (R_i - 1) / 2.

Additionally, for non-friends pairs, their contribution is always 0.

So, the expected sum E[S] is the sum over all friends pairs of E[R_i * f_i + R_i * (R_i - 1) / 2].

Now, R_i follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p, where p is the probability of choosing that specific friends pair.

Since there are a total of n*(n-1)/2 possible pairs, p = 1 / (n*(n-1)/2).

Wait, but in the code provided, it has c = pow(n*(n-1)//1, -1, M). Wait, that seems off.

Wait, n*(n-1)//1 is just n*(n-1), which is not the number of pairs. The number of pairs is n*(n-1)/2.

So, that might be a mistake in the code.

Assuming that, p = 1 / (n*(n-1)/2) = 2 / (n*(n-1)).

Now, R_i ~ Binomial(k, p).

So, E[R_i] = k * p = k * 2 / (n*(n-1)).

Similarly, E[R_i * (R_i - 1)] = k*(k-1) * p^2.

Because for binomial, E[R*(R-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2.

So, E[R_i * (R_i - 1) / 2] = (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2.

Therefore, E[R_i * f_i + R_i * (R_i - 1)/2] = f_i * E[R_i] + E[R_i * (R_i - 1)/2].

So, plugging in E[R_i] and E[R_i * (R_i - 1)/2], we get:

f_i * (k * 2 / (n*(n-1))) + (k*(k-1) * (2 / (n*(n-1)))^2)/2.

Simplifying:

f_i * (2k / (n*(n-1))) + (k*(k-1) * 4 / (n^2 * (n-1)^2)) / 2.

Which simplifies to:

f_i * (2k / (n*(n-1))) + (k*(k-1) * 2 / (n^2 * (n-1)^2)).

Now, the total expected sum E[S] is the sum over all m friends pairs of this expression.

So, E[S] = sum over i=1 to m of [f_i * (2k / (n*(n-1))) + (k*(k-1) * 2 / (n^2 * (n-1)^2)))].

This can be written as:

(2k / (n*(n-1))) * sum f_i + m * (k*(k-1) * 2 / (n^2 * (n-1)^2)).

Let me denote s = sum f_i.

Then, E[S] = (2k * s) / (n*(n-1)) + (2 m k (k-1)) / (n^2 * (n-1)^2).

But the problem asks for this expected value modulo (10^9 + 7), after expressing it as p/q with p and q coprime and computing p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7).

Now, to implement this, I need to compute E[S] as a fraction and then find p and q such that p/q = E[S], with p and q coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod 10^9 + 7.

But, in the provided code, it seems to be calculating something different.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

M = 10 ** 9 + 7

c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)

s = 0

a = 0

for i in range(m):

(u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())

a += f

for i in range(k):

s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a

print(s % M)

There are a few issues here.

First, c is defined as pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M). But n*(n-1)//1 is just n*(n-1), which is twice the number of possible pairs. The number of possible pairs is n*(n-1)/2. So, c should be pow(n*(n-1)//2, -1, M).

Second, in the loop over k, s is being updated as s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a.

This seems incorrect based on my earlier derivation.

According to my earlier calculation, E[S] = (2k * s)/(n*(n-1)) + (2 m k (k-1))/(n^2 * (n-1)^2).

But in the code, it's accumulating s in a loop over k, adding c * i * c * m + c * a each time.

This doesn't align with the formula I derived.

So, it seems the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread it.

Let me look again.

The code has:

for i in range(k):

s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a

So, for each excursion j from 0 to k-1, it's adding c * j * c * m + c * a to s.

What is c? It's the modular inverse of n*(n-1), not divided by 2, which is incorrect.

Moreover, the expression being added doesn't match my formula.

In my formula, E[S] is a function of k, s, m, n, and it's not being built incrementally in k.

Hence, the provided code seems to be incorrect.

I think the correct approach should be to compute E[S] directly using the formula I derived:

E[S] = (2k * s)/(n*(n-1)) + (2 m k (k-1))/(n^2 * (n-1)^2).

Then, express this as a fraction p/q, reduce it to lowest terms, and compute p * q^{-1} mod 10^9 + 7.

To implement this, I need to compute numerator and denominator separately, handle the modular inverse, and ensure that the fraction is in lowest terms.

But in the provided code, it's doing something different, and hence, it's incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
