Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, such that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

First, I need to understand the condition: a + b should be a multiple of b * GCD(a, b). In other words, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b without leaving a remainder.

Let's denote GCD(a, b) as d. So, d divides both a and b. That means we can write a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d * b1.

But since a1 and b1 are coprime (GCD(a1, b1) = 1), and d divides a1 + b1, then d must divide b1. But b1 is part of b, which is multiplied by d to get b. This seems a bit circular, and I might be overcomplicating it.

Let me try another approach.

Given that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b), and since GCD(a, b) divides both a and b, let's consider the ratio:

(a + b) / (b * GCD(a, b))

This should be an integer.

Substituting a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where GCD(a1, b1) = 1:

(d * a1 + d * b1) / (d * b1 * d) = d * (a1 + b1) / (d^2 * b1) = (a1 + b1) / (d * b1)

For this to be an integer, d * b1 must divide a1 + b1.

But since a1 and b1 are coprime, and d divides a1 + b1, then d must divide a1 + b1.

Wait, but d divides a1 + b1, and a1 and b1 are coprime. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider specific examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example in the note: n=1, m=1.

So, only pair is (1,1). Check if 1 + 1 is a multiple of 1 * GCD(1,1) = 1 * 1 = 1. Yes, 2 is a multiple of 1. So, 1 pair.

Second example: n=10, m=8.

From the note, there are 14 pairs that satisfy the condition.

Let me try to find a general approach.

I need to count the number of pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

This seems tricky. Maybe I can iterate over possible values of b and, for each b, find the number of a's that satisfy the condition.

So, fix b, and find the number of a's such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

But GCD(a, b) depends on a and b, which makes this complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible values of GCD(a, b), say d, and then iterate over d.

Let d be a common divisor of a and b, so a is a multiple of d, and b is a multiple of d.

Let a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, the condition becomes:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, d * (a1 + b1) must be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplify: (a1 + b1) must be divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime except for the common factors.

Wait, no. a1 and b1 are coprime, but a1 + b1 and b1 may have common factors.

Specifically, GCD(a1 + b1, b1) = GCD(a1, b1) = 1, since a1 and b1 are coprime.

Therefore, a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime.

So, for (a1 + b1) to be divisible by d * b1, and since a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, d must be 1.

Wait, that can't be right because in the example, there are multiple pairs.

Let me think again.

If a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1, and a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, then d must be a divisor of a1 + b1.

But since a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, d can only be 1.

This suggests that d must be 1, meaning that a and b are coprime.

But that can't be right because in the example, there are pairs where a and b are not coprime.

Wait, in the fourth test case, pairs like (2,1), (2,2), (4,1), etc., some of these have GCD greater than 1.

So, my earlier assumption that d must be 1 is incorrect.

Therefore, I need to rethink this.

Let me consider the condition again:

a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b)

Which is equivalent to:

b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b

Let's denote d = GCD(a, b), so a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, d^2 * b1 divides d * (a1 + b1), which simplifies to d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, and a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1, and since a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, d must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 + b1 is less than or equal to (n/d) + (m/d), which might not help directly.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to look for another approach.

Let me consider fixing b and finding for each b, the number of a's that satisfy the condition.

For a fixed b, I need to find the number of a's such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

This still seems tricky because GCD(a, b) depends on a.

Perhaps I can iterate over possible values of GCD(a, b), say d, and then for each d, find the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy the condition.

Let d be a positive integer that divides both a and b.

Then, a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) is divisible by d^2 * b1

Which simplifies to a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, so d must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 + b1 is equal to (a + b)/d, which might not help directly.

This seems too convoluted. Maybe I need to look for a different way to approach this problem.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I can consider the condition a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * GCD(a, b)).

But this doesn't seem immediately helpful.

Let me consider small values of b and see if I can find a pattern.

Suppose b = 1.

Then, the condition is a + 1 is divisible by 1 * GCD(a, 1) = 1 * 1 = 1, which is always true, since any integer is divisible by 1.

Therefore, for b = 1, all a from 1 to n are valid.

So, for b = 1, the number of valid a's is n.

Now, suppose b = 2.

Then, the condition is a + 2 is divisible by 2 * GCD(a, 2).

Let's consider possible values of GCD(a, 2):

- If a is odd, GCD(a, 2) = 1.

- If a is even, GCD(a, 2) = 2.

So, for a odd:

a + 2 must be divisible by 2 * 1 = 2.

But a is odd, so a + 2 is odd + even = odd, which is not divisible by 2.

Therefore, no odd a's satisfy the condition for b = 2.

For a even:

a + 2 must be divisible by 2 * 2 = 4.

Since a is even, a + 2 is even, and we need a + 2 to be divisible by 4.

So, a must be congruent to 2 mod 4, or a ≡ 2 mod 4.

Therefore, for b = 2, only even a's that are multiples of 4 - 2, i.e., a = 4k - 2, satisfy the condition.

Wait, a = 4k - 2?

Wait, a + 2 ≡ 0 mod 4.

So, a ≡ -2 mod 4, which is a ≡ 2 mod 4.

So, a must be of the form 4k + 2, for integer k ≥ 0, and within 1 to n.

So, for b = 2, the number of valid a's is the number of a's in 1 to n that are congruent to 2 mod 4.

Similarly, for b = 3:

GCD(a, 3) can be 1 or 3.

If GCD(a, 3) = 1, i.e., a is not divisible by 3:

a + 3 must be divisible by 3 * 1 = 3.

Since a is not divisible by 3, a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

So, a + 3 ≡ 1 + 0 = 1 mod 3, or 2 + 0 = 2 mod 3, neither of which is 0 mod 3.

Therefore, no a's with GCD(a, 3) = 1 satisfy the condition.

If GCD(a, 3) = 3, i.e., a is divisible by 3:

a + 3 must be divisible by 3 * 3 = 9.

Since a is divisible by 3, a + 3 is divisible by 3, but we need it to be divisible by 9.

So, a must be ≡ -3 mod 9, which is a ≡ 6 mod 9.

Therefore, for b = 3, only a's that are multiples of 3 and congruent to 6 mod 9 satisfy the condition.

This seems too case-specific and not generalizable easily.

Maybe I need to find a better way.

Let me consider the condition again:

b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Let me denote d = GCD(a, b), so a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, the condition becomes:

d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, and a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, so d must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 + b1 is less than or equal to n/d + m/d, which might not help directly.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b), which implies that GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

But since GCD(a, b) divides both a and b, it already divides a + b.

So, that doesn't add any new information.

Wait, but the condition is stronger: b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

So, it's not just GCD(a, b) divides a + b, but b times that.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a mathematical relationship or formula that can help simplify this condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of b and find a's that satisfy the condition for each b.

Given the constraints, n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, but the sum of n and m over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^6.

So, I need an efficient way to compute the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Perhaps precomputing some values or using mathematical insights to compute the count quickly.

Let me consider that for a fixed b, I need to find the number of a's such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Let me fix b and iterate over possible GCD's d that divide b.

Since d divides both a and b, and b is fixed, d must be a divisor of b.

So, for a fixed b, I can iterate over all divisors d of b, and for each d, find the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy the condition.

Wait, more precisely:

For a fixed b, and for each possible d that divides b, I can find the number of a's that are multiples of d and have GCD(a, b) = d.

Then, for each such a, check if a + b is divisible by b * d.

But this seems time-consuming for large n and m.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the ratio (a + b)/(b * GCD(a, b)).

This needs to be an integer.

Given a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1, as before.

Then, (a + b)/(b * GCD(a, b)) = (d * a1 + d * b1)/(d * b1 * d) = (a1 + b1)/(d * b1)

For this to be an integer, d * b1 must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, and a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime, so d must divide a1 + b1.

Given that a1 = a/d and b1 = b/d, and a1 + b1 = (a + b)/d.

So, d must divide (a + b)/d, meaning that d^2 divides a + b.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, the condition simplifies to d^2 divides a + b.

But d = GCD(a, b), and a + b is divisible by d^2.

So, the condition is that GCD(a, b)^2 divides a + b.

That's a simpler way to think about it.

Therefore, the condition is that GCD(a, b)^2 divides a + b.

So, I need to count the number of pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and GCD(a, b)^2 divides a + b.

This seems more manageable.

Now, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of GCD(a, b), say d, and for each d, count the number of pairs (a, b) where GCD(a, b) = d, and d^2 divides a + b.

To do this, I can iterate over all possible d, and for each d, iterate over multiples of d up to n and m.

Wait, but this might still be too slow for large n and m.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a given d, the number of pairs where GCD(a, b) = d is equal to the number of pairs where GCD(a/d, b/d) = 1, with a/d ranging from 1 to floor(n/d), and b/d ranging from 1 to floor(m/d).

So, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of coprime pairs (x, y) where x = a/d and y = b/d, with 1 ≤ x ≤ floor(n/d), and 1 ≤ y ≤ floor(m/d).

Now, among these pairs, I need to count only those where d^2 divides a + b.

Given that a = d * x and b = d * y, so a + b = d * (x + y).

Therefore, d^2 divides d * (x + y), which simplifies to d divides x + y.

So, the condition is that d divides x + y.

Therefore, for each d, I need to count the number of coprime pairs (x, y) where 1 ≤ x ≤ floor(n/d), 1 ≤ y ≤ floor(m/d), and x + y is divisible by d.

This seems more manageable.

So, for each d, the number of valid pairs is equal to the number of coprime pairs (x, y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ floor(n/d), 1 ≤ y ≤ floor(m/d), and x + y ≡ 0 mod d.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I need a way to count the number of coprime pairs (x, y) in a range with the sum divisible by d.

This still seems complicated, but perhaps I can find a formula or a way to compute this for each d.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better mathematical approach to this problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a and iterate over b, or vice versa.

But with n and m up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, I need an O(1) or O(log N) solution per test case, or at least something that can be precomputed.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some values or use inclusion-exclusion based on divisors.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to see if I can find a pattern.

First sample input: n=1, m=1.

Only pair is (1,1). Since GCD(1,1)=1, and 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 1*1=1. So, 1 pair.

Second sample input: n=2, m=3.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).

Let's check each:

- (1,1): 1 + 1 = 2, divisible by 1*1=1. Yes.

- (1,2): GCD(1,2)=1, 1 + 2 = 3, divisible by 2*1=2? 3 is not divisible by 2. No.

- (1,3): GCD(1,3)=1, 1 + 3 = 4, divisible by 3*1=3? 4 is not divisible by 3. No.

- (2,1): GCD(2,1)=1, 2 + 1 = 3, divisible by 1*1=1. Yes.

- (2,2): GCD(2,2)=2, 2 + 2 = 4, divisible by 2*2=4? 4 is divisible by 4. Yes.

- (2,3): GCD(2,3)=1, 2 + 3 = 5, divisible by 3*1=3? 5 is not divisible by 3. No.

So, valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Total: 3.

Third sample input: n=3, m=5.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).

Checking each:

- (1,1): Yes.

- (1,2): No.

- (1,3): No.

- (1,4): GCD(1,4)=1, 1+4=5, not divisible by 4*1=4. No.

- (1,5): GCD(1,5)=1, 1+5=6, not divisible by 5*1=5. No.

- (2,1): Yes.

- (2,2): Yes.

- (2,3): No.

- (2,4): GCD(2,4)=2, 2+4=6, divisible by 4*2=8? 6 is not divisible by 8. No.

- (2,5): GCD(2,5)=1, 2+5=7, not divisible by 5*1=5. No.

- (3,1): Yes.

- (3,2): GCD(3,2)=1, 3+2=5, not divisible by 2*1=2. No.

- (3,3): GCD(3,3)=3, 3+3=6, divisible by 3*3=9? 6 is not divisible by 9. No.

- (3,4): GCD(3,4)=1, 3+4=7, not divisible by 4*1=4. No.

- (3,5): GCD(3,5)=1, 3+5=8, not divisible by 5*1=5. No.

Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1). Total: 4.

This matches the sample output.

From these small examples, it seems that pairs where b=1 are always valid, and some pairs where b>1 also satisfy the condition based on the GCD.

But I need a general approach for larger n and m.

Let me consider that for b=1, all a's are valid, as we saw earlier.

For b>1, I need to find a's such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Given the time constraints, perhaps I can iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, iterate over possible GCD's d that divide b, and then find the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy d^2 divides a + b.

Wait, but this might still be too slow for large m and n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider precomputing the number of valid a's for each b and d.

But with n and m up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

Perhaps I can iterate over possible d's and compute the number of pairs for each d.

Let me try that.

Let d be a positive integer.

For each d, I need to find pairs (a, b) where GCD(a, b) = d, 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and d^2 divides a + b.

But a + b = a + b, and GCD(a, b) = d.

As before, a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, a + b = d * (a1 + b1), and d^2 divides d * (a1 + b1), which simplifies to d divides a1 + b1.

So, a1 + b1 is divisible by d.

Given that a1 and b1 are coprime, I need to count the number of coprime pairs (a1, b1) where 1 ≤ a1 ≤ floor(n/d), 1 ≤ b1 ≤ floor(m/d), and a1 + b1 is divisible by d.

This seems manageable.

Now, to count the number of coprime pairs (a1, b1) with a1 + b1 ≡ 0 mod d, I can iterate over possible a1 and compute b1 = -a1 mod d, and ensure that GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

But this still seems time-consuming for large n and m.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for fixed d, the number of such pairs is equal to the sum over a1 from 1 to floor(n/d) of the number of b1 from 1 to floor(m/d) such that b1 ≡ -a1 mod d and GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

This can be written as:

sum over a1=1 to floor(n/d):

sum over b1=1 to floor(m/d):

[b1 ≡ -a1 mod d] and [GCD(a1, b1) = 1]

This seems complicated to compute directly.

Perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion or some number-theoretic functions here.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate over possible b1 and for each b1, find the number of a1's that satisfy a1 ≡ -b1 mod d and GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

This is similar to counting the number of a1's in [1, floor(n/d)] such that a1 ≡ -b1 mod d and GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

This still seems tricky.

Let me consider that for fixed d and b1, the number of a1's that satisfy a1 ≡ -b1 mod d and GCD(a1, b1) = 1 can be computed using Euler's Totient Function.

But Euler's Totient Function counts the number of integers up to a certain number that are coprime to it.

In this case, for each b1, I need to count the number of a1's in [1, floor(n/d)] such that a1 ≡ -b1 mod d and GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

This seems too slow for large n and m.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each d, the number of pairs (a1, b1) where a1 and b1 are coprime, 1 ≤ a1 ≤ floor(n/d), 1 ≤ b1 ≤ floor(m/d), and a1 + b1 is divisible by d.

I can iterate over d from 1 to min(n, m), and for each d, compute this count.

But even this might be too slow.

Given the time constraints, perhaps there's a mathematical formula that can compute this more efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe I can precompute some values or use sieve methods to speed up the computation.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each d, the number of pairs where a1 + b1 is divisible by d can be computed as floor((n/d + m/d) / d) or something similar.

But I need to ensure that GCD(a1, b1) = 1, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion over the divisors of d.

But this seems too involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, iterate over possible d's that divide b, and then find the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy d^2 divides a + b.

But again, this might be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a fixed b, and d dividing b, the number of a's that are multiples of d and where d^2 divides a + b is equal to the number of a's where a ≡ -b mod d^2.

So, for each b and d dividing b, the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy a ≡ -b mod d^2.

This can be computed as the number of a's in [1, n] where a ≡ -b mod d^2 and a is a multiple of d.

But a being a multiple of d means a ≡ 0 mod d.

So, a must satisfy a ≡ -b mod d^2 and a ≡ 0 mod d.

Since d divides d^2, and a ≡ 0 mod d, and a ≡ -b mod d^2, we can combine these congruences.

Specifically, a ≡ -b mod d^2 and a ≡ 0 mod d.

Since d divides d^2, and a ≡ 0 mod d, we can write a = d * k for some integer k.

Then, d * k ≡ -b mod d^2, which simplifies to k ≡ -b/d mod d.

So, k ≡ -b/d mod d.

Therefore, k = -b/d + t * d for some integer t.

But k must be such that a = d * k is in [1, n], so k ∈ [1/d, n/d].

Wait, but k must be an integer, so 1 ≤ d * k ≤ n ⇒ 1/d ≤ k ≤ n/d.

But d is at least 1, so k is from 1 to floor(n/d).

Now, k ≡ -b/d mod d.

So, for each b and d dividing b, I can compute k ≡ -b/d mod d, and then find the number of k's in [1, floor(n/d)] that satisfy this congruence.

This seems feasible.

So, for each b from 1 to m, and for each d dividing b, compute k ≡ -b/d mod d, and count the number of k's in [1, floor(n/d)] that satisfy this.

Then, sum over all such b's and d's.

But this still seems too slow for large m and n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each b, and for each d dividing b, I can compute the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy a ≡ -b mod d^2.

Given that a is a multiple of d, a = d * k, and a ≡ -b mod d^2, which translates to d * k ≡ -b mod d^2, or k ≡ -b/d mod d.

So, k ≡ -b/d mod d.

Therefore, k can be written as k = -b/d + t * d for integer t.

But k must be positive and up to floor(n/d).

So, I can find the number of t's such that 1 ≤ d * k ≤ n, where k = -b/d + t * d.

This seems messy.

Perhaps I can compute the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy a ≡ -b mod d^2 directly.

The number of such a's is floor(n/d) divided by d, adjusted for the offset.

But this is getting too complicated.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that the condition a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b) can be rewritten in terms of a/b.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of a and b and use mathematical insights to count the valid pairs without checking each pair individually.

Given the time constraints, I need an O(1) or O(log N) solution per test case, or at least something that can be precomputed.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the number of valid pairs for all possible n and m up to 2*10^6, but that would require O(N^2) space, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can precompute some number-theoretic functions like the number of integers up to n that are coprime with a certain number, but this still seems too involved.

Given the time constraints, perhaps there's a simpler mathematical formula or observation that I'm missing.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs again.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1: n=1, m=1 → 1 pair

Test case 2: n=2, m=3 → 3 pairs

Test case 3: n=3, m=5 → 4 pairs

Test case 4: n=10, m=8 → 14 pairs

Test case 5: n=100, m=1233 → 153 pairs

Test case 6: n=1000000, m=1145141 → 1643498 pairs

Looking at these, it seems that the number of pairs grows roughly linearly with n and m, but it's not straightforward.

Perhaps the number of valid pairs can be expressed as a function of n and m, but I need to find what that function is.

Let me consider that for b=1, all a's are valid, which gives n pairs.

For b=2, only certain a's satisfy the condition, and so on.

So, the total number of pairs is equal to n (for b=1) plus the number of valid a's for b=2 to m.

But I need a better way to compute this.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of valid a's is equal to the number of a's in [1, n] such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

This seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each b, the number of valid a's is equal to the number of a's in [1, n] where GCD(a, b) divides (a + b)/b.

But this seems too similar to the original condition and not helpful.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b), which implies that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

This can be rewritten as:

a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * GCD(a, b))

But I'm not sure how to use this directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that a ≡ -b mod (b * GCD(a, b))

But again, this seems too similar.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula or identity that can help simplify this condition.

After struggling with this for a while, I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for each b, and for each d dividing b, I can compute the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy d^2 divides a + b.

So, for each b and d dividing b:

Number of a's = floor(n/d) / d, adjusted for the offset.

But this is still too vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a precomputed solution or find a pattern in the sample inputs.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1: n=1, m=1 → 1 pair

Test case 2: n=2, m=3 → 3 pairs

Test case 3: n=3, m=5 → 4 pairs

Test case 4: n=10, m=8 → 14 pairs

Test case 5: n=100, m=1233 → 153 pairs

Test case 6: n=1000000, m=1145141 → 1643498 pairs

Looking at these, it seems that the number of pairs is roughly n + m, but not exactly.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, m=1 → 1 pair.

In the second test case, n=2, m=3 → 3 pairs.

In the third test case, n=3, m=5 → 4 pairs.

In the fourth test case, n=10, m=8 → 14 pairs.

In the fifth test case, n=100, m=1233 → 153 pairs.

In the sixth test case, n=1000000, m=1145141 → 1643498 pairs.

It seems that the number of pairs is close to n + floor(n/b), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n + floor(m/a), but again, not sure.

This is getting too time-consuming.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach or seek help from online resources.

But since this is a programming problem, perhaps I can look for patterns or mathematical formulas that can help compute the number of valid pairs efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle based on divisors.

But I'm not sure.

Given that time is limited, perhaps I should implement a solution based on the initial observations and see if it works.

So, in summary, my approach would be:

- Iterate over each b from 1 to m.

- For each b, iterate over all possible d's that divide b.

- For each d, compute the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy d^2 divides a + b.

- Sum these counts over all b's to get the total number of valid pairs.

However, as discussed earlier, this might be too slow for large n and m.

Given that the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^6, perhaps this approach is acceptable, as long as it's optimized.

To optimize, I can precompute the divisors for all numbers up to 2*10^6, and then for each test case, iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, iterate over its precomputed divisors d, and compute the number of valid a's for each d.

Computing the number of valid a's for each d can be done using the formula:

floor((n - (b * (d - 1)))/ (d * d))

But I'm not entirely sure about this formula.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should implement this approach and see if it works.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula or observation that I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the number of valid pairs is equal to n + m - GCD(n, m), or something similar, but the sample inputs don't support this.

Wait, in the first sample input, n=1, m=1: 1 + 1 - 1 = 1, which matches.

Second sample input, n=2, m=3: 2 + 3 - 1 = 4, but the correct answer is 3, so doesn't match.

Third sample input, n=3, m=5: 3 + 5 - 1 = 7, but the correct answer is 4, so doesn't match.

Fourth sample input, n=10, m=8: 10 + 8 - 2 = 16, but the correct answer is 14, so close but not exact.

Fifth sample input, n=100, m=1233: 100 + 1233 - GCD(100,1233)=100 + 1233 - 1=1332, but the correct answer is 153, which doesn't match.

Sixth sample input, n=1000000, m=1145141: 1000000 + 1145141 - GCD(1000000,1145141)=1000000 + 1145141 - 1=2145140, but the correct answer is 1643498, which doesn't match.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Perhaps another observation: in the first sample input, n=1, m=1: 1 pair.

In the second sample input, n=2, m=3: 3 pairs.

In the third sample input, n=3, m=5: 4 pairs.

In the fourth sample input, n=10, m=8: 14 pairs.

In the fifth sample input, n=100, m=1233: 153 pairs.

In the sixth sample input, n=1000000, m=1145141: 1643498 pairs.

Looking at these, it seems that the number of pairs is roughly n + m - something, but it's not consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of coprime pairs, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Given that I'm running out of time, perhaps I should implement the initial approach and see if it works.

So, I'll proceed with iterating over b from 1 to m, and for each b, iterating over its divisors d, and computing the number of a's that are multiples of d and satisfy d^2 divides a + b.

To compute the number of such a's, I can compute the number of a's in [1, n] where a ≡ -b mod (d^2) and a is a multiple of d.

This can be computed using the formula for the number of solutions to a ≡ -b mod (d^2) and a ≡ 0 mod d.

Since d divides d^2, I can find the number of a's that satisfy both congruences.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

I'll need to:

- Precompute the divisors for all numbers up to 2*10^6.

- For each test case, iterate over b from 1 to m.

- For each b, iterate over its divisors d.

- For each d, compute the number of a's in [1, n] that are multiples of d and satisfy a ≡ -b mod (d^2).

- Sum these counts for all b's and output the total.

To optimize, I can precompute the divisors for all numbers up to 2*10^6 in the beginning.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^6, this should be feasible.

I'll proceed with this approach.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). We'll leverage mathematical insights and efficient computation to achieve this.

### Approach

1. **Insight into the Condition**:
   - Given the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can express it mathematically and simplify it using properties of GCD.
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a1\) and \(b = d \cdot b1\) where \(\gcd(a1, b1) = 1\).
   - The condition simplifies to \(d \cdot (a1 + b1)\) being divisible by \(d^2 \cdot b1\), which further simplifies to \(a1 + b1\) being divisible by \(d \cdot b1\).

2. **Efficient Pair Counting**:
   - For each \(b\), iterate over its divisors \(d\).
   - For each \(d\), compute the number of \(a\)'s that are multiples of \(d\) and satisfy \(a + b\) being divisible by \(d^2\).

3. **Optimized Computation**:
   - Precompute divisors for all numbers up to the maximum possible value of \(m\) (2,000,000).
   - Use precomputed divisors to quickly iterate over possible \(d\)'s for each \(b\).
   - Calculate the count of valid \(a\)'s for each \(d\) using arithmetic progression properties.

                continue
