Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets. Alice has A coins, and Bob has B coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses. We need to determine who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. Each turn consists of two steps: choosing to swap wallets or not, and then removing one coin from the current wallet. Importantly, the wallet can't have zero coins before removing a coin. So, if a player has zero coins, they can't remove a coin and thus lose.

Let me think about the base cases. If Alice has zero coins initially, she loses immediately because she can't make a move. But according to the problem, A and B are at least 1, so both start with at least one coin.

Let's consider the first test case from the example: A=1, B=1.

- Alice's turn: She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: A=1, B=1 (same as before).

- If she doesn't swap: A=0, B=1.

- If she swaps: A=1, B=0.

Wait, but in the note, it says that when A=1, B=1, Bob wins. Let me see what happens.

- Alice chooses not to swap: A=0, B=1.

- Bob's turn: His wallet has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: A=0, B=0.

- If he doesn't swap: A=0, B=0.

- In either case, Alice's turn next: A=0, B=0. She can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case: A=1, B=4.

- Alice's turn: She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=0, B=4.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=4. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: A=4, B=0.

- Alice's turn: A=4, B=0. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=3, B=0.

- Bob's turn: A=3, B=0. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: A=0, B=3.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=3. She must not swap: A=0, B=2.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=2. He must not swap: A=0, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=1. She must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Alice wins in this case.

So, seems like swapping can be strategic.

I need to find a general rule for any A and B.

Let me think in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games since the moves available depend only on the game state, not on which player is moving.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where you have heaps and you remove objects.

But in this case, the moves are more complicated due to the swapping option.

Let me try to model this.

Let's think recursively. For any state (A, B), the current player can choose to swap or not, then remove one coin from their wallet.

So, from (A, B), if the player chooses not to swap:

- New state: (A-1, B)

If the player chooses to swap:

- New state: (B, A-1)

Because after swapping, they remove one coin from their current wallet.

Wait, no. After swapping, their wallets are exchanged, so Alice's wallet becomes B, and Bob's becomes A. Then, removing one coin from the current wallet means:

- If Alice swaps, then her wallet becomes B, then she removes one coin from B, so B becomes B-1, and Alice's wallet is now B-1, and Bob's is A.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify:

- Initial state: Alice has A coins, Bob has B coins.

- Alice chooses to swap or not.

- If she chooses not to swap:

- She removes one coin from her wallet: A becomes A-1, B remains B.

- If she chooses to swap:

- Wallets are exchanged: Alice now has B coins, Bob has A coins.

- Then, Alice removes one coin from her current wallet: so A becomes A, B becomes B-1.

Wait, no:

- After swapping, Alice has B coins, Bob has A coins.

- Then, Alice removes one coin from her current wallet, which is B coins: so B becomes B-1.

- So the new state is: Alice has B-1 coins, Bob has A coins.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if A + B is even or odd.

So, perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of A + B.

Looking at the sample input and output:

1 1 -> Bob

1 4 -> Alice

5 3 -> Bob

4 5 -> Alice

11 9 -> Bob

83 91 -> Bob

1032 9307 -> Alice

839204 7281 -> Alice

1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at these, it seems that when A + B is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

1 + 1 = 2 (even) -> Bob

1 + 4 = 5 (odd) -> Alice

5 + 3 = 8 (even) -> Bob

4 + 5 = 9 (odd) -> Alice

11 + 9 = 20 (even) -> Bob

83 + 91 = 174 (even) -> Bob

1032 + 9307 = 1032 + 9307 = 1032 is even, 9307 is odd, sum is odd -> Alice

839204 is even, 7281 is odd, sum is odd -> Alice

1000000000 + 1000000000 = even -> Bob

53110 is even, 2024 is even, sum is even -> Bob

So, in all cases, if A + B is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Is this always true?

Let me try to see.

Base case: A = 1, B = 1 -> sum = 2 (even) -> Bob wins.

A = 1, B = 2 -> sum = 3 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Let's simulate A=1, B=2.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=0, B=2.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=2. He must not swap: A=0, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=1. She must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

- If Alice chooses to swap: A=2, B=0.

- Bob's turn: A=2, B=0. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=1, B=0.

- Alice's turn: A=1, B=0. She can choose to swap: A=0, B=1.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=1. He must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Wait, but in this case, if Alice chooses to swap, Bob wins; if she doesn't, Alice wins. So, since Alice plays optimally, she chooses not to swap, and wins.

Hence, Alice wins when A + B is odd.

Another test case: A=2, B=2.

Sum is 4 (even). According to the pattern, Bob wins.

Let's simulate.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=2.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=2. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=0, B=2.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=2. She must not swap: A=0, B=1.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=1. He must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

- If Bob chooses to swap: A=2, B=0.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=0. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=0.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=0. He must swap: A=0, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=1. She must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, so if Bob chooses to swap, Alice wins; if he doesn't, Bob wins.

But in the first scenario, Bob chooses not to swap and wins; in the second, he chooses to swap and loses.

So, Bob, playing optimally, would choose not to swap and win.

Hence, Bob wins when A + B is even.

This seems consistent with the pattern.

So, the strategy seems to be that if A + B is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let's think in terms of Grundy numbers or Mex function from game theory.

But that might be too time-consuming for large A and B (up to 1e9).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or parity argument.

Let me consider the total number of coins: A + B.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one, since one coin is removed each turn.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins.

But because they can swap wallets, it's not straightforward.

Wait, but the swapping allows players to choose whose coins to deplete.

It seems that the player who has to make the last move loses, because they can't make a move when their wallet is empty.

This resembles the game of Nim, where the player who takes the last object loses in misère Nim.

But standard Nim is for normal play, where the last move wins.

Misère Nim has different rules.

Perhaps this game is similar to misère Nim.

In standard Nim, the Grundy number (xor of heap sizes) determines the winner.

In misère Nim, it's more complicated.

But perhaps in this game, the parity of A + B determines the winner, as suggested by the sample inputs.

Let me try to generalize.

Suppose A + B is even.

Then, Bob wins.

If A + B is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for the sample inputs.

Is there a way to confirm this without simulating every possible game state?

Given the constraints (A and B up to 1e9, T up to 1000), a simple solution based on parity would be efficient.

But I need to ensure it's correct.

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose A=1, B=1: sum=2 (even), Bob wins. Matches sample.

A=1, B=2: sum=3 (odd), Alice wins. Matches sample.

A=2, B=2: sum=4 (even), Bob wins. Matches sample.

A=3, B=3: sum=6 (even), Bob wins.

Let's simulate A=3, B=3.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=2, B=3.

- Bob's turn: A=2, B=3. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=1, B=3.

- Alice's turn: A=1, B=3. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=0, B=3.

- Bob's turn: A=0, B=3. He must not swap: A=0, B=2.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

- Alternatively, if Alice chooses to swap: A=3, B=0.

- Bob's turn: A=3, B=0. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=2, B=0.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=0. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=0.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=0. He must swap: A=0, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=1. She must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So, depending on the choices, different outcomes are possible.

But since both players play optimally, Bob would choose the path where he wins.

Hence, in this case, if Alice doesn't swap, Bob wins; if she swaps, Alice wins.

So, Bob would win when A + B is even.

Another test case: A=4, B=5. Sum=9 (odd), Alice wins.

Let's simulate.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=3, B=5.

- Bob's turn: A=3, B=5. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=2, B=5.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=5. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=5.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=5. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=0, B=5.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

- But according to the pattern, Alice should win when A + B is odd.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: A=5, B=3.

- Bob's turn: A=5, B=3. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: A=3, B=4.

- Alice's turn: A=3, B=4. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: A=4, B=2.

- Bob's turn: A=4, B=2. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: A=2, B=3.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=3. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: A=3, B=1.

- Bob's turn: A=3, B=1. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=2, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=1. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=1.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=1. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=0, B=1.

- Alice's turn: A=0, B=1. She must swap: A=0, B=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So, in this path, Alice wins.

Another path:

- Alice swaps: A=5, B=3.

- Bob doesn't swap: A=4, B=3.

- Alice's turn: A=4, B=3. She can swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=3, B=3.

- Bob's turn: A=3, B=3. He can swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=2, B=3.

- Alice's turn: A=2, B=3. She can swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: A=1, B=3.

- Bob's turn: A=1, B=3. He can swap or not.

- If he doesn't swap: A=0, B=3.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, again, depending on the choices, different outcomes.

But since both play optimally, and Alice goes first, perhaps in this case, Alice can force a win by choosing the right path.

Given the complexity of simulating all possible moves, especially for large A and B, it's essential to find a general rule.

Given that the sample inputs suggest that the sum's parity determines the winner, and considering the time constraints for large inputs, it's reasonable to implement this parity check.

Therefore, the provided code checks if A + B is even, in which case Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins.

Given that this seems to align with the sample inputs and outputs, and considering the time constraints, this approach is likely correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, given their initial number of coins in their wallets. Both players play optimally, and the game proceeds with specific rules for swapping wallets and removing coins.

### Approach
1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Alice starts first.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, followed by removing one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Play Observation**:
   - By analyzing several test cases, we observe a pattern based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Efficient Solution**:
   - Given the large possible values of coins (up to 1,000,000,000), an efficient way to determine the winner is by checking the parity of the sum of coins.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    test = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for t in range(test):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Extract the number of test cases and iterate through each case.

2. **Determine Winner**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - Check if this sum is even or odd.
   - If even, print "Bob"; if odd, print "Alice".

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution runs in O(1) time per test case, making it highly efficient for up to 1000 test cases.

This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently and correctly determines the winner based on the observed pattern in the problem's constraints and examples.
