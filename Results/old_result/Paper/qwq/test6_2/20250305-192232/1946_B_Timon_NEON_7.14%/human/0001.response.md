Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform exactly k operations on it. In each operation, I select a contiguous subarray (which could even be empty), calculate its sum, and insert that sum anywhere in the array. I need to maximize the sum of the array after k such operations, and since the result can be very large, I have to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what these operations allow me to do. Each operation lets me pick any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum back into the array wherever I want. I have to do this exactly k times, and my goal is to maximize the total sum of the array after these operations.

Let me think about how these operations can increase the sum of the array. Whenever I insert a sum of a subarray, I'm adding that value to the array, which directly increases the total sum. So, to maximize the sum, I should choose subarrays with the largest possible sums to insert.

But there's a catch: the subarray is contiguous, and I have to insert the sum back into the array, which can potentially create new subarrays with even larger sums in future operations. It's a bit tricky to see how these operations interact with each other.

Maybe I should consider the maximum sum of any subarray in the initial array and see how that can be amplified over k operations.

I recall that there's a standard algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subarray in O(n) time, known as Kadane's algorithm. Maybe I can use that here.

Let me recall how Kadane's algorithm works. It scans the array, keeping track of the current maximum subarray sum ending at each position. It updates the global maximum whenever the current maximum becomes larger than the global maximum.

But in this problem, I'm not just finding the maximum subarray sum once; I need to perform k operations, each time selecting a subarray, inserting its sum, and maximizing the total sum after all operations.

I need to think about how these k insertions can be optimized to maximize the total sum.

One idea is to always select the subarray with the maximum sum and insert it back into the array. This way, in each operation, I'm adding the largest possible value to the array.

Wait, but where should I insert it? Since I can choose any position, maybe it doesn't matter where I insert it because I'm only interested in the sum, not in the array's structure.

So, perhaps in each operation, I can add the maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

But that seems too simplistic. Let's see with an example.

Take the first example in the input:

n = 2, k = 2

a = [-4, -7]

In this case, all elements are negative, so the maximum subarray sum is 0, corresponding to an empty subarray.

According to the explanation, in this case, it's advantageous to take an empty subarray twice and insert 0 each time. So the final array would be [-4, -7, 0, 0], with a sum of -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

Okay, so in this case, inserting the sum of the empty subarray twice gives us the maximum sum possible.

Another example:

n = 3, k = 3

a = [2, 2, 8]

Here, the maximum subarray sum is 12 (2 + 2 + 8). If I insert 12 into the array three times, I could have [2, 2, 8, 12, 12, 12], with a sum of 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 48.

But according to the sample output, it's 96, which suggests that perhaps I can insert the sum multiple times and it gets compounded.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that inserting a sum can create new subarrays with even larger sums in future operations.

Wait, but in the first example, with all negative numbers, inserting zeros is the best I can do.

In the second example, inserting the total sum each time seems to be the way to go.

Wait, in the second example, the explanation says:

"[2, 2, 8] -> [2, 2, 8, 12] -> [2, 2, 8, 12, 24] -> [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]"

So, each time, they're taking the sum of the current array and inserting it at the end.

Wait, but the sum of [2,2,8,12] is 24, and they insert 24 at the end, making it [2,2,8,12,24], and then sum is 48, insert 48 to make [2,2,8,12,24,48], with sum 96.

So, it seems like in each operation, they're inserting the sum of the current array.

But in the first example, they're inserting the sum of an empty subarray, which is zero, twice.

Wait, but in the first operation, if they insert the sum of the entire array, which is -11, and insert -11, that would make the array [-4, -7, -11], with sum -22.

That's worse than inserting zero.

So, perhaps the strategy is to insert the maximum possible sum in each operation, which in the case where all elements are negative, is zero (from the empty subarray).

In the second example, the maximum sum is the sum of the entire array, which is positive, so inserting that repeatedly increases the total sum.

Wait, but in the second operation, the sum becomes 12 + 12 = 24, and in the third operation, 24 + 12 = 36, but according to the explanation, it's 12 + 24 + 48 = 84, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second example, they're inserting the sum of the current array each time.

Wait, no, the explanation says they're taking the sum of the entire array and inserting it.

Wait, but in the first operation, sum is 12, insert 12 to make [2,2,8,12], sum is 24.

Second operation, sum is 24, insert 24 to make [2,2,8,12,24], sum is 48.

Third operation, sum is 48, insert 48 to make [2,2,8,12,24,48], sum is 96.

So, it seems like in each operation, they're inserting the current sum of the array.

But in the first example, with negative numbers, inserting zero is better than inserting the negative sum.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to insert the maximum possible sum of any subarray in each operation.

In the second example, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the entire array, which is positive, so inserting that repeatedly increases the sum exponentially.

In the first example, the maximum subarray sum is zero, so inserting zero in each operation is the best.

So, maybe the key is to find the maximum subarray sum, and if it's positive, then after k insertions, the total sum would be the initial sum plus k times the maximum subarray sum.

Wait, but in the second example, it's not just initial sum plus k times the maximum subarray sum; it's more than that because each insertion increases the sum, which in turn increases the maximum subarray sum for the next operation.

Wait, no, in the second example, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the entire array, which is positive, so inserting that sum each time increases the total sum.

Wait, but in the first operation, sum is 12, insert 12 to make sum 24.

Second operation, sum is 24, insert 24 to make sum 48.

Third operation, sum is 48, insert 48 to make sum 96.

So, it's doubling the sum in each operation.

Wait, initial sum is 12.

After first insertion: sum = 12 + 12 = 24

Second insertion: sum = 24 + 24 = 48

Third insertion: sum = 48 + 48 = 96

So, it's like sum becomes sum + max_subarray_sum, where max_subarray_sum is equal to the current sum.

Wait, but in this case, max_subarray_sum is the sum of the entire array, which is the current sum.

So, in each operation, inserting the current sum doubles the sum.

Hence, after k insertions, the sum becomes sum * (2^k).

But in the first example, with sum = -11, and max_subarray_sum = 0, inserting zero each time adds zero to the sum, so the sum remains -11 after k insertions.

Wait, but in reality, inserting zero k times would add zero each time, so sum remains -11.

But according to the sample output, it's 999,999,996, which is -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Wait, but in the explanation, they say inserting zero twice makes the array [-4, -7, 0, 0], with sum -11.

So, it seems like inserting zero k times adds zero each time, so the sum remains the same as the initial sum.

But in the second example, inserting the sum each time doubles the sum in each insertion.

Wait, but in the second example, inserting the sum each time adds the sum to the array, which increases the total sum by the sum.

Hence, sum becomes sum + sum = 2 * sum.

Then, in the next operation, sum becomes 2 * sum + 2 * sum = 4 * sum.

Wait, no, wait: after first insertion, sum is sum + sum = 2 * sum.

Second insertion: sum is 2 * sum + 2 * sum = 4 * sum.

Third insertion: sum is 4 * sum + 4 * sum = 8 * sum.

But according to the explanation, it's 96, which is 12 * 8.

Wait, but in the explanation, they show:

[2,2,8] -> [2,2,8,12] (sum=24)

-> [2,2,8,12,24] (sum=48)

-> [2,2,8,12,24,48] (sum=96)

So, each time, they're inserting the current sum, which doubles the sum.

Hence, after k insertions, sum becomes sum * (2^k).

Wait, but in the first example, inserting zero k times would keep the sum the same as the initial sum.

So, general formula: sum_after_k_insertions = sum + (max_subarray_sum) * (2^k - 1)

Wait, in the second example, sum = 12, max_subarray_sum = 12.

According to this formula: sum_after_k_insertions = 12 + 12 * (2^3 - 1) = 12 + 12 * 7 = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches the sample.

In the first example, sum = -11, max_subarray_sum = 0.

sum_after_k_insertions = -11 + 0 * (2^2 - 1) = -11 + 0 = -11, which matches the sample.

So, this seems to be the correct formula.

Hence, the strategy is:

1. Compute the initial sum of the array.

2. Find the maximum sum of any subarray (including the empty subarray, which has sum zero).

3. The final sum after k insertions is: initial_sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1)

Wait, but in the second example, initial_sum = 12, max_subarray_sum = 12.

According to this formula: 12 + 12 * (8 - 1) = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches.

In the first example, initial_sum = -11, max_subarray_sum = 0.

-11 + 0 * (4 - 1) = -11 + 0 = -11, which matches.

So, this seems correct.

Wait, but in the second example, if I insert the sum each time, the sum doubles each time.

Wait, initial sum = 12.

After first insertion: sum = 12 + 12 = 24.

After second insertion: sum = 24 + 24 = 48.

After third insertion: sum = 48 + 48 = 96.

So, it's sum * 2^k.

But according to the formula sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1), it's sum + sum * (2^k - 1) = sum * 2^k.

So, it's consistent.

Hence, the general formula is sum * 2^k.

But in the first example, sum is -11, and max_subarray_sum is 0, so sum + 0 * (2^k - 1) = sum.

Hence, the formula is sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1).

But in cases where max_subarray_sum is equal to sum, it becomes sum * 2^k.

Wait, but in the second example, sum = 12, max_subarray_sum = 12.

So, sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1) = sum + sum * (2^k - 1) = sum * 2^k.

Which matches the sample.

In the first example, sum = -11, max_subarray_sum = 0.

sum + 0 * (2^k - 1) = sum = -11.

Which matches the sample.

So, this seems correct.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to:

1. Compute the initial sum of the array.

2. Find the maximum sum of any subarray using Kadane's algorithm.

3. Compute the final sum as sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1).

4. Take the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Also, need to handle negative sums and zero sums correctly.

Wait, but in the formula sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1), is this always correct?

Let me check with another example.

Suppose n=1, k=7

a=[7]

Maximum subarray sum is 7.

Initial sum is 7.

According to the formula: 7 + 7 * (2^7 - 1) = 7 + 7 * 127 = 7 + 889 = 896.

Is this correct?

Let's simulate:

Initial array: [7], sum=7.

First insertion: insert 7, array becomes [7,7], sum=14.

Second insertion: insert 14, array becomes [7,7,14], sum=28.

Third insertion: insert 28, array becomes [7,7,14,28], sum=56.

Fourth insertion: insert 56, array becomes [7,7,14,28,56], sum=112.

Fifth insertion: insert 112, array becomes [7,7,14,28,56,112], sum=224.

Sixth insertion: insert 224, array becomes [7,7,14,28,56,112,224], sum=448.

Seventh insertion: insert 448, array becomes [7,7,14,28,56,112,224,448], sum=896.

Yes, matches the formula.

Another example:

n=5, k=1

a=[4,-2,8,-12,9]

Initial sum = 4 -2 +8 -12 +9 = 7.

Maximum subarray sum: [4,-2,8] with sum=10.

According to the formula: 7 + 10 * (2 - 1) = 7 + 10 = 17.

Is this correct?

After one insertion: insert 10, array becomes [4,-2,8,-12,9,10], sum=7 + 10 = 17.

Yes, matches the formula.

Another example:

n=7, k=4

a=[8,14,-9,6,0,-1,3]

Initial sum = 8+14-9+6+0-1+3=21.

Maximum subarray sum: [8,14,-9,6,0,-1,3] =21.

According to the formula: 21 + 21*(16-1)=21 + 21*15=21+315=336.

But in the sample input, the output is 351, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, sum is 8+14-9+6+0-1+3=21.

max_subarray_sum is 21.

21 + 21*(16-1)=21 + 21*15=21+315=336.

But sample output is 351.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum subarray sum is higher than the total sum.

Let me calculate the maximum subarray sum.

Possible subarrays:

[8,14]=-9,6,0,-1,3]

sums:

8

8+14=22

22-9=13

13+6=19

19+0=19

19-1=18

18+3=21

So, the maximum is 22.

Wait, [8,14]=22.

Then, according to the formula: sum=21, max_subarray_sum=22.

21 + 22*(15)=21 + 330=351.

Yes, that matches the sample output.

So, I was mistaken in calculating the maximum subarray sum.

It's actually 22, not 21.

Hence, the formula holds.

Therefore, the general approach is:

- Compute the initial sum of the array.

- Find the maximum sum of any subarray using Kadane's algorithm.

- Compute the final sum as initial_sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k -1).

- Take the result modulo 10^9 +7.

Now, to implement this, I need an efficient way to compute the initial sum and the maximum subarray sum.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 2e5, I need O(n) solutions for sum and max subarray sum.

Kadane's algorithm is perfect for finding the maximum subarray sum in O(n).

Also, sum of the array can be computed in O(n).

Then, I need to compute 2^k modulo 10^9+7, since k can be up to 2e5, and 2^k can be very large.

But in the formula, it's 2^k -1, which for large k would be computed modulo 10^9+7.

So, I need to compute (max_subarray_sum * (pow(2,k,1000000007)-1)) % 1000000007.

Then, add this to the initial sum, and take modulo 10^9+7.

Wait, but addition might cause overflow, but since we're working modulo 10^9+7, it's fine.

Edge cases to consider:

- All elements are negative: in this case, max_subarray_sum is zero (from the empty subarray), and the sum is the sum of the array.

- Sum is zero: then, adding zero k times doesn't change the sum.

- k=0: but according to the problem, k is at least 1.

- k is large: up to 2e5, but computing 2^k modulo 10^9+7 is efficient.

- Arrays with both positive and negative numbers: need to correctly find the maximum subarray sum.

- Arrays with all zeros: sum is zero, max_subarray_sum is zero, so sum remains zero after k insertions.

- Arrays with large numbers: up to 1e9 in absolute value, so need to handle large sums.

I need to make sure that all computations are done modulo 10^9+7 to prevent integer overflow.

Also, since a_i can be negative, sum can be negative, so I need to handle negative sums correctly when computing modulo 10^9+7.

In Python, the modulo operation with negative numbers can be tricky, so I need to ensure that the result is always non-negative.

For example, -11 modulo 10^9+7 is 10^9+7 -11.

So, in code, I can compute (x % MOD + MOD) % MOD to handle negative x correctly.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

from math import *

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_segment = func_2(a)

if max_segment[0] == -1:

max_segment[0] = 0

answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

print(func_1(answer))

def func_1(number):

return number % 1000000007

def func_2(arr):

new_segment = []

max_segment = [0, 0]

segments_variants = []

max_sum = -1

for i in range(len(arr)):

if new_segment:

if arr[i] < 0:

if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:

segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])

else:

segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])

max_segment = new_segment

new_segment = []

max_segment[0] += arr[i]

else:

max_segment[0] += arr[i]

new_segment[0] += arr[i]

else:

if arr[i] >= 0:

new_segment = [arr[i], i]

max_segment[0] += arr[i]

segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])

segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])

total_max_segment = [-1]

for segment in segments_variants:

if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:

total_max_segment = segment

if len(total_max_segment) == 1:

total_max_segment = [-1]

return total_max_segment

def func_3(number, quantity):

answer = 0

So, the main logic is in func_2, which is supposed to find the maximum subarray sum.

But looking at func_2, it seems overly complicated and might not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm.

In Kadane's algorithm, we keep track of the current maximum subarray sum ending at each position, and update the global maximum accordingly.

Here's a standard implementation of Kadane's algorithm:

def max_subarray_sum(arr):

max_current = max_global = arr[0]

for num in arr[1:]:

max_current = max(num, max_current + num)

if max_current > max_global:

max_global = max_current

return max_global

But in the given code, func_2 seems to be trying to track multiple segments, which is unnecessary for this problem.

Moreover, in the main logic, it computes answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

But according to the formula I derived, it should be sum(a) + max_subarray_sum * (2**k -1)

Which simplifies to sum(a) - max_subarray_sum + max_subarray_sum * 2**k

But in the code, it's sum(a) - max_subarray_sum + max_subarray_sum * 2**k, which matches.

So, the formula seems correct.

But the issue is whether func_2 correctly computes the maximum subarray sum.

Looking at func_2, it seems to try to track two segments: max_segment and new_segment.

It's not clear why it's doing that, and it might not handle all cases correctly.

In particular, in the loop, it checks if new_segment exists, and if the current element is negative, it appends the current segment to segments_variants and resets new_segment.

This seems flawed because it might discard potential larger sums.

Moreover, it's trying to store the sum and the starting index of the segment, which isn't necessary for this problem since we only need the sum.

Also, in the end, it selects the segment with the highest sum, but it might not be selecting the correct one due to the way segments_variants is constructed.

In the sample input where n=3, k=3, a=[2,2,8], the maximum subarray sum should be 12, which seems to be correctly computed.

In the first sample input where n=2, k=2, a=[-4,-7], the maximum subarray sum should be 0, which seems to be handled by setting max_segment[0] to 0 if it's -1.

But given that func_2 is complicated and might have bugs, and since there's a standard and simpler way to compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, it's better to use that.

Hence, the given program might be incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the maximum subarray sum function.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray (which may be empty), computing its sum, and inserting that sum back into the array.

### Approach

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the initial sum of the array.
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This is crucial for determining the largest possible sum to insert in each operation.
3. **Sum After k Operations**: Use the formula to compute the final sum after k operations:
   - The final sum is given by: `initial_sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1)`
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Solution Code

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
    return max_global

def main():
    MOD = 1000000007
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        initial_sum = sum(a)
        max_sum = max_subarray_sum(a)
        
        # If max_sum is negative, set it to 0 (empty subarray)
        if max_sum < 0:
            max_sum = 0
        
        # Compute 2^k modulo MOD
        pow_2_k = pow(2, k, MOD)
        
        # Compute the final sum
        final_sum = (initial_sum + (max_sum * (pow_2_k - 1)) % MOD) % MOD
        print(final_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Using Kadane's algorithm, we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. If all elements are negative, we treat the maximum subarray sum as zero (from an empty subarray).
3. **Sum After k Operations**: We use the formula `initial_sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1)` to compute the final sum after k operations.
4. **Modulo Operation**: We ensure the result is within the required range by taking the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required result while handling edge cases appropriately.
