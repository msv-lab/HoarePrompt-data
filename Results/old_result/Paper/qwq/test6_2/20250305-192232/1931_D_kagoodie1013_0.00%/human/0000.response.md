Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> (where i < j) beautiful if two conditions are met:

1. The sum of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by x.

2. The difference of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by y.

My task is to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for each test case.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by certain numbers. Let's recall that if a number a is divisible by another number b, it means that a mod b equals zero.

So, for the sum a_i + a_j to be divisible by x, (a_i + a_j) mod x should be 0.

Similarly, for the difference a_i - a_j to be divisible by y, (a_i - a_j) mod y should be 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions hold true.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since the constraints mention that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is 2*10^5. So, I need an algorithm that's linear or linearithmic in n.

Let me consider the properties of modulo operations here.

For the sum:

(a_i + a_j) mod x = 0

Which implies:

(a_i mod x + a_j mod x) mod x = 0

So, if I let a_i mod x be r_i and a_j mod x be r_j, then:

(r_i + r_j) mod x = 0

This means that r_j = (-r_i) mod x

Similarly, for the difference:

(a_i - a_j) mod y = 0

Which implies:

(a_i mod y - a_j mod y) mod y = 0

So, if I let a_i mod y be s_i and a_j mod y be s_j, then:

(s_i - s_j) mod y = 0

This implies that s_j = s_i mod y

So, for a pair <i, j> to be beautiful:

1. a_j mod x = (-a_i mod x) mod x

2. a_j mod y = a_i mod y

Given that, I can think of grouping the elements based on their remainders when divided by x and y.

Wait, but maintaining separate groups for each combination of remainders might be inefficient, especially since x and y can be up to 10^9.

Let me think differently. For each element a_i, I can compute its remainder when divided by x and by y.

Let me store two dictionaries (or maps):

- One mapping the remainder of a_i modulo x to the count of elements with that remainder.

- Another mapping the remainder of a_i modulo y to the count of elements with that remainder.

But I need to consider pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

Maybe I need to find a way to iterate through the array once and, for each element, determine how many previous elements can form a beautiful pair with it based on the conditions.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each a_j, I need to find a_i (where i < j) such that:

1. a_i mod x = (-a_j mod x) mod x

2. a_i mod y = a_j mod y

So, for each a_j, I can compute:

- target_remainder_x = (-a_j mod x) mod x

- target_remainder_y = a_j mod y

Then, the number of a_i's that satisfy a_i mod x = target_remainder_x and a_i mod y = target_remainder_y is the number of beautiful pairs that include a_j as the second element.

To efficiently keep track of these counts, I can maintain a dictionary that maps pairs of remainders (for x and y) to their counts.

Wait, but since x and y can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5, storing all possible pairs of remainders might be memory-intensive.

Is there a smarter way to handle this?

Let me consider that for each a_i, I can compute its remainder modulo x and modulo y, and store these in a tuple (remainder_x, remainder_y), and keep a count of how many times each tuple has been seen.

Then, for each a_j, I can compute its target_remainder_x and target_remainder_y, and look up how many elements have that specific pair of remainders.

This seems feasible, as the number of unique tuples is bounded by the number of unique combinations of remainders, which in the worst case could be up to n, but in practice might be less.

However, since n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but the total n across all test cases is 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

Let me think about implementing this.

I'll need to process each test case separately, and for each test case, process the array in order, maintaining a dictionary of the count of each (remainder_x, remainder_y) pair seen so far.

For each element a_j, compute its target_remainder_x and target_remainder_y, and add the count of elements with that pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.

Then, update the dictionary with the (remainder_x, remainder_y) of a_j.

Wait, but I need to compute target_remainder_x as (-a_j mod x) mod x.

Let me confirm:

target_remainder_x = (-a_j mod x) mod x

Similarly, target_remainder_y = a_j mod y

Yes, as per earlier.

Let me try to write some pseudocode for this.

For each test case:

Initialize an empty dictionary count_pairs

Initialize total = 0

For each element a_j in the array:

Compute target_remainder_x = (-a_j mod x) mod x

Compute target_remainder_y = a_j mod y

Look up the count of (target_remainder_x, target_remainder_y) in count_pairs and add it to total

Compute remainder_x = a_j mod x

Compute remainder_y = a_j mod y

Update count_pairs[(remainder_x, remainder_y)] += 1

At the end of the test case, output total

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the example given.

Example:

n=6, x=5, y=2

a = [1,2,7,4,9,6]

Let's process each element:

For a1=1:

target_remainder_x = (-1 mod 5) mod 5 = 4

target_remainder_y = 1 mod 2 = 1

Look for (4,1) in count_pairs, which is empty, so total +=0

remainder_x = 1 mod 5 =1

remainder_y =1 mod 2 =1

count_pairs[(1,1)] =1

For a2=2:

target_remainder_x = (-2 mod 5) mod 5 = 3

target_remainder_y =2 mod 2=0

Look for (3,0) in count_pairs, which is empty, so total +=0

remainder_x =2 mod 5=2

remainder_y=2 mod 2=0

count_pairs[(2,0)] =1

For a3=7:

target_remainder_x = (-7 mod 5) mod 5 = (-2 mod 5) =3

target_remainder_y =7 mod 2=1

Look for (3,1) in count_pairs, which is empty, so total +=0

remainder_x =7 mod 5=2

remainder_y=7 mod 2=1

count_pairs[(2,1)] =1

For a4=4:

target_remainder_x = (-4 mod 5) mod 5 =1

target_remainder_y =4 mod 2=0

Look for (1,0) in count_pairs, which is empty, so total +=0

remainder_x =4 mod 5=4

remainder_y=4 mod 2=0

count_pairs[(4,0)] =1

For a5=9:

target_remainder_x = (-9 mod 5) mod 5 = (-4 mod 5) =1

target_remainder_y =9 mod 2=1

Look for (1,1) in count_pairs, which has count=1 (from a1), so total +=1

remainder_x =9 mod 5=4

remainder_y=9 mod 2=1

count_pairs[(4,1)] =1

For a6=6:

target_remainder_x = (-6 mod 5) mod 5 = (-1 mod 5) =4

target_remainder_y =6 mod 2=0

Look for (4,0) in count_pairs, which has count=1 (from a4), so total +=1

remainder_x =6 mod 5=1

remainder_y=6 mod 2=0

count_pairs[(1,0)] =1

Total beautiful pairs: 2, which matches the example.

Great, seems correct.

Now, considering the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but total n across all test cases is 2*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

I need to implement this in Python, and make sure that it's optimized for speed and memory.

I should use a defaultdict from the collections module to handle the counting of pairs.

Also, I need to read all input at once and parse it, to handle large inputs efficiently.

Looking at the given code, it seems to be attempting something similar, but I need to verify if it's correct.

Let's look at the provided program.

The code reads all input at once, splits it into a list called data, and then processes the test cases.

It parses t, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads n, x, y, and then the array a.

Then, it calls a function func_1 with the list of test cases and prints the results.

In func_1, it iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it initializes count to 0, and creates two dictionaries: mod_x_map and mod_y_map.

Then, for each num in arr, it computes mod_x = -num % x and mod_y = num % y.

It adds the counts of mod_x in mod_x_map and mod_y in mod_y_map to count.

Then, it updates mod_x_map and mod_y_map with the current num's remainders.

Finally, it appends count to results and returns them.

Wait a minute, this seems different from what I had in mind.

In my approach, I considered pairs of remainders (mod_x, mod_y), but in this code, it's keeping separate maps for mod_x and mod_y.

This could be a problem because the counts from mod_x_map and mod_y_map are being added separately, which might not correctly account for pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

Let me see with the example.

Take the first test case:

n=6, x=5, y=2

a = [1,2,7,4,9,6]

Initialize count=0

mod_x_map and mod_y_map are empty.

For num=1:

mod_x = -1 % 5 =4

mod_y =1 % 2=1

count += mod_x_map.get(4,0) + mod_y_map.get(1,0) =0+0=0

Then, mod_x_key=1 %5=1, mod_y_key=1%2=1

mod_x_map[1]=1, mod_y_map[1]=1

For num=2:

mod_x=-2%5=3

mod_y=0

count += mod_x_map.get(3,0)+mod_y_map.get(0,0)=0+0=0

mod_x_key=2%5=2, mod_y_key=0

mod_x_map[2]=1, mod_y_map[0]=1

For num=7:

mod_x=-7%5= (-2)%5=3

mod_y=1

count += mod_x_map.get(3,0)+mod_y_map.get(1,0)=0+1=1

mod_x_key=2, mod_y_key=1

mod_x_map[2]=2, mod_y_map[1]=2

For num=4:

mod_x=-4%5=1

mod_y=0

count += mod_x_map.get(1,0)+mod_y_map.get(0,0)=1+1=2

mod_x_key=4%5=4, mod_y_key=0

mod_x_map[4]=1, mod_x_map[2]=2, mod_y_map[0]=2, mod_y_map[1]=2

For num=9:

mod_x=-9%5=1

mod_y=1

count += mod_x_map.get(1,0)+mod_y_map.get(1,0)=1+2=3

mod_x_key=4, mod_y_key=1

mod_x_map[4]=2, mod_y_map[1]=3

For num=6:

mod_x=-6%5=4

mod_y=0

count += mod_x_map.get(4,0)+mod_y_map.get(0,0)=2+2=4

mod_x_key=1, mod_y_key=0

mod_x_map[1]=2, mod_x_map[4]=2, mod_y_map[0]=3, mod_y_map[1]=3

Total count=1+2+3+4=10, but according to the example, it should be 2.

This is clearly incorrect.

So, the issue is that the code is adding the counts from mod_x_map and mod_y_map separately, which is not the correct way to count pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

Instead, it's counting the sum of counts where each condition is met independently, which overcounts the actual number of pairs that satisfy both conditions.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

I need to fix this by tracking pairs of remainders (mod_x, mod_y) together.

I'll need to use a dictionary that maps tuples of (mod_x, mod_y) to their counts.

Let me adjust the function accordingly.

Here's the corrected approach:

def func_1(test_cases):

results = []

for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:

count = 0

remainder_map = {}

for num in arr:

target_mod_x = (-num % x) % x

target_mod_y = num % y

target_pair = (target_mod_x, target_mod_y)

count += remainder_map.get(target_pair, 0)

current_pair = (num % x, num % y)

remainder_map[current_pair] = remainder_map.get(current_pair, 0) + 1

results.append(count)

return results

This should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

I need to replace the original func_1 with this corrected version.

Also, ensure that the reading and parsing of input are correctly done.

Given that, the program should work correctly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on specific divisibility conditions involving two given integers, x and y. A pair of indices <i, j> is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at these indices is divisible by x and their difference is divisible by y.

### Approach
1. **Modulo Conditions**:
    - For the sum a_i + a_j to be divisible by x, (a_i + a_j) mod x should be 0.
    - For the difference a_i - a_j to be divisible by y, (a_i - a_j) mod y should be 0.
   
2. **Remainder Calculation**:
    - We need to track the remainders of elements when divided by x and y.
    - For each element a_j, compute:
        - target_remainder_x = (-a_j mod x) mod x
        - target_remainder_y = a_j mod y
    - This helps identify how many previous elements can form a beautiful pair with a_j.

3. **Efficient Counting**:
    - Use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of pairs of remainders (remainder_x, remainder_y).
    - For each element, calculate the target remainders and check how many times that specific pair has been seen before.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
        index += 3
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        remainder_map = defaultdict(int)
        for num in arr:
            target_mod_x = (-num % x) % x
            target_mod_y = num % y
            target_pair = (target_mod_x, target_mod_y)
            count += remainder_map[target_pair]
            current_pair = (num % x, num % y)
            remainder_map[current_pair] += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: Read all input at once and split it into a list for easy access.
- **Test Case Parsing**: Extract the number of test cases and for each test case, extract n, x, y, and the array a.
- **Remainder Tracking**: Use a dictionary to track pairs of remainders (remainder_x, remainder_y).
- **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: For each element in the array, compute the target remainders and check how many times that pair has been seen before. Update the count and the remainder map accordingly.
- **Output**: Print the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the beautiful pairs by leveraging remainder tracking and dictionary lookups, which are optimized for speed and memory.
