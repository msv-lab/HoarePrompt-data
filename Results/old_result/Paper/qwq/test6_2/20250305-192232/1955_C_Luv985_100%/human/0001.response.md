Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and the Kraken attacks them k times. The attacks alternate between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the sequence. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.

So, in each attack cycle, the Kraken alternates between the first and last ship that haven't sunk yet. I need to simulate this process efficiently because n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15, which means a straightforward simulation would be too slow.

Let me think about how to optimize this. Since the attacks alternate between the first and last ships, I can consider the attacks in pairs: one on the first and one on the last. In each pair, both ships lose 1 durability. If I can process these pairs efficiently, I can reduce the time complexity.

But k can be up to 10^15, which is a very large number, so I need a way to handle large k efficiently. Maybe I can find a way to process multiple attacks at once, especially when the minimum durability of the first and last ships is greater than the remaining attacks.

Wait, in each pair of attacks (one on the first and one on the last), the total attacks are 2, unless k is odd, in which case there might be one extra attack on the first ship.

I need to manage the ships using two pointers: one starting from the left (first ship) and one from the right (last ship). I'll keep track of the current first and last ships that haven't sunk yet.

Let me outline a plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, l and r, starting at the first and last ships, respectively.

2. While l < r and k > 0:

a. Find the minimum durability between the current first ship (a[l]) and the last ship (a[r]).

b. Determine how many pairs of attacks can be performed without sinking either ship. This would be mi = min(a[l], a[r]), and the number of pairs is mi if 2*mi <= k.

c. Subtract the durability lost from both ships: a[l] -= mi and a[r] -= mi.

d. Subtract the number of attacks performed: k -= 2*mi.

e. If a[l] == 0, increment l and increase the sunk count.

f. If a[r] == 0, decrement r and increase the sunk count.

3. If l == r and k > 0, check if the remaining attacks can sink the last remaining ship.

This seems efficient because in each step, I'm reducing k by a significant amount (specifically, by twice the minimum durability of the current first and last ships).

Let me consider an example to see if this works.

Example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Initial state:

l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3]

First iteration:

mi = min(1,3) = 1

Since 2*1 <= 5, perform 1 pair of attacks:

a[l] -=1 => a[0]=0

a[r] -=1 => a[3]=2

k -=2 => k=3

Ship at l sinks, so l +=1, ans=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,2]

Second iteration:

mi = min(2,2)=2

Since 2*2 <=3, perform 1 pair of attacks:

a[1]-=1 => a[1]=1

a[3]-=1 => a[3]=1

k -=2 => k=1

No ship sinks, so l and r remain the same.

Third iteration:

mi = min(1,1)=1

Since 2*1 >1, can't perform a pair.

So, perform k //2 =0 pairs, and k%2=1, so one extra attack on the first ship.

a[1] -=1 => a[1]=0

k -=1 =>k=0

Ship at l sinks, l +=1, ans=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,1]

But k=0, so stop.

Final ans=2, which matches the example.

Another example:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Following the same steps as above, after the first two iterations, we have:

l=1, r=3, a=[0,1,4,1], k=1

Third iteration:

mi = min(1,1)=1

2*1 >1, so perform k//2=0 pairs, and k%2=1, so attack first ship.

a[1]-=1 => a[1]=0

k-=1 =>k=0

Ship at l sinks, l +=1, ans=3

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,1]

But k=0, so stop.

Final ans=3, which should be correct.

Another test case:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Let's simulate:

Initial: l=0, r=4, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

First iteration:

mi=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 <=20, so perform 2 pairs:

a[0]-=2 =>0

a[4]-=2 =>0

k -=4 =>16

Both ships sink, l +=1, r -=1, ans=2

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[7,1,8], k=16

Second iteration:

mi=min(1,8)=1

2*1=2 <=16, perform 1 pair:

a[1]-=1 =>0

a[3]-=1 =>7

k -=2 =>14

Ship at l sinks, l +=1, ans=3

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,7,7], k=14

Third iteration:

mi=min(7,7)=7

2*7=14 <=14, perform 7 pairs:

a[2]-=7 =>0

a[3]-=7 =>0

k -=14 =>0

Both ships sink, l +=1, r -=1, ans=5

Stop.

Final ans=5, which seems correct.

Now, looking at the code provided:

def func():

T = int(input())

while T:

T -= 1

(n, k) = input().split()

n = int(n)

k = int(k)

a = input().split()

a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))

l = 0

r = n - 1

ans = 0

while l < r and k > 0:

mi = min(a[l], a[r])

if mi * 2 <= k:

a[l] -= mi

a[r] -= mi

k -= mi * 2

if a[l] == 0:

ans += 1

l += 1

if a[r] == 0:

ans += 1

r -= 1

else:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:

ans += 1

break

if l == r:

ans += k >= a[l]

print(ans)

}

}

This seems to follow the plan I outlined. It uses two pointers and processes pairs of attacks efficiently.

However, there's a potential issue in the else clause when mi * 2 > k. In this case, the code attempts to perform as many attacks as possible with the remaining k.

But the logic in the else clause seems flawed. Let's examine it.

else:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:

ans += 1

break

I think this needs to be handled more carefully. When mi * 2 > k, it means we can't perform a full pair of attacks. So, we need to perform as many pairs as possible, and then handle the remaining attack(s).

Specifically:

- The number of full pairs we can perform is k // 2.

- Each pair reduces a[l] and a[r] by 1.

- If k is odd, there's one extra attack on the first ship.

So, in this case, we should:

- a[l] -= k // 2

- a[r] -= k // 2

- if k % 2 == 1:

- a[l] -=1

Then, check if a[l] <=0 or a[r] <=0, and update l and r accordingly.

But in the code, it seems to handle it differently, which might be incorrect.

Let me see with an example.

Consider n=2, k=3, a=[2,2]

According to the code:

while l < r and k >0:

mi = min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 >3, so go to else clause.

t = 3 % 2 =1

if a[l] - t - 3//2 ==0:

if 2 -1 -1 ==0 =>0==0, so ans +=1

break

So, ans=1

But let's see what should happen:

- Attack 1: first ship, a=[1,2]

- Attack 2: last ship, a=[1,1]

- Attack 3: first ship, a=[0,1]

- So, first ship sinks, ans=1

So, the code gives the correct answer in this case.

Another test case: n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

Processing:

mi = min(3,2)=2

2*2=4 >2, so go to else clause.

t=2%2=0

if 3 -0 -2==0 =>1==0, False

Then, check if l ==r, which is not the case here, since l=0, r=1

So, no ans increment, and loop ends.

Final ans=0

But let's see what should happen:

- Attack 1: first ship, a=[2,2]

- Attack 2: last ship, a=[2,1]

- No ship sinks, ans=0

Which matches the code's output.

Another test case: n=2, k=3, a=[1,1]

Processing:

mi = min(1,1)=1

1*2=2 <=3, so perform 1 pair:

a[0]-=1 =>0

a[1]-=1 =>0

k -=2 =>1

Both ships sink, l +=1, r -=1, ans=2

Now, l=1, r=0, so l >=r, stop.

Final ans=2

Which is correct.

Seems like the code works for these cases.

Wait, but in the else clause, it seems to have a condition that if a[l] - t - k//2 ==0, then ans +=1 and break.

I think this condition is trying to handle the case when after performing k attacks, the first ship sinks, but it's not very clear.

Maybe there's a better way to handle the else clause.

An alternative approach:

- While l < r and k >0:

- If a[l] <= a[r]:

- If a[l] <= k//2:

- k -= a[l]

- a[l] =0

- l +=1

- ans +=1

- Else:

- attacks = k//2

- a[l] -= attacks

- a[r] -= attacks

- k -= 2*attacks

- If k >0:

- a[l] -=1

- k -=1

- If a[l] <=0:

- l +=1

- ans +=1

- If a[r] <=0:

- r -=1

- ans +=1

- If l <=r and k >0:

- If a[l] <=k:

- k -= a[l]

- a[l] =0

- l +=1

- ans +=1

- Else:

- a[l] -=k

- k=0

This might be clearer.

But the original code seems to handle it differently but still correctly in the examples I tested.

Perhaps the original code is correct, but the else clause is a bit convoluted.

I need to think more carefully.

Looking back at the original code:

else:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:

ans +=1

break

I think what's happening here is that when mi*2 >k, it means we can't perform a full pair of attacks.

So, we need to perform as many full pairs as possible, which is k//2 pairs, and then if k is odd, one extra attack on the first ship.

So, total attacks on the first ship would be k//2 + (k%2)

And attacks on the last ship would be k//2

So, a[l] -= (k//2 + k%2)

a[r] -= (k//2)

Then, check if a[l] <=0 or a[r] <=0, and update l and r accordingly.

But in the code, it's not doing that directly. Instead, it's checking if a[l] - t - k//2 ==0, which is equivalent to a[l] - (k//2 + k%2) ==0, which is the condition for the first ship to sink after the remaining attacks.

But it's not handling the last ship's sinking in this else clause.

I think this might be a mistake.

Let me consider a test case where the last ship sinks due to the remaining attacks.

Test case: n=2, k=3, a=[2,1]

Processing:

mi = min(2,1)=1

1*2=2 <=3, so perform 1 pair:

a[0]-=1 =>1

a[1]-=1 =>0

k -=2 =>1

Ship at r sinks, r -=1, ans=1

Now, l=0, r=1-1=0, so l >=r, stop.

Final ans=1

But what should happen is:

- Attack 1: first ship, a=[1,1]

- Attack 2: last ship, a=[1,0], ship 2 sinks

- Attack 3: first ship, a=[0,0], ship 1 sinks

- So, ans=2

But according to the code, ans=1, which is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, after performing the pair:

a[0]=1, a[1]=0, k=1

Then, since a[r]=0, r -=1, ans=1

Then l=0, r=0-1=-1, so l >=r, stop.

Hence, ans=1, but expected ans=2.

So, the code is missing the final attack on the first ship.

This indicates a flaw in the code's logic.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Another test case: n=3, k=4, a=[2,3,1]

Processing:

mi = min(2,1)=1

1*2=2 <=4, perform 1 pair:

a[0]-=1 =>1

a[2]-=1 =>0

k -=2 =>2

Ship at r sinks, r -=1, ans=1

Now, l=0, r=1, a=[1,3], k=2

mi = min(1,3)=1

1*2=2 <=2, perform 1 pair:

a[0]-=1 =>0

a[1]-=1 =>2

k -=2 =>0

Ship at l sinks, l +=1, ans=2

Now, l=1, r=1, stop.

Final ans=2, which is correct.

But in the previous test case with n=2, k=3, a=[2,1], it gave ans=1 instead of 2.

So, the code is incorrect in that case.

I need to fix this.

I think the issue is in the else clause when mi*2 >k.

In such cases, the code should perform as many full pairs as possible, and then handle the remaining attacks.

Specifically:

- full_pairs = k // 2

- a[l] -= full_pairs

- a[r] -= full_pairs

- k -= 2 * full_pairs

- if k % 2 ==1:

- a[l] -=1

- k -=1

Then, check if a[l] <=0 or a[r] <=0, and update l, r, ans accordingly.

But in the original code, it only checks if a[l] after the remaining attacks equals 0, and increments ans by 1, then breaks.

This doesn't account for the possibility that both ships could sink if their durability drops to 0 after the attacks.

In the test case n=2, k=3, a=[2,1]:

- full_pairs =3//2=1

- a[l]-=1 =>1

- a[r]-=1 =>0

- k -=2 =>1

- k%2=1, so a[l]-=1 =>0

- k -=1 =>0

- Now, a[l]=0, a[r]=0

- So, both ships sink, ans should be incremented by 2

But in the code, it only increments ans by 1.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I need to adjust the code to properly handle the sinking of both ships in such scenarios.

An improved version would be:

while l < r and k >0:

mi = min(a[l], a[r])

if mi *2 <=k:

attacks = mi

else:

attacks = k //2

a[l] -= attacks

a[r] -= attacks

k -= 2*attacks

if l < r and k >0:

# extra attack on the first ship

a[l] -=1

k -=1

# Now, check if ships have sunk

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

r -=1

if l >= r or k <=0:

break

# If l == r and k >0:

if l == r and k >0:

if a[l] <=k:

ans +=1

print(ans)

This way, we ensure that both ships are checked for sinking after the attacks.

Let's test this improved version with n=2, k=3, a=[2,1]:

First iteration:

mi = min(2,1)=1

1*2=2 <=3, so attacks=1

a[0]-=1 =>1

a[1]-=1 =>0

k -=2 =>1

Extra attack on first ship:

a[0]-=1 =>0

k -=1 =>0

Check sinking:

a[l]=0, so ans +=1, l +=1

a[r]=0, so ans +=1, r -=1

Now, l=1, r=0, stop.

Final ans=2, which is correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

First iteration:

mi = min(3,2)=2

2*2=4 >2, so attacks=2//2=1

a[0]-=1 =>2

a[1]-=1 =>1

k -=2 =>0

No extra attack since k=0

Check sinking:

a[l]=2 >0

a[r]=1 >0

No sinking, stop.

Final ans=0, which is correct.

Seems better.

But in the original code, it doesn't handle the sinking of both ships properly in the else clause.

Hence, the original code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
