Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets and they take turns making moves according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who wins the game if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the game ends when a player has zero coins and can't remove any more coins. The player who is forced to make a move when their wallet is already empty loses.

I need to think about how the game progresses based on the initial number of coins each has. Since both play optimally, they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if I can find a pattern or a general rule.

Test case 1:

a = 1, b = 1

- Alice's move: She has 1 coin. If she exchanges wallets, she'll have b=1, and remove 1 coin, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob's move: Now he has 0 coins, and Alice has 0 coins. Since Alice has 0 coins, Bob can't exchange or remove a coin because his wallet is empty. So, Alice can't make a move, hence Bob wins.

According to the program:

if a == b:

print('Bob')

Which matches the output.

Test case 2:

a = 1, b = 4

- Alice's move: She has 1 coin. If she exchanges, a=4, b=1. Remove 1, so a=3, b=1.

- Bob's move: He has 1 coin. If he exchanges, a=1, b=3. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

- Alice's move: She has 1 coin. If she doesn't exchange, a=0, b=2.

- Bob's move: He has 2 coins. If he doesn't exchange, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's move: She has 0 coins, so she must exchange, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

According to the program:

elif a == 1:

print('Alice')

Which matches the output.

Wait, but in the program, it's:

if a == b:

print('Bob')

elif a == 1:

print('Alice')

elif b == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

print('Alice')

elif a > b:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

So, in the second test case, a=1, b=4, which matches a==1, so print 'Alice'.

Another test case:

a=5, b=3

According to the program:

a != b, a !=1, b !=1, a%2 ==1, so print 'Bob'

I need to see if this is correct.

Let's simulate:

- Alice has 5, Bob has 3.

- Alice's move: Option 1: exchange, a=3, b=5. Remove 1, a=2, b=5.

- Bob's move: a=2, b=5. Option 1: exchange, a=5, b=2. Remove 1, a=5, b=1.

- Alice's move: a=5, b=1. Option 1: exchange, a=1, b=5. Remove 1, a=0, b=5.

- Bob's move: a=0, b=5. Can't exchange because a=0, so must keep. Remove 1, a=0, b=4.

- Alice's move: a=0, b=4. Can't exchange because a=0, so must keep. Remove 1, a=0, b=3.

- This continues until b=0.

- Finally, Bob is the one who can't make a move when b=0, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the program, it should print 'Bob', but in this simulation, it seems Alice wins.

Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Alternative moves:

- Alice has 5, Bob has 3.

- Alice decides not to exchange: a=4, b=3.

- Bob has 3, exchanges: a=3, b=4. Remove 1, a=3, b=3.

- Alice has 3, b=3. Exchanges: a=3, b=3. Remove 1, a=2, b=3.

- Bob has 3, exchanges: a=3, b=2. Remove 1, a=3, b=1.

- Alice has 3, b=1. Exchanges: a=1, b=3. Remove 1, a=0, b=3.

- Bob has 3, must keep: a=0, b=2.

- Alice has 0, must exchange: a=0, b=2.

- Bob has 2, must keep: a=0, b=1.

- Alice has 0, must exchange: a=0, b=1.

- Bob has 1, must keep: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Okay, in this case, Bob wins, which matches the program's output 'Bob'.

Another test case: a=11, b=9

According to the program:

a != b, a !=1, b !=1, a%2 ==1, so print 'Bob'

Let's simulate:

- Alice has 11, Bob has 9.

- Alice can exchange: a=9, b=11. Remove 1, a=8, b=11.

- Bob has 11, exchanges: a=11, b=8. Remove 1, a=11, b=7.

- Alice has 11, b=7. Exchanges: a=7, b=11. Remove 1, a=6, b=11.

- Bob has 11, exchanges: a=11, b=6. Remove 1, a=11, b=5.

- Alice has 11, b=5. Exchanges: a=5, b=11. Remove 1, a=4, b=11.

- Bob has 11, exchanges: a=11, b=4. Remove 1, a=11, b=3.

- Alice has 11, b=3. Exchanges: a=3, b=11. Remove 1, a=2, b=11.

- Bob has 11, exchanges: a=11, b=2. Remove 1, a=11, b=1.

- Alice has 11, b=1. Exchanges: a=1, b=11. Remove 1, a=0, b=11.

- Bob has 11, must keep: a=0, b=10.

- Alice has 0, must exchange: a=0, b=10.

- Bob has 10, must keep: a=0, b=9.

- ... continues until b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, matches the program's output 'Bob'.

Another test case: a=83, b=91

According to the program:

a != b, a !=1, b !=1, a%2 ==1, so print 'Bob'

But in the example output, it's 'Bob', which matches.

Wait, but according to the program, if a%2 ==1, print 'Bob', regardless of b.

But in earlier simulation, it seemed that when a=5, b=3, Bob wins, and a=11, b=9, Bob wins, but what if a=4, b=2?

Wait, a=4, b=2:

a != b, a !=1, b !=1, a%2 ==0, b%2 ==0.

Then, it goes to elif a > b: print 'Bob'

else: print 'Alice'

So, a=4, b=2, a > b, so print 'Bob'

Let's simulate:

- Alice has 4, b=2. Exchanges: a=2, b=4. Remove 1, a=1, b=4.

- Bob has 4, exchanges: a=4, b=1. Remove 1, a=4, b=0.

- Alice has 4, b=0. Can't exchange because b=0, so must keep. Remove 1, a=3, b=0.

- Bob has 0, can't make a move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, a=4, b=2, a > b, so print 'Bob', but in simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, contradiction here.

Wait, in the program:

if a == b:

print('Bob')

elif a == 1:

print('Alice')

elif b == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

print('Alice')

elif a > b:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

So, for a=4, b=2:

a != b, a !=1, b !=1, a%2 ==0, b%2 ==0.

Then, a > b is True (4 > 2), so print 'Bob'

But in simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, maybe the program is wrong in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look at the example outputs:

Input:

10

1 1 -> Bob

1 4 -> Alice

5 3 -> Bob

4 5 -> Alice

11 9 -> Bob

83 91 -> Bob

1032 9307 -> Alice

839204 7281 -> Alice

1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at these, seems like there's a pattern based on the parity of a and b and their values.

I need to find a general rule.

Let me consider that the game is symmetric in some way, and perhaps the parity of the number of coins matters.

From the program, it seems to be focusing on whether a and b are equal, or if a or b is 1, or the parity of a and b.

But in my simulation for a=4, b=2, it seems Alice wins, but the program would output 'Bob' because a > b and a is even.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the example outputs, for a=4, b=5, it's Alice, which matches the program's logic because a=4, b=5, a < b, and a is even, so goes to 'else: print 'Alice''

Wait, a=4, b=5: program outputs 'Alice', which matches the example.

But in my simulation for a=4, b=2, program says 'Bob', but simulation suggests Alice wins.

Wait, maybe my simulation is wrong.

Let's try again:

a=4, b=2

Alice's move:

Option 1: exchange, a=2, b=4. Remove 1, a=1, b=4.

Option 2: don't exchange, a=3, b=2.

Let's choose option 1: a=1, b=4.

Bob's move:

He has 4 coins. Option 1: exchange, a=4, b=1. Remove 1, a=4, b=0.

Option 2: don't exchange, a=1, b=3.

If he chooses option 1: a=4, b=0.

Alice's move: a=4, b=0. Remove 1, a=3, b=0.

Bob's move: b=0, can't make a move. So Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Bob chooses option 2: keep, a=1, b=3.

Alice's move: a=0, b=3.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=2.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=2.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=1.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, depending on the choices, Bob can force a win.

Hence, Bob wins, which matches the program's output.

Wait, but in my first simulation, I thought Alice wins, but actually, Bob can force a win.

So, the program is correct in this case.

Another test case: a=2, b=1

According to the program:

a != b, a !=1, b ==1, print 'Bob'

Simulation:

Alice has 2, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: exchange, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

Option 2: don't exchange, a=1, b=1.

If she chooses option 1: a=0, b=2.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=1.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

If she chooses option 2: a=1, b=1.

Bob's move: must not exchange, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So, Alice can choose to make Bob win or Alice win, depending on her first move.

But according to the program, b==1, so print 'Bob'.

But in reality, Alice can choose to make Alice win.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says both play optimally.

So, Alice would choose the move that leads to her victory.

In this case, if she chooses not to exchange, she can win.

Hence, the program should output 'Alice', but according to the program:

elif b ==1:

print 'Bob'

Which is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the problem description, a and b are at least 1.

So, in this case, a=2, b=1, program outputs 'Bob', but in reality, Alice can win.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example outputs, a=1, b=4 outputs 'Alice', which seems contradictory.

Wait, in a=1, b=4, Alice can exchange, a=4, b=1, then Bob exchanges back, a=1, b=3, and so on, leading to Alice winning.

In a=2, b=1, Alice can choose not to exchange, a=1, b=1, leading to Alice winning.

But according to the program, when b==1, print 'Bob', which is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I think the condition needs to be revised.

Perhaps, when b==1, if a==1, Bob wins, else Alice can choose to make a=1, b=1, leading to Alice winning.

Hence, the condition should be more nuanced.

Another example: a=3, b=1

According to the program:

a !=b, a !=1, b==1, print 'Bob'

Simulation:

Alice has 3, b=1.

Option 1: exchange, a=1, b=3. Remove 1, a=0, b=3.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=2.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=2.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: must exchange, a=0, b=1.

Bob's move: must keep, a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Hence, in this case, 'Bob' is correct.

So, perhaps when b==1 and a >1, if a is even, Alice can win, else Bob wins.

Wait, but in a=2, b=1, according to my earlier simulation, Alice can win, but program says 'Bob'.

Hence, the program is incorrect in that case.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, the key is the difference between a and b.

Or, perhaps, it's about the parity of a and b and their values.

I need to find a general rule.

Looking back at the program:

if a == b:

print('Bob')

elif a ==1:

print('Alice')

elif b ==1:

print('Bob')

elif a %2 ==1:

print('Bob')

elif a %2 ==0 and b%2 ==1:

print('Alice')

elif a > b:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

This seems somewhat arbitrary.

I think a better approach is needed.

Perhaps, the game can be analyzed using game theory, specifically impartial games like Nim.

But in this case, the game is not exactly Nim because of the exchange option.

Alternatively, perhaps it can be modeled as a variant of the game of Nim with two heaps.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to Nim with two heaps where players can choose to swap the heaps or not.

In standard Nim, the winning strategy is based on the XOR of the heap sizes.

But here, the moves are different because of the exchange option.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that the game state is defined by the pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each player, on their turn, can choose to swap a and b or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The player who can't make a move loses.

I need to find the winning strategy for Alice and Bob.

Let me try to find out who has the winning strategy based on a and b.

First, consider base cases:

- If a=0 and b>0, the player whose turn it is must remove a coin from their wallet, but their wallet has 0 coins, so they can't make a move and lose.

- If b=0 and a>0, the player can choose to swap or not, but if they swap, they have 0 coins and can't remove a coin, so they must not swap and remove a coin from their wallet.

- If a=0 and b=0, the player can't make a move and loses.

But in the game, a and b start at least 1.

I need to see who can force the opponent into a losing position.

Perhaps, I can define winning and losing positions.

A position is a losing position if any move leads to a winning position for the opponent.

A position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

This is the standard game theory approach.

But given the large constraints (a and b up to 1e9), I need an efficient way to determine the winner without simulating the game.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be based on some observed patterns:

- If a == b, Bob wins.

- If a ==1, Alice wins.

- If b ==1, Bob wins.

- If a is odd, Bob wins.

- If a is even and b is odd, Alice wins.

- If a > b, Bob wins.

- Else, Alice wins.

But as I saw in the a=2, b=1 case, the program outputs 'Bob', but in reality, Alice can win.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to determine the winner.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of coins each player has.

Each move consists of choosing to swap or not, and then removing one coin from their current wallet.

The player who can't make a move loses.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where players remove objects from heaps.

But here, there is an exchange option, which makes it more complex.

Perhaps, I can model this game as a graph, where each node is a state (a, b), and edges represent possible moves.

But with a and b up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

In the program, there is a condition based on a % 2 and b % 2.

Maybe that's a clue.

Let me see.

Suppose a and b are both even.

What happens?

Alice has an even number of coins.

If she chooses to swap, she gets b (even), remove 1, becomes odd.

If she chooses not to swap, a decreases by 1, becomes odd.

In both cases, the next state has a odd number of coins for Alice.

Similarly, if a and b are both odd.

Alice has odd a.

If she swaps, gets b (odd), remove 1, even.

If she doesn't swap, a decreases by 1, even.

So, next state has even a.

Similarly for other parities.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the parity after each move.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of coins.

Suppose a >= b.

Alice can choose to swap or not.

If she swaps, a becomes b, and b becomes a.

Then, she removes 1 from a.

So, new state is (b-1, a).

If she doesn't swap, a becomes a-1, b remains b.

New state is (a-1, b).

Similarly for Bob's moves.

So, the game tree can be built with these possible moves.

But again, building the game tree is not practical for large a and b.

I need to find a mathematical way to determine the winner.

Perhaps, I can think in terms of the difference between a and b.

Or, maybe in terms of the sum.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the parity of a + b.

Wait, let's see.

In the first test case, a=1, b=1.

Sum is 2, which is even.

Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1, b=4.

Sum is 5, odd.

Alice wins.

Third test case, a=5, b=3.

Sum is 8, even.

Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4, b=5.

Sum is 9, odd.

Alice wins.

Fifth test case, a=11, b=9.

Sum is 20, even.

Bob wins.

Sixth test case, a=83, b=91.

Sum is 174, even.

Bob wins.

Seventh test case, a=1032, b=9307.

Sum is odd.

Alice wins.

Eighth test case, a=839204, b=7281.

Sum is odd.

Alice wins.

Ninth test case, a=1000000000, b=1000000000.

Sum is even.

Bob wins.

Tenth test case, a=53110, b=2024.

Sum is even.

Bob wins.

Looking at these, it seems that when the sum a + b is even, Bob wins, else Alice wins.

But wait, in the second test case, a=1, b=4, sum=5, odd, Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, a=4, b=5, sum=9, odd, Alice wins.

In the seventh test case, a=1032, b=9307, sum=1032+9307=10339, which is odd, Alice wins.

In the eighth test case, a=839204, b=7281, sum=839204+7281=846485, which is odd, Alice wins.

In the tenth test case, a=53110, b=2024, sum=55134, which is even, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, a=83, b=91, sum=174, even, Bob wins.

Fifth test case, a=11, b=9, sum=20, even, Bob wins.

Third test case, a=5, b=3, sum=8, even, Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1, b=4, sum=5, odd, Alice wins.

First test case, a=1, b=1, sum=2, even, Bob wins.

So, it seems that when a + b is even, Bob wins, else Alice wins.

This matches all the test cases in the example.

Hence, the correct approach is to check if a + b is even, then Bob wins, else Alice wins.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it has more complicated conditions, whereas the actual result depends solely on the parity of a + b.

For example, in the a=2, b=1 case, a + b =3, odd, so Alice should win, but the program outputs 'Bob'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
