Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. So, it's not about the positions but about having at least k common elements between the subsegment and b.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b," and in the example, it shows that even if you rearrange the subsegment to match b, as long as at least k elements are the same, it's considered good. So, it's not just about having k common elements, but k elements that can be made to match b's elements after some rearrangement.

I need to think about this carefully. Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

5

7 4 2

4 1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 3 4

7 4 3

4 1 2 3 4 5 6

9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3

6 9 7 8 10

4 1 1

4 1 5 6

Output:

4

4

1

So, for the first test case, n=7, m=4, k=2, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4]. It says there are 4 good subsegments.

Let's list all possible subsegments of length m=4 in a:

1. [4,1,2,3] -> Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least k=2 match.

2. [1,2,3,4] -> Already matches b.

3. [2,3,4,5] -> Can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has three elements matching b: 2,3,4.

4. [3,4,5,6] -> Can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has two elements matching b: 3,4.

So all four subsegments are good.

In the second test case, n=7, m=4, k=3, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

Subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] -> Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least k=3 match.

2. [1,2,3,4] -> Matches b completely.

3. [2,3,4,5] -> Has three elements matching b: 2,3,4.

4. [3,4,5,6] -> Has two elements matching b: 3,4. Since k=3, this is not good.

So, only the first three subsegments are good.

In the third test case, n=7, m=4, k=4, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

Subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] -> Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely.

2. [1,2,3,4] -> Matches b completely.

3. [2,3,4,5] -> Has three elements matching b: 2,3,4. Since k=4, it's not good.

4. [3,4,5,6] -> Has two elements matching b: 3,4. Not good.

So, only the first two subsegments are good.

From these examples, it seems that for a subsegment to be good, the number of elements in the subsegment that are also in b should be at least k, regardless of their positions.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b." So, it's not just about having at least k common elements, but about being able to rearrange the subsegment so that at least k elements are exactly the same as in b after rearrangement.

Looking back at the example, for the first test case, subsegment [3,4,5,6] can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], and b is [1,2,3,4], so the matching elements are 3 and 4, which are two, and k=2, so it's good. Similarly, in the second test case, the same subsegment [3,4,5,6] can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], matching b=[1,2,3,4] on 3 and 4, which is only two, but k=3, so it's not good.

So, the key is to count, for each subsegment of length m in a, the number of elements that can be matched to b when both are sorted, and check if this number is at least k.

Wait, but the problem allows rearrangement, so perhaps it's about the intersection of the elements in the subsegment and b having at least k elements in common.

But, considering duplicates, if b has duplicates, we need to consider the frequency of each element.

I think I need to use counters to count the frequency of each element in b and in each subsegment of a, and then for each subsegment, calculate the number of matching elements based on the minimum frequencies.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can use a sliding window approach, where I maintain a window of size m over a, and keep track of the frequency of each element in the window. Then, compare these frequencies with the frequencies in b to count how many elements can be matched.

Specifically, for each window, I can compute the intersection of the frequency counters of the window and b, and sum the minimum frequencies to get the number of matching elements.

If this sum is at least k, then the window is good, and I increment the answer counter.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 2e5, I need an efficient implementation to handle this within time constraints.

I need to optimize the sliding window approach to avoid recomputing the frequency counter from scratch for each window.

I can maintain a frequency counter for the current window, and as the window slides, I can update the frequency counter by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element.

Then, I need to update the number of matching elements based on the changes in frequencies.

This way, I can efficiently compute the number of matching elements for each window.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, I'll read the input: t test cases, each with n, m, k, array a of n integers, and array b of m integers.

For each test case, I need to iterate over all subsegments of a of length m, compute the number of matching elements with b, and count how many such subsegments have at least k matching elements.

To optimize, I'll use a sliding window with a frequency counter.

Initialize a counter for b, and a counter for the first window of size m in a.

Then, compute the intersection of these two counters, sum the minimum frequencies, and check if it's at least k.

As the window slides, when I remove an element from the window, I decrement its frequency in the window counter, and if it was contributing to the matching count, update the matching count accordingly.

Similarly, when I add a new element to the window, I increment its frequency in the window counter, and if it matches an element in b, update the matching count.

This way, I can efficiently maintain the matching count as the window slides.

Now, considering that elements can be duplicated in both a and b, I need to handle frequencies correctly.

For example, if b has two 3's, and the window has one 3, then only one matching is counted. If the window has two or more 3's, then two matchings are counted.

Similarly, if b has one 3 and the window has zero or more, the matching count is min(window[3], b[3]).

So, the total matching count is the sum of min(window[x], b[x]) for all x.

I need to efficiently compute this sum as the window slides.

To do this, I'll keep track of the current matching count, and update it when the window slides by one position.

When removing an element from the window:

- If the frequency of the element in the window was greater than in b, then removing it doesn't affect the matching count.

- If the frequency of the element in the window was equal to or less than in b, then removing it decreases the matching count by one.

When adding a new element to the window:

- If the element is in b and the frequency in the window is less than in b, then the matching count increases by one.

- If the frequency in the window was already equal to or greater than in b, then adding another doesn't increase the matching count.

By maintaining this matching count, I can efficiently check if it's at least k for each window.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

I'll use the collections.Counter class in Python to handle frequency counters.

For each test case:

- Read n, m, k.

- Read array a of n integers.

- Read array b of m integers.

- Compute the counter for b.

- Initialize a counter for the first window of size m in a.

- Compute the initial matching count as sum of min(window[x], b[x]) for all x.

- If matching count >= k, increment the answer counter.

- Slide the window from position m to n-1:

- Remove the element that is sliding out from the window counter, and update the matching count accordingly.

- Add the new element sliding in to the window counter, and update the matching count accordingly.

- If matching count >= k, increment the answer counter.

- After processing all windows, print the answer counter.

I need to make sure that this is efficient, as n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 2e5, so it should be manageable.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

The program defines a function func_1 that takes n, m, k, a, b as arguments and returns the number of good subsegments.

Inside func_1:

- It creates counters for sorted b and the first window of size m in a.

- It computes the initial matching count as sum of (ca & cb).values(), which is the sum of minimum frequencies for common elements.

- If this sum is >= k, it increments the answer counter ans.

- Then, it slides the window from position m to n-1:

- If the frequency of the new element in a is less than in b, it increases the matching count.

- It adds the new element to the window counter.

- If the frequency of the element sliding out is less than or equal to in b, it decreases the matching count.

- It removes the element sliding out from the window counter.

- If the matching count is >= k, it increments the answer counter.

- Finally, it returns the answer counter.

This seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.

However, I need to verify if sorting the arrays before counting frequencies is necessary or correct.

In the code, it sorts both b and a before creating the counters:

cb = Counter(sorted(b))

ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

But, since we're dealing with frequencies of elements, sorting should not affect the frequency counts, as Counter counts occurrences regardless of order.

So, sorting here is unnecessary but doesn't harm the correctness.

But, in the sliding window part, it doesn't sort the elements as it slides, which is correct because frequencies are what matter, not the order.

Another thing to check is if the conditions for updating the matching count are correct.

When adding a new element:

- If ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], then sm += 1

- Then, ca[a[r]] += 1

When removing an element:

- If ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], then sm -= 1

- Then, ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

This seems correct because:

- When adding a new element, if its frequency in the window is less than in b, then it can contribute to the matching count.

- When removing an element, if its frequency in the window is less than or equal to in b, then removing it decreases the matching count.

This aligns with my earlier reasoning.

Also, in the initial window, it correctly computes sm as sum((ca & cb).values()), which is the sum of minimum frequencies.

Therefore, the given program seems to correctly implement the sliding window approach with frequency counters to count the number of good subsegments.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{4, 3, 2, 4, 1}} \]

**Correctness: True**
