Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to look at every subsegment of a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are the same as in b, regardless of order. So, it's about having at least k common elements between the subsegment and b.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b," and in the example, it shows that even if you rearrange c to match b, as long as at least k elements are the same, it's good. So, it's not just about having k same elements, but k same elements in the sense that you can rearrange c to have at least k elements identical to b.

I need to be careful here. Let me look at the example provided:

In the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Good subsegments:

- a[1:4] = [4,1,2,3] -> can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least 2 match.

- a[2:5] = [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

- a[3:6] = [2,3,4,5] -> can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b: 2,3,4.

- a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6] -> can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has 2 elements matching b: 3,4.

So, all four subsegments are good.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

Good subsegments:

- a[1:4] = [4,1,2,3] -> can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b in all 4 elements.

- a[2:5] = [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

- a[3:6] = [2,3,4,5] -> matches b in 3 elements: 2,3,4.

- a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6] -> matches b in 2 elements: 3,4 -> not good since k=3.

So, only the first three are good.

In the third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Same a and b.

Good subsegments:

- a[1:4] = [4,1,2,3] -> can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], matching b in all 4 elements.

- a[2:5] = [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

- a[3:6] = [2,3,4,5] -> matches b in 3 elements: 2,3,4 -> not good since k=4.

- a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6] -> matches b in 2 elements: 3,4 -> not good.

So, only the first two are good.

From these examples, it seems like for each subsegment of a of length m, I need to check how many elements are common with b, considering their frequencies, and see if at least k of them match.

So, I need a way to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of elements that are also in b, with frequencies not exceeding those in b.

Wait, but in the first test case, a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6], and b = [1,2,3,4], so in a[4:7], there are 3 and 4, which are in b. But according to the problem, it's good only if at least k=2 match, which they do, since 3 and 4 are matching.

Wait, but in the second test case, a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6], which has 3 and 4 matching b, which is only 2, but k=3, so it's not good.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=2, so it's good, in the second, k=3, so it's not good.

So, it seems like I need to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of elements that are also in b, considering their frequencies.

I need to make sure that I account for the frequency of each element in b.

Wait, for example, if b has two 3's, and a's subsegment has at least two 3's, then those two 3's count towards the matching.

But in the given examples, b has unique elements, so I need to generalize it.

I recall that in programming problems, when we need to check for subarrays or substrings with certain properties, sliding window techniques are often useful, especially when the subarrays are of fixed size, which in this case, m is fixed.

So, perhaps I can use a sliding window approach to iterate through a with a window of size m and check, for each window, if it can be rearranged to match at least k elements of b.

But how do I efficiently check the number of matching elements between the window and b, considering their frequencies?

I remember that using frequency counters, like dictionaries or counters in Python, can help with this.

So, perhaps I can create a frequency counter for b, and then for each window in a, create a frequency counter and find the intersection of the two counters.

The sum of the minimum frequencies for each element in both counters would give me the number of matching elements.

Then, if this sum is at least k, it's a good subsegment.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t (number of test cases) is up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, it's manageable as long as each test case is O(n).

So, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently.

First, for each test case, I read n, m, k, then array a of size n, and array b of size m.

Then, I need to iterate through all subarrays of a of length m, and for each one, check if it can be rearranged to match at least k elements of b.

As mentioned, I can use a sliding window approach.

I can maintain a frequency counter for the current window of a, and the frequency counter for b.

Then, I can compute the intersection of these two counters and sum the minimum frequencies to get the number of matching elements.

If this sum is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

To optimize, I need to efficiently update the frequency counter of the window as it slides.

I can start by creating a frequency counter for the first window a[0:m], then, as the window slides to a[1:m+1], I decrease the frequency of a[0] and increase the frequency of a[m].

Then, I need to update the number of matching elements accordingly.

To do this efficiently, I need to keep track of how the matching count changes when I add a new element and remove an old one.

So, I need to consider the frequencies in b for each element.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Create a frequency counter for b, let's call it cb.

2. Create a frequency counter for the first window of a, a[0:m], call it ca.

3. Compute the initial number of matching elements: for each element in ca, if it's in cb, add the minimum of ca[element] and cb[element]) to the sum.

4. If this sum is >= k, increment the answer counter.

5. Then, slide the window one by one:

a. Remove the element a[i-1] from ca: decrease ca[a[i-1]], and if ca[a[i-1]] < cb[a[i-1]], then decrease the sum by 1.

b. Add the element a[i+m-1] to ca: increase ca[a[i+m-1]], and if ca[a[i+m-1]] <= cb[a[i+m-1]], then increase the sum by 1.

c. If the sum is >= k, increment the answer counter.

6. Continue this until the end.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm correctly updating the sum when elements are added or removed.

Let me think carefully about the conditions:

- When I add an element to the window:

- If the element is in b and its frequency in ca is less than its frequency in cb, then the sum increases by 1.

- If the element is in b but its frequency in ca is already equal to or greater than its frequency in cb, then the sum doesn't increase.

- When I remove an element from the window:

- If the element is in b and its frequency in ca is less than or equal to its frequency in cb, then the sum decreases by 1.

- If the element is in b but its frequency in ca is greater than its frequency in cb, then the sum remains the same.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the intersection sum.

Let me define sum as the sum of the minimum of ca[element] and cb[element] for all elements.

When I add an element x to the window:

- If x is in b, and ca[x] < cb[x], then sum increases by 1.

- If ca[x] >= cb[x], sum doesn't increase.

When I remove an element y from the window:

- If y is in b, and ca[y] <= cb[y], then sum decreases by 1.

- If ca[y] > cb[y], sum remains the same.

Yes, this seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case:

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

First window: a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

ca = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4

Since 4 >= 2, it's good.

Next, slide to a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4]

ca = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1} (same as before)

sum still 4 >= 2, good.

Next, a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5]

ca = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) = 3 >= 2, good.

Next, a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6]

ca = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) = 2 >= 2, good.

So, all four are good.

Now, in the second test case with k=3:

Same a and b.

First window a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3], sum=4 >=3, good.

Second window a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4], sum=4 >=3, good.

Third window a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5], sum=3 >=3, good.

Fourth window a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6], sum=2 <3, not good.

So, total 3 good subsegments.

This matches the sample output.

Alright, so this approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to maintain a frequency dictionary for the current window, and keep track of the sum of minimums.

In Python, I can use the collections.Counter for this.

But considering the constraints, with t up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5 in total, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient.

Using Counter should be fine, as it's implemented efficiently in C.

I need to make sure that I handle the sliding window correctly, updating the frequency counts and the sum accordingly.

Also, I need to be careful with the indices when sliding the window.

Let me try to outline the code structure:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k.

- Read array a of size n.

- Read array b of size m.

- Implement the sliding window approach as described.

- Output the number of good subsegments.

I need to make sure that I reset the frequency counters and the sum at the start of each test case.

Also, since elements can be up to 1e6, using counters should be fine in terms of memory.

Edge cases to consider:

- k=1: any subsegment with at least one matching element is good.

- k=m: the subsegment must have all m elements matching.

- m=1: simple check if a[i] is in b.

- m=n: only one subsegment to check.

- All elements in a and b are the same.

- All elements in a and b are unique.

- a and b have repeated elements.

I should make sure that the frequency counts are handled correctly, especially when elements are added or removed from the window.

Let me consider an example where frequencies matter.

Suppose:

n=5, m=3, k=2

a = [1,2,2,3,2]

b = [2,2,3]

cb = {2:2, 3:1}

First window a[0:3] = [1,2,2]

ca = {1:1,2:2}

sum = min(1,0) + min(2,2) = 0 + 2 = 2 >=2, good.

Second window a[1:4] = [2,2,3]

ca = {2:2,3:1}

sum = min(2,2) + min(1,1) = 2 + 1 = 3 >=2, good.

Third window a[2:5] = [2,3,2]

ca = {2:2,3:1}

sum = min(2,2) + min(1,1) = 2 + 1 = 3 >=2, good.

So, all three are good.

Another example:

n=5, m=3, k=3

a = [1,2,2,3,2]

b = [2,2,3]

cb = {2:2, 3:1}

First window a[0:3] = [1,2,2]

ca = {1:1,2:2}

sum = 0 + 2 = 2 <3, not good.

Second window a[1:4] = [2,2,3]

ca = {2:2,3:1}

sum = 2 + 1 = 3 >=3, good.

Third window a[2:5] = [2,3,2]

ca = {2:2,3:1}

sum = 2 + 1 = 3 >=3, good.

So, two good subsegments.

This seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):

cb = Counter(sorted(b))

ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

ans = 0

sm = sum((ca & cb).values())

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

for r in range(m, n):

if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sm += 1

ca[a[r]] += 1

if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:

sm -= 1

ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

return ans

First, it imports Counter from collections.

Then, it reads t, and for each test case, reads n, m, k, array a, and array b.

Then, it calls func_1 with these parameters.

In func_1:

- It creates a Counter for sorted b and for the first window of a (sorted).

- It initializes ans to 0.

- It computes sm as the sum of the minimum frequencies between ca and cb.

- If sm >= k, it increments ans.

- Then, it slides the window from m to n:

- If ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], it increases sm by 1.

- It increases ca[a[r]] by 1.

- If ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], it decreases sm by 1.

- It decreases ca[a[r - m]] by 1.

- If sm >= k, it increments ans.

- Finally, it returns ans.

Now, let's check if this implementation matches the logic I described.

First, sorting a and b before creating counters: is this necessary?

Actually, since we're dealing with frequencies of elements, sorting is not necessary. Counters work perfectly well with unsorted lists.

So, sorting here is unnecessary and might even be harmful in terms of performance.

But, in Python, sorting small lists is fast, so it's not a big issue.

Next, the initial sum is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies between ca and cb, which is correct.

Then, in the sliding window:

- When adding a new element a[r]:

- If ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], then sm +=1.

- ca[a[r]] +=1.

- When removing the old element a[r - m]:

- If ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], then sm -=1.

- ca[a[r - m]] -=1.

This seems correct.

Wait, but there might be a mistake in the conditions.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case:

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

First window: a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

ca = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sm = 4 >=2, ans=1

Then, r=4:

a[r]=5

ca[5] =1 (since it was 0 before)

cb[5]=0, so ca[5] < cb[5] is 1 < 0, which is False, so sm +=1 is not executed.

ca[5] +=1, now ca[5]=1

Remove a[r - m] = a[4 - 4] = a[0]=4

ca[4] =1 <= cb[4]=1, so sm -=1 (sm=4-1=3)

ca[4] -=1, now ca[4]=0

Now, sm=3 >=2, ans=2

Next, r=5:

a[r]=6

ca[6]=1 (was 0)

cb[6]=0, so ca[6] < cb[6] is 1 < 0, False, so sm +=1 not executed.

ca[6] +=1, now ca[6]=1

Remove a[r - m] = a[5-4]=a[1]=1

ca[1]=1 <= cb[1]=1, so sm -=1 (sm=3-1=2)

ca[1] -=1, now ca[1]=0

Now, sm=2 >=2, ans=3

Next, r=6:

a[r]=None, since r=6 and a has indices 0 to 6, but a[6] is the last element.

Wait, in Python, range(m, n) is from m to n-1.

So, r goes from 4 to 6.

So, r=4,5,6.

But a has indices 0 to 6.

So, a[r] for r=4 is a[4]=4, r=5 is a[5]=5, r=6 is a[6]=6.

But in the earlier step, when r=6:

a[r]=6

ca[6]=1 < cb[6]=0? 1 < 0 is False, so sm +=1 not executed.

ca[6] +=1, now ca[6]=2

Remove a[r - m] = a[6-4]=a[2]=2

ca[2]=1 <= cb[2]=1, so sm -=1 (sm=2-1=1)

ca[2] -=1, now ca[2]=0

Now, sm=1 <2, so ans remains 3.

So, total ans=3, which matches the sample output for the second test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=5, m=3, k=2

a=[1,2,2,3,2]

b=[2,2,3]

cb={2:2, 3:1}

First window a[0:3]=[1,2,2]

ca={1:1,2:2}

sm=min(1,0)+min(2,2)=0+2=2 >=2, ans=1

Then, r=3:

a[r]=3

ca[3]=1 < cb[3]=1, so sm +=1 (sm=2+1=3)

ca[3] +=1, now ca[3]=1

Remove a[r - m]=a[3-3]=a[0]=1

ca[1]=1 <= cb[1]=0? 1 <= 0 is False, so sm -=1 not executed.

ca[1] -=1, now ca[1]=0

Now, sm=3 >=2, ans=2

Next, r=4:

a[r]=2

ca[2]=1 < cb[2]=2, since ca[2]=1 < cb[2]=2, sm +=1 (sm=3+1=4)

ca[2] +=1, now ca[2]=2

Remove a[r - m]=a[4-3]=a[1]=2

ca[2]=2 <= cb[2]=2, so sm -=1 (sm=4-1=3)

ca[2] -=1, now ca[2]=1

Now, sm=3 >=2, ans=3

So, total ans=3, which matches the earlier manual calculation.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a=[4,1,5,6]

b=[6]

cb={6:1}

First window a[0:1]=[4]

ca={4:1}

sm=min(1,0)=0 <1, ans=0

Then, r=1:

a[r]=1

ca[1]=1 < cb[1]=0? 1 < 0 is False, so sm +=1 not executed.

ca[1] +=1, now ca[1]=1

Remove a[r - m]=a[1-1]=a[0]=4

ca[4]=1 <= cb[4]=0? 1 <= 0 is False, so sm -=1 not executed.

ca[4] -=1, now ca[4]=0

Now, sm=0 <1, ans still 0

Next, r=2:

a[r]=5

ca[5]=1 < cb[5]=0? 1 < 0 is False, so sm +=1 not executed.

ca[5] +=1, now ca[5]=1

Remove a[r - m]=a[2-1]=a[1]=1

ca[1]=1 <= cb[1]=0? 1 <= 0 is False, so sm -=1 not executed.

ca[1] -=1, now ca[1]=0

Now, sm=0 <1, ans still 0

Next, r=3:

a[r]=6

ca[6]=1 < cb[6]=1, so sm +=1 (sm=0+1=1)

ca[6] +=1, now ca[6]=1

Remove a[r - m]=a[3-1]=a[2]=5

ca[5]=1 <= cb[5]=0? 1 <= 0 is False, so sm -=1 not executed.

ca[5] -=1, now ca[5]=0

Now, sm=1 >=1, ans=1

So, total ans=1, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a=[9
