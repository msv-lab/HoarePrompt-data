Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and understand what's being asked.

So, there's a card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, and we do this for 2n turns, meaning each of us plays n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and places it on the table. If there's already a card with number x on the table, the player gets one point.

Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in maximizing her points, she minimizes my points.

Given that, I need to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better.

Each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire deck. So, for each number, there are two cards with that number, and these two cards are distributed between me and Nene in some way.

For example, for n=4, if the cards are 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4, and I get 1,1,2,3, then Nene gets 2,3,4,4.

Now, we take turns placing one card at a time, starting with me, and we do this for 2n turns.

The scoring is based on whether the number being played is already on the table. If it is, the player gets a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she minimizes my points.

I need to find out the maximum points I can get if I play optimally.

Let me try to think about this step by step.

First, since Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider her responses to my moves.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where we're both trying to maximize our own points.

But it's not exactly zero-sum because the total points can vary based on the moves made. For example, if I play a card that's already on the table, I get a point, but Nene doesn't lose a point; she just doesn't get a point unless she plays a duplicate later.

Wait, actually, the points are gained independently by each player based on whether the card they play is a duplicate on the table at that time.

So, it's not a zero-sum game in the traditional sense because one player's gain doesn't directly correspond to the other's loss in points.

However, since Nene is playing to maximize her points and, in case of a tie on her part, minimize mine, there's a strategic interplay between our moves.

I need to model this to find out the best possible outcome for myself.

Let me consider the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

The sequence of moves as described:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4]

3. I play 1, table: [1,4,1], I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2], Nene gets 1 point

7. I play 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point

Total points: Me:1, Nene:3

It's claimed that I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

I need to see if that's indeed the case.

Let me try another sequence.

Suppose I play 2 first:

1. I play 2, table: [2]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4]

3. I play 1, table: [2,4,1]

4. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 1, table: [2,4,1,4,1], I get 1 point

6. Nene plays 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,3]

7. I play 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,3,3], I get 1 point

8. Nene plays nothing, but since it's 2n turns, she plays her last card.

Wait, Nene has only 4 cards, so in this scenario, she would have played all her cards by turn 7.

Wait, n=4, so each plays 4 turns, total 8 turns.

Wait, in the initial description, it's 2n turns, each playing n turns.

In the first sequence:

I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 2, Nene plays 2, I play 3, Nene plays 3.

In my alternative sequence:

I play 2, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 3, I play 3, Nene plays nothing.

Wait, Nene has 4 cards: 2,3,4,4.

Wait, in my alternative sequence:

Turn 1: I play 2, table: [2]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2, table: [2,2], Nene gets 1 point

Turn 3: I play 1, table: [2,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays 4, table: [2,2,1,4]

Turn 5: I play 1, table: [2,2,1,4,1], I get 1 point

Turn 6: Nene plays 4, table: [2,2,1,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

Turn 7: I play 3, table: [2,2,1,4,1,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays 3, table: [2,2,1,4,1,4,3,3], Nene gets 1 point

Total points: Me:1, Nene:3

Same as before.

Another sequence:

I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 2, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 3, I play 3.

Points: Me:1, Nene:3

Again the same.

Seems like no matter what I do, I can only get 1 point.

Let me see if there's a way for me to get more than 1 point.

Suppose I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 2, Nene plays 3, I play 3.

Points: Me:1, Nene:3

Same again.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1, Nene plays 3, I play 3.

Points: Me:1, Nene:3

Still the same.

It seems that I can't get more than 1 point in this scenario.

So, in this test case, the answer is 1.

Looking at the other test cases in the example:

Second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: the remaining cards, which are 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, total cards are 16, with numbers from 1 to 8, each appearing twice.

So, Nene's cards would be the ones not in my hand.

Given my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, 1 appears twice, but I have one 1, so Nene has one 1.

Similarly, 2: I have one, Nene has one.

3: I have none, Nene has two.

4: I have one, Nene has one.

5: I have two, Nene has none.

6: I have none, Nene has two.

7: I have one, Nene has one.

8: I have two, Nene has none.

In this scenario, the output is 2.

So, in this case, I can get up to 2 points.

I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum points I can get across different test cases.

Looking at the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's cards: the remaining cards, which are 2,3,5,5,6,7,8,8

Wait, let's see:

Total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, Nene has the other copies: 2,3,5,5,6,7,8,8

Wait, 5 appears twice in my hand, so Nene has no 5s.

Wait, I have two 5s, so Nene has none.

Wait, no, the problem says each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, if I have two 5s, Nene has none.

Similarly, she has two 8s, and I have none.

Wait, in this test case, the output is 1.

So, I can get up to 1 point in this scenario.

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

Output: 0

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards: 1

Nene's cards: 1

Output: 0

So, in these smaller cases, it's clearer.

In the fourth test case, n=3:

I have 1,2,3

Nene has 1,2,3

No matter the order, I can't get any points because Nene can always play a card that isn't on the table yet before I can play its duplicate.

Similarly, in n=1, only one card each, I can't get any points.

In the second test case, n=8, with my cards being 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, I can get up to 2 points.

I need to find a pattern or a formula to calculate this maximum points I can get.

Let me think about the game in more general terms.

Each number can appear twice in the deck, and we both have some of those cards.

The key is to maximize the number of times I can play a card that's already on the table.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and, in case of a tie on her part, minimize mine.

So, she's playing against me in an optimal way.

I need to model this interaction.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Identify the numbers that I have two cards of. For those, I can potentially get a point by playing the second one after it's already on the table.

- However, Nene can interfere by playing the other card before I play my second one.

- So, for numbers where I have two cards, if Nene has none, then I can control when to play the second one.

- For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, Nene can choose to play her card at a time that minimizes my chances of getting points.

I need to categorize the numbers based on how many cards I and Nene have for each number.

Let's define:

- For each number x from 1 to n:

- If I have two cards of x, Nene has zero.

- If I have one card of x, Nene has one.

- If I have zero cards of x, Nene has two.

So, for each number x:

- If I have two cards, Nene has zero.

- If I have one card, Nene has one.

- If I have zero cards, Nene has two.

Given that, I need to strategize how to play my cards to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Let me consider the numbers where I have two cards.

For those, since Nene has none, I can control the timing of playing the two cards.

I can choose to play the first card at a time when it's not yet on the table, and play the second one after it's already on the table, thus getting a point.

However, Nene can play her cards in a way that interferes with my plans.

Wait, but since Nene has no cards for those numbers, she can't play any card for those numbers.

So, for numbers where I have two cards and Nene has none, I can always get one point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

Similarly, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, it's more complicated.

In this case, Nene can choose to play her card at a time that minimizes my chances.

Suppose I have one card of x, and Nene has one card of x.

If I play my card first, then Nene can play her card later, but I won't get a point because I played first.

If Nene plays her card first, then when I play mine, I get a point.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she would choose to play her card in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

Wait, Nene plays optimally to maximize her points, and in case of a tie on her part, minimize mine.

So, in the case where I have one card and Nene has one, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, then I get a point.

But she might prefer to play her card at a time when it benefits her more.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of graph theory or some other combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as a matching problem.

Let me consider counting the number of pairs where I have two cards.

For each such pair, I can get one point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

For pairs where I have one card and Nene has one, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of such pairs.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let:

- Let s be the number of numbers where I have two cards. For each such number, I can get one point.

- Let t be the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one.

In the game, for each of these t numbers, Nene can choose to play her card at a time that either helps or hinders me, depending on her strategy.

But since Nene is playing to maximize her points and minimize mine in case of a tie, she will try to minimize my points.

So, for these t numbers, perhaps I can get at most one point from them, but I need to see.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the interaction more carefully.

Let me consider that for each number where I have two cards, I can get one point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total possible points I can get.

Let me consider that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards, plus some points from the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one.

But I need to see how Nene's play affects this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

- For each number where I have two cards, I can get one point, as Nene has none to interfere.

- For each number where I have one card and Nene has one, I can get at most one point, but Nene can choose to minimize my points.

However, I need to consider that Nene can play her cards in a way that affects when I can play my cards to get points.

This seems quite involved.

Let me look for a pattern in the example test cases.

First test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

s = number of numbers where I have two cards: 1 (number 1)

t = number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one: 2 (numbers 2 and 3)

Output: 1

So, points = s + something from t.

In this case, s=1, and from t=2, I get 0 additional points.

Second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

s = number of numbers where I have two cards: 2 (numbers 5 and 8)

t = number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one: 3 (numbers 1,2,4,7) Wait, I have one of 1,2,4,7 and Nene has one of each.

Wait, I have one of 1,2,4,7 and Nene has one of each.

So, t=4.

Output: 2

So, points = s + something from t.

Here, s=2, and from t=4, I get 0 additional points.

Wait, but output is 2, which is equal to s.

Wait, perhaps the formula is points = s.

But in the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's cards: 2,3,5,5,6,7,8,8

s = number of numbers where I have two cards: 1 (number 5)

t = number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one: 5 (numbers 1,2,3,4,6,7)

Wait, I have one of 1,2,3,4,6,7 and Nene has one of each.

Wait, I have one of 1,2,3,4,6,7 and Nene has one of each.

So, t=6.

Output:1

So, points = s + something from t.

Here, s=1, and from t=6, I get 0 additional points.

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

Nene's cards:1,2,3

s=0 (no number where I have two cards)

t=3 (numbers 1,2,3)

Output:0

So, points = s + something from t.

Here, s=0, and from t=3, I get 0 points.

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards:1

Nene's cards:1

s=0

t=1

Output:0

So, points = s + something from t.

Here, s=0, from t=1, I get 0 points.

Looking at these test cases:

First test case: s=1, t=2, points=1

Second test case: s=2, t=4, points=2

Third test case: s=1, t=6, points=1

Fourth test case: s=0, t=3, points=0

Fifth test case: s=0, t=1, points=0

It seems that in all these cases, points = s.

Is that the case?

Wait, in the second test case, s=2, t=4, points=2.

In the third test case, s=1, t=6, points=1.

So, it seems that points = s, regardless of t.

But why?

Wait, perhaps because for the numbers where I have two cards, I can get one point each, and for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, I can't get any points because Nene can play her card in a way that prevents me from getting points.

Wait, but in the second test case, output is 2, which matches s=2.

Similarly, in the third test case, points=1, which matches s=1.

In the first test case, points=1, which matches s=1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, points=0, which matches s=0.

So, perhaps the formula is points = s.

But is this always true?

Let me try to see if this makes sense.

For numbers where I have two cards, since Nene has none, I can always play the first card, put it on the table, and then play the second card later to get a point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, Nene can play her card at a time when it doesn't help me get points.

Specifically, Nene can play her card before I play mine, so that when I play mine, it's not a duplicate yet, hence I don't get a point.

Alternatively, Nene can play her card after I play mine, but in that case, I still don't get a point because I played first.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If I play my card first, then Nene can play her card later, but I don't get a point because I played first.

If Nene plays her card first, then when I play mine, it's a duplicate, and I get a point.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine in case of a tie.

So, she would choose to play her card in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

If she plays her card before I play mine, then I get a point.

But by playing her card first, she also gets a point if the card is a duplicate on the table.

Wait, no, she gets a point only if there's already a card with that number on the table when she plays it.

So, if she plays her card first, and there's no duplicate on the table yet, she doesn't get a point.

Then, when I play my card, it's a duplicate, so I get a point.

But Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she would prefer to play her card when it gives her a point, or at least doesn't give me a point.

But in this scenario, if she plays her card first, she doesn't get a point, but I get a point when I play mine.

If she waits for me to play first, then she can play her card later and get a point.

So, in that case, she would prefer to play her card after me, to get her own point.

But since she is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she would choose to play her card in a way that maximizes her points.

So, in the case where I have one card and she has one, she would play her card after I play mine, so that she can get a point, and I don't get a point.

Wait, but in that case, I don't get a point because I played first, and when she plays her card later, she gets a point.

But in terms of my points, I don't get any point from that number.

So, in such cases, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, I can't get any points, because Nene can always play her card in a way that I don't get a point.

Only for the numbers where I have two cards and Nene has none, I can get a point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards, which is s.

Therefore, the answer is s.

Looking back at the test cases, this matches all of them.

First test case: s=1, points=1

Second test case: s=2, points=2

Third test case: s=1, points=1

Fourth test case: s=0, points=0

Fifth test case: s=0, points=0

So, the solution seems to be to count the number of numbers where I have two cards.

In terms of implementation, given that in the input, I have the list of cards in my hand, I can count the frequency of each number and count how many numbers have two cards in my hand.

The answer is equal to that count.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



This seems to be doing something different.

Let's analyze it.

[*open(0)] reads all lines from standard input.

[2::2] slices the lines starting from the third line and takes every second line, which would be the lines containing the list of cards in my hand for each test case.

Then, for each such line, it splits the line into tokens (the numbers in my hand).

len(tokens) is the number of cards I have, which is n.

len({*tokens}) is the number of unique numbers in my hand.

So, len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) is n - number of unique numbers, which is equal to the number of numbers that appear more than once in my hand.

Since each number can appear at most twice in my hand, this is equal to the number of numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand, which is s.

Hence, this program is correctly calculating s and printing it for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{s}
