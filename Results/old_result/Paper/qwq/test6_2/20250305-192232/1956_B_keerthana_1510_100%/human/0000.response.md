Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her points and, in case of ties, minimize my points.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

We have 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. So, for example, if n=3, the cards are [1,1,2,2,3,3]. These are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. So, in this case, each gets three cards.

Let's take an example from the problem:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

The sequence of moves could be:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4]

3. I play 1, table: [1,4,1], I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2], Nene gets 1 point

7. I play 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point

In the end, I have 1 point, Nene has 3 points.

The problem says that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find out the maximum points I can get under these conditions.

First, I need to think about what "optimal play" means for both players.

Since Nene is very smart and plays optimally, she will try to maximize her points, and if there are multiple ways to do that, she will choose the one that minimizes my points.

I need to model their decision-making process.

Let's consider that both players know all the cards each has, since it's a public game and they can see the table.

Wait, no. It says that turns are made publicly, and each player can see all the cards on the table at each moment. But they don't know each other's hands, right?

Wait, actually, since the cards are distributed between me and Nene, and each gets n cards, and the rest are known to be with Nene, because I know what cards are in the deck and what I have.

Wait, no. The problem says: "the deck with 2n cards is used to play this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1 through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty). In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and Nene so that each player receives n cards."

So, I know my n cards, and I know that the remaining n cards are with Nene. So, I know exactly which cards Nene has.

Wait, but the problem says: "Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have integers a1,a2,…,an written on them", so I know my cards, and since I know all the cards in the deck, I can deduce Nene's cards.

Yes, so I know exactly which cards Nene has.

Similarly, Nene knows her cards and can deduce my cards.

So, both players have complete information about each other's hands.

This makes it easier, because both players know exactly what cards the other has.

Now, the game proceeds with me starting, and we alternate turns, each playing one card per turn, for a total of 2n turns.

On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if the number on that card is already on the table, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

The table starts empty, and cards are placed on it sequentially.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of ties, to minimize my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, knowing how Nene will play.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where both players are playing optimally.

I need to find the optimal strategy for both players.

Let me try to think about smaller cases to see if I can find a pattern or a general strategy.

Let's take n=1.

My cards: [1,1]

Wait, n=1, total cards: 2.

I get one card, Nene gets one card.

Wait, no, n=1, I get n=1 cards, so I get one card, Nene gets one card.

But the deck has two 1's, so I have one 1, Nene has one 1.

Turn 1: I play my 1, table: [1], I get 0 points (since 1 is not already on the table).

Turn 2: Nene plays her 1, table: [1,1], she gets 1 point (since 1 is already on the table).

Final scores: I have 0, Nene has 1.

In this case, I can't get any points.

Another example: n=2.

My cards: [1,1,2,2]

Wait, n=2, total cards: 4, with two 1's and two 2's.

I get two cards, Nene gets two cards.

Possible hands:

Me: [1,1], Nene: [2,2]

Me: [1,2], Nene: [1,2]

Let's consider Me: [1,1], Nene: [2,2]

Turn 1: I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

Turn 2: Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], she gets 0.

Turn 3: I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 (since 1 is already on the table).

Turn 4: Nene plays 2, table: [1,2,1,2], she gets 1.

Final scores: I have 1, Nene has 1.

Another possible sequence:

Turn 1: I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

Turn 2: Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], she gets 0.

Turn 3: I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1.

Turn 4: Nene plays 2, table: [1,2,1,2], she gets 1.

Same as above.

Another example: Me: [1,2], Nene: [1,2]

Turn 1: I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

Turn 2: Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], she gets 1.

Turn 3: I play 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0.

Turn 4: Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], she gets 1.

Final scores: I have 0, Nene has 2.

Alternative sequence:

Turn 1: I play 2, table: [2], I get 0.

Turn 2: Nene plays 1, table: [2,1], she gets 0.

Turn 3: I play 1, table: [2,1,1], I get 1.

Turn 4: Nene plays 2, table: [2,1,1,2], she gets 1.

Final scores: I have 1, Nene has 1.

So, depending on the sequence, I can get either 0 or 1 point.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of a tie, minimize mine.

In the first sequence, she gets 2 points, in the second, she gets 1 point.

So, she would choose the first sequence where she gets 2 points.

But in the first sequence, I get 0 points, in the second, I get 1 point.

But since she prefers to maximize her score first, she would choose the first sequence where she gets 2 points, even though I get 0.

Wait, but in the first sequence, she gets 2 points, in the second, she gets 1 point.

So, she strictly prefers the first sequence.

Wait, but in the first sequence, I get 0, in the second, I get 1.

But she can't choose the sequence; the sequence is determined by our choices turn by turn.

Wait, perhaps in this case, if I play 2 first, then she has to play 1, and then I play 1 to get a point, and she plays 2 to get a point.

Alternatively, if I play 1 first, she plays 1 to get a point, and then I play 2 and she plays 2.

In both cases, I get only 1 point, and she gets 1 point.

Wait, but in the first case, she gets 2 points.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the first sequence:

Me: play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

Nene: play 1, table: [1,1], she gets 1.

Me: play 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0.

Nene: play 2, table: [1,1,2,2], she gets 1.

Total: I have 0, Nene has 2.

In the second sequence:

Me: play 2, table: [2], I get 0.

Nene: play 1, table: [2,1], she gets 0.

Me: play 1, table: [2,1,1], I get 1.

Nene: play 2, table: [2,1,1,2], she gets 1.

Total: I have 1, Nene has 1.

So, in the first sequence, she gets 2 points, and in the second, she gets 1 point.

But in the first sequence, I get 0 points, and in the second, I get 1 point.

Given that Nene wants to maximize her score first and minimize mine in case of ties, she would prefer the first sequence where she gets 2 points over the second where she gets 1 point.

But in the first sequence, I get 0 points, and in the second, I get 1 point.

So, in this case, I can get at most 1 point, because if I choose to play 2 first, leading to me getting 1 point, she would prefer to play in a way that minimizes my score, but in this case, playing 1 first would give me 0 points.

Wait, but in the first sequence, she gets 2 points, and in the second, she gets 1 point.

But she prefers higher score for herself, so she would force the first sequence where she gets 2 points, and I get 0.

Wait, but how does that work in terms of moves?

Let's think step by step.

In the first sequence:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 1, getting a point.

3. I play 2.

4. Nene plays 2, getting a point.

In the second sequence:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene plays 1.

3. I play 1, getting a point.

4. Nene plays 2, getting a point.

So, Nene can choose her moves based on what I play.

If I play 1 first, she plays 1 to get a point.

If I play 2 first, she plays 1, and then I play 1 to get a point, and she plays 2 to get a point.

So, in the first case, I get 0 points, in the second, I get 1 point.

Nene wants to maximize her score, so she would prefer the first sequence where she gets 2 points.

But in that sequence, I get 0 points.

In the second sequence, she gets 1 point, and I get 1 point.

So, she would choose the first sequence.

Therefore, in this case, I can get at most 1 point, but actually, in the first sequence, I get 0 points.

Wait, but according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of ties, minimize my score.

In the first sequence, she gets 2 points, in the second, she gets 1 point.

So, she strictly prefers the first sequence.

Therefore, in this case, I get 0 points.

But in the example provided in the problem, with n=4, my cards: 1,1,2,3; Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4.

In that example, I can get 1 point.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the number of points I can get depends on the number of pairs I have in my hand.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that each number appears exactly twice, and we have to distribute them between our hands.

I need to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points first, and minimize mine second.

I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think in terms of graph theory or combinatorics.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of duplicates.

Each number appears twice, and we have to distribute them between our hands.

Let me consider that I have some numbers that appear twice in my hand, and some that appear once.

Wait, in the input, it's guaranteed that each number appears at most twice in my hand, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

Wait, no, it's guaranteed that each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, but in my hand, it can appear at most twice, but since I have n cards and there are n numbers, each appearing twice in the deck, in my hand, some numbers may appear once or twice.

Wait, no, the problem says: "It is guaranteed that the deck contains exactly 2n cards with integers from 1 to n, each integer appearing exactly twice."

And: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times."

Wait, no, it says: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most twice."

Wait, but n is the number of cards each player has, and there are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

So, in my hand of n cards, each number can appear at most twice, but since there are only two of each number in the entire deck, in my hand of n cards, some numbers appear once, some appear twice, and some don't appear at all.

Wait, but since there are exactly two of each number, and I have n cards, it's possible that some numbers are represented once, some twice, and some not at all in my hand.

Wait, but the problem says: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most twice."

But since I have n cards, and there are n different numbers, each appearing exactly twice in the deck, in my hand, each number can appear at most twice, but since I have n cards, and there are n numbers, it's impossible for a number to appear more than twice in my hand.

Wait, but n cards with numbers from 1 to n, each number appearing at most twice in my hand.

Wait, but in reality, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, and I have n cards, it's possible that some numbers appear twice in my hand, and others appear once, but the total number of cards is n.

Wait, for example, if n=4, and the numbers are [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4], and I have [1,1,2,3], then Nene has [2,3,4,4].

So, in my hand, 1 appears twice, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, and 4 appears zero times.

Similarly, in Nene's hand, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, 4 appears twice, and 1 appears zero times.

So, in general, in my hand, for each number from 1 to n, it can appear 0, 1, or 2 times, but the total number of cards is n.

Wait, but the problem says: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most twice."

Wait, but a1 to an are my n cards, so each number appears at most twice in my hand.

But since there are only two of each number in the entire deck, and I have n cards, it's possible for some numbers to appear once, some twice, and some not at all in my hand.

Wait, for example, with n=3:

Total deck: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

I can have [1,1,2], Nene has [2,3,3]

Or I have [1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3]

Or I have [1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3]

Wait, but in this case, each number appears exactly once in my hand.

Wait, but the problem says each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, but in this case, with n=3, in my hand of three cards, some numbers may appear once or twice, but not more than twice.

Wait, but in the deck, each number appears exactly twice, so in my hand, for n=3, I can have:

- All three different numbers, each appearing once.

- Two different numbers, one appearing twice and the other once.

But not all three numbers appearing twice, because that would be six cards, which is more than n=3.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled up in the constraints.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I have a set of cards, some appearing once, some appearing twice in my hand.

I need to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Nene is trying to maximize her points first, and minimize mine second.

I need to find a way to model their decisions.

Perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think recursively.

At each turn, I choose a card to play, and Nene responds optimally.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Let me count how many numbers appear twice in my hand.

Let me denote:

- Let freq[x] be the number of times x appears in my hand.

Similarly, I can compute Nene's freq, but since I know the entire deck, I can deduce Nene's hand.

Wait, but I don't need to know Nene's hand explicitly.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

Wait, let me consider that a pair is two cards with the same number.

If I have a number that appears twice in my hand, that's a pair.

Similarly, if Nene has a number that appears twice in her hand.

In the game, the order in which we play the cards matters.

I need to decide the order in which I play my cards to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal response.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

Wait, in the first example:

n=4

My hand: [1,1,2,3]

I have one pair (1 appears twice), and two singles (2 and 3 appear once).

Nene's hand: [2,3,4,4], so she has one pair (4 appears twice), and two singles (2 and 3 appear once).

In this case, I can get one point.

Another example:

n=1

My hand: [1], Nene's hand: [1]

I get 0 points.

n=2

My hand: [1,1], Nene's hand: [2,2]

Possible sequences:

- I play 1, Nene plays 2, I play 1 (get 1 point), Nene plays 2 (get 1 point).

- I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Another sequence:

- I play 1, Nene plays 1 (get 1 point), I play 1 (get 1 point), Nene plays 2 (get 0).

Wait, but in this sequence, Nene plays 1 after I play 1, getting a point.

Then I play 1 and get a point, and Nene plays 2 and gets 0.

Wait, but in this case, I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

But according to earlier analysis, in n=2, with [1,1] and [2,2], I can get 1 point.

Wait, but in this sequence, I get 1 point.

Another sequence:

I play 1, Nene plays 2, I play 1 (get 1 point), Nene plays 2 (get 1 point).

Again, I get 1 point.

So, in this case, I can get at most 1 point.

Wait, but in the first sequence I thought of earlier, with [1,2], [1,2], I can get 1 point.

Wait, perhaps the number of pairs I have determines the number of points I can get.

Wait, in the first example, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

In n=2, with one pair, I can get one point.

In n=1, with no pairs, I get zero points.

Wait, but in n=2, if I have [1,2], Nene has [1,2], and I can get one point, as shown in the example.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in n=4, with one pair, I can get one point.

In n=2, with one pair, I get one point.

In n=1, with no pairs, I get zero points.

Seems plausible.

But let's check another example.

n=3

My hand: [1,2,3], Nene's hand: [1,2,3]

I have no pairs in my hand.

Possible sequences:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], she gets 1.

3. I play 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], she gets 1.

5. I play 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3,3], she gets 1.

Total: I get 0, Nene gets 3.

Another sequence:

1. I play 2, table: [2], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [2,1], she gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [2,1,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [2,1,1,2], she gets 1.

5. I play 3, table: [2,1,1,2,3], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [2,1,1,2,3,3], she gets 1.

Total: I get 1, Nene gets 2.

So, in this case, I can get at least 1 point.

But according to my earlier hypothesis, since I have no pairs in my hand, I should get zero points, but in this sequence, I get 1 point.

Wait, perhaps my hypothesis is wrong.

Wait, in the first sequence, I get 0 points, in the second, I get 1 point.

So, I can get up to 1 point.

But I have no pairs in my hand.

Wait, but in the second sequence, I get 1 point.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs in the entire deck minus the number of pairs in Nene's hand.

Wait, in this case, total pairs are 3 (1,2,3), Nene has one pair if she has two of one number, but in this case, she has [1,2,3], no pairs.

Wait, in n=3, total pairs are three (1,1),(2,2),(3,3), but in my hand, I have [1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], so no pairs in either hand.

But in the second sequence, I get 1 point.

So, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe it's the number of times a number appears twice in the entire deck minus the number of pairs in Nene's hand.

Wait, in this case, total pairs are three, Nene has no pairs, so I can get up to three points.

But in practice, I can only get one point.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs in the entire deck minus the number of pairs in Nene's hand minus the number of pairs in my hand.

Wait, in this case, total pairs: three.

Nene's pairs: zero.

My pairs: zero.

So, 3 - 0 - 0 = 3, but I can only get one point.

Wait, not matching.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of pairs that can be formed.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of graph theory, where each number is a vertex, and edges represent pairs.

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Let me look at the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

Sample Output:

0

Looking at the first test case:

n=4

My hand: 1,1,2,3

I have one pair (1,1), and two singles (2,3)

Nene's hand: 2,3,4,4

She has one pair (4,4), and two singles (2,3)

I can get one point.

Second test case:

n=8

My hand: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

I have two pairs (8,8) and (5,5), and three singles (7,4,1,2)

Wait, no, n=8, so I have eight cards.

Wait, the input is: 7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

So, I have two 8's, two 5's, and single 7,4,1,2.

So, I have two pairs and four singles.

Nene's hand would be the remaining cards.

Total deck: two of each number from 1 to 8.

So, Nene has the remaining cards: for numbers 1 to 8, minus what I have.

So, for 1: I have one 1, so Nene has one 1.

Similarly for 2: I have one 2, Nene has one 2.

For 5: I have two 5's, so Nene has zero 5's.

For 8: I have two 8's, so Nene has zero 8's.

Similarly for 4 and 7.

So, Nene has: 1,2,3,3,4,4,6,6

Assuming that the total deck has two of each number from 1 to 8.

So, Nene has one 1, one 2, two 3's, two 4's, and two 6's.

In this case, I can get two points.

Wait, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have in my hand.

In the first test case, I have one pair, I get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs, I get two points.

In the third test case, let's see.

Third test case:

n=8

My hand: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, frequencies:

7:1,1:1,4:2,5:1,3:1,2:1,6:1

So, I have one pair (4,4), and six singles.

Nene's hand: the remaining cards.

Total deck: two of each from 1 to 8.

So, Nene has: one of each except for 4 and 4, since I have two 4's.

Wait, no, I have one 4 and one 4, so Nene has the other 4 and other cards.

Wait, no, in my hand: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have two 4's, so Nene has zero 4's.

Similarly, for other numbers, I have one of each, so Nene has one of each except 4.

So, Nene has: one of each from 1 to 8 except 4, but since I have one of each except 4, and two 4's, Nene has one of each except 4.

Wait, total deck: two of each from 1 to 8.

I have: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have two 4's, and one each of 7,1,5,3,2,6.

So, Nene has: one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7, and zero 4's.

Wait, but n=8, so Nene should have eight cards.

Wait, one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7, and needs one more card.

Wait, total should be eight cards.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, total deck has two of each from 1 to 8, so 16 cards.

Wait, n=8, so total deck has 2*8=16 cards.

I have eight cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have two 4's, and one each of 7,1,5,3,2,6.

So, Nene has: one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7, and two 4's minus the two 4's I have, so zero 4's.

Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, total two of each number.

So, for number 4, I have two 4's, so Nene has zero 4's.

For other numbers, I have one each, so Nene has one of each.

So, Nene has: one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Wait, yes, seven cards, but n=8, so she should have eight cards.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my counting.

Wait, total deck: two each of 1 to 8, so 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8.

I have: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have one 7, one 1, two 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6.

So, Nene has: one 7, one 1, zero 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6, and one 8.

Wait, but n=8, so she should have eight cards.

So, total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

I have: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have one 7, one 1, two 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6.

Missing one 8, which goes to Nene.

So, Nene has: one 8, and one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7.

And zero 4's.

So, in this case, I have one pair (two 4's), and Nene has no pairs.

According to the sample output, I can get one point.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

In this case, one pair, one point.

In the second test case, two pairs, two points.

In the first test case, one pair, one point.

In the third test case, one pair, one point.

In the fourth test case, n=3, with no pairs in my hand, I get zero points.

In the fifth test case, n=1, with no pairs in my hand, I get zero points.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs in my hand.

Wait, but earlier in n=3, with no pairs in my hand, I could still get one point.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, with one pair in my hand, I get one point.

But according to the earlier n=3 example, with no pairs, I could still get one point in some sequences.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, with one pair in my hand, I get one point.

But in n=3, with no pairs, I get zero points.

Wait, but in the n=3 example earlier, I thought I could get one point, but according to the sample, with n=3 and no pairs, I get zero points.

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

Wait, looking back, in the n=3 example:

n=3

My hand: [1,2,3], Nene's hand: [1,2,3]

I have no pairs.

Possible sequences:

Sequence 1:

1. Me: 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene: 1, table: [1,1], she gets 1.

3. Me: 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0.

4. Nene: 2, table: [1,1,2,2], she gets 1.

5. Me: 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3], I get 0.

6. Nene: 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3,3], she gets 1.

Total: I get 0, Nene gets 3.

Sequence 2:

1. Me: 2, table: [2], I get 0.

2. Nene: 1, table: [2,1], she gets 0.

3. Me: 1, table: [2,1,1], I get 1.

4. Nene: 2, table: [2,1,1,2], she gets 1.

5. Me: 3, table: [2,1,1,2,3], I get 0.

6. Nene: 3, table: [2,1,1,2,3,3], she gets 1.

Total: I get 1, Nene gets 2.

So, in this case, I can get up to one point.

But I have no pairs in my hand.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs in my hand plus something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs in my hand plus the number of numbers that appear in both my hand and Nene's hand.

Wait, in this case, with n=3, my hand: [1,2,3], Nene's hand: [1,2,3]

So, for each number, if it appears in both hands, it can contribute to my point.

Wait, in this case, all numbers appear in both hands.

So, perhaps I can get up to the number of pairs in my hand plus the number of numbers that appear in both hands.

Wait, but in this case, I have no pairs, and three numbers appearing in both hands.

But I can get only one point.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of the number of pairs in my hand and something.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs in my hand plus the number of numbers that appear in both hands minus the number of pairs in Nene's hand.

Wait, in this case, Nene has no pairs.

So, it would be 0 + 3 - 0 = 3, but I can only get one point.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs in my hand plus the number of numbers that appear in both hands divided by two or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the total points that can be scored in the game is equal to n, since there are n numbers, and each number can contribute at most one point to either player, because the second card played for each number will give a point.

Wait, no, actually, for each number, the second time it's played will give a point to the player who plays it.

So, for each number, there are two cards: the first one played doesn't give a point, the second one does.

Therefore, there are n points available in total.

Wait, but in the first example, n=4, total points are 4, I get 1, Nene gets 3.

In the second example, n=8, total points are 8, I get 2, Nene gets 6.

In the third example, n=8, I get 1, Nene gets 7.

Wait, no, in the third example, n=8, output is 1, but Nene would get 7.

Wait, but according to this logic, total points are n, and they are distributed between me and Nene based on who plays the second card of each number.

So, for each number, the player who plays the second card of that number gets a point.

Given that, and that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine in case of ties, I need to maximize my points.

So, for each number, the second card played will give a point to the player who plays it.

Given that, and that we alternate turns with me starting, we need to decide the order in which we play our cards.

I need to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a number.

Nene wants to maximize the number of times she plays the second card of a number, and if there are multiple options, choose the one where I get fewer points.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning the second card of each number to one of the players.

Given that, and that we take turns, with me starting, perhaps it's similar to assigning the second cards in a way that maximizes my points, given that Nene is trying to maximize hers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of numbers where I have both cards, and where Nene has both cards, and where we each have one card.

Wait, but in this game, we don't have both cards of a number in one hand; each number appears exactly twice, once in my hand and once in Nene's hand, except for the pairs.

Wait, no, actually, in this game, for each number, the two cards can be distributed between me and Nene in different ways.

Wait, no, since each number appears exactly twice in the deck, and we each have n cards, it's possible that:

- I have two cards of a number (a pair), meaning Nene has no cards of that number.

- I have one card of a number, and Nene has one card of that number.

- I have no cards of a number, meaning Nene has two cards of that number.

But in this game, since I know exactly which cards Nene has based on my hand and the deck, I can determine for each number who has which cards.

Wait, but actually, no. The problem states that I know my hand, and the rest of the deck is known to Nene.

Wait, but in reality, since I know the entire deck and my hand, I can deduce Nene's hand.

So, I know exactly which cards Nene has.

Given that, I can know for each number:

- If I have both cards (a pair), then Nene has none.

- If I have one card, Nene has one card.

- If I have no cards, Nene has both.

So, for each number, I can categorize:

- My pairs: numbers where I have two cards.

- Mixed numbers: numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- Nene's pairs: numbers where I have no cards, Nene has two.

Now, for each category:

- My pairs: I have both cards, so I can ensure that I play the second card, getting a point.

- Nene's pairs: Nene has both cards, so she can ensure that she plays the second card, getting a point.

- Mixed numbers: one card with me, one with Nene. Here, the order of playing matters.

So, for mixed numbers, I need to decide when to play my card, and Nene will decide when to play hers.

Given that, and that we alternate turns, with me starting, we need to see who can play their card second.

Wait, perhaps for mixed numbers, since we alternate turns, and I start, if there are k mixed numbers, and p of them are played by me second, then I can get p points from them.

But I need to maximize p, given that Nene tries to minimize p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of mixed numbers.

Let me define:

- Let m be the number of mixed numbers, i.e., numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- Let s be the number of my pairs, i.e., numbers where I have two cards.

- Then, Nene's pairs are n - m - s, because total numbers are n.

So, s + m + Nene's pairs = n.

Wait, no, s + m + Nene's pairs = n.

Wait, s is the number of my pairs (where I have two cards, Nene has zero).

m is the number of mixed numbers (where I have one card, Nene has one card).

Nene's pairs is the number of numbers where I have zero cards, Nene has two cards.

So, s + m + Nene's pairs = n.

Given that, total points available are n, since each number contributes one point for the second card played.

Now, for my pairs (s), I can ensure that I play the second card, getting s points.

For Nene's pairs, Nene can ensure that she plays the second card, getting Nene's pairs points.

For the mixed numbers (m), it depends on the order in which we play the cards.

Given that, and that we alternate turns, with me starting, how can I maximize my points from the mixed numbers?

Wait, perhaps for each mixed number, if I play
