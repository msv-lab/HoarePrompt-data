Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n players standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They play a game where they throw a ball to each other based on some rules, and after m throws, I need to figure out who could have the ball at the end based on the information provided.

First, I need to understand the setup. The players are in a circle, so the concept of clockwise and counterclockwise makes sense here. The ball starts with player x, and then there are m throws, each with a distance r_i and a direction c_i, which can be '0' for clockwise, '1' for counterclockwise, or '?' meaning unknown direction.

My task is to determine all possible players who could have the ball after m throws, given that for some throws, the direction is known, and for others, it's unknown.

Let me think about how to model this. Since the players are in a circle, the positions wrap around after n players. So, if a player throws the ball clockwise by r positions, the next player would be (current_position + r) modulo n. Similarly, counterclockwise would be (current_position - r) modulo n.

But there's a catch with the modulo operation because in programming, negative numbers in modulo operations can behave differently in different languages. In Python, (a - b) % n works correctly even if a - b is negative, but I need to be careful.

Let me consider an example to understand better. Take the first example from the input:

6 3 2

Each of the three throws has r_i = 2 and c_i = '?'

So, starting from player 2, each throw can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 2 positions.

Let's simulate this step by step.

First throw:

- From 2, clockwise by 2: (2 + 2) % 6 = 4

- From 2, counterclockwise by 2: (2 - 2) % 6 = 0, but player 0 doesn't exist, so it should be player 6.

Wait, in the code provided, there's a handling for this:

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

So, it seems that when you get 0, it's actually player n. That makes sense.

So, after the first throw, possible positions are 4 and 6.

Second throw:

From 4:

- Clockwise by 2: (4 + 2) % 6 = 0, which is player 6

- Counterclockwise by 2: (4 - 2) % 6 = 2

From 6:

- Clockwise by 2: (6 + 2) % 6 = 2

- Counterclockwise by 2: (6 - 2) % 6 = 4

So, possible positions after two throws: 2, 4, 6

Third throw:

From 2:

- Clockwise by 2: 4

- Counterclockwise by 2: 6

From 4:

- Clockwise by 2: 0 -> 6

- Counterclockwise by 2: 2

From 6:

- Clockwise by 2: 2

- Counterclockwise by 2: 4

So, after three throws, possible positions are still 2, 4, 6.

That matches the first sample output:

3

2 4 6

Okay, so the code seems to be doing this correctly.

Let me look at the code provided.

def func_4():

n, m, x = func_3()

ans = {x}

for _ in range(m):

r, c = func_1().split()

r = int(r)

temp = set()

for q in ans:

if c == '0' or c == '?':

temp.add((q + r) % n)

if c == '1' or c == '?':

temp.add((q - r) % n)

ans = temp

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

print(len(ans))

print(*sorted(ans))

This function reads n, m, x, initializes a set ans with x, and then for each of m throws, it reads r and c, and for each current position in ans, it adds the possible new positions based on the direction c.

If c is '0' or '?', it adds (q + r) % n.

If c is '1' or '?', it adds (q - r) % n.

After all throws, it checks if 0 is in ans, discards it, and adds n instead, since player 0 doesn't exist.

Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of those players.

This seems correct based on the first sample.

Let me check another sample.

Take the second sample:

12 1 2

3 1

So, n=12, m=1, x=2

One throw with r=3 and c='1', which is counterclockwise.

So, from 2, counterclockwise by 3: (2 - 3) % 12 = -1 % 12 = 11

So, only player 11 can have the ball.

The output is:

1

11

Which matches.

Another sample:

10 7 4

Throws:

2 ?

9 1

4 ?

7 0

2 0

8 1

5 ?

I need to simulate this step by step.

Start with player 4.

First throw: 2 ?

So, from 4, clockwise: (4 + 2) % 10 = 6

Counterclockwise: (4 - 2) % 10 = 2

Possible: 2, 6

Second throw: 9 1 (counterclockwise)

From 2: (2 - 9) % 10 = -7 % 10 = 3

From 6: (6 - 9) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7

Possible: 3,7

Third throw: 4 ?

From 3: clockwise (3 + 4) % 10 = 7, counterclockwise (3 - 4) % 10 = 9

From 7: clockwise (7 + 4) % 10 = 1, counterclockwise (7 - 4) % 10 = 3

Possible: 1,3,7,9

Fourth throw: 7 0 (clockwise)

From 1: (1 + 7) % 10 = 8

From 3: (3 + 7) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 7: (7 + 7) % 10 = 4

From 9: (9 + 7) % 10 = 6

Possible: 4,6,8,10

Fifth throw: 2 0 (clockwise)

From 4: (4 + 2) % 10 = 6

From 6: (6 + 2) % 10 = 8

From 8: (8 + 2) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 10: (10 + 2) % 10 = 2

Possible: 2,6,8,10

Sixth throw: 8 1 (counterclockwise)

From 2: (2 - 8) % 10 = -6 % 10 = 4

From 6: (6 - 8) % 10 = -2 % 10 = 8

From 8: (8 - 8) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 10: (10 - 8) % 10 = 2

Possible: 2,4,8,10

Seventh throw: 5 ? (unknown direction)

From 2: clockwise (2 + 5) % 10 = 7, counterclockwise (2 - 5) % 10 = 7

Wait, (2 - 5) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7?

Wait, no, (2 - 5) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7, because -3 + 10 = 7.

From 4: clockwise (4 + 5) % 10 = 9, counterclockwise (4 - 5) % 10 = 9

From 8: clockwise (8 + 5) % 10 = 3, counterclockwise (8 - 5) % 10 = 3

From 10: clockwise (10 + 5) % 10 = 5, counterclockwise (10 - 5) % 10 = 5

So, possible: 3,5,7,9

But according to the sample output, it's:

4

3 5 7 9

Which matches.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the samples.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='0' (clockwise)

From 1, clockwise by 1: (1 + 1) % 2 = 0 -> 2

So, only player 2 should have the ball.

Edge Case 2: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='1' (counterclockwise)

From 1, counterclockwise by 1: (1 - 1) % 2 = 0 -> 2

Again, only player 2.

Edge Case 3: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='?'

From 1, clockwise: 2

From 1, counterclockwise: 2

So, only player 2.

Edge Case 4: n=3, m=2, x=2, r1=1 c1='0', r2=1 c2='1'

First throw: from 2, clockwise by 1: (2 + 1) % 3 = 0 -> 3

Second throw: from 3, counterclockwise by 1: (3 - 1) % 3 = 2

So, only player 2.

Edge Case 5: n=4, m=2, x=1, r1=2 c1='?', r2=2 c2='?'

First throw: from 1, clockwise by 2: (1 + 2) % 4 = 3

From 1, counterclockwise by 2: (1 - 2) % 4 = 3

So, after first throw, only 3.

Second throw: from 3, clockwise by 2: (3 + 2) % 4 = 1

From 3, counterclockwise by 2: (3 - 2) % 4 = 1

So, only player 1.

Seems correct.

Another Edge Case: n=1000, m=1000, x=1, r_i=1, c_i='?' for all throws.

In this case, each throw can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 1.

After m=1000 throws, the ball can be at any position, since you can reach any player by moving clockwise and counterclockwise in various combinations.

Wait, no. Actually, in a circle with n players, starting from x, after m throws, each throw moving Â±1, the possible positions are all players if m >= n, because you can make a full circle.

But in this case, m=1000 and n=1000, so it should be possible to reach any player.

But I need to confirm if the code can handle this efficiently.

Given that n and m can be up to 1000 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n*m over all test cases up to 2*10^5, the code should be efficient enough, as it's O(n*m) per test case, and sum n*m is bounded.

Another consideration: when n=2, m=1000, x=1, r_i=1, c_i='?' for all throws.

In this case, after each throw, the ball switches between player 1 and 2.

So, after even number of throws, it's back to player 1, and after odd number, it's with player 2.

But since c_i is '?', meaning it can be either direction, effectively, after each throw, it can be at either player.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

Starting at 1.

First throw: can go to 2 (clockwise or counterclockwise).

Second throw: from 2, can go back to 1.

Third throw: from 1, can go to 2, and so on.

So, with c_i='?', each throw can go to either player.

So, after any number of throws, it can be at either player.

But in this specific case, with n=2, m=1000, x=1, r=1, c='?', the possible positions are both players, because each throw allows moving to either player.

Wait, but in reality, since r=1 and c='?', each throw can go to either player.

So, after m throws, it can be at any player.

Hence, for n=2, m>=1, x=1, r=1, c='?', the possible players are 1 and 2.

Similarly, for n=2, m=0, x=1, r=1, c='?', the possible player is only 1.

But m starts from 1, so for m>=1, it's both players.

Seems the code handles this correctly.

Another consideration: when r_i=0, but according to the problem, 1 <= r_i <= n-1, so r_i=0 is not possible.

Wait, the problem says 1 <= r_i <= n-1, so no issues there.

Also, c_i can be '0', '1', or '?', as specified.

I need to make sure that the code handles all these cases correctly.

Looking back at the code:

ans = {x}

for _ in range(m):

r, c = func_1().split()

r = int(r)

temp = set()

for q in ans:

if c == '0' or c == '?':

temp.add((q + r) % n)

if c == '1' or c == '?':

temp.add((q - r) % n)

ans = temp

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

print(len(ans))

print(*sorted(ans))

This seems correct.

It maintains a set of possible positions after each throw.

For each throw, it considers the possible directions based on c_i, and computes the new positions accordingly.

Finally, it adjusts for the modulo operation by replacing 0 with n, and prints the sorted list of possible players.

I think this should work correctly for all test cases.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
