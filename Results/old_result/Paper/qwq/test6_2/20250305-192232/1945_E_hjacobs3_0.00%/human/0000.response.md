Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can perform at most two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the array so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, we're supposed to apply it to an unsorted array, which is unusual. The algorithm described is a bit different from the standard binary search. Let's see:

- Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

- While r - l != 1:

- Set m = floor((r + l) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

At the end, p_l should be equal to x.

Wait a minute, this isn't the standard binary search I'm used to. Normally, binary search on a sorted array would have l = 0, r = n, and adjust m based on comparisons to find a specific element or a position where an element should be inserted.

In this problem, the binary search is a bit different. It's adjusting l and r based on whether p_m <= x or not. The loop continues until r - l = 1, which means l and r are consecutive.

After the loop, p_l should be equal to x. So, I need to arrange the array such that after this binary search, p_l is x.

Given that I can perform at most two swaps, I need to see how I can manipulate the array to satisfy this condition.

Let me think about how the binary search works here.

Let's consider an example to understand better.

Take n = 6, x = 3, and array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

According to the binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

While 7 - 1 = 6 != 1:

m = floor((7 + 1)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, so r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 3? Yes, so l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((4 + 2)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((4 + 3)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

Since r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 3, which equals x = 3. So, in this case, no swaps are needed.

Another example: n = 6, x = 5, array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Let's run the binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 1)/2) = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 4)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 5)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 6)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_6 = 4 != 5

So, incorrect. Need to perform swaps.

Let's see the sample output for this case: 1 3

Which means swap positions 1 and 3.

So, array becomes [6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]

Run the binary search again:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Loop ends, p_l = 4 != 5

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I misinterpreted the swap indices.

Wait, in the sample output, it's "1 3", which likely means swap positions 1 and 3.

But in Python, lists are 0-indexed, so position 1 is index 0, and position 3 is index 2.

So, swapping positions 1 and 3 would mean swapping array[0] and array[2], resulting in [6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]

But as I saw, p_l still isn't 5.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the swap indices are 1-based?

So, swap positions 1 and 3: array becomes [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Wait, that's the same as before because in 1-based indexing, position 1 is index 0 and position 3 is index 2.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "3 4" for the second test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to carefully read the sample input and output.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

Wait, in the second test case, n=6, x=5, array=[3,1,6,5,2,4], and output is "1 3 4"

Wait, no, looking closely, it's "1" on one line, then "3 4" on the next.

So, it's performing one swap: swap positions 3 and 4.

Wait, but in 1-based indexing, position 3 is array[2] = 6, position 4 is array[3] = 5.

So, swapping them: array becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Let's run the binary search on this:

l=1, r=7

m=4

p_4=6 <=5? No, r=4

Now, l=1, r=4

m=2

p_2=1 <=5? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3

p_3=5 <=5? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3

p_3=5 <=5? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

r - l =1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 =5, which equals x=5.

So, it works with one swap.

Alright, that makes sense.

So, the strategy seems to be: perform swaps to adjust the array so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to find a way to position x correctly in the array so that the binary search ends with p_l = x.

I need to think about how the binary search works in this context.

In the standard binary search, we have a sorted array, and we repeatedly divide the search interval in half. But here, the array is not sorted, and the binary search is a bit different.

In this problem's binary search:

- Initialize l=1, r=n+1

- While r - l !=1:

- m = floor((r + l)/2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- End loop when r - l =1

- Result is p_l should equal x

Given that, I need to ensure that after the binary search, p_l =x.

I need to find a way to arrange the array with at most two swaps so that this condition holds.

I need to understand how the binary search behaves on the array and see how I can manipulate the array to make p_l =x.

Let me consider the positions that the binary search will look at.

Depending on the values in the array, the binary search will traverse through certain indices and finally set l to a particular value.

I need to ensure that p_l =x after the search.

One approach could be to directly place x at the position where l will end up.

But to do that, I need to know where l will end up after the binary search.

Wait, but l's final position depends on the values in the array during the search.

This seems a bit circular.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can consider the current position of x in the array and see if I can swap it into a position where the binary search will end with l pointing to it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the array so that the binary search's conditions are satisfied for p_l to be x.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the properties of this binary search.

In the standard binary search on a sorted array, l and r converge to the position where the target would be inserted while maintaining sorted order.

But here, the array isn't sorted, and the binary search is a bit different.

In this algorithm:

- l and r are initialized to 1 and n+1.

- m is floor((r + l)/2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- Loop until r - l =1

This seems similar to finding the position to insert x to keep the array sorted, but adapted to this specific loop.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding the right position to insert x in the array, assuming it's sorted, and adjust the array accordingly.

But the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps.

I need a way to make the array such that after the binary search, p_l =x.

Given that, maybe I can consider where x is currently in the array and see if swapping it with some other element can make l end up at its position.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a position where if x were there, the binary search would correctly identify it.

This is getting a bit convoluted.

Let me consider that I can perform up to two swaps. That means I can change the positions of at most two pairs of elements.

Given that, perhaps the simplest way is to swap x to a position where the binary search will end up pointing l.

But to do that, I need to know where l will point after the binary search.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the array so that the binary search's conditions are met for p_l to be x.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I should look at the examples again.

In the first sample input:

n=6, x=3, array=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

No swaps needed because the binary search already finds p_l=3.

In the second sample input:

n=6, x=5, array=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

One swap: swap positions 3 and 4 (1-based), which are 6 and 5, resulting in [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then the binary search ends with l=3, p_l=5, which matches x=5.

In the third sample input:

n=5, x=1, array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Two swaps:

First swap positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

After these swaps, the array is [1,2,4,5,3]

Run the binary search:

l=1, r=6

m= floor((6+1)/2)=3

p_3=4 <=1? No, r=3

Now, l=1, r=3

m= floor((3+1)/2)=2

p_2=2 <=1? No, r=2

Now, l=1, r=2

m=1

p_1=1 <=1? Yes, l=1

Now, l=1, r=2

r - l =1, loop ends.

p_l = p_1 =1, which equals x=1.

So, with two swaps, the array is adjusted correctly.

From these examples, it seems that with up to two swaps, I can position x appropriately for the binary search to find it.

But I need a general strategy to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Perform the binary search as described to find the final l.

2. Check if p_l equals x. If yes, no swaps are needed.

3. If not, try to swap x to position l.

- Find the current position of x, say pos_x.

- Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

- Now, p_l =x.

- But, this might disrupt the binary search conditions for other elements.

- However, since I only need p_l to equal x, and don't care about other elements, maybe this is sufficient.

Wait, but the binary search might not behave the same way after the swap, because the values have changed.

Wait, no, the binary search is only dependent on the current array state at the time of running the search.

So, if I swap x to position l, then p_l =x, and the search is satisfied.

But, I need to ensure that the binary search ends with l pointing to the position where x is.

Wait, but if I swap x to position l, then p_l =x, which is what I want.

But, I need to make sure that the binary search will indeed end with l pointing to that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where l would end up, and swap x there.

But to find where l would end up, I need to simulate the binary search.

But the binary search depends on the array's values.

This seems recursive.

Maybe I can simulate the binary search to find the final l, and see if p_l equals x.

- If yes, do nothing.

- If not, swap x to position l.

- But, if swapping x to position l affects the binary search's path, I need to consider that.

Wait, perhaps performing one swap is enough in many cases, but sometimes I might need a second swap to adjust for the disruption caused by the first swap.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I should aim to minimize the number of swaps, but it's not necessary to minimize them, just perform at most two.

Another idea: since the problem states that two swaps are always sufficient, I can rely on that.

So, I need to find a way to perform at most two swaps to make p_l =x after the binary search.

Let me think about the binary search's termination condition.

It terminates when r - l =1, and at that point, p_l should be equal to x.

So, I need to ensure that after the binary search, p_l =x.

To achieve this, perhaps I can adjust the array so that the binary search's conditions are met for p_l to be x.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach: since the binary search is deterministic based on the array, I can simulate the binary search to find the final l.

Then, if p_l !=x, swap p_l with x's current position.

Then, run the binary search again to see if p_l =x.

If yes, then one swap is sufficient.

If not, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But this seems inefficient and not guaranteed to work.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following strategy:

- Find where the binary search ends up, i.e., the final l.

- If p_l ==x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p_l with x's current position.

- Then, check if p_l ==x.

- If yes, one swap is enough.

- If not, perform a second swap to adjust.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me try to formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0 swaps.

3. Else, find the current position of x, say pos_x.

4. Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

5. Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

6. If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

7. Else, perform a second swap to fix it.

For the second swap, I need to decide which two positions to swap.

This is tricky.

Perhaps, in the second swap, I can swap p_l with x again or with some other element.

Wait, perhaps I need to swap p_l with another element that would correct the situation.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Given that two swaps are always sufficient, I should find a general method that works in all cases with at most two swaps.

One possible strategy is:

- Find the current position of x, pos_x.

- Find the position where the binary search ends up, pos_l.

- If p_l ==x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p_l and p_pos_x.

- Then, check if p_l ==x.

- If yes, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

- If not, find another position, say pos_k, such that swapping p_pos_k with either p_l or p_pos_x corrects the situation.

This seems too vague. I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can effectively place x in any position I want.

For example, I can first swap x to any position, and then swap it to the desired position.

But I need to be careful about intermediate disruptions.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a series of transpositions.

Given that, I can perform up to two swaps to rearrange the array.

I need to ensure that after these swaps, the binary search ends with p_l =x.

Given that, perhaps I can identify the target position for x and move it there with at most two swaps.

But I need to confirm that this is always possible.

Given that permutations can be decomposed into transpositions, and that two swaps are sufficient, I can rely on that.

So, in the worst case, I can perform two swaps to place x in the correct position.

But I need to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

- If p_l ==x, output 0 swaps.

- Else, find the current position of x, pos_x.

- Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

- Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

- If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

- Else, find another position pos_k such that swapping p_pos_k with p_l or p_pos_x corrects the situation.

- Output two swaps: first l and pos_x, second pos_k and some other position.

But I need to make sure that this works in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any cycle of the permutation.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: x is already at position l.

- No swaps needed.

Case 2: x is not at position l, but p_l is not x.

- Swap x to position l.

- If p_l ==x after the swap, one swap is enough.

- Else, perform a second swap to correct any discrepancies.

Wait, in the second case, after swapping x to position l, if p_l ==x, we're done.

If not, perhaps swapping p_l with another element that is not x can fix it.

But this seems uncertain.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position I want.

For example, swap x to any position, and then swap it to the desired position.

But I need to make sure that the binary search ends with p_l =x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can sort the array enough for the binary search to find x correctly.

But that seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can make the array such that the binary search's conditions are met for p_l to be x.

But I need to define what those conditions are.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

Sample Input 1:

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

Output:

0

Here, no swaps needed because p_l =3.

Sample Input 2:

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

Output:

1

3 4

Swapping positions 3 and 4: 6 and 5, resulting in [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then, p_l =5, which equals x=5.

Sample Input 3:

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

First swap positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, p_l =1, which equals x=1.

So, in this case, two swaps were needed.

From these examples, it seems that one or two swaps are sufficient.

But I need a general method to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me try to think about the binary search's behavior.

Given that l starts at 1 and r at n+1, and m is floor((r + l)/2), the binary search divides the range in a specific way.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the binary search as partitioning the array into segments and adjusting the array within those segments.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach: since the problem states that two swaps are always sufficient, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in any position I need, and adjust another element to maintain the array's properties.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in position l, and if necessary, adjust another element to satisfy the binary search's conditions.

But I need to be more specific.

Let me consider that after swapping x to position l, if the binary search still doesn't find x, it might be because the path taken by the binary search was affected by other elements.

In that case, perhaps swapping another element that was on the search path can correct the issue.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can adjust the array to make p_l =x, regardless of the binary search's behavior.

Given that, perhaps I can ignore the binary search and just focus on making p_l =x with at most two swaps.

But that can't be right, because the binary search must be considered to ensure that l ends up at the correct position.

Wait, no, the binary search determines l, and I need to make sure that p_l =x after the search.

So, I need to adjust the array before running the search so that when the search is performed, l ends up at a position where p_l =x.

This seems like a chicken and egg problem because l's final position depends on the array's configuration, which I'm trying to adjust.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need a heuristic approach rather than a perfect one.

Given that, perhaps I can implement the following strategy:

- Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

- If p_l ==x, output 0 swaps.

- Else, swap p_l with x's current position.

- Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

- If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

- Else, perform a second swap between p_l and x's new position.

- Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

- If p_l ==x, output 2 swaps: first l and pos_x, second l and new_pos_x.

- Else, something went wrong, but according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, so this shouldn't happen.

This seems like a possible approach, even if it's not optimal.

Let me test this strategy with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 2:

n=6, x=5, array=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

First, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 <=5? Yes, l=4

Now, l=4, r=7

m=5, p_5=2 <=5? Yes, l=5

Now, l=5, r=7

m=6, p_6=4 <=5? Yes, l=6

Now, l=6, r=7

m=6, p_6=4 <=5? Yes, l=6

Loop ends, p_l=4 !=5

So, need to perform swaps.

Find pos_x=4 (1-based, index 3 in 0-based)

Swap p_l (p_6=4) with p_pos_x (p_4=5)

Array becomes [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Simulate the binary search again:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=4 <=5? Yes, l=4

Now, l=4, r=7

m=5, p_5=2 <=5? Yes, l=5

Now, l=5, r=7

m=6, p_6=5 <=5? Yes, l=6

Now, l=6, r=7

m=6, p_6=5 <=5? Yes, l=6

p_l=5 ==x=5

So, one swap suffices: swap positions 6 and 4.

But in the sample output, it's "1 3 4", which seems to be swapping positions 3 and 4 (1-based).

Wait, perhaps there are multiple correct ways to perform the swaps.

In this case, swapping positions 3 and 4 (p_3=6 and p_4=5) results in [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=6 <=5? No, r=4

Now, l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=1 <=5? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=5 <=5? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3, p_3=5 <=5? Yes, l=3

p_l=5 ==x=5

So, swapping positions 3 and 4 also works.

Hence, multiple swap options may be possible.

Therefore, my initial strategy of swapping l and pos_x, and then checking, is valid, but there might be other swap combinations that also work.

Given that, perhaps I can implement my strategy and it will work.

Let me try another sample input.

Sample Input 3:

n=5, x=1, array=[3,5,4,2,1]

First, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 <=1? No, r=3

Now, l=1, r=3

m=2, p_2=5 <=1? No, r=2

Now, l=1, r=2

m=1, p_1=3 <=1? No, r=1

Now, l=1, r=1

r - l =0, which is not 1, so continue?

Wait, the loop condition is while r - l !=1:

But in 0-based indexing, n=5, so positions 0 to 5.

Wait, in the problem, indices are 1-based, so l=1 to r=n+1=6.

In the loop, when r - l =1, loop ends.

In this case, l=1, r=1, which is r - l =0, so continues.

But r <= l, maybe that should be the stopping condition.

Wait, the problem says while r - l !=1.

So, when r - l =1, loop ends.

In this case, l=1, r=2: difference is 1, so loop ends.

Wait, in the earlier steps:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 <=1? No, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=2, p_2=5 <=1? No, r=2

l=1, r=2

m=1, p_1=3 <=1? No, r=1

Now, l=1, r=1

r - l =0 !=1, so continues?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the loop condition.

Looking back at the problem:

"While r - l !=1:

...

End the loop when r - l =1"

So, in this case, l=1, r=2: difference is 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_1 =3 !=1

So, need to perform swaps.

Find pos_x=5 (1-based, index 4 in 0-based)

Swap p_l (p_1=3) with p_pos_x (p_5=1)

Array becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 <=1? No, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=2, p_2=5 <=1? No, r=2

l=1, r=2

m=1, p_1=1 <=1? Yes, l=1

Now, l=1, r=2

r - l =1, loop ends.

p_l = p_1 =1 ==x=1

So, one swap suffices: swap positions 1 and 5.

But in the sample output, it's two swaps:

2

2 4

1 5

Which suggests that their approach is different.

Perhaps their approach involves swapping to make the array somewhat sorted, but I'm not sure.

Given that, perhaps my approach of swapping l and pos_x and checking is acceptable, as it achieves the goal in one swap in this case.

Wait, in this case, it worked with one swap, but the sample output shows two swaps.

Perhaps there are multiple ways, and the problem accepts any correct sequence of at most two swaps.

Hence, my approach should be acceptable.

Let me consider another case.

Sample Input 4:

n=6, x=3, array=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

First, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 <=3? No, r=4

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=3 <=3? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=1 <=3? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3, p_3=1 <=3? Yes, l=3

p_l = p_3=1 !=3

So, need to perform swaps.

Find pos_x=2 (1-based, index 1 in 0-based)

Swap p_l (p_3=1) with p_pos_x (p_2=3)

Array becomes [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 <=3? No, r=4

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=1 <=3? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=3 <=3? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3, p_3=3 <=3? Yes, l=3

p_l = p_3=3 ==x=3

So, one swap suffices: swap positions 3 and 2.

But in the sample output, it's two swaps:

2

4 5

2 4

Which suggests swapping positions 4 and 5, then 2 and 4.

Again, multiple correct ways.

Hence, my approach seems valid.

Let me consider a case where one swap is not enough, and two swaps are needed.

Sample Input 5:

n=3, x=2, array=[3,2,1]

First, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=2 <=2? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=1 <=2? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3, p_3=1 <=2? Yes, l=3

p_l = p_3=1 !=2

So, need to perform swaps.

Find pos_x=2 (1-based, index 1 in 0-based)

Swap p_l (p_3=1) with p_pos_x (p_2=2)

Array becomes [3,1,2]

Simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=1 <=2? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=2 <=2? Yes, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

m=3, p_3=2 <=2? Yes, l=3

p_l = p_3=2 ==x=2

So, one swap suffices: swap positions 3 and 2.

But in the sample output, it's one swap: 1 3

Which swaps positions 1 and 3: [3,2,1] -> [1,2,3]

Then, simulate the binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=2 <=2? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=3 <=2? No, r=3

Now, l=2, r=3

m=2, p_2=2 <=2? Yes, l=2

Now, l=2, r=3

r - l =1, loop ends.

p_l = p_2=2 ==x=2

So, swapping positions 1 and 3 also works.

Hence, multiple swap options are possible.

Therefore, my initial strategy seems acceptable.

Given that, I can implement the following algorithm:

- Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

- If p_l ==x, output 0 swaps.

- Else, swap p_l with x's current position.

- Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

- If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

- Else, perform a second swap between p_l and x's new position.

- Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

- If p_l ==x, output 2 swaps: first l and pos_x, second l and new_pos_x.

- Else, something went wrong, but according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient.

This should work, but I need to implement it carefully.

I need to make sure that I'm using 1-based or 0-based indexing correctly.

In the problem, indices are 1-based, so I need to adjust for that in the code.

Also, I need to handle the binary search correctly, ensuring that I don't have off-by-one errors.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the binary search terminates correctly and that l and r are handled properly.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed with this strategy.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to adjust a permutation array using at most two swaps so that a given binary search algorithm finds a specified element `x`. The binary search algorithm is non-standard and operates on an unsorted array, so our task is to strategically swap elements to ensure the algorithm correctly identifies `x`.

### Approach

1. **Simulate the Binary Search**:
   - Determine the final position `l` where the binary search ends.
   - Check if the element at this position is already `x`. If yes, no swaps are needed.

2. **Perform Swaps**:
   - If the element at position `l` is not `x`, swap the element at position `l` with the element `x`.
   - Simulate the binary search again. If the element at position `l` is now `x`, one swap is sufficient.
   - If not, perform a second swap between the current element at position `l` and the current position of `x` to ensure the binary search finds `x` at position `l`.

### Solution Code

```python
def binary_search(array, n, x):
    l = 0  # 0-based indexing
    r = n
    while r - l != 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if array[m] <= x:
            l = m
        else:
            r = m
    return l + 1  # 1-based indexing

def solve(n, x, array):
    # Find current position of x
    pos_x = array.index(x) + 1  # 1-based indexing
    
    # Find l after binary search
    l = binary_search(array, n, x)
    
    if array[l - 1] == x:  # 0-based indexing
        print(0)
        return
    
    # First swap: swap l and pos_x
    array[l - 1], array[pos_x - 1] = array[pos_x - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    # Find new l after the first swap
    new_l = binary_search(array, n, x)
    
    if array[new_l - 1] == x:
        print(1)
        print(l, pos_x)
        return
    else:
        # Find current position of x after first swap
        new_pos_x = array.index(x) + 1
        # Second swap: swap new_l and new_pos_x
        array[new_l - 1], array[new_pos_x - 1] = array[new_pos_x - 1], array[new_l - 1]
        
        # Verify after second swap
        final_l = binary_search(array, n, x)
        if array[final_l - 1] == x:
            print(2)
            print(l, pos_x)
            print(new_l, new_pos_x)
            return
        else:
            # The problem states that two swaps are always sufficient
            assert False, "More than two swaps needed, which should not happen."

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n_x = data[idx].split()
        n = int(n_x[0])
        x = int(n_x[1])
        idx += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        solve(n, x, array)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - We implement a binary search that adjusts bounds based on the comparison of `array[m]` with `x`.
   - The search continues until the difference between `r` and `l` is 1, ensuring we've narrowed down to the correct position.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - Identify the positions involved (`l` and `pos_x`).
   - Perform swaps to place `x` at position `l` and ensure the binary search correctly identifies it.
   - Output the number of swaps and the swap operations performed.

This approach ensures that we achieve the desired result with at most two swaps, adhering to the constraints provided.
