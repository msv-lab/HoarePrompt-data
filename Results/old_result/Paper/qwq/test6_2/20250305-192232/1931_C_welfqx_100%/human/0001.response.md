Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers: i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what's the most efficient way to make all elements equal. Since I can perform the operation only once, I have to choose the segment [i, j] wisely to minimize the cost.

One straightforward approach is to choose the entire array as the segment [1, n] and set all elements to a single value. The cost would be n, which is the full length of the array. However, maybe there are segments within the array that are already uniform, and I can take advantage of those to reduce the total cost.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

8

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

1

1

2

1 2

3

1 2 3

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

Looking at the first test case:

n = 6

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

The output is 4. So, the minimal cost is 4 burles. How can I achieve this? If I set the middle four elements (indices 2 to 5) to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4, which matches the output.

Another test case:

n = 7

a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output: 0

Since all elements are already equal, no operation is needed, hence cost 0.

n = 8

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

Output: 2

If I set the segment from index 4 to 5 (elements 1 and 2) to 8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], and the cost is 2.

n = 1

a = [1]

Output: 0

Only one element, already equal.

n = 2

a = [1,2]

Output: 1

Set either the first or the second element to match the other, cost 1.

n = 3

a = [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Set the first two or the last two elements to make all equal.

n = 7

a = [4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Output: 6

n = 9

a = [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

Output: 7

From these examples, it seems that the minimal cost is equal to the total number of elements that are not already equal to the most frequent element in the array.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5,1], the most frequent element is 1 (appears twice), so the minimal cost should be n - frequency of 1, which is 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the output.

In the second test case, all elements are 1, so n - 7 = 0.

In the third test case, 8 appears five times, so 8 - 5 = 3, but the output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's not just n - max frequency, something else is happening here.

Wait, in the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], 8 appears six times, so n - 6 = 2, which matches the output.

In the fifth test case, [1,2], the most frequent are 1 and 2, both appear once, so n - 1 = 1.

In the sixth test case, [1,2,3], each appears once, n - 1 = 2.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is n - max frequency of any element.

But in the seventh test case, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], the frequency of 1 is 2, frequency of 3 is 2, so n - 2 = 5, but the output is 6. That doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the seventh test case, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], the frequencies are:

4:1, 3:2, 2:1, 7:1, 1:2.

The max frequency is 2 (for 1 and 3), so n - 2 = 5, but the output is 6. That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the max frequency, but the sum of frequencies of the most frequent elements.

In the seventh test case, both 1 and 3 appear twice, so the sum is 4, n - 4 = 3, but the output is 6. Still doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that I can set a segment to a value that is already present in the array.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the length of the array minus the length of the longest subarray with all equal elements.

Wait, in the first test case, the longest subarray with equal elements is [1] or [1] at the end, length 1, so cost is 6 - 1 = 5, but the output is 4. Doesn't match.

Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's the total number of segments that need to be set.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal number of operations needed to make the array uniform, but since I can only perform one operation, it has to be done in one go.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the size of the smallest segment that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array uniform.

In the first test case, setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 makes the array [1,1,1,1,1,1], cost 4.

Alternatively, setting indices 1 to 5 to 1 and then setting index 6 to 1, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, no, I can only perform one operation.

So, I need to find a single segment [i, j] to set to a value x such that the entire array becomes equal to x, minimizing the cost (j - i + 1).

Wait, but in the first test case, setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 achieves that, cost 4.

But is there a way to do it with a smaller cost? For example, setting indices 3 to 4 to 1, then the array becomes [1,2,1,1,5,1], which is not uniform. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, setting indices 2 to 4 to 1, array becomes [1,1,1,4,5,1], still not uniform.

Wait, seems like setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 is the minimal segment to set to make the array uniform.

In the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], setting indices 4 to 5 to 8, cost 2, makes the array uniform.

In the seventh test case, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], what's the minimal segment to set to make it uniform?

If I set indices 1 to 7 to any value, cost 7.

Or set indices 1 to 6 to 1, and then set index 7 to 1, but I can only do one operation.

Wait, set indices 1 to 7 to 1, cost 7.

But the output is 6, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe set indices 1 to 4 to 1, and indices 6 to 7 to 1, but I can only do one operation.

Alternatively, set indices 2 to 6 to 1, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set indices 1 and 7 to 1, but again, only one operation allowed.

Wait, seems like the minimal cost is indeed 6, by setting indices 2 to 7 to 1, making the array [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], then set index 1 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, no, I can only do one operation.

So, set indices 1 to 7 to 1, cost 7.

But the output is 6, so maybe there's a better way.

Wait, maybe set indices 1 to 5 to 1, array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set index 7 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, perhaps set indices 2 to 7 to 1, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], then set index 1 to 1, but only one operation.

Wait, perhaps I misread the output.

Wait, in the sample output, for the seventh test case, it's 6, which would correspond to setting indices 2 to 7 to 1, cost 6, and the first element is already 4, which is different from 1, so I still need to set it separately, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, no, if I set indices 2 to 7 to 4, the array becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4,3], then set index 7 to 4, but only one operation.

Wait, no, I can only perform one operation.

I think I need to find a segment [i, j] to set to x such that, combined with the existing equal elements, the entire array becomes equal to x.

Wait, perhaps it's about finding the largest contiguous segment of identical elements and setting the rest to that value.

Wait, in the first test case, the largest segment of identical elements is [1] at the beginning and end, length 1, so cost is 6 - 1 = 5, but the output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's about finding the maximum number of elements that are already equal to a particular value, and then setting the rest to that value.

In the first test case, 1 appears twice, so cost is 6 - 2 = 4, which matches.

In the seventh test case, 1 appears twice, 3 appears twice, so n - 2 = 5, but the output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal.

In the first test case, the maximum consecutive equals are [1], [8,8,8], etc.

Wait, in the first test case, [1], so 6 - 1 = 5, but output is 4. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the maximum number of elements that can be made equal without any operation.

Wait, in the first test case, the maximum number of elements that are already equal is 2 (for 1 and 5), so 6 - 2 = 4.

In the seventh test case, the maximum frequency is 2 (for 1 and 3), so 7 - 2 = 5, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n - the length of the longest prefix or suffix that consists of the same element.

In the first test case, the longest prefix of the same element is [1], length 1, and the longest suffix is [1], length 1, so n - 1 = 5, but output is 4. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the sum of the lengths of the longest prefix and the longest suffix that consist of the same element, but only if they are the same element.

In the first test case, prefix [1] and suffix [1], both 1, so n - (1 + 1) = 4, which matches the output.

In the third test case, prefix [8,8,8] and suffix [8,8,8], both 8, so n - (3 + 3) = 8 - 6 = 2, which matches the output.

In the seventh test case, prefix [4] and suffix [3], different elements, so n - max(1,1) = 7 - 1 = 6, which matches the output.

In the second test case, prefix [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] and suffix [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], same element, so n - (7 + 7) = 7 - 7 = 0, which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=1, so cost is 0.

In the fifth test case, n=2, elements [1,2], different, so n - max(1,1) = 2 - 1 =1, which matches.

In the sixth test case, n=3, elements [1,2,3], so n - max(1,1) = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches.

In the eighth test case, n=9, elements [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], the longest prefix of the same element is [9,9], length 2, and the longest suffix is [5,5,5], length 3, but they are different elements, so n - max(2,3) = 9 - 3 = 6, but the output is 7. Doesn't match.

Wait, in the eighth test case, the output is 7, but according to this logic, it should be 6. Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if the longest prefix and suffix are of the same element, I can add their lengths, else just take the maximum of the two.

In the first test case, prefix [1] and suffix [1], same element, so n - (1 + 1) = 4, matches.

In the third test case, prefix [8,8,8] and suffix [8,8,8], same element, so n - (3 + 3) = 2, matches.

In the seventh test case, prefix [4] and suffix [3], different elements, so n - max(1,1) = 6, matches.

In the eighth test case, prefix [9,9] and suffix [5,5,5], different elements, so n - max(2,3) = 9 - 3 = 6, but the output is 7. Doesn't match.

Hmm, seems like there's a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the eighth test case:

n=9

a=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

Longest prefix with the same element is [9,9], length 2.

Longest suffix with the same element is [5,5,5], length 3.

Since they are different elements, we take n - max(2,3) = 9 - 3 = 6, but the output is 7.

So, this suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps instead, it's n minus the sum of the lengths of the longest same-element prefix and the longest same-element suffix, provided that the prefix and suffix consist of the same element. Otherwise, it's n - max(length of prefix, length of suffix).

In the first test case:

prefix [1], suffix [1], same element, so n - (1 + 1) = 4.

Third test case:

prefix [8,8,8], suffix [8,8,8], same element, n - (3 + 3) = 2.

Seventh test case:

prefix [4], suffix [3], different, n - max(1,1) = 6.

Eighth test case:

prefix [9,9], suffix [5,5,5], different elements, so n - max(2,3) = 9 - 3 = 6, but output is 7. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping of the prefix and suffix.

In the eighth test case, prefix [9,9] and suffix [5,5,5], no overlap.

But perhaps there is a longer segment in the middle that can be considered.

Wait, maybe it's n - the length of the longest same-element substring, whether it's prefix, suffix, or in the middle.

In the first test case, the longest same-element substring is [1] or [1], length 1, n - 1 = 5, but output is 4. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the sum of the lengths of the longest same-element prefix and suffix, even if they are different elements.

In the first test case, prefix [1], length 1, suffix [1], length 1, sum 2, n - 2 = 4, matches.

Third test case, prefix [8,8,8], length 3, suffix [8,8,8], length 3, sum 6, n - 6 = 2, matches.

Seventh test case, prefix [4], length 1, suffix [3], length 1, sum 2, n - 2 = 5, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Eighth test case, prefix [9,9], length 2, suffix [5,5,5], length 3, sum 5, n - 5 = 4, but output is 7. Doesn't match.

This is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe it's n - the maximum length of same-element segments in the array.

In the first test case, maximum segment length is 1, n - 1 = 5, but output is 4. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the maximum frequency of any element.

In the first test case, frequency of 1 is 2, n - 2 = 4, matches.

Third test case, frequency of 8 is 6, n - 6 = 2, matches.

Seventh test case, frequency of 1 and 3 is 2, n - 2 = 5, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Eighth test case, frequency of 5 is 3, n - 3 = 6, but output is 7. Doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's n - the minimum number of operations needed to make the array uniform, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a segment to set such that the remaining elements are already equal to the chosen x.

Wait, in the first test case, if I set indices 2 to 5 to 1, then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4.

Alternatively, if I set indices 1 to 5 to 1, and set index 6 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, perhaps it's n - the maximum number of elements that are equal to the most frequent element in the array.

In the first test case, most frequent is 1 (2 times), n - 2 = 4, matches.

Third test case, most frequent is 8 (6 times), n - 6 = 2, matches.

Seventh test case, most frequent is 1 and 3 (2 times), n - 2 = 5, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Eighth test case, most frequent is 5 (3 times), n - 3 = 6, but output is 7. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps in cases where the most frequent elements are different, I need to consider the sum of their frequencies.

In the seventh test case, 1 and 3 both appear twice, so sum is 4, n - 4 = 3, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that I can choose x to be any value, not necessarily present in the array.

Wait, but in the first test case, choosing x=1 and setting indices 2 to 5 to 1, cost 4, which is n - frequency of 1.

Wait, perhaps it's always n - frequency of the chosen x.

In the first test case, frequency of 1 is 2, n - 2 = 4.

In the third test case, frequency of 8 is 6, n - 6 = 2.

In the seventh test case, frequency of 1 is 2, n - 2 = 5, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x such that the sum of the lengths of the prefix and suffix that are equal to x is maximized.

In the first test case, for x=1, prefix length 1, suffix length 1, sum 2, n - 2 = 4.

In the seventh test case, for x=1, prefix length 1, suffix length 1, sum 2, n - 2 = 5, but output is 6.

For x=3, prefix length 0, suffix length 1, sum 1, n - 1 = 6.

So, taking the maximum of n - sum for x=1 (5) and x=3 (6), the minimal cost is 6.

Similarly, in the eighth test case, for x=5, prefix length 0, suffix length 3, sum 3, n - 3 = 6.

But the output is 7, which suggests that choosing x=5 is not the optimal choice.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x such that the sum of the lengths of the prefix and suffix equal to x is maximized, but only if they are of the same x.

In the eighth test case, for x=5, sum=3 (suffix), for x=9, sum=2 (prefix), so n - max(3,2) = 9 - 3 = 6, but output is 7.

Hmm, still doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that if the prefix and suffix are of the same x, I can add their lengths, else just take the maximum length.

In the first test case, prefix and suffix are both x=1, so sum=2, n - 2 =4.

Seventh test case, for x=1, sum=2, for x=3, sum=1, so n - max(2,1) =7 - 2=5, but output is 6.

Wait, n=7, max sum=2, n - 2=5, but output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider overlapping.

Wait, maybe it's n - the maximum number of elements that can be made equal to x without any operation.

In the first test case, for x=1, 2 elements are already 1, so n - 2 =4.

In the seventh test case, for x=1, 2 elements are 1, for x=3, 2 elements are 3, so n - 2=5, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that choosing x=1 allows me to set the middle elements to 1, but I have to set more elements than just the ones that are not 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

I can perform at most one operation: select i, j, x and set a[i] to a[j] to x, costing (j - i +1).

I need to make all elements equal.

Option 1: Choose x to be the most frequent element in the array.

Option 2: Choose x to be any element, and set the minimal possible segment to make the array uniform.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coverage.

I need to cover the entire array with segments where all elements are equal, and possibly add one operation to cover the remaining non-uniform segments.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimal cost to make the array uniform with at most one operation.

Let me consider that I can set a segment to a value x, and the rest of the array should already be equal to x.

So, the cost is the length of the segment that needs to be set to x.

To minimize this cost, I should choose x such that as many elements as possible are already equal to x, and choose the segment that needs to be set to x is as small as possible.

So, for each possible x, calculate the minimal segment that needs to be set to x to make the entire array equal to x.

Then, choose the x and the segment that minimizes the cost.

In the first test case, x=1:

elements that are not 1 are at positions 2,3,4,5, so I need to set indices 2 to 5 to 1, cost 4.

x=2:

elements that are not 2 are at positions 1,3,4,5,6, cost 5.

x=3:

elements that are not 3 are at positions 1,2,4,5,6, cost 6.

x=4:

elements that are not 4 are at positions 1,2,3,5,6, cost 5.

x=5:

elements that are not 5 are at positions 1,2,3,4,6, cost 5.

So, the minimal cost is 4 when choosing x=1.

Similarly, in the seventh test case:

x=1:

elements that are not 1 are at positions 1,3,4,5,7, so set indices 1,3,4,5,7 to 1, cost 5.

x=2:

elements that are not 2 are at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7, cost 6.

x=3:

elements that are not 3 are at positions 1,2,3,4,6,7, cost 6.

x=4:

elements that are not 4 are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7, cost 6.

x=7:

elements that are not 7 are at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7, cost 6.

So, the minimal cost is 5, but the output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

For x=1, elements that are not 1 are at positions 1,3,4,5,7, so setting these positions to 1 would make the array uniform. But the operation allows me to set a contiguous segment to x.

So, to set positions 1,3,4,5,7 to 1, I need to perform multiple operations, but I can only perform one operation.

So, I need to choose a single segment to set to x such that, combined with the existing x's, the entire array becomes x.

So, for x=1 in the seventh test case:

Existing 1's at positions 5 and 6.

I need to set positions 1,2,3,4,7 to 1.

But I can only set one segment, say set positions 1 to 7 to 1, cost 7.

Alternatively, set positions 1 to 4 to 1, and positions 7 to 7 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

So, the minimal single segment to set is positions 1 to 7 to 1, cost 7.

But the output is 6, so perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe set positions 2 to 7 to 1, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], then set position 1 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, no, only one operation.

So, seems like the minimal cost is indeed 7.

But the output is 6, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to choose x.

Wait, maybe choose x=3.

Existing 3's at positions 2 and 7.

Need to set positions 1,3,4,5,6 to 3, which is positions 1 to 6 to 3, cost 6.

Then, position 7 is already 3, so the entire array is 3.

So, cost is 6, which matches the output.

Ah, so choosing x=3 and setting positions 1 to 6 to 3, cost 6.

Similarly, choosing x=1 and setting positions 2 to 7 to 1, cost 6.

So, the minimal cost is 6.

Similarly, in the eighth test case, choosing x=5:

Set positions 1 to 6 to 5, cost 6, and position 9 to 5, but only one operation.

Alternatively, choose x=9:

Set positions 3 to 9 to 9, cost 7.

Choose x=5:

Set positions 1 to 6 to 5, cost 6.

Choose x=3:

Set positions 1 to 8 to 3, cost 8.

So, minimal cost is 6, but the output is 7. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps for x=5, setting positions 1 to 6 to 5, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3], then set position 9 to 5, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, only one operation, so I need to choose a segment to set to x such that the rest are already x.

So, for x=5, setting positions 1 to 6 to 5, then position 9 needs to be set to 5, but only one operation allowed.

So, that's not possible.

Wait, no, I can only set one segment to x.

So, for x=5, set positions 1 to 6 to 5, and positions 8 and 9 are already 5, so the array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], cost 6.

Wait, position 8 and 9 are [5,5], so if I set positions 1 to 6 to 5, positions 7 to 9 are already 5, so the entire array is 5, cost 6.

But the output is 7, so perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x=9.

Set positions 3 to 9 to 9, cost 7, and positions 1 and 2 are already 9, so the array becomes [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], cost 7.

So, the minimal cost is min(6,7) =6, but the output is 7. Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x=5 and set positions 1 to 7 to 5, cost 7, and positions 8 and 9 are already 5, so total cost is 7.

Wait, but earlier I thought setting positions 1 to 6 to 5, and positions 7 to 9 are already 5, so cost 6.

Wait, positions 7 to 9 are [5,5,5], so if I set positions 1 to 6 to 5, cost 6, and positions 7 to 9 are already 5, so total cost is 6, but output is 7. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers i, j, x (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to (j - i +1) burles."

So, only one operation allowed.

So, only one segment [i,j] can be set to x, and the cost is (j - i +1).

The rest of the array must already be equal to x.

So, in the eighth test case, to make the entire array equal to 5, I need to set positions 1 to 6 to 5, and positions 7 to 9 are already 5, so cost is 6.

Similarly, to make the entire array equal to 9, set positions 3 to 9 to 9, cost 7.

So, minimal cost should be 6, but the output is 7. There must be a mistake in the output or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the output.

Looking back at the sample output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

So, for the eighth test case, output is 7.

But according to my calculation, choosing x=5 and setting positions 1 to 6 to 5, cost 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after setting positions 1 to 6 to 5, position 9 is 3, which is not 5, so I need to set position 9 to 5, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, no, I can only set one segment to x.

So, if I set positions 1 to 6 to 5, then positions 7 to 9 are [
