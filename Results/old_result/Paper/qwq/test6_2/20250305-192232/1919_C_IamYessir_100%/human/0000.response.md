Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array has to be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called penalty. The penalty for a subsequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, if I have a subsequence like [1, 3, 2], the penalty would be 1 because 3 is greater than 2.

My goal is to split the array into s and t in such a way that the sum of their penalties is minimized. I need to find the minimum possible penalty.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if my array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], some subsequences could be [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even an empty sequence.

Now, the problem allows me to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, and I need to minimize the sum of their penalties. To minimize the total penalty, I need to minimize the number of times an element in s is less than the next one, plus the same for t.

I should think about how to distribute the elements between s and t to minimize these penalties. One way to approach this is to try to maximize the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence because if elements are in increasing order, their penalty would be lower.

Wait, actually, the penalty counts the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, if a subsequence is strictly increasing, its penalty would be equal to the number of pairs, which is len(subsequence) - 1. That's not what I want. I need to minimize the number of times an element is less than the next one.

Actually, to minimize the penalty, I need to maximize the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next one in both s and t. Because the penalty counts the number of times an element is less than the next one.

So, perhaps I should try to split the array into two decreasing subsequences as much as possible. Because in a decreasing subsequence, there are no pairs where an element is less than the next one, so the penalty would be zero.

But it's possible that not the entire array can be split into two decreasing subsequences. In that case, some elements will have to be in increasing order, contributing to the penalty.

Wait, let's think differently. If I can partition the array into two decreasing subsequences, then the penalty would be zero, which is the minimum possible. But if that's not possible, then I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs across both s and t.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the minimum number of decreasing subsequences to partition the array into. But in this case, I'm allowed to have two subsequences, and I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the minimum penalty for splitting the first i elements into s and t, and update the states accordingly.

Let me consider smaller examples to get an intuition.

Take the first example:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

If I split it into s = [2, 4, 5] and t = [1, 3], as mentioned in the example, penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3.

But is this the minimal penalty? Let's see.

If I split s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4], then p(s) = 2 (1 < 3, 3 < 5) and p(t) = 1 (2 < 4), total penalty = 3.

Another split: s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], t = [], penalty = 4 + 0 = 4, which is worse.

s = [1, 3, 5], t = [2, 4], same as above.

s = [1, 4, 5], t = [2, 3], p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total = 3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal penalty in this case.

But is there a way to get a lower penalty? Let's see.

If I try to split into two decreasing subsequences, but in this array, it's strictly increasing, so it's impossible to have decreasing subsequences longer than 1.

So, if I split into s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4], both s and t are increasing, so penalty is 2 + 1 = 3.

If I split s = [1, 2, 3], t = [4, 5], p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total = 3.

Alternatively, s = [1, 3, 4], t = [2, 5], p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total = 3.

I can't seem to get a lower penalty than 3 in this case.

Looking at the second example:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

A possible split is s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3], with penalties 0 + 1 = 1.

Is there a way to get a lower penalty, like 0?

If I can split into two decreasing subsequences, the penalty would be 0.

Let's try:

s = [8, 3, 1], which is decreasing.

t = [2, 1, 3], which is not decreasing.

Wait, t has 2 > 1, but 1 < 3, so p(t) = 1.

Is there a better split?

s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3, 1, 7, 4, 3]. s is not decreasing because 8 > 2 > 1.

In t, 3 > 1, but 1 < 7, so p(t) = 1.

Another split: s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3], same as before.

Is there a way to have both s and t decreasing?

Let's try s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 3].

s is decreasing, t has 2 > 1 < 3, so p(t) = 1.

Alternatively, s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3, 1, 7, 4, 3].

s is decreasing, t has 3 > 1 < 7 > 4 < 3, so p(t) = 1 (from 1 < 7 and 4 < 3, but only count 1 < 7).

Wait, p(t) is the number of times t[i] < t[i+1], so in t = [3,1,7,4,3]:

1 < 7 and 4 < 3, but only 1 < 7 is increasing, so p(t) = 1.

Similarly, s = [8,2,1], no increasing pairs, p(s) = 0.

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Seems like the minimal penalty is 1.

Is there a way to get penalty 0? Let's see.

If I can split into two decreasing subsequences.

Try s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 3].

s is decreasing, t is not.

Alternatively, s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3, 1, 3].

s is decreasing, t is not.

Another split: s = [8, 1], t = [2, 3, 1, 7, 4, 3].

s is decreasing, p(s) = 0.

t has 2 < 3, 3 > 1, 1 < 7, 7 > 4 < 3, so p(t) = 2 (from 2 < 3 and 1 < 7).

Total penalty = 0 + 2 = 2, which is worse than 1.

So, the minimal penalty seems to be 1.

Looking at the third example:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

A possible split is s = [], t = [3,3,3,3,3].

Since all elements are equal, p(t) = 0 (no increasing pairs).

Total penalty = 0 + 0 = 0.

That's straightforward.

Fourth example:

n = 1

a = [1]

Split s = [1], t = [].

p(s) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Fifth example:

n = 2

a = [2,1]

Split s = [2], t = [1].

p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Alternatively, s = [2,1], t = [].

p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

Same total.

So, in this case, penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal penalty is achievable by splitting the array into two decreasing subsequences whenever possible, and if not, having some increasing pairs.

But how do I generalize this to any array?

I need an algorithm that can split the array into two subsequences, s and t, such that the sum of their penalties is minimized.

I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This sounds like I need to maximize the number of decreasing pairs in s and t.

Wait, but decreasing pairs don't contribute to the penalty, so I want as many decreasing pairs as possible.

But I can have some increasing pairs if necessary.

I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs across both s and t.

Another way to think about it is to maximize the number of decreasing pairs in both s and t.

But I need to find a way to assign each element to s or t such that the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

This seems similar to partitioning the array into two sequences where each sequence is as decreasing as possible.

I recall that the length of the longest decreasing subsequence can be found using dynamic programming.

But here, I need to partition the array into two decreasing subsequences.

Wait, but it's not necessarily that both s and t are decreasing; some elements might be in increasing order in s or t, contributing to the penalty.

I need to find a way to assign elements to s or t such that the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

Perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem where I keep track of the minimum penalty up to each position, considering assigning the current element to s or t.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define dp[i][0] as the minimum penalty for the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to s.

Similarly, dp[i][1] as the minimum penalty for the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to t.

Then, the final answer would be the minimum of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1].

But I need to define how to transition between states.

To compute dp[i][0], I need to consider all possible assignments of the previous elements and see how assigning the i-th element to s affects the penalty.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

I can iterate through the array and decide for each element whether to put it in s or t.

I need to keep track of the last elements in s and t to decide where to place the current element.

If I can place the current element in s without increasing the penalty, that would be good.

Similarly for t.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two sequences, s and t, and for each new element, decide which sequence to append it to, based on whether it decreases the penalty.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

At each step, assign the current element to the sequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

In other words, if assigning the current element to s increases the penalty by x, and to t by y, choose the one with the smaller increase.

But I need to define how assigning an element to a sequence affects the penalty.

Wait, if I assign the element to s, I need to see if it forms an increasing pair with the previous element in s.

If it does, then p(s) increases by 1.

Similarly for t.

So, for each element, I can calculate the penalty increase if assigned to s or to t, and choose the one with the smaller increase.

To implement this, I need to keep track of the last elements in s and t.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize s and t as empty lists.

Initialize penalty s and t as 0.

For each element in the array:

    If s is empty or a[-1] >= current, assign to s, penalty_s remains the same.

    Else, assign to s would increase penalty_s by 1.

    Similarly, if t is empty or t[-1] >= current, assign to t, penalty_t remains the same.

    Else, assign to t would increase penalty_t by 1.

    Choose to assign to the sequence where the penalty increase is smaller.

    If both would increase penalty, choose the one with smaller increase.

    If one would not increase penalty, choose that one.

    Update the sequences and penalties accordingly.

At the end, total penalty is penalty_s + penalty_t.

Let me test this approach with the first example.

n = 5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize s and t as empty, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0.

First element 1:

    Assign to s: s = [1], penalty_s = 0

    Assign to t: t = [1], penalty_t = 0

    Both same, choose s.

    s = [1], penalty_s = 0

Second element 2:

    Assign to s: s = [1,2], penalty_s = 1 (since 1 < 2)

    Assign to t: t = [2], penalty_t = 0

    Choose to assign to t, since penalty increase is 0.

    t = [2], penalty_t = 0

Third element 3:

    Assign to s: s = [1,2,3], penalty_s = 2

    Assign to t: t = [2,3], penalty_t = 1

    Choose to assign to t, penalty_t = 1

Fourth element 4:

    Assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4], penalty_s = 3

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,4], penalty_t = 2

    Choose to assign to t, penalty_t = 2

Fifth element 5:

    Assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4,5], penalty_s = 4

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,4,5], penalty_t = 3

    Choose to assign to t, penalty_t = 3

Total penalty = penalty_s + penalty_t = 0 + 3 = 3.

Which matches the example.

Let's try the second example.

n = 8

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s and t as empty, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0.

First element 8:

    Assign to s: s = [8], penalty_s = 0

    Assign to t: t = [8], penalty_t = 0

    Choose s.

    s = [8], penalty_s = 0

Second element 2:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2], penalty_s = 0 (since 8 > 2)

    Assign to t: t = [2], penalty_t = 0

    Both same, choose s.

    s = [8,2], penalty_s = 0

Third element 3:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,3], penalty_s = 1 (since 2 < 3)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3], penalty_t = 1

    Both increase penalty by 1, choose s or t.

    Choose t to spread elements.

    t = [2,3], penalty_t = 1

Fourth element 1:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,1], penalty_s = 0 (since 2 > 1)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,1], penalty_t = 1 (since 3 > 1)

    Choose s, since penalty increase is 0.

    s = [8,2,1], penalty_s = 0

Fifth element 1:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,1,1], penalty_s = 0 (since 1 >= 1)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,1,1], penalty_t = 1 (since 1 >= 1)

    Choose s, penalty_s = 0

Sixth element 7:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,1,1,7], penalty_s = 1 (since 1 < 7)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,1,1,7], penalty_t = 2 (since 1 < 7)

    Choose s, since penalty increase is 1.

    s = [8,2,1,1,7], penalty_s = 1

Seventh element 4:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,1,1,7,4], penalty_s = 2 (since 7 > 4)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,1,1,7,4], penalty_t = 2 (since 7 > 4)

    Choose s or t, both same.

    Choose t.

    t = [2,3,1,1,7,4], penalty_t = 2

Eighth element 3:

    Assign to s: s = [8,2,1,1,7,4,3], penalty_s = 3 (since 4 > 3)

    Assign to t: t = [2,3,1,1,7,4,3], penalty_t = 3 (since 4 > 3)

    Choose s or t, both same.

    Choose s.

    s = [8,2,1,1,7,4,3], penalty_s = 3

Total penalty = penalty_s + penalty_t = 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but in the example, the penalty is 1.

Hmm, seems like my approach didn't yield the minimal penalty.

What's wrong here?

In the example, they have s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3], with penalties 0 + 1 = 1.

But in my approach, I ended up with penalty_s = 3 and penalty_t = 2.

So, my approach isn't optimal.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I need to consider more carefully how to assign elements to s and t to minimize the total penalty.

Let me consider another approach.

I can think of this problem as assigning each element to s or t, and keeping track of the last assigned element to each sequence.

When assigning an element to a sequence, if it is greater than the previous element in that sequence, the penalty increases by 1.

Otherwise, it doesn't increase the penalty.

I need to minimize the total number of times an assigned element is greater than the previous one in its sequence.

This sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i][0] as the minimal penalty for assigning the first i elements where the i-th element is assigned to s.

Similarly, dp[i][1] as the minimal penalty for assigning the first i elements where the i-th element is assigned to t.

Then, the total minimal penalty would be the minimum of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1].

Now, I need to define the transitions.

For dp[i][0], the i-th element is assigned to s.

If s was empty before, or the last element in s is greater than or equal to a[i], then penalty doesn't increase for s.

Otherwise, if the last element in s is less than a[i], then penalty increases by 1 for s.

Similarly for dp[i][1] with t.

But I also need to consider the penalties accumulated from previous assignments.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the last elements in s and t.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to define dp[i][0] as the minimal total penalty for assigning the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to s, and dp[i][1] for assigned to t.

Then, dp[i][0] = min(

    dp[j][0] + (1 if s[j] < a[i] else 0), for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to s,

    dp[j][1] + (1 if t[j] < a[i] else 0), for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to t

)

Wait, this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to track the last elements of s and t.

Let me consider that I maintain the last elements of s and t.

Initialize s_last and t_last as -infinity.

Then, for each element, decide to assign it to s or t.

If assigned to s:

    if a[i] >= s_last:

        penalty_s += 0

    else:

        penalty_s += 1

    s_last = a[i]

Similarly for t.

But this seems similar to my initial greedy approach, which didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the last elements of s and t, and decide based on that.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step for the second example.

n = 8

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s_last = -inf, t_last = -inf

Initialize penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0

First element 8:

    Assign to s:

        8 > -inf, penalty_s += 0

        s_last = 8

    Assign to t:

        8 > -inf, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 8

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 8, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0

Second element 2:

    Assign to s:

        2 < 8, penalty_s += 1

        s_last = 2

    Assign to t:

        2 > -inf, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 2

    Choose to assign to t, since penalty_t increase is 0.

    t_last = 2, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0

Third element 3:

    Assign to s:

        3 > 2, penalty_s += 1

        s_last = 3

    Assign to t:

        3 > 2, penalty_t += 1

        t_last = 3

    Choose to assign to s, since both increase penalty by 1.

    s_last = 3, penalty_s = 1, penalty_t = 0

Fourth element 1:

    Assign to s:

        1 < 3, penalty_s += 0

        s_last = 1

    Assign to t:

        1 < 3, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 1

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 1, penalty_s = 1, penalty_t = 0

Fifth element 1:

    Assign to s:

        1 >= 1, penalty_s += 0

        s_last = 1

    Assign to t:

        1 >= 1, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 1

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 1, penalty_s = 1, penalty_t = 0

Sixth element 7:

    Assign to s:

        7 > 1, penalty_s += 1

        s_last = 7

    Assign to t:

        7 > 1, penalty_t += 1

        t_last = 7

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 7, penalty_s = 2, penalty_t = 0

Seventh element 4:

    Assign to s:

        4 < 7, penalty_s += 0

        s_last = 4

    Assign to t:

        4 < 7, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 4

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 4, penalty_s = 2, penalty_t = 0

Eighth element 3:

    Assign to s:

        3 < 4, penalty_s += 0

        s_last = 3

    Assign to t:

        3 < 4, penalty_t += 0

        t_last = 3

    Choose to assign to s.

    s_last = 3, penalty_s = 2, penalty_t = 0

Total penalty = penalty_s + penalty_t = 2 + 0 = 2.

But in the example, the penalty is 1.

So, my approach still didn't achieve the minimal penalty.

What's different here?

In the example, they have s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3], with penalties 0 + 1 = 1.

In my approach, I ended up with penalty_s = 2 and penalty_t = 0.

So, I need to find a way to achieve a lower total penalty.

Maybe I need to consider not just the last elements of s and t, but also the sequences themselves.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the entire sequences to correctly calculate the penalties.

But that's too inefficient for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the penalty is the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

So, I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both sequences.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of decreasing pairs or equal pairs in both sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning elements to s or t such that the total number of times an element is less than the next one in s and t is minimized.

This seems similar to partitioning the array into two sequences where each sequence has as few increasing pairs as possible.

Maybe I can use a priority queue or some other data structure to keep track of the last elements of s and t.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two separate decreasing subsequences using patience sorting or something similar.

I recall that the length of the longest decreasing subsequence can be found using a modified binary search.

Maybe I can use a similar approach to partition the array into two decreasing subsequences.

If I can partition the array into two decreasing subsequences, then the penalty would be zero.

If not, the minimal penalty would be the number of elements that cannot be placed into these two decreasing subsequences without creating increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of additional decreasing subsequences needed beyond two to cover the entire array.

But I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in the example, s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3], with penalties 0 + 1 = 1.

In s, it's decreasing, so no increasing pairs.

In t, 2 < 7 is the only increasing pair, so penalty is 1.

Is there a way to achieve a lower penalty?

If I try s = [8,2,1], t = [3,1,7,4,3], then s is decreasing (penalty 0), t has 3 > 1 < 7 > 4 < 3, so p(t) = 1 (from 1 < 7), total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Same as before.

Another split: s = [8,3,1,1,3], t = [2,7,4], s has 3 > 1 >= 1 < 3 (penalty 1), t has 2 < 7 > 4 (penalty 1), total penalty = 1 + 1 = 2, which is worse.

So, the minimal penalty seems to be 1.

Back to my initial approach, I got penalty 2, which is higher.

I need to adjust my approach to achieve a lower penalty.

Perhaps instead of choosing to assign the element to the sequence with the smallest penalty increase, I need to consider the potential future increases.

This sounds like a job for dynamic programming.

Let me try to define dp states more carefully.

Define dp[i][0] as the minimal total penalty for assigning the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to s.

Similarly, dp[i][1] for assigning to t.

Then, dp[i][0] = min(

    dp[j][0] + (1 if a[j] < a[i] else 0), for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to s,

    dp[j][1] + (1 if t[j] < a[i] else 0), for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to t

)

Wait, this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to track the last elements of s and t.

Let me try to keep track of the last elements of s and t.

Initialize s_last and t_last to -infinity.

Initialize penalty_s and penalty_t to 0.

For each element a[i]:

    Option 1: assign to s

        if a[i] > s_last:

            penalty_s += 1

        s_last = a[i]

        total_penalty_s = penalty_s + penalty_t

    Option 2: assign to t

        if a[i] > t_last:

            penalty_t += 1

        t_last = a[i]

        total_penalty_t = penalty_s + penalty_t

    Choose the option with the smaller total_penalty.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm not keeping track of the penalties correctly because penalty_s and penalty_t are shared between the two options.

I need to keep track of the penalties separately for each sequence.

Perhaps I need to maintain two variables, penalty_s and penalty_t, and update them based on the assignment.

But this seems too simplistic and doesn't account for the dependencies between the sequences.

I think I need to use dynamic programming to track the penalties for each possible assignment.

Let me try to define dp[i][0] as the minimal total penalty for assigning the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to s.

Similarly, dp[i][1] for assigning to t.

Then, dp[i][0] = min(

    dp[j][0] + (1 if a[j] < a[i] else 0) for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to s,

    dp[j][1] + (1 if t[j] < a[i] else 0) for j from 0 to i-1 where the j-th element is assigned to t

)

But this is too time-consuming for n up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is equivalent to the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

So, I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both sequences.

This is similar to maximizing the number of decreasing pairs.

I recall that the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to partition the array is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But here, I'm allowed to use only two subsequences.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence minus 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increasing subsequences minus the number of decreasing subsequences, but I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I can partition the array into two decreasing subsequences, the penalty would be zero.

If not, the minimal penalty would be the minimal number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided.

This seems similar to the problem of partitioning an array into a minimal number of decreasing subsequences.

In standard scheduling problems, the minimal number of machines needed is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But here, I'm allowed to use only two subsequences.

So, perhaps if the length of the longest increasing subsequence is greater than the number of subsequences (which is 2), then the minimal penalty is the length of the longest increasing subsequence minus the number of subsequences.

In this case, minimal_penalty = max(0, length_of_LIS - 2)

But in the first example, LIS is 5, so 5 - 2 = 3, which matches the example.

In the second example, LIS is 4 (e.g., 2,3,7,4), so 4 - 2 = 2, but the example has penalty 1.

Hmm, doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not exactly that.

Wait, in the second example, is the LIS really 4?

Looking at a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], possible LIS could be [2,3,7,4] or [2,3,4,3], both of length 4.

So, according to this formula, minimal_penalty = 4 - 2 = 2, but the example has penalty 1.

So, the formula is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Maybe the minimal penalty is equal to the total number of elements minus twice the size of the largest antichain or something, but this is getting too complicated.

I need a different approach.

Let me think about the problem in terms of minimizing the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

I can model this as a graph where each element is a node, and there is an edge from node i to node j if a[i] < a[j] and i < j.

Then, assigning elements to s and t corresponds to coloring the nodes with two colors, say red and blue.

The penalty would be the number of edges within the red subgraph plus the number of edges within the blue subgraph.

So, I need to minimize the sum of edges within each color.

This is similar to minimizing the number of monochromatic increasing edges.

This is a graph bipartition problem, which is NP-hard in general, but perhaps there is a smarter way to approach it given the specific structure of the problem.

Given time constraints, I need to find an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider that for each element, I need to decide whether to assign it to s or t, based on the previous assignments.

I can keep track of the last elements of s and t, and assign the current element to the sequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

To implement this efficiently, I can maintain two lists or arrays for s and t, and keep track of the last elements.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me consider maintaining two decreasing sequences using patience sorting.

Patience sorting can find the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

In standard patience sorting, you use a list of piles, where each pile is a decreasing subsequence.

To assign a new element, you find the leftmost pile where the top element is greater than or equal to the new element, and place it there.

The number of piles is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But here, I'm allowed to use only two subsequences.

So, I can try to assign elements to s or t, maintaining that both are decreasing.

If I can assign the element to one of them without violating the decreasing property, I do so.

If not, I have to assign it to the sequence where the penalty increase is minimal.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach similar to patience sorting with two piles.

Initialize s and t as empty.

For each element a[i]:

    if a[i] <= s[-1] or a[i] <= t[-1]:

        assign it to the sequence where the last element is smallest among s and t.

    else:

        assign it to the sequence where the last element is smallest among s and t, and increase the penalty accordingly.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can always assign the element to the sequence where the last element is greater than or equal to the current element, and if both sequences have last elements smaller than the current element, choose the one with the smallest last element.

Wait, no.

Let me try to implement this logic for the second example.

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 8:

    Both s and t are empty, so assign to s.

    s = [8], penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0

Second element 2:

    s[-1] = 8 > 2, can assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    Assign to s.

    s = [8,2], penalty_s = 0

Third element 3:

    s[-1] = 2 < 3, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s by 1.

    t is empty, so assign to t.

    t = [3], penalty_t = 0

Fourth element 1:

    s[-1] = 2 > 1, can assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    Assign to s.

    s = [8,2,1], penalty_s = 0

Fifth element 1:

    s[-1] = 1 >= 1, can assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    Assign to s.

    s = [8,2,1,1], penalty_s = 0

Sixth element 7:

    s[-1] = 1 < 7, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s by 1.

    t[-1] = 3 < 7, cannot assign to t without increasing penalty_t by 1.

    Choose to assign to the sequence with the smallest last element, which is s.

    Assign to s.

    s = [8,2,1,1,7], penalty_s = 1

Seventh element 4:

    s[-1] = 7 > 4, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s by 1.

    t[-1] = 3 < 4, cannot assign to t without increasing penalty_t by 1.

    Choose to assign to t, since t[-1] = 3 < s[-1] = 7.

    Assign to t.

    t = [3,4], penalty_t = 1

Eighth element 3:

    s[-1] = 7 > 3, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s by 1.

    t[-1] = 4 > 3, can assign to t without increasing penalty_t.

    Assign to t.

    t = [3,4,3], penalty_t = 1 (since 4 > 3, no increase)

Total penalty = penalty_s + penalty_t = 1 + 1 = 2.

But in the example, the penalty is 1.

So, my approach still didn't achieve the minimal penalty.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to prioritize assigning elements to the sequence that has the smallest possible last element.

Wait, in the example, s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3], with penalties 0 + 1 = 1.

In this assignment:

- s is decreasing: 8 > 3 > 1, penalty_s = 0

- t has 2 < 1 (penalty), but 1 < 7 (penalty), but in their example, penalty_t = 1.

Wait, in t = [2,1,7,4,3], p(t) is the number of times t[i] < t[i+1].

So, t[0] = 2 < 1? No, 2 > 1, no penalty.

t[1] = 1 < 7, penalty +=1.

t[2] = 7 > 4, no penalty.

t[3] = 4 < 3, no penalty.

So, p(t) = 1.

Similarly, s is decreasing, p(s) = 0.

Total penalty = 1.

So, in my previous approach, I ended up with penalty_s =1 and penalty_t=1, total penalty=2.

I need to find a way to achieve penalty_s=0 and penalty_t=1.

Perhaps I need to prioritize assigning elements to the sequence that allows maintaining the decreasing property without increasing the penalty.

Let me try to adjust my approach.

Initialize s and t as empty, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0.

For each element a[i]:

    if a[i] <= s[-1]:

        assign to s, penalty_s += 0

    elif a[i] <= t[-1]:

        assign to t, penalty_t += 0

    else:

        assign to the sequence with the smallest last element, and increase its penalty by 1.

Let's apply this to the second example.

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s and t as empty, penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0.

First element 8:

    Both s and t are empty, so assign to s.

    s = [8], penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0

Second element 2:

    s[-1] = 8 > 2, assign to s, penalty_s += 0

    s = [8,2], penalty_s = 0

Third element 3:

    s[-1] = 2 < 3, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    t is empty, so assign to t, penalty_t += 0

    t = [3], penalty_t = 0

Fourth element 1:

    s[-1] = 2 > 1, assign to s, penalty_s += 0

    s = [8,2,1], penalty_s = 0

Fifth element 1:

    s[-1] = 1 >= 1, assign to s, penalty_s += 0

    s = [8,2,1,1], penalty_s = 0

Sixth element 7:

    s[-1] = 1 < 7, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    t[-1] = 3 < 7, cannot assign to t without increasing penalty_t.

    Choose to assign to s, since s[-1] = 1 < t[-1] = 3.

    Assign to s, penalty_s +=1

    s = [8,2,1,1,7], penalty_s =1

Seventh element 4:

    s[-1] =7 >4, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    t[-1] =3 <4, cannot assign to t without increasing penalty_t.

    Choose to assign to t, since t[-1] =3 < s[-1]=7.

    Assign to t, penalty_t +=1

    t = [3,4], penalty_t =1

Eighth element 3:

    s[-1]=7 >3, cannot assign to s without increasing penalty_s.

    t[-1]=4 >3, assign to t, penalty_t +=0

    t = [3,4,3], penalty_t =1

Total penalty = penalty_s + penalty_t =1 +1=2.

Still not matching
