Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is simply the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. In a grid, it's the distance you'd travel if you can only move horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. So, for example, in a 2x2 grid, the Manhattan distances between all pairs of cells are:

- (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1

- (1,1) and (2,1): |1-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,2) and (2,1): |1-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,2) and (2,2): |1-2| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1

- (2,1) and (2,2): |2-2| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1

So, in this case, the distinct distances are 1 and 2, making the size of H equal to 2.

The problem gives some examples for n=2 to n=6, but I need to find a general approach that works for any n between 2 and 10^3, and for multiple test cases up to 50.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For n=2: points are (1,1) and (1,2), giving H={0,1}

- For n=3: points are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), giving H={0,1,2,3}

- For n=4: points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), giving some H set

- For n=5 and n=6, similar sets are given.

Wait a minute, in the first example for n=2, the output shows two points: (1,1) and (1,2). But according to the problem, we need to choose n cells, which for n=2 should be 2 cells. That makes sense.

But in the first example, the set H is given as {0,1}, which includes the distance between a cell and itself (0). Is that intended? Probably, since the problem says "any pair of cells," which could include the distance from a cell to itself.

But in the first example, it shows H={0,1}, but actually, there are two distances: between (1,1) and (1,2), which is 1, and the distance from each cell to itself, which is 0. So, H={0,1}, which matches.

Okay, so I need to maximize the number of distinct distances, including zero.

Now, thinking about how to approach this: I need to choose n points in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct pairwise Manhattan distances is maximized.

One way to think about this is to spread the points as much as possible to get a variety of distances.

But, in the examples provided, it seems like choosing points along the diagonal or along a straight line gives a certain number of distinct distances.

Wait, in the first example for n=2, choosing (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances 0 and 1.

In the second example for n=3, choosing (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) gives distances 0,1,2,3.

Wait, let's calculate that:

- Distance between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Distance between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Distance between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- And distances from each point to itself: 0

So, H={0,1,2,3}, which is four distinct distances.

Is that the maximum possible for n=3?

Well, in a 3x3 grid, there are only a few possible Manhattan distances: 0,1,2,3.

Wait, let's see: the maximum possible Manhattan distance in a 3x3 grid is from (1,1) to (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.

Wait, is that possible? Let's see: in a 3x3 grid, the coordinates range from 1 to 3 for both x and y.

So, the maximum Manhattan distance would be between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.

Wait, but in the example for n=3, they have H={0,1,2,3}. Is 4 achievable?

Wait, in the chosen points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1):

- (2,1) to (2,3): 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, no 4 in there. Is it possible to get 4 with n=3? Maybe not, since n=3 is small.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the maximum Manhattan distance. Let's see:

In a n x n grid, with coordinates from 1 to n for both x and y.

The maximum possible Manhattan distance would be between (1,1) and (n,n): |1-n| + |1-n| = 2*(n-1).

But in n=3, that would be 2*(3-1) = 4, which matches my earlier calculation.

But in the example for n=3, they have H={0,1,2,3}, but not 4. Is that the best possible?

Wait, maybe in their choice, 4 is not achievable because no pair has a distance of 4.

But in a 3x3 grid, is there a pair with distance 4? Only between corners like (1,1) and (3,3).

But in their selection, they chose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), and the distance between (2,1) and (2,3) is 2, between (2,1) and (3,1) is 1, between (2,3) and (3,1) is 3.

So, 4 is not included in H for their selection.

Is it possible to include 4 in H for n=3?

If I choose points (1,1), (3,3), and maybe another point.

Wait, but I need exactly n points, which is 3 for n=3.

So, if I choose (1,1), (3,3), and another point, say (2,2).

Then, distances would be:

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (1,1) to (2,2): 2

- (3,3) to (2,2): 2

- (1,1) to itself: 0

- (3,3) to itself: 0

- (2,2) to itself: 0

So, H={0,2,4}, which has three distinct distances.

But in the original example, their selection gives H={0,1,2,3}, which has four distinct distances.

So, their selection is better because it includes more distinct distances, even though the maximum distance is 3 instead of 4.

So, perhaps maximizing the number of distinct distances is more important than including the maximum possible distance.

Hence, their selection is better.

So, my goal is to select n points such that the number of distinct pairwise Manhattan distances is maximized.

Now, for n=2, H has 2 distinct distances: 0 and 1.

For n=3, H has 4 distinct distances: 0,1,2,3.

For n=4, from the example, points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), which should give H={0,1,2,3,4,5}.

Wait, let's calculate:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,1) to (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,3) to (4,3): 3

- (1,3) to (4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,3) to (4,4): 1

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is seven distinct distances.

But in their example for n=4, they have four points, and H has seven distinct distances.

Wait, but n=4, so n points, and H has n + something.

Wait, for n=2, H has 2 elements; n=3, H has 4 elements; n=4, H has 7 elements.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, 2,4,7,... not sure.

Wait, for n=2: 2 points, H has 2 distinct distances.

For n=3: 3 points, H has 4 distinct distances.

For n=4: 4 points, H has 7 distinct distances.

Is there a formula for the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n points in an n x n grid?

I'm not sure, but perhaps I can look for a way to select points that are spread out in such a way that their pairwise distances are as distinct as possible.

One idea is to place the points along a diagonal, but in the examples, they are not always on the diagonal.

Wait, for n=2: (1,1) and (1,2), which are in the same row.

For n=3: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

For n=4: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

It seems like they are trying to cover different rows and columns to get a variety of distances.

Another idea is to place points in a way that minimizes overlaps in distances.

But perhaps there's a better systematic approach.

Let me consider small n and see what's possible.

For n=2:

Possible points: (1,1), (1,2)

Distances: 0,1

Alternatively, (1,1), (2,2): distances 0,2

Alternatively, (1,1), (2,1): distances 0,1

So, H has size 2 in all cases.

So, for n=2, H can have at most 2 distinct distances.

For n=3:

Let's try to choose 3 points to maximize distinct distances.

Option 1: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (2,2): 2

- (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- (2,2) to (3,3): 2

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, H={0,2,4}, which has three distinct distances.

But in the example, they have four distinct distances with a different selection.

So, their selection is better.

Option 2: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (3,1): 2

- (1,3) to (3,1): 4

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, H={0,2,4}, same as above.

Wait, but in their example for n=3, they have H={0,1,2,3}, which is better.

So, how did they achieve that?

Looking back at their n=3 example: points are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- (2,1) to (2,3): 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): 3

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, H={0,1,2,3}, which is four distinct distances.

That's better than my previous selections.

So, perhaps choosing points in a line isn't the best approach.

Maybe mixing rows and columns can give more distinct distances.

For n=4, in their example, points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (4,3): 5

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,3) to (4,3): 3

- (1,3) to (4,4): 4

- (4,3) to (4,4): 1

- And 0 for each point to itself.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is seven distinct distances.

That seems optimal for n=4.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Looking at n=2 to n=4:

- n=2: H has 2 elements

- n=3: H has 4 elements

- n=4: H has 7 elements

Is there a formula for the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances?

I'm not sure, but perhaps it's related to the number of possible distinct sums of |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Given that x and y range from 1 to n, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 to 2*(n-1).

But not all sums in between are necessarily achievable, depending on the chosen points.

So, to maximize the number of distinct distances, I need to choose points such that their pairwise Manhattan distances cover as many values as possible in the range from 0 to 2*(n-1).

One way to approach this is to select points that are spread out in both rows and columns.

Looking back at their selections:

- n=2: (1,1), (1,2)

- n=3: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- n=4: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

It seems like they are choosing points that cover different rows and columns.

Perhaps a good strategy is to select points where the x-coordinates and y-coordinates are as spread out as possible.

Wait, for n=2, they chose both points in the first row, but for n=3 and n=4, they chose points in different rows.

Maybe choosing points in a staircase pattern could help.

Alternatively, maybe choosing points along a diagonal or anti-diagonal.

But in the examples, they are not strictly choosing points along a diagonal.

Wait, perhaps choosing points such that no two points share the same x or y coordinate, like placing them on a permutation of rows and columns.

But in their n=3 example, (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), two points share the same x-coordinate (2,1) and (2,3).

So, that doesn't fit the permutation idea.

Alternatively, maybe choosing points where the differences in x and y coordinates are distinct.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a general pattern or formula to maximize the number of distinct distances.

Alternatively, maybe there's a known mathematical result for this.

After some research, I find that in an n x n grid, the number of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of points is related to the number of distinct sums of absolute differences in their coordinates.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of distinct distances is equal to the number of integers from 0 to 2*(n-1), inclusive, that can be expressed as the sum of two absolute differences in coordinates.

But in practice, not all sums may be achievable depending on the chosen points.

So, to maximize the number of distinct distances, I need to choose points such that their pairwise Manhattan distances cover as many of these possible sums as possible.

One strategy could be to place points in such a way that their x-coordinates and y-coordinates are as spread out as possible.

Wait, perhaps choosing points where x + y is distinct for each point.

But in an n x n grid, x + y can range from 2 to 2n.

But with n points, it's possible to choose points where x + y are all distinct.

For example, for n=2:

- (1,1): x + y = 2

- (2,2): x + y = 4

This gives H={0,2}

But in their example, they have H={0,1}, which has the same size.

Not sure if this is better.

Wait, in n=3:

- (1,1): x + y = 2

- (2,2): x + y = 4

- (3,3): x + y = 6

H={0,2,4}

But in their selection, H={0,1,2,3}, which is better.

So, choosing points with distinct x + y doesn't necessarily maximize the number of distinct distances.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points where x - y is distinct.

But x - y can be negative, so it might not be directly applicable.

Wait, in n=3, their selection is (2,1), (2,3), (3,1):

- x - y: 2-1=1, 2-3=-1, 3-1=2

So, distinct x - y values.

But the Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|, which is different from just x - y.

So, not sure if that helps directly.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Another approach is to fix one point and choose the other points such that their distances to this fixed point are all distinct.

But in reality, with the Manhattan distance, it's challenging to ensure that all pairwise distances are distinct.

Because, for example, in a grid, multiple pairs can have the same distance.

Wait, in their n=4 example, points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4):

Looking at distances from (1,1):

- to (1,3): 2

- to (4,3): 5

- to (4,4): 6

From (1,3):

- to (4,3): 3

- to (4,4): 4

From (4,3):

- to (4,4): 1

Plus the zeros for each point to itself.

So, all pairwise distances are distinct: 1,2,3,4,5,6,0.

That's seven distinct distances.

Is that the maximum possible for n=4?

Probably, since there are n=4 points, and the possible distances range from 0 to 6.

So, H has seven elements, which seems optimal.

So, perhaps for general n, choosing points in a way that their pairwise Manhattan distances are all distinct, including zero.

But for larger n, this might not be possible, as the number of possible distinct distances is limited by the grid size.

Wait, for n=1000, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is 2*(n-1) = 1998.

The number of distinct distances possible is 2*n -1, since the possible distances are 0,1,2,...,2*(n-1).

But with n points, the number of pairwise distances is C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2, but we are interested in the number of distinct distances, not the total number of distances.

So, in general, the number of distinct Manhattan distances in an n x n grid is at most 2*n -1.

But with only n points, we can't achieve all 2*n -1 distances, because with n points, there are only C(n,2) + n = n*(n+1)/2 distances including distances to themselves.

But for small n, we can achieve a number of distinct distances up to 2*n -1, but for larger n, it might not be possible with only n points.

Wait, in the n=2 case, 2*n -1 = 3, but H has 2 elements.

In n=3, 2*3 -1 =5, but H has 4 elements.

In n=4, 2*4 -1=7, which matches the number of distinct distances in their example.

So, perhaps for n=4, it's possible to achieve 7 distinct distances, which is 2*n -1.

Wait, 2*n -1 for n=4 is 7, which matches their example.

For n=3, 2*3 -1=5, but in their example, H has 4 elements.

So, maybe for some n, it's possible to achieve 2*n -1 distinct distances, but for others, it's less.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of distinct distances for any n.

Looking for a general approach, perhaps placing points in a way that their x and y coordinates are as spread out as possible.

One idea is to place points along the main diagonal: (1,1), (2,2), ...,(n,n).

In this case, the pairwise Manhattan distances are:

For points (i,i) and (j,j), the distance is |i - j| + |i - j| = 2*|i - j|.

So, the distances are 0, 2, 4, ..., up to 2*(n-1).

So, H={0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1)}, which has n distinct distances.

But in the n=3 example, their selection gives H with 4 elements, which is more than n=3.

So, placing points on the diagonal gives H with n elements, but in some cases, we can get more than n distinct distances.

Hence, placing points on the diagonal may not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps placing points in a way that x and y coordinates are different for each point.

Wait, in their n=3 example: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Here, x coordinates are 2,2,3 and y coordinates are 1,3,1.

So, x coordinates are not all unique.

Similarly, in n=4 example: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

x coordinates: 1,1,4,4; y coordinates:1,3,3,4

Again, not unique.

So, uniqueness of coordinates isn't necessary.

Perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me consider the maximum number of distinct distances possible in an n x n grid with n points.

The maximum number of distinct distances is limited by the number of possible distinct Manhattan distances in the grid, which is 2*n -1 (from 0 to 2*(n-1)).

But with only n points, the number of pairwise distances is C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2, plus n distances of zero.

So, the number of distinct distances can be up to min(2*n -1, n*(n+1)/2).

But for larger n, n*(n+1)/2 can be larger than 2*n -1, but in practice, the number of distinct Manhattan distances is limited by the grid structure.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of distinct distances is 2*n -1, and with n points, it's possible to achieve that.

Looking back at the examples:

- n=2: 2*n -1=3, but H has 2 elements

- n=3: 2*3 -1=5, H has 4 elements

- n=4: 2*4 -1=7, H has 7 elements

- n=5: presumably H has 9 elements

- n=6: H has 11 elements

So, perhaps for n >=4, H has 2*n -1 elements.

But for n=3, it's 4, which is less than 2*3 -1=5.

Maybe for n >= some value, H has 2*n -1 elements.

Alternatively, perhaps H has C(n,2) +n distinct distances, but limited by the possible distances in the grid.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a general pattern in the way points are selected.

Looking back at the examples:

- n=2: (1,1), (1,2)

- n=3: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- n=4: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

- n=5: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

- n=6: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

It seems like in these selections, points are chosen in a way that they are spread out in both rows and columns, often reusing certain rows or columns.

Wait, for n=2, rows 1; columns 1 and 2.

For n=3: rows 2 and 3; columns 1 and 3.

For n=4: rows 1 and 4; columns 1,3,4.

For n=5: rows 1,2,5; columns 1,3,4,5,6.

For n=6: rows 1,5,6; columns 1,2,4,5,6.

So, perhaps a general strategy is to choose points in a subset of rows and columns, ensuring that the pairwise distances are as diverse as possible.

But I need a systematic way to choose these points for any n.

Another idea: fix one row and choose multiple columns in that row, and then choose additional points in other rows with different columns.

But in the n=4 example, they chose points in rows 1 and 4, with columns 1,3,4.

This seems to cover a range of column differences.

Similarly, in n=5, rows 1,2,5 with columns 1,3,4,5,6.

Wait, in n=5, row 1 has columns 1,3,4; row 2 has column 1; row 5 has columns 5,6.

This seems to spread out the columns across different rows.

Perhaps the idea is to choose points such that the differences in both x and y coordinates are varied.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Choose points in such a way that for each point, its x-coordinate and y-coordinate are as different as possible from the other points.

- Try to maximize the variety of |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| values.

But this is still vague.

Maybe I can try to cover as many possible distances as possible by choosing points that can generate those distances.

Wait, perhaps choosing points where one coordinate is fixed, and the other varies.

For example, choose all points in one row or one column, but in the n=3 example, choosing all points in row 2: (2,1), (2,3), and then add (3,1).

This gives H={0,1,2,3}, which is better than choosing all points in one row.

Similarly, in n=4, choosing points in rows 1 and 4, with varying columns.

So, perhaps a good strategy is to choose points in a small number of rows, spreading out the columns.

Wait, for n=3, they chose points in rows 2 and 3, with columns 1 and 3.

For n=4, rows 1 and 4, columns 1,3,4.

For n=5, rows 1,2,5, columns 1,3,4,5,6.

This seems like choosing points in roughly half the rows, and spreading the columns as much as possible.

But for n=2, they chose points in one row.

So, perhaps for even n, choose points in roughly n/2 rows, and for odd n, choose points in (n+1)/2 rows.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe choose points in a "staircase" pattern, where each point is in a different row and column.

Wait, but in their examples, points are not all in different rows and columns.

For example, in n=4, rows 1 and 4 have multiple points.

So, that approach doesn't hold.

Another idea: choose points along the main diagonal and some off-diagonal points.

But in their examples, points are not strictly on the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps choosing points where x + y is distinct.

But in n=3, their selection has:

(2,1): x+y=3

(2,3): x+y=5

(3,1): x+y=4

So, x+y are distinct: 3,4,5.

Similarly, in n=4:

(1,1):2

(1,3):4

(4,3):7

(4,4):8

So, x+y are 2,4,7,8, which are distinct.

Wait, in n=2:

(1,1):2

(1,2):3

So, x+y=2 and 3, distinct.

In n=3: 3,4,5

In n=4:2,4,7,8

Wait, in n=4, x+y are 2,4,7,8, which are distinct.

Is this a general strategy? To choose points where x+y are distinct?

If so, then for n=5, choose points with x+y=2,3,4,5,6, but in their example, points have x+y=2,4,5,6,7,8.

Wait, but n=5 has only 5 points, so x+y from 2 to n+1=6.

Wait, n=5: points are (1,1),(1,3),(1,4),(2,1),(5,5)

x+y: 2,4,5,3,10

So, x+y:2,3,4,5,10, which are distinct except for possibly overlapping values.

But in n=4, x+y were 2,4,7,8, which are distinct.

In n=3, x+y=3,4,5, distinct.

In n=2, x+y=2,3, distinct.

So, perhaps choosing points where x+y are distinct can help maximize the number of distinct distances.

Because if x1 + y1 != x2 + y2, then |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this directly leads to distinct distances.

Wait, the Manhattan distance |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| is equal to |(x1 + y1) - (x2 + y2)| if x1 >= x2 and y1 >= y2, but not in general.

So, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps considering x - y and x + y separately.

Wait, x - y and x + y are two independent variables in a sense.

Maybe choosing points where both x - y and x + y are distinct.

But that might be too restrictive.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points where x - y is distinct.

In n=3, their selection has x - y: 2-1=1, 2-3=-1, 3-1=2.

So, distinct x - y values.

Similarly, in n=4:1-1=0,1-3=-2,4-3=1,4-4=0.

Wait, not all distinct.

Wait, in n=4, x - y:0,-2,1,0.

So, not distinct.

Hence, this approach doesn't hold.

Perhaps another angle: think about the possible Manhattan distances and see how to cover as many as possible with n points.

Given that, perhaps choose points that can generate as many distinct sums of |x差异| and |y差异| as possible.

But this seems too vague.

Looking back at the examples, perhaps there's a pattern in the way rows and columns are selected.

For n=2: row 1, columns 1 and 2.

For n=3: rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

For n=4: rows 1 and 4, columns 1,3,4.

For n=5: rows 1,2,5, columns 1,3,4,5,6.

For n=6: rows 1,5,6, columns 1,2,4,5,6.

So, it seems like for larger n, more rows are selected, but not all rows.

Perhaps choosing points in the first and last few rows, and spreading columns.

But this is still not a concrete strategy.

Maybe I need to accept that finding the optimal selection is complex and look for a heuristic that works well.

One such heuristic could be:

- Choose points in the first row: (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,k)

- Then, choose points in the last row: (n, n-k+1), ..., (n,n)

- Adjust k based on n.

But in the examples, it's not exactly following this pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps choose points in a "staircase" pattern, where each point is in a different row and column.

Wait, but in their selections, some rows have multiple points.

So, that approach may not work.

Another idea: choose points where x coordinates are as spread out as possible, and y coordinates are also spread out.

For example, for n=4, choose points in rows 1 and 4, with columns 1,3,4.

This covers the top and bottom rows, and spreads columns.

Similarly, for n=5, choose points in rows 1,2,5, with columns 1,3,4,5,6.

Again, choosing points in the first few and last few rows, and spreading columns.

Perhaps a general strategy is:

- Choose points in the first ceil(n/2) rows and the last ceil(n/2) rows, ensuring that columns are spread out.

But this needs refinement.

Alternatively, perhaps choose points in rows from 1 to ceil(n/2), and columns from 1 to ceil(n/2), but adjust for n.

But I'm not sure.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should settle for a suboptimal but simple strategy.

One straightforward approach is to choose all points in a single row, say row 1: (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n).

In this case, the pairwise Manhattan distances are:

- For points (1,i) and (1,j): |i - j|

So, H={0,1,2,...,n-1}, which has n distinct distances.

But in the n=3 example, their selection gives H with 4 elements, which is better than n=3.

So, choosing all points in one row gives H with n elements, but in some cases, we can get more than n elements.

Hence, this approach may not be optimal.

Alternatively, choose points in two rows: row 1 and row n.

For example, for n=4: (1,1), (1,2), (4,3), (4,4)

Wait, in their n=4 example, they chose (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Which gives H with 7 elements, which is better than n=4.

So, choosing points in multiple rows can give more distinct distances.

Hence, choosing all points in one row isn't optimal.

Another approach: choose points in a "diagonal band," i.e., points where x + y is in a certain range.

But I'm not sure.

Given the complexity, perhaps I should accept that finding the optimal selection is non-trivial and look for a strategy that works reasonably well.

One such strategy is to choose points in the first row and the last row, selecting columns that are spread out.

For example, for n=4:

- Choose (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Which matches their n=4 example.

For n=3:

- Choose (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)

Which would give H={0,2,4}, but in their example, they have H={0,1,2,3} with points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

So, their selection is better.

Wait, perhaps choosing points in the middle row can help achieve more distinct distances.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points in rows that are spread out, like rows 1 and n, and possibly some middle rows.

But this is getting too vague.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should settle for choosing points in the first row and last row, selecting columns that are spread out.

Hence, for general n, I can choose:

- Points in row 1: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), ..., up to n

- Points in row n: (n,2), (n,4), (n,6), ..., up to n

But need to ensure that the total number of points is n.

Wait, for n even, say n=4:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3)

- Row 4: (4,2), (4,4)

Which matches their n=4 example, sort of, but not exactly.

In their n=4 example, they chose (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Which is similar to my proposed strategy.

For n=5:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)

- Row 5: (5,2), (5,4)

But that's only 5 points, which matches their selection.

Wait, in their n=5 example, points are: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Which is different from my proposed strategy.

So, perhaps my strategy isn't aligning perfectly.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points in row 1 and row n, and possibly one middle row, can cover more distances.

But this is still not systematic.

Given that, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the possible Manhattan distances are integers from 0 to 2*(n-1).

So, there are 2*n -1 possible distinct distances.

With n points, the number of pairwise distances is C(n,2) + n = n*(n+1)/2.

But for n >=3, n*(n+1)/2 >= 2*n -1.

So, for n=3: 6 >=5

n=4:10 >=7

n=5:15 >=9

Hence, with n points, it's possible to achieve up to 2*n -1 distinct distances, but not necessarily more.

Hence, perhaps the maximum number of distinct distances is 2*n -1 for n >=2.

Looking back at the examples:

- n=2: H has 2 elements, which is less than 2*2 -1=3

- n=3: H has 4 elements, less than 5

- n=4: H has 7 elements, equal to 2*4 -1=7

- n=5: presumably H has 9 elements, equal to 2*5 -1=9

- n=6: H has 11 elements, equal to 2*6 -1=11

So, perhaps for n >=4, H can achieve 2*n -1 distinct distances.

For n=2 and n=3, it's not possible.

Hence, perhaps the maximum number of distinct distances is min(C(n,2) +n, 2*n -1).

Wait, no, for n=2, C(2,2)+2=1+2=3, but H has 2 elements.

Wait, perhaps it's min(C(n,2) +n, 2*n -1, something else).

This is getting too convoluted.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that finding the optimal selection is complex and focus on implementing a strategy that works reasonably well.

One such strategy is to choose points in the first row and the last row, selecting columns that are spread out.

Hence, for general n, I can choose:

- Points in row 1: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), ..., up to n

- Points in row n: (n,2), (n,4), (n,6), ..., up to n

Adjusting to ensure that the total number of points is n.

But need to handle both even and odd n.

Wait, for n=4:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3)

- Row 4: (4,2), (4,4)

Which matches their n=4 example, sort of, but in their example, they chose (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Which is similar but not exactly the same.

Still, it's close.

For n=5:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)

- Row 5: (5,2), (5,4)

But in their n=5 example, points are (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Which is different.

So, perhaps this strategy isn't perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points in row 1 and row n, and if n is odd, adding a point in the middle row.

But this is speculative.

Given that, perhaps I should stick with choosing points in row 1 and row n, selecting columns in a way that maximizes the variety of distances.

Hence, for implementation, I can do the following:

- For row 1, choose columns 1,3,5,... up to n

- For row n, choose columns 2,4,6,... up to n

- If n is odd, maybe add an additional point in row n or adjust accordingly.

But need to ensure that the total number of points is exactly n.

For example, for n=4:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3)

- Row 4: (4,2), (4,4)

Total 4 points.

For n=5:

- Row 1: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)

- Row 5: (5,2), (5,4)

Total 5 points.

This matches the n=5 example, except for the additional point (2,1) in their selection.

But perhaps this is sufficient.

Hence, a possible strategy is:

- For row 1, choose columns from 1 to n with step 2: 1,3,5,...

- For row n, choose columns from 2 to n with step 2:
