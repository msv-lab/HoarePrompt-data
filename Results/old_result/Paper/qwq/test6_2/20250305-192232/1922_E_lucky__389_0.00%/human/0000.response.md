Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with length at most 200, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. Each test case has its own X, and there can be up to 1000 test cases.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the description, it's a sequence of numbers from the array that are in strictly increasing order, and the positions in the array are maintained. For example, in the array [1, 3, 2], the increasing subsequences are [], [1], [3], [2], [1,3], and [1,2]. So, there are 6 increasing subsequences.

Wait, but according to the note, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing. So, including the empty one, there are 6 in this case.

Now, the problem allows arrays of length up to 200, which is manageable, but X can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number. So, I need to find a way to construct arrays that can achieve such large counts of increasing subsequences.

I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated. For a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be found by considering all possible subsets of the array and counting those that are strictly increasing.

But generating all subsets is not feasible for large arrays due to the exponential time complexity. So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations or something similar, since X can be up to 10^18, which is 60 bits.

Wait, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is less than 10^18, but 2^63 is over 10^18. But X can be up to 10^18, so I need to handle at least 60 bits.

But in the problem, it's mentioned that X can be up to 10^18, and the array can have at most 200 elements. So, I need to find a way to represent X in terms of increasing subsequences.

One idea is to use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the sum of combinations or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences adds up to X.

I recall that for a sequence of unique strictly increasing numbers, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the sequence, including the empty subsequence.

But in this problem, the array can have duplicates, and the subsequences must be strictly increasing, meaning that even if there are duplicates, as long as their positions are different, they are considered different subsequences.

Looking back at the example in the problem:

Input:

4

2

5

13

37

Output:

1

0

3

0 1 0

5

2 2 3 4 2

7

-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

So, for X=2, the array is [0], which has subsequences: [] and [0].

For X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0], [0,1], [0,0], [1,0]. Wait, but [0,0] is not strictly increasing, so it shouldn't be counted. Similarly, [1,0] is decreasing. So, the valid increasing subsequences are: [], [0], [1], [0], [0,1]. That's 5 subsequences.

Similarly, for X=13, the array is [2,2,3,4,2], and for X=37, it's [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1].

I need to find a general way to construct such arrays for any given X in the range.

Let me think about binary representation. Since X can be up to 10^18, which is manageable in terms of bits.

If I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, then maybe I can construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but 2^n gives the total number of subsets, including all possible increasing subsequences.

But in this problem, it's more nuanced because of the strictly increasing condition and the possibility of duplicates.

Perhaps I can think of building the array in levels, where each level corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

Wait, maybe I need to look into the properties of the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me consider a simple case. If the array is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3], then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^3 = 8, including the empty one.

But if there are duplicates, like [1,1,2], then the number is more than 2^3 because different positions can form different subsequences.

Wait, no. For [1,1,2], the increasing subsequences are:

[]

[1]

[1]

[1,1]

[1,2]

[1,2]

But [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so it shouldn't be counted. So, valid increasing subsequences are:

[]

[1]

[1]

[1,2]

[1,2]

So, total of 5.

Wait, that matches the earlier example where X=5.

So, for [0,1,0], the increasing subsequences are:

[]

[0]

[1]

[0]

[0,1]

Total of 5.

Similarly, for [1,1,2], it's also 5.

So, seems like duplicates are handled by considering their positions.

Now, I need a way to construct arrays that can achieve any X by combining such sequences.

Perhaps I can use the binary representation of X and construct parts of the array that contribute specific amounts to the total count.

Let me consider that each element in the array can potentially start new increasing subsequences.

If I have a sequence where each element is larger than the previous, it contributes to more increasing subsequences.

But managing duplicates and their positions is tricky.

Another idea: perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum over all possible lengths, from 0 to n, of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of that length.

But calculating this directly is not efficient for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at index i.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum over j < i and a[j] < a[i] of dp[j].

But this is for subsequences ending at i.

But I need the total number of increasing subsequences, which is the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

But this seems too time-consuming for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the minimal array size needed to achieve a given X.

Since n is at most 200, and X can be up to 10^18, I need to maximize the number of increasing subsequences per element added.

I need to maximize the growth of the number of increasing subsequences with each added element.

In the best case, if I add an element that is larger than all previous elements, it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, effectively doubling the number of increasing subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or not include this new element).

Wait, but actually, adding a new largest element would multiply the number of increasing subsequences by 2, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or not include the new element.

Wait, but including the new element would always maintain the increasing order.

So, if I have S increasing subsequences before adding the new element, after adding it, I have 2*S increasing subsequences: the original S plus S new ones that include the new element.

But actually, that's only if the new element is larger than all previous elements.

In that case, yes, it doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

So, starting with an empty array, adding a smallest element gives me 2 subsequences: [] and [a1].

Then, adding a larger element a2 gives me 4: [], [a1], [a2], [a1,a2].

Adding a larger element a3 gives me 8: [], [a1], [a2], [a1,a2], [a3], [a1,a3], [a2,a3], [a1,a2,a3].

So, with n elements, all strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

But in our problem, X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, so n up to 60 would suffice if we could have strictly increasing sequences.

But the problem allows n up to 200, which is more than enough for X up to 10^18.

But the problem is that X can be any number up to 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, I need a way to construct arrays where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be any large number, perhaps I can represent X in binary and construct parts of the array that contribute specific amounts to the total count.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as consisting of segments, each segment contributing a power of 2 to the total number of increasing subsequences.

For example, a segment of k increasing elements would contribute 2^k subsequences.

If I have multiple such segments, their contributions would multiply.

Wait, no. If I have two independent segments, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of their individual counts, because I can combine any subsequence from the first segment with any from the second.

But only if the segments are independent, meaning that no element from one segment is between elements of the other segment in value.

To make them independent, I need to ensure that all elements in one segment are less than all elements in the other segment.

But in that case, the total number of increasing subsequences would indeed be the product of the individual counts.

So, if I have segments S1, S2, ..., Sk, where all elements in S1 are less than all elements in S2, and so on, then the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each segment.

Wait, but actually, since the segments are ordered, any increasing subsequence can be formed by choosing a subsequence from each segment and concatenating them.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences is indeed the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each segment.

Given that, I can represent X as a product of numbers of the form 2^{n_i}, where n_i is the size of segment i.

But X can be any number up to 10^18, so it may not be a perfect power of 2.

So, perhaps I need to represent X in binary and construct segments that correspond to each bit.

Wait, perhaps I can think of X as a sum of increasing subsequences from different parts.

But earlier, I thought about representing X as a product of powers of 2, corresponding to each segment.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each segment can contribute a certain number of increasing subsequences, and the total is the product of these contributions.

Given that, I can try to factor X into a product of numbers, each of which is achievable as the number of increasing subsequences of a segment.

Since 2^n is achievable for a strictly increasing segment of size n, I can use that.

But X may not factor neatly into powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of numbers, each of which is achievable.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array in such a way that each new element added contributes a specific amount to the total count of increasing subsequences.

For example, starting with an empty array, which has 1 subsequence (the empty one).

Then, adding an element a1, which creates 2 subsequences: [] and [a1].

Then, adding a2 > a1, which creates 4: [], [a1], [a2], [a1,a2].

Alternatively, adding a2 < a1, which creates 3: [], [a1], [a2].

Wait, in this case, [a2] is valid, but [a1,a2] is not, since a2 < a1.

So, total of 3 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, adding a3 > a1 and a3 > a2, would double the number of increasing subsequences up to that point.

Wait, but a3 > a1 and a3 > a2 would allow appending to any subsequence that ends before it, as long as it's larger than the last element.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the binary representation of X.

Suppose X is 5, which is 101 in binary.

Can I construct segments that correspond to each bit?

For example, for X=5, I can have two segments: one contributing 4 and one contributing 1.

But how do I construct segments that contribute exactly 2^k subsequences?

Well, a strictly increasing segment of length k contributes 2^k subsequences.

So, for X=5, which is 101 in binary, I can have segments contributing 4 and 1.

So, I can have one segment of length 2 (contributing 4) and one segment of length 0 (contributing 1), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust this idea.

Alternatively, perhaps I can build the array by starting with a base segment and then adding elements in a way that adds specific numbers of new subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding an element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Similarly, adding an element that is smaller than all previous elements adds a new set of subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary numbers, where each bit corresponds to adding an element that either doubles the number of subsequences or adds a new branch.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

For X=2:

Output:

1

0

So, array [0], which has 2 subsequences: [] and [0].

For X=5:

Output:

3

0 1 0

As we saw earlier, this has 5 increasing subsequences.

For X=13:

Output:

5

2 2 3 4 2

And for X=37:

Output:

7

-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

So, it seems that the approach allows duplicates and negative numbers.

But I need a general method.

Perhaps I can try to build the array by starting with a base and then adding elements in a way that increases the number of increasing subsequences by specific amounts.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding an element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Similarly, adding an element that is smaller than all previous elements adds a number of new subsequences equal to the number of subsequences in the previous array, plus one for the new element itself.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let me define:

- Let S be the current array.

- Let f(S) be the number of increasing subsequences in S.

Now, if I add a new element 'a' to S:

- If 'a' is larger than all elements in S, then f(S') = 2 * f(S), because for each subsequence in S, I can choose to include 'a' or not.

- If 'a' is smaller than all elements in S, then f(S') = f(S) + number of subsequences that can be formed by appending 'a' to the empty subsequence, which is just 1 (the subsequence [a]).

Wait, but [a] is always a valid increasing subsequence.

Also, any subsequence that ends with an element larger than 'a' can have 'a' appended to it, but since 'a' is smaller than all elements in S, no existing subsequence can have 'a' appended and remain increasing.

Therefore, f(S') = f(S) + 1.

Wait, but in the sample input where X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

Let's see:

- Start with [] (1)

- Add 0: [], [0] (2)

- Add 1: [], [0], [1], [0,1] (4)

- Add 0: [], [0], [1], [0,1], [0], [0,0], [1,0]

But [0,0] and [1,0] are not strictly increasing, so they are invalid.

So, valid increasing subsequences are: [], [0], [1], [0,1], [0].

Total of 5.

So, adding the third 0 didn't double the number of increasing subsequences.

It added some, but not double.

This suggests that adding an element that is not larger than all previous elements doesn't simply double the number of increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can use a combination of adding elements that are larger than all previous elements (to double the count) and adding elements that are smaller, which add only a few new subsequences.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where each element is equal, like [1,1,1].

The increasing subsequences are:

[]

[1]

[1]

[1]

So, total of 4.

Wait, but [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so it's invalid.

Hence, only [], [1], [1], [1], which is 4.

Similarly, for [1,1,1,1], it would be 5.

Wait, but in strictly increasing terms, only the singletons and the empty set are valid.

Wait, no, [1] is valid, but [1,1] is not.

Wait, but according to the problem, [1] is valid, but [1,1] is not.

So, for [1,1,1], the valid increasing subsequences are:

[]

[1]

[1]

[1]

Total of 4.

Similarly, for [1,2,3], it's 8.

For [1,2,2], it's 7: [], [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2], [2,2]

But [2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's invalid.

Hence, valid are: [], [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2]

Total of 6.

Wait, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of increasing subsequences being equal to the sum over all k of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length k.

But calculating this directly is not efficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I represent X in binary.

Each bit in X corresponds to adding a certain number of increasing subsequences.

I need to find a way to map these bits to parts of the array that contribute that many increasing subsequences.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding a new element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Similarly, adding an element that is smaller than all previous elements adds a number of new subsequences equal to the number of increasing subsequences in the previous array.

Wait, no, as we saw earlier, adding a smaller element only adds one new subsequence: the subsequence consisting only of that element.

Because you can't append it to any existing subsequence since it's smaller than all previous elements.

Wait, but in the earlier example with [0,1,0], adding the third 0 didn't add any new increasing subsequences except [0] itself.

So, f(S') = f(S) + 1.

Therefore, adding an element smaller than all previous elements increases the total number of increasing subsequences by 1.

Similarly, adding an element larger than all previous elements doubles the total number of increasing subsequences.

This seems like a promising observation.

So, if I can represent X in terms of operations that either double the current total or add 1 to it, I can build the array step by step.

For example, starting with f(S) = 1 (the empty subsequence).

- Add an element: f(S) = 1 + 1 = 2 (double or add 1?)

Wait, according to the earlier observation:

- Adding an element larger than all previous elements: f(S') = 2 * f(S)

- Adding an element smaller than all previous elements: f(S') = f(S) + 1

So, I can model the process of building the array as a sequence of operations where each operation either doubles the current total or adds 1 to it.

Therefore, I can represent X in terms of these operations.

Given that, I can find a sequence of operations that leads to X.

Then, I can construct the array accordingly.

For example, to get X=5:

Start with 1.

- Add an element smaller: 1 + 1 = 2

- Add an element larger: 2 * 2 = 4

- Add an element smaller: 4 + 1 = 5

So, three elements: first smaller, then larger, then smaller.

In terms of values, I can set:

- First element: 0 (smaller than nothing)

- Second element: 1 (larger than 0)

- Third element: 0 (smaller than 1)

Which matches the sample output for X=5.

Similarly, for X=13:

Binary representation of 13 is 1101, which is 8 + 4 + 1.

So, operations:

- Start with 1

- Double: 2

- Double: 4

- Double: 8

- Add 1: 9

- Add 1: 10

- Add 1: 11

- Add 1: 12

- Add 1: 13

But that would require too many operations.

Wait, perhaps I can find a more efficient sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of X as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Wait, but 13 is 8 + 4 + 1, which corresponds to operations:

- Start with 1

- Double three times to get 8

- Then add 4 (which is 4)

- Then add 1

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine where to add elements that double or add 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the binary representation of X-1.

Wait, in the sample input for X=5, which is 101 in binary.

Similarly, X=13 is 1101 in binary.

Wait, perhaps I can think of X-1 in binary.

Wait, let's try that.

For X=5, X-1=4, which is 100 in binary.

Similarly, for X=13, X-1=12, which is 1100 in binary.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the operations correspond to the binary digits of X-1.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence of operations where each operation is either doubling or adding 1.

This is similar to the way numbers are represented in binary, where each bit represents whether we double or add 1.

Wait, actually, this is similar to the binary representation of numbers, where each bit decides whether to add a power of 2 or not.

But in this case, since our operations can either double or add 1, it's similar to the way numbers are built in binary, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the binary representation of X.

Each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to adding a certain power of 2.

But in our case, adding a '1' operation adds 1 to the total, while doubling corresponds to shifting left in binary.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to represent X as a sum of numbers where each number is a power of 2 multiplied by the number of ways to choose certain segments.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look back at the reference solution provided.

Wait, there is no reference solution provided. You provided a code, and I need to determine if it's correct.

Wait, no, the problem is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Oh, I see. So, I need to analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

Alright, let's look at the program.

The program is:

import math

MOD = 1000000007

if __name__ == '__main__':

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

x = int(input())

x -= 1

subseq_lens = []

mx = 0

while x != 0:

i = 0

while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:

i += 1

if i == 0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i)

x -= 2 ** i - 1

mx = max(mx, i)

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

print(len(ansv))

for i in range(len(ansv)):

print(ansv[i], end=' ')

print()

So, this program reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads X, subtracts 1 from it, and then tries to build an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Wait, but in the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so the total number of increasing subsequences is X, including the empty one.

So, X includes the empty subsequence.

But in the code, x -= 1, which suggests that it's considering X - 1 non-empty increasing subsequences.

Wait, but the problem includes the empty subsequence in the count.

Wait, in the sample input for X=2, the array is [0], which has 2 subsequences: [] and [0].

Similarly, for X=5, it's [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, the code subtracts 1 from X, which would make x = X - 1, representing the number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

But in the problem, X includes the empty subsequence.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrectly subtracting 1.

Wait, let's see what the code does.

It subtracts 1 from X, then enters a loop where it finds the largest i such that 2^i - 1 <= x, appends i to subseq_lens, subtracts 2^i - 1 from x, and keeps track of the maximum i.

Then, it builds an array ansv that starts with [0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1], and then appends subseq_lens[i] for i from 1 to len(subseq_lens)-1.

Finally, it prints the length of ansv and the elements of ansv.

I need to verify if this approach correctly constructs an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

First, I need to understand what subseq_lens represents.

It seems that subseq_lens is a list of integers where each integer i corresponds to a segment that contributes 2^i subsequences.

Wait, no, in the code, it appends i where 2^i - 1 is the contribution.

Wait, 2^i - 1 is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences for a segment of size i.

Wait, for a strictly increasing segment of size i, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^i, including the empty one.

So, 2^i - 1 is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

So, the code is trying to represent X - 1 as a sum of (2^i - 1) for various i.

This seems similar to representing X - 1 in terms of numbers that are one less than a power of 2.

Then, it builds an array that combines these segments.

But I need to verify if this actually results in exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let's take an example.

Take X=5.

Then, x = 4.

Find the largest i where 2^(i+1) <= 5.

2^2 = 4 <= 5, so i=1.

Append 1 to subseq_lens.

x -= 2^1 - 1 = 1, so x=3.

Next iteration:

2^(i+1) <= 4:

i=1, since 2^2=4 <=4.

Append 1 to subseq_lens.

x -=1, x=2.

Next iteration:

2^(i+1) <=3:

i=1, since 2^2=4 >3, so i=0.

Wait, no.

while 2^(i+1) <= x+1:

initially i=0: 2^1=2 <=3+1=4, so i=0.

Then i=1: 2^2=4 <=3+1=4, so i=1.

Then i=2: 2^3=8 >4, so stop at i=1.

Append 1 to subseq_lens.

x -=2^1 -1=1, x=1.

Next iteration:

2^(i+1)<=2:

i=0:2^1=2<=2+1=3, i=0.

Append 0 to subseq_lens.

x -=2^0 -1=0, x=1.

Next iteration:

2^(i+1)<=1:

i=0:2^1=2>1, so i=0.

Break.

So, subseq_lens=[1,1,0]

mx=1.

ansv=[0,1]

Then, for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[1])=1

ansv.append(subseq_lens[2])=0

So, ansv=[0,1,1,0]

But in the sample input for X=5, the output is [0,1,0].

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the code, it's for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

But in Python, range(1, len(subseq_lens)) starts from 1 and goes up to len(subseq_lens)-1.

So, for subseq_lens=[1,1,0], len=3, so i=1 and i=2.

ansv.append(subseq_lens[1])=1

ansv.append(subseq_lens[2])=0

So, ansv=[0,1,1,0]

But in the sample input for X=5, it's [0,1,0].

So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the increasing subsequences for [0,1,0].

Wait, according to the problem, for X=5, the output is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0,1], [0].

So, the code outputs [0,1,1,0], which might have more or fewer increasing subsequences.

Let's count for [0,1,1,0]:

Possible increasing subsequences:

[]

[0]

[1]

[1]

[0]

[0,1]

[0,1]

[1,1] (invalid)

[1,0] (invalid)

[0,1]

[0,0] (invalid)

[0,1,1] (invalid)

[0,1,0] (invalid)

So, valid ones are: [], [0], [1], [1], [0], [0,1], [0,1]

Total of 7.

But for X=5, the sample output is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, the code is producing an array with 7 increasing subsequences, which is not equal to X=5.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
