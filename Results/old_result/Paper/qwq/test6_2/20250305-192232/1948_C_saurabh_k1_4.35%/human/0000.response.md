Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and we need to determine if it can reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

The robot moves in two steps every second:

1. It moves left, right, up, or down, but it can't go outside the grid or skip a move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

My task is to determine for multiple test cases if the robot can reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell based on the grid configuration provided.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly. The robot has a choice of direction in the first step, and then it follows the arrow in its new position. This seems a bit tricky because the arrow determines the second move, so the robot's path isn't entirely under its control.

Let me think about how to model this movement. Since the grid is only two rows tall, perhaps I can consider the possible states the robot can be in and see if it's possible to transition from the starting state to the ending state.

I should consider that the robot can move between rows only if it moves up or down, but since there are only two rows, moving up from row 2 takes it to row 1, and moving down from row 1 takes it to row 2.

Also, the arrows are only pointing left or right, so after the initial move, the robot will move horizontally based on the arrow in its current cell.

I need to find a sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach cell (2,n).

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

4

>><<

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

Output:

YES

YES

NO

YES

In the first test case, n=4, with arrows:

Row 1: > > < <

Row 2: > > > <

The explanation says one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow '>', so it moves right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), then follow the arrow '>', so it moves right to (2,4).

- Reached the destination.

In the second test case, n=2:

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2).

- Start at (1,1), move down to (2,1), follow the arrow '>', move right to (2,2).

- Reached the destination.

In the third test case, n=4:

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><<

Output: NO

In the fourth test case, n=6:

Row 1: >><<><

Row 2: ><>>><

Output: YES

From these examples, it seems that sometimes it's possible to switch rows to reach the destination, but not always.

I need to find a general approach to determine if such a path exists for any given n and arrow configurations.

Let me consider the properties of the grid and the movement rules.

Since the grid has only two rows, I can model it as a graph where each cell is a node, and there are edges based on the possible moves the robot can make.

But given the constraints and the large value of n (up to 2*10^5), building a graph and performing a traversal for each test case might not be efficient enough.

I need a smarter way to determine reachability.

Let me consider the following observations:

1. The robot can move left, right, up, or down in the first step, but it can't move outside the grid.

2. After moving, it must follow the arrow in its current cell, which points either left or right.

So, effectively, each move consists of two parts: a chosen direction and then a forced horizontal move based on the arrow.

I need to see how these combined moves can be used to navigate the grid.

Let me think about possible strategies:

- Try to reach the bottom row as soon as possible and then move right to the end.

- Or, move right in the top row as much as possible before switching to the bottom row.

But this seems too simplistic, and the arrow directions play a crucial role.

I need to consider how the arrow directions affect the movement.

Let me consider the movement in more detail.

Suppose the robot is at some cell (r,c), where r is the row (1 or 2) and c is the column (1 to n).

In the first step, it can choose to move left, right, up, or down.

- If it moves left, it goes to (r, c-1).

- If it moves right, it goes to (r, c+1).

- If it moves up, it goes to (r-1, c), but only if r > 1.

- If it moves down, it goes to (r+1, c), but only if r < 2.

Then, in the second step, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

- If the arrow points right, it moves to (r, c+1).

- If the arrow points left, it moves to (r, c-1).

So, the overall movement is a combination of the chosen direction and the arrow direction.

This seems a bit complex. Maybe I can think in terms of possible positions after each move.

But that might still be too slow for large n.

Let me consider the target cell (2,n). To reach this cell, the robot must be at a cell from which it can move to (2,n) in one move.

Considering the two-step movement:

1. Choose a direction to move.

2. Then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, to end up at (2,n), the robot must be at a cell from which, after choosing a direction and following the arrow, it lands on (2,n).

Let's think about possible preceding cells.

Case 1: The robot moves right to (2,n), then follows the arrow.

But (2,n) is the rightmost cell, so the arrow can't point right beyond that. But according to the problem, no arrow points outside the grid, so if the arrow points right, it would stay at (2,n). If it points left, it would move to (2,n-1).

Wait, but the robot has to reach (2,n), so perhaps it can reach it and then stay there if the arrow points right.

But the problem is to reach (2,n), not necessarily to stay there.

Wait, no, the problem is just to determine if the robot can reach (2,n), regardless of what happens after that.

But since the robot keeps moving every second, I need to ensure that it can reach (2,n) at some point.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to model this as a graph where edges represent possible moves and then see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But with n up to 2e5, building a graph is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the grid is only two rows. Maybe I can find a way to represent the possible movements between the two rows.

Let me try to think in terms of dynamic programming or some kind of state propagation.

Define dp[r][c] as whether the robot can be at cell (r,c).

I need to set dp[1][1] = True, and then propagate this through all possible moves.

But with n up to 2e5, this would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only by moving up or down.

Since there are only two rows, moving up from row 2 takes it to row 1, and moving down from row 1 takes it to row 2.

So, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column positions in each row, and see when it's possible to switch rows.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases, each with n, the first row arrows, and the second row arrows.

Then, for each test case, it checks if the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is '<'. If it is, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

So, it's making a decision based solely on the arrow in cell (2, n-1).

This seems too simplistic. How can the reachability be determined just by looking at one arrow?

Let me check the sample inputs and see if this logic holds.

First test case:

n=4

Row 1: > > < <

Row 2: > > > <

According to the program, it checks cell (2,3), which has arrow '<'. So, it should print 'No', but in the sample output, it's 'Yes'.

Wait, that's contradictory.

Wait, n=4, so n-1=3, and cell (2,3) has arrow '>', which is not '<', so it should print 'Yes', which matches the sample output.

Wait, in the first test case, cell (2,3) has arrow '>', so the program prints 'Yes'.

In the second test case:

n=2

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Cell (2,1) has arrow '>', which is not '<', so it prints 'Yes', matching the sample output.

In the third test case:

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><<

Cell (2,3) has arrow '<', so it prints 'No', matching the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

n=6

Row 1: >><<><

Row 2: ><>>><

Cell (2,5) has arrow '>', so it prints 'Yes', matching the sample output.

So, in all sample cases, the program's logic seems to hold.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to find a counterexample where the program's logic fails.

Suppose n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><>

According to the program, cell (2,3) has arrow '<', so it would print 'No'.

But perhaps there is a way to reach (2,4).

Let's see:

Possible path:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- At (2,2), move right to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- It seems like it's stuck in a loop and can't reach (2,4).

So, in this case, 'No' is correct.

Another example:

n=4

Row 1: >>>>

Row 2: >>>>

Cell (2,3) has arrow '>', so program prints 'Yes'.

Possible path:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- Move right to (1,4), follow arrow '>', move right stays at (1,4).

- Then, move down to (2,4), follow arrow '>', stays at (2,4).

- Reached (2,4).

So, 'Yes' is correct.

Another example where cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<':

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >><<

Cell (2,3) has arrow '<', so program prints 'No'.

Is there a way to reach (2,4)?

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '<', move left to (1,1).

- Stuck in a loop between (1,1) and (1,2).

- Alternatively, move down to (2,1), follow arrow '>', move right to (2,2).

- At (2,2), move right to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- Stuck in a loop between (2,2) and (2,3).

- Can't reach (2,4).

So, 'No' is correct.

Another example:

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >>><

Cell (2,3) has arrow '<', so program prints 'No'.

Can the robot reach (2,4)?

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- At (2,2), move right to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- Can't reach (2,4).

- 'No' is correct.

Another example where cell (2,n-1) has arrow '>':

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >>>

Cell (2,3) has arrow '>', so program prints 'Yes'.

Can the robot reach (2,4)?

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow '>', move right to (2,4).

- Reached (2,4).

- 'Yes' is correct.

So, in all these cases, the program's logic seems to hold.

But is this always true?

Let me try to think of a case where cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', but the robot can still reach (2,n) through some other path.

Suppose n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><>

Cell (2,3) has arrow '<', so program prints 'No'.

Is there another way to reach (2,4)?

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- At (2,2), move right to (2,3), follow arrow '<', move left to (2,2).

- Can't reach (2,4).

- 'No' is correct.

Another example:

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >>>>

Cell (2,3) has arrow '>', so program prints 'Yes'.

Possible path:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow '>', move right to (1,3).

- At (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow '>', move right to (2,4).

- Reached (2,4).

- 'Yes' is correct.

Wait, but in this case, even if cell (2,n-1) has arrow '>', it's possible to reach (2,n).

But what if cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', then it's impossible to reach (2,n)?

Wait, but in the first example where cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', and the program prints 'No', and indeed, it's not possible to reach (2,n).

So, is it always the case that if cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', it's impossible to reach (2,n)?

Let me try to see why.

If cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', then from cell (2,n-1), following the arrow would move the robot to cell (2,n-2).

So, even if the robot manages to reach cell (2,n-1), it would be pushed back to cell (2,n-2), and can't proceed to cell (2,n).

Therefore, in such a case, it's impossible to reach cell (2,n).

Similarly, if cell (2,n-1) has arrow '>', then from cell (2,n-1), following the arrow would move the robot to cell (2,n), which is the destination.

Therefore, in this case, it's possible to reach cell (2,n).

Hence, the program's logic seems correct: if cell (2,n-1) has arrow '<', print 'No'; else, print 'Yes'.

But is this always true?

Wait, what if there's a way to reach cell (2,n) without going through cell (2,n-1)?

For example, maybe the robot can jump over cell (2,n-1) somehow.

But given that the robot can only move left, right, up, or down, and must follow the arrow after the first move, it's not possible to skip over cells.

Moreover, since the grid is only two rows, and the arrows only point left or right, the robot can't make diagonal moves or skip columns.

Therefore, to reach cell (2,n), the robot must pass through cell (2,n-1) if its arrow is '<', which would pull it back, making it impossible to reach (2,n).

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

So, the answer is that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
