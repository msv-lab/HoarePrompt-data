Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. The store has two options: buy one yogurt for a burles or buy two yogurts for b burles. I need to find out the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the promotion. Buying two yogurts for b burles might be cheaper than buying them individually for 2a burles. So, I need to compare b and 2a to see which option is better for buying in pairs.

Let me think about this step by step.

1. If b is less than 2a, then it's cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs using the promotion.

2. If b is greater than or equal to 2a, then it's better to buy yogurts individually.

But wait, the problem says that when buying two yogurts, I can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price. So, I need to consider both options and choose the one that minimizes the total cost.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

Take the first example from the input:

2 5 9

Here, n=2, a=5, b=9

So, buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 9 burles, or buying them individually costs 5*2=10 burles. So, the promotion is cheaper, and the output is 9.

Second example:

3 5 9

n=3, a=5, b=9

I can buy two yogurts using the promotion for 9 burles and one yogurt individually for 5 burles, totaling 14 burles. Alternatively, buying all three individually would cost 15 burles, which is more. So, the output is 14.

Third example:

3 5 11

n=3, a=5, b=11

Using the promotion for two yogurts costs 11 burles, and buying the third one individually costs 5 burles, totaling 16 burles. But the note says it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles. Wait, but the promotion is only for two yogurts, so how can I buy three yogurts for 15 burles? Maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, in this case, buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 11 burles, and the third one costs 5 burles, totaling 16 burles. But the output is 15 burles, which is less than 16. So, perhaps there's another way to calculate this.

Wait, maybe the store allows buying multiple promotions, but in this case, since n=3, I can only buy one promotion (two yogurts for 11 burles) and one yogurt individually for 5 burles, totaling 16 burles. But the output is 15 burles, which suggests that there might be a better way.

Wait, maybe the promotion can be applied in a different way, but the problem says "buy two yogurts for b burles," so I think the output might have a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the note: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." So, perhaps there's a different promotion for three yogurts, but the problem only mentions a promotion for two yogurts. Maybe I need to consider that buying two yogurts for b burles and buying the remaining individually.

Wait, but in this specific test case, n=3, a=5, b=11, and the output is 15. If I buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles, that's 16 burles, which is more than buying three yogurts for some other price, but the problem only mentions the promotion for two yogurts. Maybe I need to find a general formula.

Let me try to derive a general formula.

If n is even, then I can buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion. So, the total cost would be (n/2)*b.

If n is odd, then I can buy (n-1) yogurts in pairs using the promotion and one yogurt individually. So, the total cost would be ((n-1)/2)*b + a.

But wait, in the second example, n=3, a=5, b=9, according to this formula, it should be ((3-1)/2)*9 + 5 = 1*9 + 5 = 14 burles, which matches the output.

In the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11, according to this formula, it should be ((3-1)/2)*11 + 5 = 1*11 + 5 = 16 burles, but the output is 15 burles. So, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that buying two yogurts for b burles is only available once, and I can't use it multiple times. But the problem doesn't specify that; it seems I can use the promotion as many times as needed.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that buying two yogurts for b burles is only available if I buy exactly two yogurts that way, and the rest must be bought individually.

But in the third example, according to the note, it's better to buy three yogurts for 15 burles, but the problem only mentions the promotion for two yogurts. Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the promotion is "buy two yogurts for b burles, but you can choose to buy more than two yogurts in multiples of two."

But the problem specifically says "buy two yogurts for b burles," so I think I need to stick to that.

Let me consider another approach.

I can calculate the cost per yogurt for the promotion and compare it to the individual price.

So, cost per yogurt in promotion is b/2.

If b/2 is less than a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion.

If b/2 is greater than or equal to a, then it's better to buy yogurts individually.

But in the third example, b=11, a=5, so b/2=5.5, which is greater than a=5, so according to this, I should buy all yogurts individually, which would be 3*5=15 burles, which matches the output.

Wait, but in the second example, b=9, a=5, b/2=4.5, which is less than a=5, so I should buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion.

For n=3, I can buy one pair for 9 burles and one yogurt individually for 5 burles, totaling 14 burles, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

If b/2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion, and buy the remaining yogurt(s) individually.

If b/2 >= a, then buy all yogurts individually.

Wait, but in the third example, b/2=5.5 >= a=5, so buy all yogurts individually for 15 burles.

In the second example, b/2=4.5 < a=5, so buy one pair for 9 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles, totaling 14 burles.

This seems consistent.

Let me apply this to the fourth example:

4 5 11

n=4, a=5, b=11

b/2=5.5 >= a=5, so buy all yogurts individually: 4*5=20 burles, which matches the output.

So, the formula seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X)

print(X * C + B)

Wait, this seems incorrect.

First, the variable names are A, B, C, which correspond to n, a, b.

So, A is n, B is a, C is b.

The condition is if B*2 < C:

print(A * B)

Which means if 2a < b, then buy all yogurts individually.

Else, if A is even:

print(int(A * C / 2))

Which means buy all pairs using the promotion.

Else:

X = A // 2

print(X)

print(X * C + B)

Which means buy X pairs using the promotion and one yogurt individually.

But there are two prints in the else clause, which seems incorrect.

Also, in the elif clause, int(A * C / 2) is calculating (n * b)/2, which is equivalent to (n/2)*b, which is correct for even n.

But in the else clause, it's printing X and then X * C + B, which seems to print the number of pairs and then the total cost.

But in the example, only one number is expected in the output for each test case, which is the total cost.

So, printing X is unnecessary and incorrect.

Moreover, in the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11, which should output 15, but according to this code:

X = 3 // 2 = 1

print(1)

print(1 * 11 + 5 = 16)

But the output should be 15, as per the note.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, since b/2 >= a, we should buy all yogurts individually, which is 3*5=15 burles.

But the code is printing 16 burles in this case, which is incorrect.

So, the code is incorrect for this test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
