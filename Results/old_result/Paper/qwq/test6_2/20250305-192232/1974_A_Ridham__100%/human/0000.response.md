Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 15 cells.

There are two types of applications:

1. Applications with 1x1 icons, which take up one cell each.

2. Applications with 2x2 icons, which take up a square of four cells.

Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and we need to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

The input consists of multiple test cases, each with values x and y, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications, respectively.

Our task is to determine the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

First, I need to understand how to optimally place these icons on the screens to minimize the number of screens used.

Let's consider the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon occupies a square of four cells. Given the grid dimensions, we need to see where these 2x2 icons can be placed.

Looking at the grid, a 2x2 icon can be placed in positions that cover cells:

- (1,2,4,5)

- (2,3,5,6)

- (4,5,7,8)

- (5,6,8,9)

- (7,8,10,11)

- (8,9,11,12)

- (10,11,13,14)

- (11,12,14,15)

So, there are specific positions where 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping or going out of bounds.

Given that, each screen can hold a certain number of 2x2 icons. Let's see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Looking at the grid, if I place one 2x2 icon in position (1,2,4,5), then another can be placed in position (7,8,10,11), and possibly another in (13,14,10,11), but that would overlap with the second icon. So, perhaps only two 2x2 icons can fit per screen without overlapping.

Wait, let's visualize this.

Screen grid:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

10 11 12

13 14 15

If I place a 2x2 icon on cells (1,2,4,5), and another on cells (7,8,10,11), that seems fine. There are cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15 left.

Now, can I place another 2x2 icon in the remaining space? For example, on cells (9,11,12,14), but that would require cells 9,11,12,14, which might overlap or go out of bounds.

Wait, cells 9,10,12,11 are already partially occupied. It seems that only two 2x2 icons can fit per screen without overlapping.

So, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Given that, the number of screens required just for the 2x2 icons would be ceil(y / 2).

But, we also have 1x1 icons to place, and they can be placed in the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

Each 2x2 icon occupies four cells, so two 2x2 icons per screen occupy eight cells, leaving seven cells per screen for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in reality, the placement might be more efficient.

Wait, actually, if we place two 2x2 icons per screen, they might share some cells or overlap, but from earlier visualization, it seems possible to place two without overlapping.

Wait, no, in the earlier example, placing two 2x2 icons on (1,2,4,5) and (7,8,10,11) seems fine, without overlapping.

So, per screen, two 2x2 icons can be placed, occupying eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

But, in reality, the total cells per screen are 15, and two 2x2 icons take up eight cells, so remaining cells are 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But, in practice, the actual number of remaining cells might be different because of the way 2x2 icons are placed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe I should calculate the total space required and divide by the screen capacity.

Total space required is x * 1 + y * 4 cells.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, a naive approach would be to divide the total required cells by 15 and take the ceiling of that division.

But, this might not be optimal because 2x2 icons cannot be split across screens; they must be placed entirely within one screen.

Moreover, the way 2x2 icons are placed can affect the number of screens needed.

So, perhaps a better approach is to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible, considering that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining spaces.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

This is the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Then, the total space used by these screens for 2x2 icons is screens_for_y * 15 cells.

But, actually, each of these screens is used for two 2x2 icons, which take up 8 cells per screen (2 icons * 4 cells each), but in reality, they might take up more cells due to overlapping.

Wait, no, 2x2 icons do not overlap if placed correctly.

In the earlier example, two 2x2 icons per screen seem possible without overlapping, using 8 cells in total.

So, per screen used for 2x2 icons, 8 cells are used for icons, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for screens_for_y screens, we can place 2 * screens_for_y 2x2 icons and additionally, up to 7 * screens_for_y 1x1 icons.

But, we have x 1x1 icons to place.

So, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed in the screens used for 2x2 icons is min(x, 7 * screens_for_y)

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons would be x - min(x, 7 * screens_for_y), and these would require additional screens.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil(max(0, x - 7 * screens_for_y) / 15)

Therefore, the total number of screens is screens_for_y + ceil(max(0, x - 7 * screens_for_y) / 15)

Wait, but in the earlier example, with y=1 and x=1, the total screens needed are 1, and in the grid, it seems possible to place one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon on the same screen.

But according to this formula, screens_for_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1, and then 7 * 1 = 7 cells available for 1x1 icons, and x=1 <=7, so no additional screens needed, total screens =1, which matches.

Another example: y=2, x=7.

screens_for_y = ceil(2 / 2) =1

7 *1 =7 cells available for 1x1 icons, x=7 <=7, so no additional screens needed, total screens =1.

But according to the sample input, 7 2 gives output 1, which matches.

Another sample: x=12, y=4.

screens_for_y = ceil(4 / 2) =2

7 *2 =14 cells available for 1x1 icons.

x=12 <=14, so no additional screens needed, total screens=2, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: x=0, y=3.

screens_for_y = ceil(3 / 2) =2

No 1x1 icons, so total screens=2, matches the sample.

Another sample: x=8, y=1.

screens_for_y = ceil(1 / 2) =1

7 *1=7 cells for 1x1 icons.

x=8, so remaining 8-7=1, which requires ceil(1 /15)=1 additional screen.

Total screens=1+1=2.

But according to the sample input, for 8 1, the output is 1, which contradicts this calculation.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when placing 2x2 icons, the remaining space can vary depending on their positions.

In the earlier calculation, I assumed that each screen used for 2x2 icons can hold up to two 2x2 icons and leave seven cells for 1x1 icons.

But in reality, depending on how the 2x2 icons are placed, the remaining cells might be more or less.

Looking back at the first sample input:

x=1, y=1.

Place one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon on the same screen, which seems possible without overlapping.

Similarly, for x=7, y=2, it's possible to place two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons on one screen.

But for x=8, y=1, according to the sample, it's possible with one screen.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I got that it would require two screens, but the sample output is one screen.

So, perhaps my assumption about the remaining cells is incorrect.

Maybe more 1x1 icons can be placed on screens that have 2x2 icons.

Let me try to visualize it.

For x=8, y=1:

Place one 2x2 icon, say on cells (1,2,4,5).

Then, the remaining cells are 3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

That's eleven cells available for 1x1 icons.

So, x=8 <=11, so it fits on one screen.

Ah, so my earlier assumption that only seven cells are available for 1x1 icons when placing two 2x2 icons is incorrect.

In reality, when placing one 2x2 icon, more than seven cells are available for 1x1 icons.

Wait, in this case, with y=1, only one 2x2 icon is placed, occupying four cells, leaving 15-4=11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, x=8 <=11, fits on one screen.

Similarly, for y=2, placing two 2x2 icons, occupying eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps the formula should be:

screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_y - y * 4

if x <= remaining_cells:

total screens = screens_for_y

else:

extra_x = x - remaining_cells

additional_screens = ceil(extra_x / 15)

total_screens = screens_for_y + additional_screens

This seems to align with the sample inputs.

Let's test it with x=8, y=1:

screens_for_y = ceil(1 / 2) =1

remaining_cells =15*1 -1*4=11

x=8 <=11, so total screens=1, which matches the sample.

Another sample: x=12, y=4

screens_for_y=ceil(4/2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -4*4=30-16=14

x=12 <=14, so total screens=2, matches the sample.

Another sample: x=0, y=3

screens_for_y=ceil(3/2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -3*4=30-12=18

x=0 <=18, so total screens=2, matches the sample.

Another sample: x=15, y=0

screens_for_y=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=0*15 -0*4=0

x=15 >0, so extra_x=15

additional_screens=ceil(15/15)=1

total_screens=0+1=1, which should be correct.

Another sample: x=0, y=0

screens_for_y=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=0*15 -0*4=0

x=0 <=0, so total screens=0, but according to the sample input, output is 0, which matches.

Another sample: x=2, y=0

screens_for_y=ceil(0/2)=0

remaining_cells=0*15 -0*4=0

x=2 >0, so extra_x=2

additional_screens=ceil(2/15)=1

total_screens=0+1=1, which should be correct.

Another sample: x=15, y=0

As above, total screens=1, matches the sample.

Another sample: x=8, y=2

screens_for_y=ceil(2/2)=1

remaining_cells=15*1 -2*4=15-8=7

x=8 >7, so extra_x=8-7=1

additional_screens=ceil(1/15)=1

total_screens=1+1=2, which matches the sample.

Last sample: x=0, y=9

screens_for_y=ceil(9/2)=5

remaining_cells=15*5 -9*4=75-36=39

x=0 <=39, so total screens=5, matches the sample.

So, this formula seems consistent with all the sample inputs.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons: screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

2. Calculate the remaining cells in these screens after placing the 2x2 icons: remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_y - y * 4

3. If the number of 1x1 icons x is less than or equal to the remaining cells, then the total screens needed are screens_for_y.

4. Otherwise, calculate the extra 1x1 icons that need to be placed: extra_x = x - remaining_cells

5. Calculate the additional screens needed for these extra 1x1 icons: additional_screens = ceil(extra_x / 15)

6. The total screens needed are screens_for_y + additional_screens.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

n = int(input())

result = []

for _ in range(n):

(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))

space_x = x * 1

space_y = y * 4

total_space = space_y + space_x

if y % 2 == 0:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2

else:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

if space_x <= remaining_cells:

result.append(screen_require_for_y)

else:

extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells

if extra_space % 15 == 0:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15

else:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1

result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)

print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



This seems to implement exactly the approach I just described.

It calculates screens_for_y as ceil(y / 2), which is done by y // 2 if y is even, else y // 2 + 1.

Then, it calculates remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

Then, checks if x <= remaining_cells, and if so, total screens are screen_require_for_y.

Otherwise, calculates extra_space = x - remaining_cells, then extra_screen = ceil(extra_space / 15), and total screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screen.

This matches the reasoning I had earlier.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider edge cases.

Edge Case 1: x=0, y=0

screens_for_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

remaining_cells = 15*0 - 0*4 = 0

x=0 <=0, so total screens=0, which is correct.

Edge Case 2: x=0, y=1

screens_for_y=ceil(1 / 2)=1

remaining_cells=15*1 -1*4=11

x=0 <=11, so total screens=1

Edge Case 3: x=15, y=0

screens_for_y=0

remaining_cells=0

x=15 >0, extra_x=15

additional_screens=ceil(15 / 15)=1

total_screens=0+1=1, correct.

Edge Case 4: x=1, y=7

screens_for_y=ceil(7 / 2)=4

remaining_cells=15*4 -7*4=60-28=32

x=1 <=32, so total screens=4, which seems correct.

Edge Case 5: x=15, y=2

screens_for_y=ceil(2 / 2)=1

remaining_cells=15*1 -2*4=15-8=7

x=15 >7, extra_x=15-7=8

additional_screens=ceil(8 / 15)=1

total_screens=1+1=2, which seems correct.

Edge Case 6: x=0, y=3

screens_for_y=ceil(3 / 2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -3*4=30-12=18

x=0 <=18, total screens=2, correct.

Edge Case 7: x=14, y=2

screens_for_y=1

remaining_cells=15*1 -2*4=15-8=7

x=14 >7, extra_x=14-7=7

additional_screens=ceil(7 / 15)=1

total_screens=1+1=2, which seems correct.

Edge Case 8: x=15, y=3

screens_for_y=ceil(3 / 2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -3*4=30-12=18

x=15 <=18, total screens=2, which seems correct.

Edge Case 9: x=1, y=8

screens_for_y=ceil(8 / 2)=4

remaining_cells=15*4 -8*4=60-32=28

x=1 <=28, total screens=4, correct.

Edge Case 10: x=15, y=4

screens_for_y=ceil(4 / 2)=2

remaining_cells=15*2 -4*4=30-16=14

x=15 >14, extra_x=15-14=1

additional_screens=ceil(1 / 15)=1

total_screens=2+1=3, which seems correct.

All these edge cases seem to be handled correctly by the program.

Additionally, the program reads the number of test cases and processes each one, storing the results in a list and printing them separated by newlines, which matches the required output format.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
