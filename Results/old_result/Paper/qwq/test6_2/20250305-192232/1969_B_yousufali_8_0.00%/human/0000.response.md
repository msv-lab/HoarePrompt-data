Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. Each time I do this, there's a cost equal to the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. So, I need to figure out the sequence of operations that will sort the string with the least possible cost.

First, I need to understand what operations can achieve. Let's consider a simple example. Take "10". To sort this, I need to get "01". If I perform a cyclic shift on the entire string, "10" becomes "01" with a cost of 2 (since the substring length is 2). That seems straightforward.

Another example: "110". To sort this to "011", I can choose the substring from position 1 to 3, which is "110", and perform a cyclic shift to get "011" with a cost of 3.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to do it with smaller costs. For instance, in "110", if I choose the substring from position 2 to 3, "10", and shift it to "01", the string becomes "101". Then, I can choose positions 1 to 2, "10", and shift to "01", resulting in "011". The total cost would be 2 (for the first shift) + 2 (for the second shift) = 4, which is higher than the single shift of cost 3. So, in this case, the single shift is better.

But maybe for some strings, multiple shifts with smaller substrings could be cheaper. Let's try "1010". To sort it to "0011", I can think of shifting different substrings.

Option 1: Shift the entire string "1010" to "0101", cost 4. Then shift "101" to "011", cost 3. Total cost 7.

Option 2: Shift substring positions 2 to 3, "01", which is already sorted, so no change. Not helpful.

Option 3: Shift positions 3 to 4, "10" to "01", resulting in "1001". Then shift positions 1 to 2, "10" to "01", resulting in "0101". Then shift positions 3 to 4 again, "01" to "10", wait, that's not sorted. This seems messy.

Alternatively, shift positions 1 to 4, "1010" to "0101", cost 4. Then shift positions 3 to 4, "10" to "01", resulting in "0110", which is closer to sorted. Then shift positions 2 to 3, "11" is already sorted. So total cost is 4 + 2 = 6.

But the optimal seems to be shifting the entire string once, getting "0101", then shifting positions 2 to 4, "101" to "011", resulting in "0011", with a total cost of 4 + 3 = 7, which is higher than the previous option. So maybe shifting the entire string and then adjusting smaller parts isn't always optimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let's think about the positions where the string deviates from the sorted version. In "1010", the sorted version is "0011". So, positions where they differ are positions 1 and 4.

I need to move the '1' at position 1 to some position after position 4, but since it's a cyclic shift, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I need a different approach. Let's think in terms of inversions. In a sorted array, there should be no inversions, meaning no 1 should come before any 0.

Each inversion requires some operation to fix. Maybe the number of operations needed is related to the number of inversions.

But the cost is based on the substring length, so I need to find a way to minimize the total cost, not just the number of operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of blocks. Find contiguous blocks of 0s and 1s and see how to rearrange them.

Let's consider the example from the problem: "11000". The sorted version is "00011". One way is to shift the first three characters "110" to "011", cost 3, then shift the first four characters "0110" to "0011", cost 4, total 7. But in the note, it says an optimal way is three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9, which is more than 7. So perhaps my approach is better, but the note says 9. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, in the note, it shows:

1. Choose [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

2. Choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

3. Choose [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost: 3+3+3=9

But I can do it with two shifts: Choose [1,3]: "110" -> "011", then choose [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", total cost 3+4=7

So why does the note say 9? Maybe I'm missing something about the operation's definition.

Wait, the operation is to perform a cyclic shift on a substring, and the cost is the length of the substring.

In my first shift, [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

Then, [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", cost 4

Total cost 7

But the note shows three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9. So their total cost is higher. Maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the operation can only be performed on different substrings, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the operation.

Wait, no, the operation can be performed any number of times on any substring, and the cost is the length of the substring each time.

So, my approach of two shifts totaling 7 should be acceptable. But the note shows three shifts totaling 9. Maybe their approach is different, but my approach is valid, so the minimal cost should be 7.

But according to the sample input and output:

Input:

5

10

0000

11000

101011

01101001

Output:

2

0

9

5

11

Wait, for "11000", the output is 9, but I have a way to do it with 7. Is that possible? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps my shifts don't actually achieve the sorted string.

Let's verify:

Start with "11000"

First shift: [1,3]: "110" -> "011", so string becomes "01100"

Second shift: [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", so string becomes "00110"

Wait, that's not sorted yet. Sorted should be "00011". So, an additional shift is needed.

Third shift: [3,5]: "110" -> "011", so string becomes "00011"

Total cost: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10, which is higher than the note's 9.

Wait, in my earlier approach, I thought I could do it in two shifts with total cost 7, but actually, it takes three shifts with total cost 10, which is worse than the note's 9.

So perhaps my initial approach was incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the minimal cost is equal to the number of 1s before the first 0 in the string, plus the number of 0s after the last 1 in the string.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think about the positions of 0s and 1s.

Suppose I have a string "101011". To sort it to "000111", I need to move all the 0s to the front.

Each 0 that is after some 1s needs to be moved before those 1s.

Each such move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 0 and some 1s, and performing a cyclic shift to move the 0 to the front of the substring.

The cost would be the length of that substring.

I need to minimize the total cost of such operations.

This seems similar to bubble sort, where each swap moves a 0 to the left gradually.

But in this case, instead of swapping adjacent elements, I can perform cyclic shifts on substrings.

Wait, maybe it's similar to counting the number of inversions, where each inversion is a pair of positions (i,j) with i < j and s[i] > s[j].

In a binary string, inversions are pairs where s[i] is '1' and s[j] is '0' with i < j.

Each such inversion needs to be resolved by some operation.

But I need to find a way to group these inversions into operations that cover multiple inversions at once, minimizing the total cost.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Looking at the sample input and output:

For "10", output is 2.

For "0000", output is 0.

For "11000", output is 9.

For "101011", output is 5.

For "01101001", output is 11.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can calculate the minimal cost for any given binary string.

Let me consider the positions of 0s and 1s.

Suppose I have a string "101011".

Indices: 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1

In the sorted string, all 0s should be before all 1s.

So, ideally, 0s should be at the beginning.

Each 0 that is after some 1s needs to be moved before those 1s.

Each such movement can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 0 and some 1s, and performing a cyclic shift to bring the 0 to the front.

The cost is the length of the substring.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps, for each 0 that is not already in its correct position (i.e., not all 0s are before all 1s), I can calculate the cost of moving it to the correct position.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the positions of the 0s and see what operations are needed to bring them all to the front.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of 1s after each 0.

Each 0 that has 1s after it needs to be moved past those 1s.

Each such movement can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 0 and some 1s and performing a cyclic shift.

The cost would be the length of that substring.

But I need to find a way to group these movements to minimize the total cost.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe there's a mathematical formula based on the positions of 0s and 1s.

Let me try to find a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample: "10" -> cost 2.

To sort to "01", one operation: shift the entire string.

Second sample: "0000" -> already sorted, cost 0.

Third sample: "11000" -> cost 9.

According to the note, three operations of cost 3 each.

Fourth sample: "101011" -> cost 5.

Fifth sample: "01101001" -> cost 11.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me count the number of 1s and 0s in each string.

First: "10" -> one 1, one 0.

Second: "0000" -> four 0s.

Third: "11000" -> two 1s, three 0s.

Fourth: "101011" -> four 1s, two 0s.

Fifth: "01101001" -> five 1s, three 0s.

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe the cost is related to the number of inversions.

In a binary string, the number of inversions is the number of pairs where a '1' appears before a '0'.

For "10", there's one inversion, and the cost is 2.

For "11000", number of inversions is 2*3=6, and the cost is 9.

For "101011", number of inversions is 1 (first '1' with the third '0') + 1 (second '1' with the third '0') + 1 (fourth '1' with the fifth '0') = 3 inversions, and the cost is 5.

Wait, that doesn't seem to match.

Wait, in "11000", number of inversions is 2*3=6, and the cost is 9.

In "101011", number of inversions is 1*2 (first '1' with two '0's) + 1*2 (second '1' with two '0's) + 0 (third '1' has no '0' after it) + 1*1 (fourth '1' with one '0' after it) = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 5, which matches the sample output of 5.

Wait, but earlier for "11000", 2*3=6 inversions, but the sample output is 9.

So perhaps the cost is not equal to the number of inversions, but something else.

Wait, maybe the cost is equal to the sum over all 0s of the number of 1s before them.

For "10", there's one '0' with one '1' before it, so cost 1, but the operation costs 2.

Doesn't match.

For "11000", there are three '0's, with two '1's before each, so 3*2=6, but sample output is 9.

For "101011", two '0's:

- First '0' has one '1' before it.

- Second '0' has three '1's before it.

Total 1 + 3 = 4, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of (number of 1s before the '0' +1).

For "10": 1 (number of '1's before '0') +1 = 2, matches the sample output.

For "11000": (2+1) + (2+1) + (2+1) = 3*3=9, matches the sample output.

For "101011": (1+1) + (3+1) = 2 + 4 = 6, but sample output is 5. Doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the sum over all '0's of (number of '1's before it +1), but subtract the number of '0's.

Wait, in "101011", sum is 2 + 4 = 6, but sample output is 5. Maybe subtract the number of '0's minus one: 6 -1 =5. That matches.

Similarly, in "11000", sum is 3*3=9, number of '0's is 3, so 9 - (3-1) = 7, which doesn't match the sample output of 9.

So that doesn't work.

Alternative idea: maybe for each '0', the cost is equal to the number of '1's before it plus one, but you can group '0's that are adjacent.

For "11000", group the three '0's together: number of '1's before them is 2, so cost is 2 +1 (for the group) *3 = 9, matches the sample.

For "101011", '0's are in positions 2 and 4.

Group them: from position 2 to 4, there are two '0's, number of '1's before position 2 is one, so cost is 1 +1 *2 =4, but sample output is 5. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum over all '0's of (number of '1's before it +1), minus the overlaps.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

Wait, the program given is:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1():

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

n = 0

ans = 0

for i in range(len(s)):

if s[i] == 1:

n += 1

if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:

ans += n +1

print(ans)

def func_2():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

So, it reads the input string, converts it to a list of integers, iterates through the list, counting the number of '1's encountered, and whenever it sees a '0' and there have been '1's before it, it adds (number of '1's +1) to the answer.

This seems similar to what I was thinking earlier: for each '0', add the number of '1's before it plus one to the total cost.

But in the sample input "101011", according to this, it would be:

- Position 1: '1', n=1

- Position 2: '0', n=1, ans=1+1=2

- Position 3: '1', n=2

- Position 4: '0', n=2, ans=2 +2+1=5

- Position 5: '1', n=3

- Position 6: '1', n=4

Total ans=5, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for "11000":

- Position 1: '1', n=1

- Position 2: '1', n=2

- Position 3: '0', n=2, ans=2+1=3

- Position 4: '0', n=2, ans=3 +2+1=6

- Position 5: '0', n=2, ans=6 +2+1=9

Which matches the sample output of 9.

For "10", it would be:

- Position 1: '1', n=1

- Position 2: '0', n=1, ans=1+1=2

Which matches the sample output of 2.

For "0000", n=0, ans=0, which matches the sample output of 0.

For "01101001":

- Position 1: '0', n=0, ans=0

- Position 2: '1', n=1

- Position 3: '1', n=2

- Position 4: '0', n=2, ans=2+1=3

- Position 5: '1', n=3

- Position 6: '0', n=3, ans=3 +3+1=7

- Position 7: '0', n=3, ans=7 +3+1=10

- Position 8: '1', n=4

Total ans=10, but the sample output is 11. So, discrepancy here.

Wait, according to the program, it should output 10 for "01101001", but the sample output is 11. So, either the program is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's apply the program's logic to "01101001":

- Position 1: '0', n=0, ans=0

- Position 2: '1', n=1

- Position 3: '1', n=2

- Position 4: '0', n=2, ans=0 +2+1=3

- Position 5: '1', n=3

- Position 6: '0', n=3, ans=3 +3+1=7

- Position 7: '0', n=3, ans=7 +3+1=10

- Position 8: '1', n=4

Total ans=10, but sample output is 11. So, there's a discrepancy.

Therefore, either the program is incorrect, or the sample output is wrong.

But assuming the sample output is correct, the program must be incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
