Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, the task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If it's impossible to do so, I need to report that it's impossible.

First, I need to understand when it's impossible to rearrange the string to get a different string. I think that if all the characters in the string are the same, then no matter how I rearrange them, the string will still be the same. For example, if `s` is "aaaaa", any rearrangement will still be "aaaaa", which is equal to `s`. So, in such cases, I should output "NO".

On the other hand, if there is at least one character that is different, then there should be a way to rearrange the characters to get a different string. For example, if `s` is "codeforces", I can rearrange it to "forcescode" or "forcodesec" or something like that, which is not equal to the original string.

So, my first step should be to check if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, then output "NO". Otherwise, output "YES" and provide one possible rearrangement that is not equal to the original string.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to be attempting this logic. Let's go through it step by step.

The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and then loops through each test case. For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

Then, it creates a set `a` from the string `s`. Since sets automatically remove duplicates, the length of this set will tell us how many unique characters are in `s`.

If the length of the set is greater than 1, meaning there are at least two different characters, it prints "YES" and proceeds to generate a new string `r`.

The code then tries a few different ways to rearrange the string:

1. It creates `newstr` by taking the second half of `s` and concatenating it with the first half. For example, if `s` is "code", `newstr` would be "deco", which is different from "code". So, if `newstr` is not equal to `s`, it prints `newstr`.

2. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, it tries the reverse of `s` (`isreverse`). If the reverse is not equal to `s`, it prints the reverse.

3. If neither `newstr` nor `isreverse` is different from `s`, it tries another variation: taking the second half of `s` and concatenating it with the first half, but this time without the last character of the first half. I think this is a typo or a mistake because it's similar to the first attempt.

Wait, actually, in the else clause, it prints `s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2]`, which is the same as the first `newstr`. So, it's redundant.

Let me think about whether these methods are sufficient to guarantee that the new string is different from `s`.

First, taking `s[len(s)//2:] + s[:len(s)//2]` is a rotation of the string by half its length. For even lengths, this is a clear rotation. For odd lengths, it's similar.

For example, if `s` is "abcd", then `newstr` would be "cdab", which is different from "abcd".

If `s` is "abcde", `newstr` would be "cdeab", which is different from "abcde".

So, in these cases, it works.

But what if `s` is a string where rotating by half gives the same string? I need to think of an example where rotating by half equals the original string.

Let's take `s` = "abab". Half length is 2, so `newstr` = "ab" + "ab" = "abab", which is equal to `s`. So, in this case, `newstr` equals `s`.

So, the code checks if `newstr` != `s`, and if not, it tries the reverse.

In the example "abab", the reverse would be "baba", which is not equal to "abab". So, it would print "baba", which is correct.

But is there any string where both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`?

Let's consider `s` = "abba". Half length is 2, so `newstr` = "ba" + "ab" = "baab", which is not equal to "abba". So, it would print "baab".

Another example: `s` = "abcdcdab". Half length is 4, so `newstr` = "cdab" + "abcd" = "cdababcd", which is not equal to "abcdcdab". Reverse is "badcddcba", which is also not equal.

Hmm, I can't think of a string where both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, except maybe for certain symmetrical strings.

Wait, let's try `s` = "abba". We already saw that `newstr` = "baab" != "abba", and `isreverse` = "abba" == "abba". So, it would print "baab".

Another example: `s` = "xyzzyx". Half length is 3, `newstr` = "zyx" + "xyz" = "zyxyzx" != "xyzzyx", `isreverse` = "xyzzyx" != "xyzzyx". So, it would print "zyxyzx".

Hmm, seems like in all these cases, either `newstr` or `isreverse` is not equal to `s`.

But let's think about a string where `newstr` equals `s` and `isreverse` equals `s`. That would require that rotating by half equals the original and reversing equals the original.

So, for `newstr` to equal `s`, the first half must be equal to the second half.

And for `isreverse` to equal `s`, the string must be a palindrome.

So, if `s` is a palindrome and the first half is equal to the second half.

For example, `s` = "aabb". Half length is 2, `newstr` = "bb" + "aa" = "bbaa" != "aabb", `isreverse` = "bbaa" != "aabb". So, it would print "bbaa".

Another example: `s` = "abab". Half length is 2, `newstr` = "ab" + "ab" = "abab" == "abab", `isreverse` = "baba" != "abab". So, it would print "baba".

Wait, but in the first step, when `newstr` equals `s`, it tries the reverse.

So, in the case where both `newstr` and `isreverse` equal `s`, what happens?

Looking back at the code:

if newstr != s:

print(newstr)

elif isreverse != s:

print(isreverse)

else:

print(s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2])

But in the else clause, it's printing the same as `newstr`. So, if both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, it would print `newstr`, which is equal to `s`. That's bad because we need a string that is not equal to `s`.

Wait, in the else clause, it's printing `s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2]`, which is the same as `newstr`. So, if both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, it would print `newstr`, which is equal to `s`. That's incorrect.

So, is there any string where both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`?

Let's consider `s` = "abab". As above, `newstr` = "abab", which equals `s`, and `isreverse` = "baba" != "abab". So, it would print "baba", which is correct.

Another example: `s` = "abcdba". Half length is 3, `newstr` = "dba" + "abc" = "dbabca" != "abcdba", `isreverse` = "abdcba" != "abcdba". So, it would print "dbabca".

Wait, I can't find a string where both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`. Maybe it's impossible.

Let me try `s` = "abcdcba". Half length is 3, `newstr` = "dcba" + "abc" = "dcbabc" != "abcdcba", `isreverse` = "abdcba" != "abcdcba". So, it would print "dcbabc".

Another one: `s` = "abba". `newstr` = "ba" + "ab" = "baab" != "abba", `isreverse` = "abba" == "abba". So, it would print "baab", which is correct.

Wait, but in the else clause, it's printing `s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2]`, which is the same as `newstr`. So, if both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, it would print `newstr`, which is equal to `s`, which is incorrect.

But in practice, I can't find any string where both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, except maybe for certain edge cases.

Wait, let's consider `s` = "aa". Half length is 1, `newstr` = "a" + "a" = "aa" == "aa", `isreverse` = "aa" == "aa". So, in this case, both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`.

Then, in the else clause, it prints `s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2]`, which is "a" + "a" = "aa", which is equal to `s`. So, this is a problem because we need to output a string that is not equal to `s`.

So, in this case, the code would output "aa", which is equal to `s`, which is incorrect.

But according to the problem, if it's impossible to rearrange the string to get a different string, we should output "NO". However, in the case where all characters are the same, like "aaaaa", it correctly outputs "NO".

But in the case where there are multiple unique characters, but the rearrangements coincide with `s`, like "aa", it outputs "aa", which is incorrect.

Wait, but "aa" can be rearranged to "aa", which is the same, but since all characters are the same, it's inevitable. But according to the problem, if it's impossible to rearrange to get a different string, output "NO". So, for "aa", it should output "NO".

But in the code, for "aa", len(a) = 1 (since both characters are 'a'), so it would go to the else clause and print "NO", which is correct.

Wait, no. Wait, 'a' and 'a' are the same, so len(a) = 1, which would trigger the else clause and print "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought of "abab", where `newstr` equals `s`, but `isreverse` does not. So, it would print `isreverse`, which is correct.

But for "aa", len(a) = 1, so it prints "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but what if s = "ab"? len(a) = 2, since 'a' and 'b' are different.

Then, `newstr` = "b" + "a" = "ba" != "ab", so it would print "ba", which is correct.

Another example: s = "abc". `newstr` = "c" + "ab" = "cab" != "abc", so it would print "cab".

So, in the case where len(a) > 1, it tries to generate a new string that is different from `s`. In most cases, it works, except perhaps for certain edge cases where `newstr` and `isreverse` both equal `s`, but I can't find such a string.

Wait, let's try s = "abcdcba". `newstr` = "dcba" + "abc" = "dcbabc" != "abcdcba", `isreverse` = "abdcba" != "abcdcba", so it prints "dcbabc", which is correct.

Another one: s = "abba". `newstr` = "ba" + "ab" = "baab" != "abba", so it prints "baab", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought of s = "aa". len(a) = 1, so it prints "NO", which is correct.

Wait, maybe the code is correct after all.

Wait, but in the else clause, it's printing `s[len(s)//2:] + s[0:len(s)//2]`, which is the same as `newstr`, which might be equal to `s` in some cases.

But in practice, for strings with len(a) > 1, it seems that either `newstr` or `isreverse` is not equal to `s`.

I need to think harder to find a counterexample.

Let's try s = "abcd". `newstr` = "cd" + "ab" = "cdab" != "abcd", so it prints "cdab".

s = "abcde". `newstr` = "cde" + "ab" = "cdeab" != "abcde", so it prints "cdeab".

s = "aabb". `newstr` = "bb" + "aa" = "bbaa" != "aabb", so it prints "bbaa".

s = "abab". `newstr` = "ab" + "ab" = "abab" == "abab", so it tries `isreverse` = "baba" != "abab", so it prints "baba".

s = "abcdcba". `newstr` = "dcba" + "abc" = "dcbabc" != "abcdcba", so it prints "dcbabc".

s = "abcdba". `newstr` = "dba" + "abc" = "dbabca" != "abcdba", so it prints "dbabca".

s = "abba". `newstr` = "ba" + "ab" = "baab" != "abba", so it prints "baab".

s = "aa". len(a) = 1, so it prints "NO".

s = "a". len(a) = 1, so it prints "NO".

s = "ab". `newstr` = "b" + "a" = "ba" != "ab", so it prints "ba".

s = "abc". `newstr` = "c" + "ab" = "cab" != "abc", so it prints "cab".

s = "abcd". `newstr` = "cd" + "ab" = "cdab" != "abcd", so it prints "cdab".

s = "abcde". `newstr` = "cde" + "ab" = "cdeab" != "abcde", so it prints "cdeab".

s = "abcdef". `newstr` = "ef" + "abcd" = "efabcd" != "abcdef", so it prints "efabcd".

It seems that in all these cases, the code correctly generates a rearranged string that is not equal to `s`, or correctly reports "NO" when it's impossible.

Therefore, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, or determine if it's impossible to do so.

### Approach

1. **Check for Impossible Cases**: 
   - If all characters in the string are the same, any rearrangement will result in the same string. Hence, output "NO".
   
2. **Generate a Different Rearrangement**:
   - For strings with at least two distinct characters:
     - Try rotating the string by half its length.
     - If the rotated string is different from the original, use it.
     - Otherwise, try the reverse of the original string.
     - If both the rotated and reversed strings are equal to the original, use another rearrangement method.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            half = len(s) // 2
            newstr = s[half:] + s[:half]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(newstr)
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                # Fallback: Scramble the string in some other way
                # For example, swap the first two characters
                if len(s) > 1:
                    swapped = s[1] + s[0] + s[2:]
                    print(swapped)
                else:
                    print(s)
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the string `s`.

2. **Check Uniqueness of Characters**:
   - Use a set to determine the unique characters in `s`.
   - If there is only one unique character, output "NO" since rearrangement won't change the string.

3. **Generate New String**:
   - If there are multiple unique characters:
     - Create a new string by rotating `s` by half its length.
     - If this new string is different from `s`, print it.
     - Otherwise, create the reverse of `s` and check if it's different.
     - If both methods fail, use a fallback method (e.g., swap the first two characters).

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a different arrangement is possible.
   - Print "NO" if it's impossible to rearrange the string to be different from the original.

This approach ensures that we handle all edge cases and provide a correct rearrangement when possible.
