Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked.

We have an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. We need to perform an operation `n` times, where in each operation, we select an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then delete `a[i]` from `a`. After all operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain some unique values. We need to sort `S` in decreasing order to form array `b`, and find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that when comparing two arrays, we look for the first position where they differ, and the array with the larger value at that position is considered larger. So, to make `b` lexicographically largest, we want the largest possible values to appear as early as possible in the array.

Given that `S` is a set, it can only contain unique elements. So, even if we try to insert duplicates, they will be ignored.

The challenge is to choose which element to remove at each step to maximize the resulting `b`.

Let me think about the process:

1. In each step, I choose an index `i`, insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and remove `a[i]` from `a`.

2. The index `i` is based on the current length of `a`, which decreases by one each time.

3. Since `S` is a set, only unique values are kept.

4. After all operations, `b` is `S` sorted in decreasing order.

5. I need to maximize `b` lexicographically.

I need to maximize the largest elements in `b`, and then the next largest, and so on.

One approach is to try to maximize the maximum value in `S`, then maximize the second maximum, and so on.

But since we have to do this in a sequence of operations, I need a strategy to choose which element to remove at each step to achieve this.

Let's consider the following:

- The value inserted into `S` is `a[i] + i`, where `i` is the index in the current `a`.

- When I remove `a[i]`, the indices of elements after `i` decrease by one.

So, the value `a[j] + j` for `j > i` will change after `a[i]` is removed.

This seems complicated to handle directly. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can precompute all possible values that could be inserted into `S`, and then figure out the optimal way to select them.

Given that in each operation, I can choose any remaining index `i`, and insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then remove `a[i]` from `a`.

But since the indices change after each removal, it's tricky to keep track.

Maybe if I consider that the value inserted is `a[i] + (position where it was originally)`, because the index `i` changes as elements are removed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the original positions of the elements.

Let me try to reframe this.

Let's say the original array is `a1, a2, a3, ..., an`.

In the first operation, I can choose any index from 1 to n, insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and remove `a[i]`.

In the second operation, the array has n-1 elements, and I choose an index from 1 to n-1, insert `a[j] + j` into `S`, and remove `a[j]`.

And so on, until the array is empty.

But the indices are dynamic, which makes it confusing.

Maybe there's a way to fix the indices by considering the original positions.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the original positions and compute what `a[i] + i` would be for each original `i` from 1 to n.

But since the indices change after each removal, this might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that in each step, the index `i` corresponds to the current position in the array, which changes as elements are removed.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the final set `S`. It will contain some values of the form `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position at which `a[i]` was removed.

I need to choose the order of removals such that the set `S` is maximized in a lexicographical sense when sorted in decreasing order.

This is still tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of selecting which values to insert into `S` and ensuring that I get the largest possible values.

Given that `S` is a set, duplicates are ignored, which adds another layer of complexity.

Let me consider an example to get some intuition.

Take the first sample input:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Option 1:

- First operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, remove a[1], so a becomes [1]

- Second operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {2, 3}, b = [3, 2]

Option 2:

- First operation: choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, remove a[2], so a becomes [2]

- Second operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {3}, b = [3]

So, the first option is better.

Another example:

n = 3

a = [6, 4, 8]

From the sample output, b = [11, 7, 6]

Let's see how:

Option:

- First operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, remove a[1], a becomes [4, 8]

- Second operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, remove a[1], a becomes [8]

- Third operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {5,7,9}, b = [9,7,5], which is not matching the sample output.

Wait, the sample output is [11,7,6], so maybe another sequence:

- First operation: choose i=3, insert a[3] + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11, remove a[3], a becomes [6,4]

- Second operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, remove a[1], a becomes [4]

- Third operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {11,7,5}, b = [11,7,5], which still doesn't match the sample [11,7,6]

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in understanding the index numbering.

In the problem, indices start from 1, and when an element is removed, the indices of elements to the right decrease by 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's try again for the third sample:

n = 3

a = [6,4,8]

Option:

- First operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, remove a[1], a becomes [4,8]

- Second operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, remove a[1], a becomes [8]

- Third operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {5,7,9}, b = [9,7,5]

But the sample output is [11,7,6], which suggests a different sequence.

Wait, perhaps the indices are 1-based, and in the first operation, choosing i=3 inserts a[3] + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11, then a becomes [6,4], then choosing i=1 inserts a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, then a becomes [4], then choosing i=1 inserts a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, so S = {11,7,5}, which doesn't match the sample [11,7,6].

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, perhaps in the third operation, after removing a[1]=6, the array becomes [4,8], then choosing i=2 inserts a[2] + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10, but that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the index is based on the current array.

Wait, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the third sample, the output is [11,7,6], but according to my calculations, it should be [11,7,5]. Maybe there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the array after removing a[1]=6 becomes [4,8], and choosing i=2 inserts a[2] + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10, but that's still not matching.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the array after removing a[1]=6 is [4,8], and choosing i=1 inserts a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, but that's not matching the sample.

Alternatively, maybe choosing different operations.

Wait, perhaps choosing a different sequence:

- First operation: choose i=3, insert a[3] + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11, remove a[3], a becomes [6,4]

- Second operation: choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6, remove a[2], a becomes [6]

- Third operation: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, remove a[1], a is empty

- S = {11,6,7}, b = [11,7,6], which matches the sample output.

Ah, so the sequence matters in terms of which elements are inserted into `S`.

So, the order in which we remove elements affects the values inserted into `S`.

Our goal is to maximize the sorted array `b`.

Given that `S` is a set, duplicates are ignored, but in this case, with distinct insertions, it's less of a concern.

So, the challenge is to choose the removal sequence to maximize the set `S` in a lexicographical order when sorted in decreasing order.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that the final `b` is sorted in decreasing order, and we need it to be as large as possible lexicographically.

This means we need the largest possible values in `S`, and as many as possible of the next largest, and so on.

Given that, perhaps we should aim to include the largest possible unique values in `S`.

Wait, but the values are `a[i] + i`, and `i` is the index at the time of removal.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider precomputing all possible `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position at which `a[i]` is removed.

But that seems too vague.

An alternative idea: since the final `b` is sorted in decreasing order, perhaps I can collect all possible unique `a[i] + pos` and select the largest ones.

But I need to ensure that the selections are possible given the operation constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each element is removed exactly once, and its contribution to `S` is `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is its removal position (from 1 to n).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the set `S` can contain at most `n` unique values, but in some cases, due to duplicates, it might contain fewer.

Given that, I need to maximize the sorted array `b`.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve this by first computing all possible `a[i] + (original position)`, then sorting them, and constructing `b` accordingly.

Wait, let's look at the program step by step.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, calls `func_1()`.

In `func_1()`:

- Read `n`

- Read array `a` with `n` integers

- For each element in `a`, compute `a[i] + (i + 1)`, where `i` is the 0-based index in the list

- Create a `Counter` of these values

- Create a set from these values and sort them in reverse order to get `a`

- Compute `cnt = n - len(a)`, which is the number of duplicates

- Initialize an empty list `ans`

- Iterate through the sorted unique values:

- For each pair of consecutive values, if there's a gap, insert values in decreasing order to fill the gap, up to the number of duplicates available

- Append the current value to `ans`

- After processing all unique values, if there are still duplicates left, append decreasing values to `ans`

- Print the array `ans`

Wait, this seems to be trying to maximize `b` by filling the gaps between unique values with as many as possible of the duplicates.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider the first sample input:

n = 2

a = [2,1]

Compute a[i] + (i + 1):

- a[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

- a[1] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, `a` becomes [3,3]

Counter: {3:2}

Set of `a`: {3}

Sorted in reverse: [3]

cnt = 2 - 1 = 1

ans starts empty

Iterate through sorted unique a:

i=0: since i>0 doesn't apply

append 3

counter[3] -=1 -> counter[3]=1

Then, for _ in range(cnt=1):

append 3 -1 =2

So, ans = [3,2]

Which matches the first sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

n=5

a= [1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=2

- a[1]+2=102

- a[2]+3=1003

- a[3]+4=1000004

- a[4]+5=1000000005

All unique, so counter: {2:1,102:1,1003:1,1000004:1,1000000005:1}

sorted reverse: [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

cnt =5-5=0

ans starts empty

Iterate through sorted unique a:

append 1000000005

append 1000004

append 1003

append 102

append 2

No gaps, cnt=0, so output is [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

But in the sample output, it's:

1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2

Which matches.

Another sample:

n=3

a=[6,4,8]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=7

- a[1]+2=6

- a[2]+3=11

So, counter: {7:1,6:1,11:1}

sorted reverse: [11,7,6]

cnt=3-3=0

ans starts empty

append 11

append 7

append 6

output: [11,7,6]

Which matches the third sample output.

So, in these cases, it seems correct.

But is this always correct?

Let me think about a case where there are duplicates.

Suppose n=3

a=[1,1,1]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=2

- a[1]+2=3

- a[2]+3=4

All unique, so counter: {2:1,3:1,4:1}

sorted reverse: [4,3,2]

cnt=3-3=0

ans starts empty

append 4

append 3

append 2

output: [4,3,2]

Is this the optimal?

Alternative sequence:

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a becomes [1,1]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a becomes [1]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2}, b=[2]

Which is worse.

Another sequence:

- Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=1+3=4, remove a[3], a becomes [1,1]

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=1+2=3, remove a[2], a becomes [1]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,3,4}, b=[4,3,2]

Same as the first approach.

So, in this case, the program's output is correct.

Another case with duplicates in `a`:

n=4

a=[1,2,1,2]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=2

- a[1]+2=4

- a[2]+3=4

- a[3]+4=6

So, counter: {2:1,4:2,6:1}

sorted reverse: [6,4,2]

cnt=4-3=1

ans starts empty

Iterate through sorted unique a:

i=0: i>0 doesn't apply, append 6, counter[6]-=1 -> counter[6]=0

i=1: a[0]-a[1]-1=6-4-1=1, min(1, cnt=1, counter[a[0]]=0) -> min(1,1,0)=0, so no addition, append 4, counter[4]-=1 -> counter[4]=1

i=2: a[1]-a[2]-1=4-2-1=1, min(1, cnt=1, counter[a[1]]=1) -> min(1,1,1)=1, so add 3, append 3, cnt -=1, counter[a[1]]-=1 -> counter[4]=0

Then, append 2

Final ans: [6,4,3,2]

But is this optimal?

Let's see possible sequences:

Option 1:

- Choose i=4, insert a[4]+4=2+4=6, remove a[4], a=[1,2,1]

- Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=1+3=4, remove a[3], a=[1,2]

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, remove a[2], a=[1]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,4,6}, b=[6,4,2]

Option 2:

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=1+2=3, remove a[2], a=[1,2,2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a=[2,2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, remove a[1], a=[2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,3}, b=[3,2]

Worse than option 1.

Option 3:

- Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=1+3=4, remove a[3], a=[1,2,2]

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, remove a[2], a=[1,2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a=[2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,3,4}, b=[4,3,2]

Same as option 1.

Option 4:

- Choose i=4, insert a[4]+4=2+4=6, remove a[4], a=[1,2,1]

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=1+2=3, remove a[2], a=[1,2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a=[2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,3,6}, b=[6,3,2]

Still same as before.

Seems like [6,4,2] is the best, matching the program's output.

But according to the program, it outputs [6,4,3,2], which seems better.

Wait, but in reality, we can't have 3 in S because in all sequences I can think of, S only contains {2,4,6} or {2,3,6}.

How does the program end up with [6,4,3,2]?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program's logic.

Looking back at the program:

- It computes a[i] + (i+1) for each element, getting [2,4,4,6]

- Counter: {2:1,4:2,6:1}

- sorted reverse: [6,4,2]

- cnt =4-3=1

- ans starts empty

- i=0: a[0]=6, append 6, counter[6]-=1 -> counter[6]=0

- i=1: a[0]-a[1]-1=6-4-1=1, min(1, cnt=1, counter[a[0]]=0)=0, so no addition, append 4, counter[4]-=1 -> counter[4]=1

- i=2: a[1]-a[2]-1=4-2-1=1, min(1, cnt=1, counter[a[1]]=1)=1, so append 3, cnt -=1, counter[4]-=1 -> counter[4]=0

- Finally, cnt=0, so no more additions

- ans = [6,4,3,2]

But in reality, we can't have 3 in S, as per the sequences I tried.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I missed a possible sequence.

Let's try:

- Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=1+3=4, remove a[3], a=[1,2,2]

- Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, remove a[2], a=[1,2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, remove a[1], a=[2]

- Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, remove a[1], a is empty

- S={2,3,4}, b=[4,3,2]

Wait, in this sequence, S does contain 3.

So, it's possible to have 3 in S.

I must have missed this earlier.

Hence, the program's output of [6,4,3,2] seems correct in this case.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,1,1,1]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=2

- a[1]+2=3

- a[2]+3=4

- a[3]+4=5

All unique, counter: {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

sorted reverse: [5,4,3,2]

cnt=4-4=0

ans starts empty

append 5

append 4

append 3

append 2

output: [5,4,3,2]

Is this optimal?

Seems yes.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,2,1,2]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=2

- a[1]+2=4

- a[2]+3=4

- a[3]+4=6

counter: {2:1,4:2,6:1}

sorted reverse: [6,4,2]

cnt=4-3=1

In the loop:

i=0: append 6, counter[6]=0

i=1: a[0]-a[1]-1=6-4-1=1, min(1,1,0)=0, so no addition, append 4, counter[4]=1

i=2: a[1]-a[2]-1=4-2-1=1, min(1,1,1)=1, so append 3, cnt -=1=0, counter[4]-=1=0

Then, cnt=0, so no more additions

final ans=[6,4,3,2]

Which seems correct as per earlier analysis.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

It handles duplicates properly and fills the gaps when possible.

Therefore, the program is correct.
