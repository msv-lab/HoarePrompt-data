Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so I need to check if every possible combination of length n from the first k alphabets is present as a subsequence in s. That sounds tricky, especially since n can be up to 26, and k can be up to 26 as well. But m, the length of s, can be up to 1000, and the sum of m over all test cases is up to 10^6, which is a million. So, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me think about the total number of possible strings of length n from the first k alphabets. It's k^n, which can be quite large if both k and n are big. For example, if k=26 and n=26, that's 26^26, which is enormous. Obviously, I can't generate and check each one individually.

So, I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can think about the problem differently. Instead of trying to find all possible subsequences, perhaps I can find a way to determine if s contains all possible combinations.

Let me consider the properties of s that would ensure it contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k alphabets.

One idea is to ensure that s contains enough repetitions of each character to cover all possible combinations. But I'm not sure how to formalize that.

Another approach is to model this problem using graph theory. I can think of each character in the first k alphabets as a node, and build a graph where edges represent the order in which characters appear in s.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of a de Bruijn sequence or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider smaller values of n and k to get some intuition.

Suppose n=1 and k=2, with s="ab". Then, the possible strings are "a" and "b", and both are subsequences of s. So, the answer is YES.

If n=2 and k=2, with s="abba", possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". I need to check if all of these are subsequences of "abba".

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (indices starting from 1)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": positions 3 and 4

All of these are present, so the answer is YES.

Another example: n=2, k=2, s="abb"

Possible strings:

- "aa": is "a" at position 1, but there's only one "a", so "aa" is not a subsequence.

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": positions 2 and 3

So, "aa" is missing, hence the answer is NO, and I should output "aa".

From this, it seems like I need to find a way to check if s contains all possible combinations of length n from the first k alphabets as subsequences.

But checking each possible combination individually is not feasible due to the size of k^n.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the minimal s that contains all possible combinations.

In the case of n=2 and k=2, "aba" would be sufficient because:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": positions 2 and 3

But in the second example, s="abb" also works.

Wait, but for n=2 and k=2, m=3 is sufficient.

But for larger n and k, m could be much larger.

I need to find a way to check if s is rich enough in terms of subsequences to cover all possibilities.

One idea is to consider the number of times each character appears in s. For example, for n=2 and k=2, if s has at least two "a"s and two "b"s, arranged appropriately, it might cover all combinations.

But this seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the problem from the perspective of choosing positions for each character in the target subsequence.

For a target string t of length n, I need to find positions in s where the characters of t appear in order.

So, for t="aa", I need two "a"s in s with the first "a" before the second "a".

Similarly, for t="ab", I need an "a" before a "b".

And so on.

Is there a way to precompute, for each character, the positions where it appears in s, and then check for each t if there exists a sequence of positions in s that match t's characters in order?

But again, this seems too slow for large k and n.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible combinations.

For example, for n=1, k=2, s just needs to contain both "a" and "b" at least once.

For n=2, k=2, s needs to contain "a" at least twice and "b" at least twice, arranged such that all combinations are covered.

But I'm not sure about this.

Let me try to generalize.

Suppose n=3 and k=2.

Possible strings: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".

I need to ensure that s contains all these as subsequences.

For "aaa", s needs to have at least three "a"s in increasing positions.

For "aab", s needs to have at least two "a"s followed by at least one "b".

And so on.

This seems complicated to check directly for large n and k.

I need a better approach.

Maybe I can think about the minimal s that contains all possible combinations.

But I don't know enough about that.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

from collections import *

from math import *

from heapq import *

import sys

from bisect import *

from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

for i in s:

if i in us:

win.add(i)

if len(win) == k:

ans.append(i)

ps += 1

win.clear()

if ps >= n:

return print('YES')

print('NO')

for i in us:

if i not in win:

print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))

So, the program reads t, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calls func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n, k, m

- Read string s

- Create a set us containing the first k lowercase letters

- Initialize an empty set win and an empty list ans and a counter ps

- Loop through each character in s:

- If the character is in us:

- Add it to win

- If win now contains all k characters:

- Append the character to ans

- Increment ps

- Clear win

- If ps >= n:

- Print 'YES'

- Else:

- Print 'NO'

- Find a character in us not in win

- Print the concatenation of ans, that character, and 'a' repeated (n - len(ans) - 1) times

Wait, this seems... off.

Let me try to understand this logic.

It seems like the program is trying to find sequences in s where it sees all k characters, and then counts how many such sequences it can find. If it can find at least n such sequences, it concludes that all possible strings of length n are covered. Otherwise, it constructs a string that's not present by appending a missing character to the sequences found.

But I'm not sure if this logic is correct.

Let me test it with the first example:

Test case 1:

2 2 4

abba

us = {'a', 'b'}

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

Loop through s:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a', 'b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

- a: win = {'b', 'a'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b', 'a'], ps = 2, win = set()

Since ps = 2 >= n=2, print 'YES'

This matches the first test case.

Test case 2:

2 2 3

abb

us = {'a', 'b'}

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

Loop through s:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a', 'b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

Since ps = 1 < n=2, print 'NO'

Then, find a character in us not in win. win = {'b'}, us = {'a', 'b'}, so 'a' is not in win.

So, print ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a' * (n - len(ans) -1) = 'b' + 'a' + 'a' * (2 - 1 -1) = 'ba' + '' = 'ba'

Wait, but in the example output, it's 'aa'. Hmm.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the second test case, s = "abb", n=2, k=2.

The program would do:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

So, ps = 1 < n=2, print 'NO'

Then, win = {'b'}, us = {'a','b'}, so 'a' is not in win.

So, print ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a' * (n - len(ans) -1) = 'b' + 'a' + 'a' * (2-1-1) = 'ba' + '' = 'ba'

But according to the example, the missing string is 'aa'.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that 'aa' is missing.

So, the program is giving 'ba', but the correct answer should be 'aa'.

So, this suggests that the program is not correct.

Wait, but in the test case, it's accepting 'ba' as a valid answer, since it's one of the strings not present.

But in the example output, it's 'aa'.

So, multiple answers are possible, as long as it's a string not present.

But in this case, 'ba' is present, as per the first test case.

Wait, in the second test case, s = "abb"

Possible subsequences:

- 'aa': positions 1 and 3 (both 'a's), but there's only one 'a', so 'aa' is not possible.

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2

- 'bb': positions 2 and 3

- 'ba': positions 2 and 3 (but is 'bb' positions 2 and 3, so 'ba' might not be present)

Wait, positions 2 and 3 are both 'b's, so 'ba' is not present.

Wait, to have 'ba', I need a 'b' followed by an 'a', but in "abb", the 'a' is at position 1, and 'b's are at positions 2 and 3. So, 'ba' is not a subsequence.

Wait, but in the first test case, s = "abba", which does contain 'ba' as a subsequence.

But in "abb", there is no 'a' after a 'b'.

So, 'ba' is not present.

But according to the example, 'aa' is missing.

So, both 'aa' and 'ba' are missing.

Hence, the program could output either, as long as it's a valid missing string.

But the problem says to output any such string.

So, in this case, the program outputs 'ba', which is correct, even though the example outputs 'aa'.

So, perhaps it's acceptable.

But in the third test case:

3 3 10

aabbccabab

us = {'a','b','c'}

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

Loop through s:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 3

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 3

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) != 3

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) != 3

- c: win = {'a','b','c'}, len(win) == 3 -> ans = ['c'], ps = 1, win = set()

- c: win = {'c'}, len(win) != 3

- a: win = {'a','c'}, len(win) != 3

- b: win = {'a','b','c'}, len(win) == 3 -> ans = ['c','c'], ps = 2, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 3

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) != 3

Since ps = 2 < n=3, print 'NO'

Then, win = {'a','b'}, us = {'a','b','c'}, so 'c' is not in win.

So, print ''.join(ans) + 'c' + 'a' * (3 - len(ans) -1) = 'c' + 'c' + 'c' + 'a' * (3 - 2 -1) = 'ccc' + '' = 'ccc'

But according to the example, 'ccc' is missing.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, it output 'ba', which is also missing.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, it outputs 'ba', but the example outputs 'aa'.

But both are missing, so both are acceptable.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But I need to verify if this logic is generally correct.

The logic seems to be:

- Collect characters until you've seen all k characters.

- Each time you collect such a sequence, increment a counter.

- If you have at least n such sequences, then you conclude that all possible strings of length n are covered.

But I'm not sure if this is always true.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2, k=2, s="abab"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop through s:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b','b'], ps = 2, win = set()

Since ps = 2 >= n=2, print 'YES'

But let's check if all possible strings of length 2 are present:

- 'aa': is 'a' at positions 1 and 3

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2

- 'ba': positions 2 and 4

- 'bb': positions 3 and 4

All are present, so 'YES' is correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=2, s="ababa"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b','b'], ps = 2, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

Since ps = 2 >= n=3? No, ps=2 < n=3, so print 'NO'

Then, win = {'a'}, us = {'a','b'}, so 'b' is not in win.

Output: ''.join(ans) + 'b' + 'a' * (3 - 2 -1) = 'b' + 'b' + 'b' + '' = 'bbb'

But in s="ababa", is 'bbb' a subsequence?

Positions of 'b's are 2,4.

So, 'bbb' requires three 'b's, but there are only two 'b's, so 'bbb' is not a subsequence.

Hence, the program is correct in this case.

Another test case: n=2, k=3, s="abc"

us = {'a','b','c'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 3

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) != 3

- c: win = {'a','b','c'}, len(win) == 3 -> ans = ['c'], ps = 1, win = set()

Since ps = 1 < n=2, print 'NO'

Then, win = set(), us = {'a','b','c'}, pick any character not in win, say 'a'

Output: ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a' * (2 -1 -1) = 'c' + 'a' + '' = 'ca'

But in s="abc", is 'ca' a subsequence? Positions 1 and 3: 'a' and 'c', which is 'ac', not 'ca'. So 'ca' is not a subsequence.

Hence, the program is correct again.

Wait, but 'ca' is not a subsequence of "abc", which is correct.

So, perhaps this logic works.

But I need to think harder to find a case where it fails.

Suppose n=2, k=2, s="abba"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

- a: win = {'b','a'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b','a'], ps = 2, win = set()

Since ps = 2 >= n=2, print 'YES'

Which is correct, as per the first test case.

Another test case: n=1, k=2, s="ab"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

Since ps = 1 >= n=1, print 'YES'

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=1, s="aaa"

us = {'a'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) == 1 -> ans = ['a'], ps = 1, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) == 1 -> ans = ['a','a'], ps = 2, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) == 1 -> ans = ['a','a','a'], ps = 3, win = set()

Since ps = 3 >= n=3, print 'YES'

Which is correct.

Wait, but with k=1, n=3, there's only one possible string: "aaa", which is present.

Now, a test case where the program might fail.

Let's try n=2, k=2, s="abab"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b','b'], ps = 2, win = set()

Since ps = 2 >= n=2, print 'YES'

But let's check if all possible strings are present:

- 'aa': positions 1 and 3

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2

- 'ba': positions 2 and 4

- 'bb': positions 3 and 4

All are present, so 'YES' is correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=2, s="aabb"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

Since ps = 1 < n=2, print 'NO'

Then, win = {'b'}, us = {'a','b'}, pick 'a'

Output: ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a' * (2 -1 -1) = 'b' + 'a' + '' = 'ba'

But in s="aabb", is 'ba' a subsequence? Positions 2 and 4: 'ab', not 'ba'. Positions 1 and 3: 'aa', not 'ba'. So, 'ba' is not a subsequence.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but 'ba' is not a subsequence, so outputting 'ba' is correct.

But is there a case where the program might output a string that is actually present?

I need to find such a case.

Let's try n=2, k=2, s="abab"

Program outputs 'YES', which is correct.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the earlier test case, n=2, k=2, s="abab", it outputs 'YES', which is correct.

Wait, maybe I can't find a counterexample.

Perhaps the logic is correct.

Let me try to understand why this logic works.

The program is essentially dividing s into segments where each segment contains all k characters at least once.

By ensuring that there are at least n such segments, it assumes that all possible combinations of length n can be formed by choosing characters from these segments.

But I'm not sure if this is always true.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's not always correct.

Let me think of a case where the program says 'YES' but it's actually 'NO'.

Suppose n=2, k=2, s="abba"

Program outputs 'YES', which is correct.

Another case: n=3, k=2, s="abba"

us = {'a','b'}

Loop:

- a: win = {'a'}, len(win) != 2

- b: win = {'a','b'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b'], ps = 1, win = set()

- b: win = {'b'}, len(win) != 2

- a: win = {'b','a'}, len(win) == 2 -> ans = ['b','a'], ps = 2, win = set()

Since ps = 2 >= n=3? No, ps=2 < n=3, so print 'NO'

Then, win = set(), us = {'a','b'}, pick 'a'

Output: ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a' * (3 -2 -1) = 'b' + 'a' + '' = 'ba'

But in s="abba", 'ba' is a subsequence (positions 2 and 4: 'bb', but 'ba' is not present).

Wait, in "abba", is 'ba' a subsequence? Positions 1 ('a') and 4 ('a') give 'aa', not 'ba'. Positions 2 ('b') and 3 ('b') give 'bb', not 'ba'. Positions 2 ('b') and 4 ('a') give 'ba'.

Wait, so 'ba' is present in "abba" as a subsequence.

But according to the program, it outputs 'ba' as a missing string, but it's actually present.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first test case, with s="abba", n=2, k=2, the program outputs 'YES', which is correct.

But in this case, n=3, k=2, s="abba", ps=2 < n=3, so 'NO', and outputs 'ba', but 'ba' is present, which is incorrect.

Hence, this is a counterexample where the program is wrong.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is:

**False**
