Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them to maximize something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 2]. The beauty would be (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. Another arrangement could be [1, 2, 3], which gives (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Yet another arrangement is [3, 1, 2], which gives (1-3) + (2-1) = (-2) + 1 = -1.

From these examples, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. In the first arrangement, it's not sorted, and the beauty is 1. In the second, sorted arrangement, it's 2. In the third, it's -1.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for the input [2, 1, 3], the explanation says rearranging to [1, 2, 3] gives a beauty of 2, which matches what I just calculated.

So, maybe the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order. Let's see another example from the problem: [69, 69, 69]. No matter how you arrange them, the differences will always be 0, so beauty is 0.

Another example: [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. If sorted, it becomes [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty would be (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches the sample output.

Okay, so it seems that sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty. But why?

Let's think about the sum: sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. This simplifies to a_n - a_1. Because when you expand the sum:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the arranged array.

Wait, that's interesting. So, no matter how you arrange the array, the beauty is just the last element minus the first element.

In the first example, [1, 2, 3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2.

In the second example, [69, 69, 69], it's 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third example, [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], it's 100 - 43 = 57.

Yes, that seems to hold true.

So, to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize (an - a1), where an is the last element and a1 is the first element.

To maximize this difference, I should minimize a1 and maximize an.

So, to minimize a1, I should set a1 to the smallest element in the array, and set an to the largest element.

Wait, but I have to arrange the entire array. So, if I set a1 to the smallest and an to the largest, what about the elements in between?

Well, according to the sum simplifying to an - a1, the elements in between don't affect the beauty. So, as long as a1 is the smallest and an is the largest, the beauty is maximized.

But, is this always true? Let's test with an example.

Take [2, 1, 3]. If I set a1 to 1 and an to 3, beauty is 3 - 1 = 2.

If I set a1 to 1 and an to 2, beauty is 2 - 1 = 1.

If I set a1 to 2 and an to 3, beauty is 3 - 2 = 1.

So, indeed, setting a1 to the smallest and an to the largest gives the maximum beauty.

Another example: [69, 69, 69]. All elements are the same, so beauty is 69 - 69 = 0.

And [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]: 100 - 43 = 57.

So, it seems that the beauty is always the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the maximum element minus the minimum element.

Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention rearranging the array, and in the code, they sort the array.

But according to this, I don't need to sort the entire array; I just need to find the maximum and minimum elements and subtract them.

But sorting the array in ascending order would achieve the same thing, as the first element would be the minimum and the last element would be the maximum.

So, both approaches are valid.

But sorting might be unnecessary if I can just find the min and max.

Let me check with the code provided.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n, the length of the array.

- Reads the array as input.

- Converts the input string to a list of integers.

- Calls func_1(a, num2), which seems to check if the array is already sorted in ascending order.

- If func_1 returns True, prints 0.

- Else, sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with what I just concluded.

According to my reasoning, the beauty is always max(a) - min(a), regardless of the arrangement.

But according to this code, if the array is already sorted in ascending order, it prints 0, otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, in the first example, [2,1,3], which is not sorted, it sorts it to [1,2,3] and calculates beauty as 2, which is correct.

If the array is already sorted, like [1,2,3], then according to the code, it would print 0, but according to my reasoning, it should print 2.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread func_1.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(a, num2):

order = 0

for i in range(1, num2):

if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:

order += 1

if order == 0:

return True

else:

return False

This function checks if the array is strictly increasing. If it is, it returns True; else, False.

Then, in the main code, if func_1(a, num2) is True, it prints 0; else, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

But according to my reasoning, if the array is already strictly increasing, the beauty should be a_n - a1, which is not necessarily 0.

So, this seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if it is, the beauty is 0.

But that's not correct, as in the first example, [1,2,3] has beauty 2, not 0.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the func_1.

Let's see: func_1 counts the number of pairs where a[i-1] >= a[i]. If there are no such pairs, the array is strictly increasing, and it returns True.

Then, if the array is strictly increasing, it prints 0; else, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

This seems incorrect because, in the strictly increasing case, the beauty should be a_n - a1, which is positive, not 0.

So, this suggests that the code is wrong.

But perhaps I misread the condition.

Wait, maybe the func_1 is checking if the array is non-decreasing.

Let's see:

For [1,2,3], a[i-1] < a[i] for all i, so order remains 0, func_1 returns True, and it prints 0, which is incorrect because beauty should be 2.

For [69,69,69], a[i-1] <= a[i], but since a[i-1] == a[i], order increases, but wait:

func_1 increments order if a[i-1] >= a[i]. In [69,69,69], a[i-1] == a[i], so order increases, so func_1 returns False, and it sorts the array and calculates beauty as 0, which is correct.

Wait, but in the first case, [1,2,3], func_1 returns True, and prints 0, which is incorrect because beauty should be 2.

So, the code is wrong in that case.

Perhaps the condition should be if the array is strictly increasing, calculate the beauty; else, sort it and calculate.

But according to the code, it's doing the opposite.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

"Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain, if he can rearrange its elements in any way."

So, we need to rearrange the array to maximize the beauty.

According to the problem, beauty is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

As I reasoned earlier, this sum simplifies to a_n - a1, where a1 is the first element and a_n is the last element in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, we need to maximize a_n - a1, which means setting a1 to the minimum value and a_n to the maximum value.

So, sorting the array in ascending order achieves this.

Then, why does the code check if the array is already sorted and prints 0 in that case?

That doesn't make sense.

Looking back at the code:

if func_1(a, num2):

print(0)

else:

b = sorted(a)

for x in range(1, num2):

beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]

print(beauty)

According to this, if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order, it prints 0; else, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

But according to my reasoning, it should always sort the array in ascending order to maximize beauty.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
