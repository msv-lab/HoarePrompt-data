Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and there are multiple queries. Each query gives me a range within this array, and I need to find two indices within that range such that the elements at those indices are different. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 -1.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an array a of length n, and q queries. For each query, I get l and r, which define a subarray from index l to r (inclusive). I need to find two indices i and j in this subarray where a[i] != a[j]. If no such pair exists, I return -1 -1.

I should consider the constraints. The array can be up to 2*10^5 elements, and there can be up to 2*10^5 queries. Also, there are multiple test cases, up to 10^4, but the total sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) or O(n log n) time in total.

Let me think about how to approach this. For each query, if all elements in the subarray are the same, there's no such pair; otherwise, there is. So, I need a way to quickly determine if all elements in a given range are identical.

One way is to precompute the frequencies of elements or keep track of the distinct elements in each range. But that might be too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, if I can determine for each query if all elements in the range are the same, I can decide whether to output -1 -1 or some pair of indices.

How can I optimize this? Maybe I can preprocess the array to find where changes occur.

Let me consider keeping track of the positions where the element changes. That is, where a[i] != a[i-1].

If I have a list of these positions, then for any query, I can check if there's at least one change within the range.

If there is at least one change, then there exists a pair with different elements; otherwise, all elements are the same.

This sounds promising.

So, I can iterate through the array and record the positions where a[i] != a[i-1].

Then, for each query, I need to check if there's any such position between l and r.

If there is, output any such pair; if not, output -1 -1.

But I need to output specific indices i and j, not just yes or no.

So, for pairs where a[i] != a[j], I can choose the first and the last indices if there's a change in between.

Wait, to make it simple, I can iterate through the query ranges and find the first index where a[i] != a[l-1], and then choose that index and l.

But I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, preprocess the array to find positions where a[i] != a[i-1], let's call them change points.

Then, for each query [l, r], check if there's any change point in between l and r.

If there is, find the first index i where a[i] != a[l-1], and set j = l.

Otherwise, all elements are the same, output -1 -1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that i and j are within [l, r].

Also, I need to handle the case where l = r, but according to the constraints, l <= r, but in the problem statement, it's l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, and i and j can be the same or different, as long as a[i] != a[j].

But in the problem, it's specified that l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, and a_i != a_j.

Wait, but if l = r, then i and j must both be l, but a[l] != a[l] is false, so in that case, it's impossible, but according to the constraints, l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, and a_i != a_j, so if l = r, it's impossible, so we should output -1 -1.

But in the input description, it says 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the example, l can be equal to r.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the example, some queries have l = r.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the example, all queries have l < r.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the sample input, some queries have l = r.

Wait, checking the problem statement again: "Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)."

In the sample input, there are queries where l = r.

Wait, in the first test case, query 2 has l = 1, r = 2, and query 3 has l = 1, r = 3.

Wait, actually, in the first test case, all queries have l < r.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it allows l = r.

But in the sample input, there are no l = r queries.

So, I need to handle the case when l = r.

In that case, since i and j must be within [l, r], and l = r, then i = j = l, but a[l] != a[l] is false, so output -1 -1.

But in the problem description, it says "find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r and l ≤ j ≤ r and a_i != a_j."

So, if l = r, it's impossible, so output -1 -1.

But in the input description, it says "the boundaries of the query."

And in the sample input, all queries have l < r.

But in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.

So, to be safe, I should handle l = r cases.

But in the sample input, l < r, so maybe it's safe to assume l < r, but according to the problem statement, l can be equal to r.

I think I should handle l = r cases.

So, in code, if l = r, output -1 -1.

Otherwise, proceed to check if there's any change in the range.

Now, back to the preprocessing idea.

I can iterate through the array and record the positions where a[i] != a[i-1].

Then, for each query [l, r], check if there's any such position in between l and r.

If there is, find the first index i where a[i] != a[l-1], and set j = l.

Wait, but indices are 1-based in the problem, so I need to be careful with indexing in code.

Alternatively, I can use a different approach.

Another way is to precompute for each position, the next position where a different element appears.

Like, for each i, find the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i].

Then, for each query [l, r], check if there's any j in [l+1, r] such that a[j] != a[l].

If such a j exists, output l and j.

Otherwise, output -1 -1.

This seems feasible.

But precomputing the next different element for each position could be efficient.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can iterate through the array and keep track of stretches where elements are the same.

Then, for each query, check if the subarray from l to r has only one unique element or not.

But I need an efficient way to handle many queries.

An efficient way is to use a sparse table to find the minimum and maximum in the range; if min != max, then there's a pair with different elements.

But since the array can have up to 2*10^5 elements and q up to 2*10^5 queries, using a sparse table is acceptable in terms of time and space.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, in the problem, elements are up to 10^6, but I need to find if there's at least two different elements in the range.

So, I can use a frequency array or a set, but that would be too slow for the constraints.

Wait, no, for each query, I can't afford to iterate through the range each time.

So, I need a way to quickly determine if there's more than one unique element in the range.

An efficient way is to use a segment tree that stores the set of elements in each range, but that's too slow for the constraints.

Alternatively, use a sparse table to store the minimum and maximum in each range; if min != max, then there's a pair with different elements.

Yes, that's a good approach.

So, I can build a sparse table for range minimum and another for range maximum.

Then, for each query, check if the minimum and maximum in the range are different.

If they are, output any i and j where a[i] != a[j].

If not, output -1 -1.

But how do I find specific indices i and j where a[i] != a[j]?

Well, if min != max, I can find the first index in the range where a[i] != a[l], and set j = l.

Wait, no, I need to make sure that i and j are both within [l, r].

A better way is to find the first index in [l, r] where a[i] != a[l-1], and set j = l.

But indices are 1-based, so in code, I need to adjust for 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the array a, indices start from 1 to n.

In code, if I use 0-based indexing, a[0] corresponds to a_1.

So, I need to be careful with indexing.

Wait, in the problem, indices are 1-based, but in code, arrays are 0-based.

So, in code, a[0] is a_1, a[1] is a_2, and so on.

So, for a query [l, r], it's a[l-1] to a[r-1] in code.

If min != max in [l-1, r-1], then there exists i and j where a[i] != a[j].

To find specific i and j, I can iterate from l to r and find the first index i where a[i-1] != a[l-1], and set j = l.

If no such i exists, output -1 -1.

This should work.

But iterating through each query range would be too slow if q is up to 2*10^5.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, I can precompute for each position, the next position where a different element appears.

Then, for each query, using this precomputed array, find the first i in [l, r] where a[i] != a[l-1].

But I need to make sure that i is within [l, r].

Wait, here's a better idea.

I can precompute for each position i, the next position j > i where a[j] != a[i].

Then, for each query [l, r], check if next[l-1] <= r.

If it is, then set i = next[l-1], j = l.

Otherwise, output -1 -1.

This seems efficient.

Let me try to formalize this.

Precompute next[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

next[i] is the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i].

If no such j exists, set next[i] = n+1 or some value outside the range.

Then, for each query [l, r], if next[l-1] <= r, output next[l-1] and l.

Otherwise, output -1 -1.

This should work.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

In code, I need to:

1. Read t test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n.

b. Read the array a of n integers.

c. Read q.

d. For each query, read l and r, and output the result.

But I need to make sure that the total time is efficient.

Given that n and q can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n + q) solution per test case.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5", and similarly for q.

So, total n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and total q is up to 2*10^5.

Therefore, I can have an O(n + q) total time complexity.

So, per test case, O(n + q) is acceptable.

Now, implementing the precompute next[i] for each i.

I can iterate from the end of the array to the start, and for each i, if a[i] != a[i+1], set next[i] = i+1; else, next[i] = next[i+1].

This way, next[i] is the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i], or n+1 if no such j exists.

Then, for each query [l, r], if next[l-1] <= r, output next[l-1] and l; else, output -1 -1.

This seems correct and efficient.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1,1,2,1,1]

q = 3

Queries:

1 5

1 2

1 3

So, a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=2, a[3]=1, a[4]=1

Compute next[i]:

next[4] = 5 (since j=5 >4 and a[5] doesn't exist, so no change)

next[3] = 4 (a[4]=1 == a[3]=1, so next[3] = next[4] =5)

next[2] = 3 (a[3]=1 != a[2]=2, so next[2]=3)

next[1] = 2 (a[2]=2 != a[1]=1, so next[1]=2)

next[0] =1 (a[1]=1 == a[0]=1, so next[0]=next[1]=2)

Wait, no.

According to the rule:

If a[i] != a[i+1], next[i] = i+1

Else, next[i] = next[i+1]

So, for i=4, a[4]=1, a[5] doesn't exist, so next[4] =5

For i=3, a[3]=1 == a[4]=1, so next[3] = next[4] =5

For i=2, a[2]=2 != a[3]=1, so next[2] =3

For i=1, a[1]=1 == a[2]=2, so next[1] = next[2] =3

For i=0, a[0]=1 == a[1]=1, so next[0] = next[1] =3

So, next = [3,3,3,5,5]

Now, for query 1 5:

l=1, r=5

next[0]=3 <=5, so output next[0]=3 and l=1, which is 3 and 1, but in the sample output, it's 2 3.

Wait, but a[1]=1 != a[3]=2, which is correct.

But in the sample output, it's 2 3.

Well, any valid pair is acceptable, so 2 3 is also correct because a[2]=2 != a[3]=1.

So, my approach of outputting next[l-1] and l is acceptable, as long as next[l-1] <=r.

In this case, next[0]=3 <=5, so output 3 and 1, which is acceptable.

Similarly, for query 1 2:

l=1, r=2

next[0]=3 >2, so output -1 -1, which matches the sample output.

For query 1 3:

l=1, r=3

next[0]=3 <=3, so output 3 and 1.

But in the sample output, it's 1 3.

Well, 3 and 1 is the same as 1 and 3, as order doesn't matter.

So, my approach is correct.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

q=5

Queries:

1 2

2 3

2 4

2 6

3 5

Compute next[i]:

i=5: next[5]=6

i=4: a[4]=10 == a[5]=20, so next[4]=5

i=3: a[3]=10 != a[4]=10, so next[3]=4

i=2: a[2]=20 == a[3]=10, so next[2]=3

i=1: a[1]=20 == a[2]=20, so next[1]=next[2]=3

i=0: a[0]=30 != a[1]=20, so next[0]=1

So, next=[1,3,3,4,5,6]

Now, for queries:

1 2: l=1, r=2

next[0]=1 <=2, so output 1 and 1, which is 1 and 1, but a[1]=30 != a[1]=30 is false.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2 1, which is a[2]=20 != a[1]=30.

So, my approach outputs 1 and 1, which is incorrect because a[1] == a[1].

Wait, I need to make sure that i and j are different.

So, perhaps I should choose i = l and j = next[l-1], ensuring i != j.

In this case, l=1, next[0]=1, so i=1, j=1, which is invalid.

But in the sample output, it's 2 1.

So, in this case, my approach fails.

Hence, I need to adjust my approach.

Alternative approach:

For each query [l, r], find the first index i in [l, r] where a[i-1] != a[l-1].

If such an i exists, set j = l, and i = that index.

Otherwise, output -1 -1.

In the above example, for query 1 2:

a[0]=30, a[1]=20 != a[0], so i=2, j=1.

Which matches the sample output 2 1.

Similarly, for query 2 3:

a[1]=20, a[2]=20 == a[1], so no such i exists, output -1 -1.

But in the sample output, it's -1 -1.

For query 2 4:

a[1]=20, a[2]=20 == a[1], a[3]=10 != a[1], so i=4, j=2.

Wait, indices are 1-based.

a[1]=30, a[2]=20 != a[1], so i=2, j=1.

Wait, but in the sample output, for query 1 2, it's 2 1.

So, perhaps I should set i = l, and j = next[l-1], ensuring j <= r and j != i.

Wait, in the first test case, query 1 5:

next[0]=3, which is within [1,5], so output 3 and 1.

Similarly, query 1 2:

next[0]=1, which is l=1, so i=1, j=1, which is invalid.

So, in this case, I need to find the next[i] where next[i] != l.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] != a[l-1], and j=l.

In the first test case, query 1 5:

a[l-1]=a[0]=1

Find the smallest i >=1 where a[i-1] !=1, which is i=3 (a[2]=2 !=1), so output i=3, j=1.

For query 1 2:

Find the smallest i >=1 where a[i-1] !=1, which is i=3, but i=3 > r=2, so output -1 -1.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's -1 -1, which matches.

For query 1 3:

Find the smallest i >=1 where a[i-1] !=1, which is i=3 (a[2]=2 !=1), and i=3 <= r=3, so output 3 and 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

q=5

Queries:

1 2

2 3

2 4

2 6

3 5

Compute next[i]:

next=[1,3,3,4,5,6]

For query 1 2:

a[l-1]=a[0]=30

Find the smallest i >=1 where a[i-1] !=30, which is i=2 (a[1]=20 !=30), so output 2 and 1.

Which matches the sample output 2 1.

For query 2 3:

a[l-1]=a[1]=20

Find the smallest i >=2 where a[i-1] !=20, which is i=4 (a[3]=10 !=20), but i=4 > r=3, so output -1 -1.

Which matches the sample output.

For query 2 4:

a[l-1]=a[1]=20

Find the smallest i >=2 where a[i-1] !=20, which is i=4 (a[3]=10 !=20), i=4 <= r=4, so output 4 and 2.

Which matches the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Hence, in code, for each query [l, r], find the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] != a[l-1].

If such an i exists and i <=r, output i and l.

Otherwise, output -1 -1.

To implement this efficiently, I can precompute the next[i] array as before.

Then, for each query, check if next[l-1] <=r.

If yes, output next[l-1] and l.

Else, output -1 -1.

But in the earlier example, for query 1 2:

next[0]=1 <=2, so output 1 and 1, which is invalid.

But according to the adjusted approach, find the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1], which is i=2, since a[1]=20 != a[0]=30.

So, output 2 and 1.

Hence, I need to adjust the precompute next[i] to be the smallest j >=i where a[j-1] !=a[l-1].

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the precompute.

Wait, maybe I should iterate from l to r and find the first i where a[i-1] !=a[l-1].

To optimize this, I can precompute for each position l, the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1].

Wait, this seems similar to the next array.

Wait, perhaps I need to precompute for each l, the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1].

I can compute this for all l, but it's essentially the same as the next array.

Hence, with the next array as defined earlier, for each l, next[l-1] is the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1].

Then, for each query [l, r], if next[l-1] <=r, output next[l-1] and l; else, output -1 -1.

In the earlier example, for query 1 2:

next[0]=1 <=2, but outputting 1 and 1 is invalid.

But according to the approach, find the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1], which is i=2.

But next[0]=1, which corresponds to i=1, but a[0] !=a[0], which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the definition.

Let me redefine the next array.

Let me define next[i] as the smallest j > i where a[j-1] !=a[i-1].

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing.

Let me define next[i] as the smallest j > i where a[j] !=a[i].

Wait, in 0-based indexing, a[i] corresponds to a_{i+1}.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to define next[i] in 0-based indexing.

next[i] = smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i]

Then, for query [l, r], which is a[l-1] to a[r-1] in 0-based indexing.

I need to find if there exists j > l-1 where a[j] != a[l-1] and j <=r-1.

If next[l-1] <=r-1, then output next[l-1]+1 and l.

Else, output -1 -1.

In the first test case, query 1 2:

l-1=0, next[0]=1 <= r-1=1, so output next[0]+1=2 and l=1.

Which is 2 and 1, matching the sample output.

Perfect.

In the second test case, query 2 3:

l-1=1, next[1]=3 > r-1=2, so output -1 -1.

Correct.

Hence, this approach works.

In code, I need to:

- For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a (0-based)

- Read q

- For each query, read l and r

- Precompute next[i] for i from 0 to n-1

- next[n-1] = n if a[n-1] == a[n-1], else n+1 (but n+1 is out of bounds)

- Actually, since j > i, next[i] is the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i]

- So, iterate from n-1 to 0:

- if a[i] != a[i+1], next[i] = i+1

- else, next[i] = next[i+1]

- Handle i=n-1: next[n-1] = n if a[n-1] == a[n-1], else n+1. Wait, a[n-1] is always equal to itself, so next[n-1] = n+1.

- But in previous examples, I set next[n-1] =n.

Wait, need to be careful.

In 0-based indexing:

- next[i] is the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i]

- For i = n-1, there is no j > i, so next[n-1] = n

- But a[n] doesn't exist, so if j = n, it's out of bounds.

- So, next[n-1] = n

- For i from n-2 downto 0:

- if a[i] != a[i+1], next[i] = i+1

- else, next[i] = next[i+1]

Then, for each query [l, r], which is a[l-1] to a[r-1]:

- if next[l-1] <= r-1, output next[l-1]+1 and l

- else, output -1 -1

In the first test case, query 1 5:

next[0]=2, r-1=4, 2 <=4, so output 3 and 1

Wait, in previous calculations, next[0]=3 <=4, output 4 and 1.

Wait, confusion again.

Wait, in 0-based:

next[0]=2, which is j=2 > i=0 where a[2]!=a[0]

But in 1-based, it's j=3 and i=1.

Wait, in sample output, it's 2 3, which is i=2, j=3.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to output j and i, not i and j.

Wait, in sample output, it's 2 3, which is i=2, j=3.

But according to my approach, next[0]=2 <=4, so output next[0]+1=3 and l=1.

Which is j=3, i=1.

But in sample output, it's i=2, j=3.

Wait, so perhaps I need to output l and next[l-1], instead of next[l-1] and l.

Wait, in the first test case, query 1 5:

next[0]=2, so output l=1 and next[0]+1=3, which is 1 and 3.

But in sample output, it's 2 and 3.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to find the smallest i >=l where a[i-1] !=a[l-1], and set j = next[l-1], i = l.

Wait, perhaps I need to set i = l, j = next[l-1].

But in the first test case, query 1 5:

i=1, j=3.

Sample output is i=2, j=3.

But both are correct since a[1]=1 != a[3]=2.

So, it's acceptable.

Hence, in code, for each query, if next[l-1] <=r, output l and next[l-1], else -1 -1.

In 1-based indexing, next[l-1] is the first index after l-1 where a[j] !=a[l-1].

So, in 1-based, next[l-1] +1 is the index.

Wait, in code, next[l-1] is a 0-based index, so next[l-1] +1 is 1-based.

But need to output two 1-based indices.

Hence, output l and next[l-1]+1.

In the first test case, l=1, next[0]=2, so output 1 and 3.

Which is acceptable, as a[1]=1 != a[3]=2.

Similarly, in the second test case, query 1 2:

next[0]=1, which is l=1 and next[0]+1=2, which is a[1]=30 != a[2]=20.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, this approach is correct.

Now, implement this in code.

Also, need to handle the case when l=r.

In that case, output -1 -1, since i and j must be within [l, r], and l=r, so only one index available.

But according to the problem statement, l <= r, and in the sample input, l < r, but in the problem statement, l can be equal to r.

Hence, in code, if l == r, output -1 -1.

Otherwise, proceed with the above approach.

Also, need to make sure that next[l-1] <= r.

In code, next[l-1] is 0-based, so next[l-1] <= r-1.

If yes, output l and next[l-1]+1.

Else, output -1 -1.

Now, implement this.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so total time should be O(n + q) overall.

Hence, this approach is acceptable.

Now, proceed to code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine for each query whether there exists a pair of different elements within a specified range in the array. If such a pair exists, we output any two indices that satisfy the condition; otherwise, we output `-1 -1`.

### Approach

1. **Precompute Next Array**:
   - We precompute an array `next` where for each index `i`, `next[i]` is the smallest index `j > i` such that `a[j] != a[i]`.
   - This is achieved by iterating from the end of the array and setting:
     - If `a[i] != a[i+1]`, then `next[i] = i+1`.
     - Else, `next[i] = next[i+1]`.

2. **Handle Each Query**:
   - For each query with range `[l, r]`, we check if `next[l-1]` is within the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `next[l-1] <= r`, we output `l` and `next[l-1] + 1` (since `next[l-1]` is 0-based).
   - If `next[l-1] > r` or if `l == r`, we output `-1 -1`.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx+1])
            queries.append((l, r))
            idx += 2
        
        # Precompute next array
        next = [0] * n
        next[n-1] = n if a[n-1] == a[n-1] else n+1
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if a[i] != a[i+1]:
                next[i] = i+1
            else:
                next[i] = next[i+1]
        
        # Answer queries
        for l, r in queries:
            if l == r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                if next[l-1] <= r:
                    print(l, next[l-1]+1)
                else:
                    print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Precompute Next Array**:
  - We iterate from the end of the array to compute the `next` array efficiently.
  - For each position `i`, `next[i]` holds the smallest index `j > i` where `a[j] != a[i]`.

- **Handle Each Query**:
  - For each query, check if there is a different element within the specified range.
  - If such an element exists, output the indices of any such pair; otherwise, output `-1 -1`.

This approach ensures that we handle multiple test cases efficiently, adhering to the problem's constraints.
