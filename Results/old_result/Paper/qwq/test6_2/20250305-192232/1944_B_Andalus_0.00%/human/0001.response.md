Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2 floor. I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. 

Specifically, l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array, and r should be a subset of the last n elements. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of the elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in r. And it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting some elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging them. So, order doesn't matter here, which is important because XOR is commutative and associative. That means the order in which we XOR the elements doesn't matter; the result will be the same.

So, my goal is to select some elements from the first n elements and some from the last n elements such that the XOR of the selected elements from the first half equals the XOR of the selected elements from the second half.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, that means in the first n elements, some numbers will be present, and their duplicates are in the last n elements, but not necessarily in the same positions.

I need to find a way to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR of a set of numbers is essentially the bitwise sum modulo 2. One important property is that the XOR of a set of numbers is equal to the XOR of any permutation of that set, and XOR is associative and commutative.

Another thing to consider is that if I have two sets with the same XOR, then the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Given that it's guaranteed that a solution exists, I don't need to handle the case where no solution is possible.

Let me look at the example provided to get some intuition.

In the first test case:

n = 2, k = 1

Array: [1, 2, 2, 1]

So, first n elements: [1, 2]

Last n elements: [2, 1]

Possible l and r:

l = [2, 1], r = [2, 1]

XOR of l: 2 XOR 1 = 3

XOR of r: 2 XOR 1 = 3

Which matches.

Another test case:

n = 6, k = 1

Array: [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First n elements: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Last n elements: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Possible l and r:

l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

XOR of l: 6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR of r: 1 XOR 3 = 2

Which matches.

So, in both examples, they selected pairs of elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

Now, I need to find a general approach that works for any n and k within the given constraints.

Constraints:

- t (number of test cases) <= 5000

- n <= 5*10^4 per test case

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 5*10^4

- Time constraints: 4 seconds, memory: 1024 megabytes

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select subsets from the first n and the last n elements, I need to consider the distribution of these numbers.

I can start by identifying which numbers appear in the first n elements and which appear in the last n elements.

But since each number appears exactly twice, some numbers will have both occurrences in the first n, some in the last n, and some in both.

Wait, no. Since the total length is 2n, and each number appears exactly twice, it's possible for both occurrences of a number to be in the first n or both in the last n, or one in each.

But, given that, I need to select subsets from each half such that their XORs are equal.

I need to select 2k elements from each half.

Wait, no, I need to select subsets from each half such that the XOR of the selected elements is equal.

The subsets don't have to be of size 2k, but they must have exactly 2k elements.

Wait, the problem says:

"two arrays l and r each of length 2k such that:

- l is a subset of [a1, a2, … an]

- r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, … a2n]

- bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r; in other words, l1 ⊕ l2 ⊕ … ⊕ l2k = r1 ⊕ r2 ⊕ … ⊕ r2k"

So, yes, each subset must have exactly 2k elements.

And I need to output the elements of l and r, in any order.

Given that, I need to select exactly 2k elements from the first n and exactly 2k elements from the last n, such that their XORs are equal.

Given that it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, I need to find any such pair.

Now, one way to approach this is to consider the properties of XOR and how it behaves with subsets.

But considering the time constraints, I need an efficient way to find such subsets.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first n and the XOR of all elements in the last n.

Let's denote:

xor_l = XOR of all elements in the first n

xor_r = XOR of all elements in the last n

Now, if I select a subset of 2k elements from the first n with XOR s, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first n would be xor_l ⊕ s.

Similarly, if I select a subset of 2k elements from the last n with XOR s, the XOR of the remaining elements in the last n would be xor_r ⊕ s.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where each number is represented as a vector in a vector space, and XOR is the vector addition.

But that might be too slow for n up to 5*10^4 per test case.

Let me think differently.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, I can consider the pairs of their occurrences.

For each number from 1 to n, I have two positions where it appears.

I can group the numbers based on whether both occurrences are in the first n, both in the last n, or one in each.

Let me define:

- Type A: both occurrences are in the first n

- Type B: both occurrences are in the last n

- Type C: one occurrence in the first n and one in the last n

Now, for Type A numbers, both copies are in the first n, so if I select both in l, their XOR contributes 0 (since x ⊕ x = 0).

Similarly, for Type B numbers, both copies are in the last n, so selecting both in r contributes 0.

For Type C numbers, one copy is in the first n and the other in the last n, so selecting the one in the first n for l and the one in the last n for r would contribute x ⊕ x = 0.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements in total for l and 2k for r.

Wait, no, I need to select subsets l and r each with exactly 2k elements.

But in the example, for k=1, they selected 2 elements in l and 2 elements in r.

Wait, no, wait: "each of length 2k", so for k=1, 2k=2 elements in each.

Wait, no, the problem says "each of length 2k", so for k=1, 2k=2 elements in each.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, k=1, so 2k=2 elements in each.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1, so 2k=2 elements in each.

Wait, but in the last test case, n=6, k=2, so 2k=4 elements in each.

Yes, so I need to select exactly 2k elements from the first n and exactly 2k elements from the last n, such that the XOR of the selected elements in l equals the XOR of the selected elements in r.

Now, considering the types:

- Type A: both in first n

- Type B: both in last n

- Type C: one in first n, one in last n

For Type A numbers, if I select both in l, their XOR is 0. If I select none in l, their contribution is also 0.

For Type B numbers, similarly, selecting both in r gives XOR 0, and selecting none gives XOR 0.

For Type C numbers, if I select the one in l and the one in r, their XOR in l and r would both be x, so their XORs would be equal.

Wait, but in that case, l would have x and r would have x, so l XOR is x and r XOR is x, which matches.

Alternatively, if I don't select the Type C number in l or r, their contribution is 0.

So, perhaps I can group the Type A and Type B numbers to contribute certain XOR values, and use Type C numbers to adjust the XOR as needed.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Given that it's guaranteed that a solution exists, and considering the constraints, I need an efficient way to find such subsets.

One idea is to select k pairs of Type C numbers, i.e., for k different numbers that have one occurrence in the first n and one in the last n, select the occurrence in the first n for l and the occurrence in the last n for r.

Since XOR is associative and commutative, the order doesn't matter.

In that case, l would be the selected Type C numbers from the first n, and r would be the corresponding Type C numbers from the last n.

The XOR of l would be the XOR of those selected Type C numbers, and the XOR of r would be the same, since they are the same numbers.

Thus, their XORs would match.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and 2k in r, which would be achieved by selecting k Type C numbers for l and r, each contributing 2 elements (one in l and one in r).

Wait, no. If I select k Type C numbers, each contributing one element to l and one to r, then l would have k elements and r would have k elements.

But I need l and r each to have 2k elements.

Wait, maybe I need to select 2k Type C numbers.

But in the first test case, n=2, k=1, and there are two Type C numbers: 1 and 2, both appearing once in the first n and once in the last n.

Selecting both for l and r would give l=[2,1] and r=[2,1], which matches the first test case.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1, so select 2 Type C numbers.

Looking at the array: [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First n: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Last n: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Looking at the numbers:

1 appears at positions 4 and 9

2 appears at positions 3 and 5

3 appears at positions 6 and 8

4 appears at positions 2 and 12

5 appears at positions 10 and 11

6 appears at positions 1 and 7

So, Type C numbers are those where one occurrence is in first n and one in last n.

For 1: positions 4 (first n) and 9 (last n)

For 2: positions 3 (first n) and 5 (first n), so both in first n -> Type A

For 3: positions 6 (first n) and 8 (last n)

For 4: positions 2 (first n) and 12 (last n)

For 5: positions 10 (last n) and 11 (last n) -> Type B

For 6: positions 1 (first n) and 7 (last n)

So, Type C numbers are 1,3,4,6

Type A: 2

Type B: 5

So, in the second test case, selecting 2k=2 elements for l and r.

One possible selection is l=[6,4], r=[6,4], but in the example, they selected l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

Wait, 6 and 4 are both Type C, so selecting them from first n to l and from last n to r would give l=[6,4] and r=[6,4], but they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which also works because 6 XOR 4 = 2 and 1 XOR 3 = 2.

So, their XORs match.

So, it's not necessary to select the same Type C numbers for l and r, as long as the total XOR matches.

So, perhaps I can select different Type C numbers for l and r, as long as their XORs are equal.

But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, perhaps I can select some Type A and Type B numbers to adjust the XOR.

Wait, for Type A numbers, since both are in the first n, selecting both would give XOR 0, or selecting none would also give XOR 0.

Similarly, for Type B, selecting both or none gives XOR 0.

For Type C, selecting one in l and one in r gives XOR x in both l and r.

So, perhaps I can select some Type C numbers to contribute their XOR to l and r, and use Type A and Type B to adjust the XOR as needed.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think about the total number of Type C numbers.

Since n can be up to 5*10^4 and k up to n/2, I need an efficient way.

Maybe I can try to select k Type C numbers for l and r, but ensure that their XORs match.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and r, so for each Type C number selected, I add one element to l and one to r.

So, to get 2k elements in l and r, I need to select k Type C numbers for l and r.

But in the second test case, they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which are different Type C numbers.

So, their XORs happen to be equal.

But how to generalize this?

Wait, maybe I can select any k Type C numbers for l and r, and output the corresponding elements.

But in the second test case, selecting l=[6,4] and r=[1,3] works because 6 XOR 4 = 2 and 1 XOR 3 = 2.

But if I select different Type C numbers, their XORs might not match.

So, I need a way to ensure that the XORs match.

Perhaps I can precompute the XOR of all possible Type C numbers and find a combination that matches.

But that sounds too time-consuming.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first n is S, and in the last n is T.

I need to select subsets l from first n and r from last n, each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me denote XOR(l) = A and XOR(r) = B, and I need A = B.

Also, the XOR of the remaining elements in the first n would be S ⊕ A, and in the last n would be T ⊕ B.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total XOR of all elements in the first n is S, and in the last n is T.

If I select subsets l and r with XOR A and B respectively, and I need A = B.

Also, the remaining elements in the first n have XOR S ⊕ A, and in the last n have XOR T ⊕ B.

But I don't have any constraints on the remaining elements, so maybe that's not useful.

Let me think differently.

Since each number appears exactly twice, and I need to select 2k elements from each half, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can group the Type C numbers and handle them separately from Type A and Type B.

Let me try to categorize the numbers:

- Type A: both occurrences in first n

- Type B: both occurrences in last n

- Type C: one in first n, one in last n

Let me count how many Type C numbers there are.

Each Type C number contributes one element to the first n and one to the last n.

Let me denote the set of Type C numbers as C.

For each c in C, I can choose to select c in l and c in r, which would contribute c to both l and r, so XOR(l) += c and XOR(r) += c.

Alternatively, I can choose not to select c in l and r.

For Type A numbers, I can choose to select both in l or neither, contributing 0 to XOR(l).

Similarly, for Type B numbers, select both in r or neither, contributing 0 to XOR(r).

So, perhaps I can select a subset of C, say S, and select those in l and r, which would make XOR(l) = XOR(S) and XOR(r) = XOR(S), thus satisfying the condition.

Then, I need to select additional elements from Type A and Type B to make up the required 2k elements in l and r.

Wait, but Type A and Type B selections would contribute 0 to XOR(l) and XOR(r), since selecting both copies contributes x ⊕ x = 0.

So, if I select S subset of C, and select both copies for Type A and Type B, their contributions are 0.

Thus, XOR(l) = XOR(S) and XOR(r) = XOR(S), which satisfies XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Now, I need to select S such that |S| = 2k.

Wait, no, I need to select 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Each c in C contributes one element to l and one to r.

So, to select 2k elements in l and r, I need to select k Type C numbers, each contributing one element to l and one to r, totaling 2k elements (since each Type C number contributes two elements, one in l and one in r).

Wait, no, if I select k Type C numbers, each contributing one element to l and one to r, then l would have k elements and r would have k elements.

But I need l and r each to have 2k elements.

Wait, maybe I need to select 2k Type C numbers.

But in the first test case, n=2, k=1, so 2k=2, and there are two Type C numbers: 1 and 2.

Selecting both would give l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], which matches the first test case.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1, 2k=2, and there are four Type C numbers: 1,3,4,6.

Selecting any two, say 6 and 4, gives l=[6,4] and r=[6,4], which works.

But in the example, they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which also works because 6 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 = 2.

So, selecting different Type C numbers for l and r, as long as their XORs match.

Wait, but in this approach, if I select different Type C numbers for l and r, I need to ensure that their XORs are equal.

So, perhaps selecting the same Type C numbers for l and r is the easiest way to ensure that.

But in the example, they selected different Type C numbers, which also worked.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways.

But to simplify, I can just select k Type C numbers for l and r, each contributing one element to l and one to r.

Thus, l would have k elements, each from Type C, and r would have k elements, each from Type C, corresponding to the same numbers.

Wait, but I need l and r each to have 2k elements.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, if I select k Type C numbers, and for each, select one for l and one for r, then l has k elements and r has k elements.

But I need l and r each to have 2k elements.

Wait, maybe I need to select 2k Type C numbers.

Then, select for l the first 2k Type C numbers from the first n, and for r, the corresponding from the last n.

But in the first test case, n=2, k=1, so 2k=2, and there are two Type C numbers: 1 and 2.

Selecting both for l and r gives l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], which works.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1, 2k=2, and there are four Type C numbers: 1,3,4,6.

Selecting any two, say 6 and 4, gives l=[6,4] and r=[6,4], which works.

Alternatively, selecting 1 and 3 gives l=[1,3] and r=[1,3], which also works.

But in the example, they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which also works because 6 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 = 2.

So, it's possible to select different Type C numbers for l and r, as long as their XORs match.

But to simplify, I can just select k Type C numbers for l and r, each contributing one element to l and one to r.

Wait, but that would give l and r each k elements, but I need 2k elements in each.

Wait, perhaps I need to select 2k Type C numbers, and select one from each for l and r.

Wait, no, if I select 2k Type C numbers, and for each, select one for l and one for r, then l and r each have 2k elements.

But in the first test case, n=2, k=1, 2k=2, and there are two Type C numbers: 1 and 2.

Selecting both gives l=[1,2] and r=[1,2].

Similarly, in the second test case, selecting 6 and 4 gives l=[6,4] and r=[6,4].

But in the example, they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which are different Type C numbers.

So, perhaps there is more flexibility.

But to ensure correctness and simplicity, I can just select k Type C numbers and duplicate them in l and r.

Wait, but in the first test case, selecting both Type C numbers gives l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], which is correct.

In the second test case, selecting 6 and 4 gives l=[6,4] and r=[6,4], which works.

But in the example, they selected l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which also works.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways.

But to make it simple, I can just select k Type C numbers and duplicate them in l and r.

But in the third test case:

n=4, k=1, 2k=2

Array: [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First n: [1,2,3,4]

Last n: [1,2,3,4]

Type C numbers: 1,2,3,4 (each appears once in first n and once in last n)

Selecting any two, say 1 and 2, gives l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], but in the example, they selected l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], but in the output, it's [1,2] and [1,2], but in the explanation, it's [1,2] and [1,2].

Wait, no, in the third test case, the output is:

1 2

1 2

But in the example output, it's:

1 2

1 2

So, it's consistent with selecting Type C numbers.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, k=2, 2k=4

Array: [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First n: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Last n: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Type C numbers:

1: positions 2 and 6 (both in first n) -> Type A

2: positions 7 and 11 (last n) -> Type B

3: positions 3 and 4 (both in first n) -> Type A

4: positions 9 and 10 (both in last n) -> Type B

5: positions 1 and 5 (both in first n) -> Type A

6: positions 8 and 12 (both in last n) -> Type B

Wait, but in the first n, 5 appears at positions 1 and 5, both in first n -> Type A

1 appears at positions 2 and 6, but position 6 is in last n? Wait, n=6, so first n is indices 1 to 6, last n is 7 to 12.

So, 1 is at positions 2 (first n) and 6 (first n) -> Type A

2 is at positions 7 (last n) and 11 (last n) -> Type B

3 is at positions 3 (first n) and 4 (first n) -> Type A

4 is at positions 9 (last n) and 10 (last n) -> Type B

5 is at positions 1 (first n) and 5 (first n) -> Type A

6 is at positions 8 (last n) and 12 (last n) -> Type B

So, there are no Type C numbers in this test case.

Wait, but in the output, l=[5,1,3,3] and r=[6,4,2,4]

Wait, but in this case, since there are no Type C numbers, how do I select l and r?

Wait, in this case, all numbers are Type A or Type B.

For Type A numbers, selecting both copies contributes 0 to XOR(l), and for Type B, selecting both contributes 0 to XOR(r).

So, if I select both copies of Type A numbers for l, and both copies of Type B numbers for r, their XORs would both be 0.

But in the output, l=[5,1,3,3] and r=[6,4,2,4]

Wait, in this case, Type A numbers are 1,3,5, and Type B are 2,4,6.

So, l is selecting both 1's and both 3's, and r is selecting both 2's and both 4's.

XOR(l) = 5 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 3 = 5 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 0 = 5 ⊕ 1 = 4

XOR(r) = 6 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 4 = 6 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 0 = 6 ⊕ 2 = 4

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = 4, which matches.

So, in this case, since there are no Type C numbers, I can select k Type A numbers and k Type B numbers, selecting both copies for l and r respectively.

In this case, for k=2, select two Type A numbers (1 and 3) and select both copies for l, and select two Type B numbers (2 and 4) and select both copies for r.

Thus, l=[1,1,3,3] and r=[2,2,4,4], which would have XOR(l) = 0 and XOR(r) = 0.

But in the output, it's l=[5,1,3,3] and r=[6,4,2,4], which also works because their XORs are equal.

Wait, but selecting l=[1,1,3,3] and r=[2,2,4,4] would give XOR(l) = 0 and XOR(r) = 0, which matches.

So, that's another possible solution.

So, in cases where there are no Type C numbers, I can select k Type A numbers and select both copies for l, and select k Type B numbers and select both copies for r.

Their XORs would both be 0.

In cases where there are Type C numbers, I can select k Type C numbers and select one copy for l and one for r.

Their XORs would be equal to the XOR of the selected Type C numbers.

If I have both Type C numbers and Type A and B, I can mix them.

But to keep it simple, I can prioritize selecting Type C numbers if available, and for the remaining, select Type A and Type B pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type C numbers available.

If there are at least k Type C numbers, I can select k Type C numbers and select one copy for l and one for r.

Then, for the remaining 2k - 2k = 0 elements, I don't need to select anything else.

If there are less than k Type C numbers, say m < k, then I can select m Type C numbers, and for the remaining k - m, select Type A numbers for l and Type B numbers for r.

Wait, but selecting Type A numbers for l by selecting both copies contributes 0 to XOR(l), and selecting Type B numbers for r contributes 0 to XOR(r).

So, overall, XOR(l) = XOR of selected Type C numbers, and XOR(r) = XOR of selected Type C numbers, plus the XOR of selected Type A and Type B numbers, which is 0.

Thus, XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Hence, this seems to work.

So, the general approach is:

1. Identify Type A, Type B, and Type C numbers.

2. If there are at least k Type C numbers:

a. Select k Type C numbers.

b. For each selected Type C number, select its copy in the first n for l and its copy in the last n for r.

c. This gives l and r each 2k elements, with XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR of selected Type C numbers.

3. If there are less than k Type C numbers, say m < k:

a. Select all m Type C numbers.

b. Select k - m Type A numbers and select both copies for l.

c. Select k - m Type B numbers and select both copies for r.

d. This gives l and r each 2k elements: m Type C numbers (2m elements) plus 2(k - m) elements from Type A and B.

e. XOR(l) = XOR of Type C numbers ⊕ XOR of selected Type A numbers (which is 0 since both copies are selected).

f. XOR(r) = XOR of Type C numbers ⊕ XOR of selected Type B numbers (which is 0 since both copies are selected).

g. Thus, XOR(l) = XOR(r).

This seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

First, I need to identify Type A, Type B, and Type C numbers.

To do that, I can track the positions of each number.

Given that n can be up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, with sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^4, I need an efficient way.

For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array of 2n elements.

- Find the positions of each number from 1 to n.

- Classify numbers into Type A, Type B, and Type C.

- If number x has both positions in first n: Type A

- Both in last n: Type B

- One in first n and one in last n: Type C

Then, proceed as per the above approach.

Implementing this should be efficient enough.

Now, looking at the given code, let's see if it follows this logic.

Looking at the code:

def func():

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

lft = lst[:n]

rgt = lst[n:]

ldb = []

rdb = []

sng = []

lft.sort()

rgt.sort()

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

sng.append(lft[i])

for i in range(1, n):

if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:

rdb.append(rgt[i])

sz = 0

for elem in ldb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

sz = 0

for elem in rdb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

So, the code sorts lft and rgt, then finds ldb (duplicates in lft) and rdb (duplicates in rgt), and sng (singleton in lft).

Then, it prints elements from ldb and sng for l, and from rdb and sng for r.

Wait, but in the approach I outlined, I need to select Type C numbers, which are those that appear once in lft and once in rgt.

But in this code, it's sorting lft and rgt and finding duplicates within each.

Wait, perhaps ldb are Type A numbers (duplicates in lft), rdb are Type B numbers (duplicates in rgt), and sng are Type C numbers (single in lft, must be in rgt).

Wait, but sng is defined as elements in lft that are not duplicates in lft.

But in reality, Type C numbers are those that appear once in lft and once in rgt.

So, in lft, they appear once, and in rgt, they appear once.

But in this code, sng collects elements in lft that appear only once in lft.

But in reality, some of these sng elements might appear in rgt, making them Type C, while others might appear in rgt twice, making them Type B.

Wait, no, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, if a number appears once in lft, it must appear once in rgt.

Hence, sng collects Type C numbers.

Similarly, ldb collects Type A numbers (those appearing twice in lft), and rdb collects Type B numbers (appearing twice in rgt).

Wait, but in the code, ldb collects duplicates in lft, which are Type A numbers.

rdb collects duplicates in rgt, which are Type B numbers.

sng collects elements in lft that appear only once, which are Type C numbers.

So, that seems correct.

Then, the code selects from ldb and sng for l, and from rdb and sng for r.

But in the approach I outlined, I suggested selecting k Type C numbers for l and r.

But in this code, it seems to select from ldb and sng for l, and from rdb and sng for r.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to select pairs of Type C numbers.

Looking closer:

For l:

- It selects elements from ldb (Type A) in pairs, printing elem, elem if k - sz >=2, meaning selecting both copies for l.

- Then, selects from sng (Type C) individually.

Similarly for r:

- Selects from rdb (Type B) in pairs.

- Selects from sng (Type C) individually.

Wait, but sng are Type C numbers, which appear once in lft and once in rgt.

So, for l, selecting from sng means selecting the Type C number from lft.

For r, selecting from sng means selecting the Type C number from rgt.

Hence, selecting a Type C number in l and r would contribute that number to both l and r, so XOR(l) += x and XOR(r) += x.

Selecting both copies of a Type A number for l contributes x ⊕ x = 0 to XOR(l).

Similarly for Type B and r.

Hence, the total XOR(l) would be XOR of selected Type C numbers, and XOR(r) would be XOR of selected Type C numbers, which matches.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=1

lft = [1,2]

rgt = [2,1]

ldb = [2] (since 2 appears twice in lft)

rdb = [2] (since 2 appears twice in rgt)

sng = [1] (since 1 appears once in lft)

Then, for l:

- sz=0, k=1

- ldb: elem=2, k - sz=1 >=2? No, skip

- sng: elem=1, print 1, sz=1

- print()

For r:

- sz=0, k=1

- rdb: elem=2, k - sz=1 >=2? No, skip

- sng: elem=1, print 1, sz=1

- print()

Hence, l=[1] and r=[1], but we need 2k=2 elements in each.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 2 1 and 2 1.

But according to this code, it would output 1 and 1, which is only one element in each, but we need two elements.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

for elem in ldb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

So, for l:

- sz=0, k=1

- ldb: elem=2, k - sz=1 >=2? No, skip

- sng: elem=1, print 1, sz=1

- print()

Hence, l=[1], but we need 2k=2 elements.

Wait, that's incorrect.

In the first test case, the correct output is 2 1 and 2 1.

But according to this code, it would output 1 and 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the first test case, ldb=[2], sng=[1]

When selecting from ldb, k - sz=1 >=2? No, so skip.

Then select from sng: select 1, sz=1 <2, so select another from sng, but sng only has one element.

Hence, it would select only one element.

But we need 2k=2 elements.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case, ldb=[2], sng=[1]

When selecting for l:

- sz=0, k=1

- ldb: k - sz=1 >=2? No, skip

- sng: select 1, sz=1 >=k=1, break

Hence, l=[1], which is insufficient.

Similarly for r: select [1]

But we need 2k=2 elements in each.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

It says "print(elem, elem, end=' ')" when selecting from ldb if k - sz >=2.

But in the first test case, k=1, sz=0, k - sz=1 <2, so it skips ldb.

Then selects from sng: selects 1, sz=1 >=k=1, breaks.

Hence, l=[1], which is insufficient.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Looking back at the problem, it requires selecting subsets l and r each with exactly 2k elements.

But in this code, it seems to select k elements for l and r, not 2k.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 2 1 and 2 1, which are 2 elements each, for k=1.

Hence, perhaps in that case, it coincidentally matches.

But in general, the code seems to select k elements for l and r, not 2k.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

for elem in ldb:

if sz >=k:

break

if k - sz >=2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz +=2

So, for ldb, it selects pairs of elements if k - sz >=2.

Hence, for k=1, since k - sz=1 >=2? No, skips.

Hence, only selects from sng, which is [1], selects 1, sz=1 >=k=1, stops.

Hence, l=[1], which is insufficient.

But in the first test case, the correct output is 2 1 and 2 1, which are 2 elements each.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the variable k should be 2k.

But in the function, it's defined as k, but perhaps it should be 2k.

Wait, in the problem, k is given, and we need 2k elements in l and r.

Hence, perhaps in the code, it should be 2k.

Looking back, in the code, it's defined as k, but perhaps it should be 2k.

Wait, no, in the code, it's defined as k, and it's used as such.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering 2k as k.

Wait, perhaps the variable k in the code is actually 2k.

Looking back, in the function, it reads k from input, which is the given k in the problem.

But in the problem, we need 2k elements in l and r.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering 2k as k, hence selecting k elements in l and r, each of which is 2k elements.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the code is wrong.

Looking back at the problem, it says "each of length 2k", meaning l and r each have 2k elements.

But in the code, it seems to select k elements for l and r.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the variable k in the code should be multiplied by 2.

Looking back, perhaps the code should set k = 2*k.

Let me check.

If I set k = 2*k in the code, then for the first test case, k=1, 2*k=2.

Then, for l:

sz=0, k=2
