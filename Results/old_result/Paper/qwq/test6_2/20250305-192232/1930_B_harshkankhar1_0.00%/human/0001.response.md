Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there shouldn't be any two different indices i and j (where i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i != j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Hmm, that means that if I pick two positions i and j, the element at i should not divide the element at j, and at the same time, the next element after i should not divide the next element after j.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Let's consider all possible pairs of i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4 and p_2=1; 4 does not divide 1, so this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4 and p_3=2; 4 divides 2? No, 4 does not divide 2, so fine.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4 and p_4=3; 4 does not divide 3, so fine.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1 and p_3=2; 1 divides 2, but let's check p_{i+1}=p_3=2 and p_{j+1}=p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3, so this pair is fine.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1 and p_4=3; 1 divides 3, but p_{i+1} doesn't exist because i+1=3, which is okay since j+1=5 is out of bounds.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2 and p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3, so fine.

Looks like this permutation works. Now, in the explanation, it says that [1,2,3,4] is invalid because i=1 and j=3: p_1=1 divides p_3=3, and p_2=2 divides p_4=4. So, this permutation fails the condition.

Another example given is [3,4,2,1], which is also invalid. Let's see why. If i=3 and j=2: p_3=2 divides p_2=4, and p_4=1 divides p_3=2. So, it fails for this pair.

In the second test case, n=3, and all permutations are valid, which makes sense because there are fewer possibilities and it's harder to find such pairs i and j.

Now, looking at the provided program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls func_1(). In func_1(), it creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based indexing, so indices 0,2,4,...). Finally, it prints the list.

Let's see what this does for n=4:

Original list: [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3]

Reversing [1,3] gives [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the sample input for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3]. The program outputs [3,2,1,4], which seems different. Is [3,2,1,4] a valid permutation?

Let's check the condition for [3,2,1,4]:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 and p_2=2; 3 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 and p_3=1; 3 divides 1? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=3 and p_4=4; 3 does not divide 4.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=1; 2 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 and p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_{i+1}=p_3=1 and p_{j+1}=p_5 doesn't exist.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=1 and p_4=4; 1 divides 4, but p_{i+1} doesn't exist.

So, it seems [3,2,1,4] is valid, even though it's different from the sample output. The problem allows any valid permutation, so this should be acceptable.

Let's check for n=3:

Original list: [1,2,3]

a[::2] = [1,3]

Reversed: [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1]

Is [3,2,1] valid?

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 and p_2=2; 3 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 and p_3=1; 3 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=1; 2 divides 1? No.

Looks good.

Another test case: n=5

Original list: [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5]

Reversed: [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Check if this is valid:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 and p_2=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 and p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 and p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=5 and p_5=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 and p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_{i+1}=p_3=3 and p_{j+1}=p_5=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 and p_5=1; 2 divides 1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 and p_4=4; 3 does not divide 4.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=3 and p_5=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 and p_5=1; 4 does not divide 1.

Seems valid.

So, the approach in the code is to reverse the elements at even indices. This seems to work for n=4, n=3, and n=5.

Is there a general reason why this would work?

Let's think about the permutation generated: for n even, it's like splitting the list into even and odd indexed elements, reversing the even ones.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, even indices are 0,2,4,... and odd are 1,3,5,...

By reversing the even indices, we're swapping the first and last even elements, second and second-to-last, etc.

For n=4: [1,2,3,4] -> [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]

Seems like it pairs p_i and p_{n-i} for even i.

But I'm not sure if this is the best way to ensure the condition is met. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps arranging the permutation in a way that avoids the division condition.

One way to ensure that p_i doesn't divide p_j and p_{i+1} doesn't divide p_{j+1} is to arrange the numbers so that no two elements have such a dividing relationship in the specified positions.

Perhaps placing larger numbers first could help, but in the sample output for n=4, it's [4,1,2,3], which seems to place the largest number first, followed by 1, then increasing numbers.

Wait, in [4,1,2,3], 4 is large, then 1 is small, then 2 and 3 are in order.

In [3,2,1,4], it's somewhat decreasing for even positions.

Maybe arranging the permutation in a decreasing order for even positions and increasing for odd positions or something like that.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Given that the problem states that at least one such permutation exists for the given constraints, and we've tested the code for n=3,4,5 and it seems to work, maybe it's correct.

However, to be thorough, let's check for a larger n, say n=6.

Original list: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5]

Reversed: [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check the condition:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 and p_2=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 and p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 and p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=5 and p_5=1; 5 divides 1? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=5 and p_6=6; 5 does not divide 6.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 and p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_{i+1}=p_3=3 and p_{j+1}=p_5=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 and p_5=1; 2 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 and p_6=6; 2 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_3=3 and p_{j+1}=p_7 doesn't exist.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 and p_4=4; 3 does not divide 4.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=3 and p_5=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=3 and p_6=6; 3 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_4=4 and p_{j+1}=p_7 doesn't exist.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 and p_5=1; 4 does not divide 1.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 and p_6=6; 4 does not divide 6.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=1 and p_6=6; 1 divides 6, but p_{i+1} doesn't exist.

So, it seems [5,2,3,4,1,6] is valid.

Another test case: n=7

Original list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check the condition:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 and p_2=2; 7 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 and p_3=5; 7 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 and p_4=4; 7 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 and p_5=3; 7 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 and p_6=6; 7 does not divide 6.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=7 and p_7=1; 7 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=5; 2 does not divide 5.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 and p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_{i+1}=p_3=5 and p_{j+1}=p_5=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 and p_5=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 and p_6=6; 2 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_3=5 and p_{j+1}=p_7=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 and p_7=1; 2 does not divide 1.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 and p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 and p_5=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 and p_6=6; 5 does not divide 6.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=5 and p_7=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 and p_5=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 and p_6=6; 4 does not divide 6.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 and p_7=1; 4 does not divide 1.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 and p_6=6; 3 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_6=6 and p_{j+1}=p_7=1; 6 does not divide 1.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=3 and p_7=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 and p_7=1; 6 does not divide 1.

Seems valid.

At this point, it appears that the approach in the code works for the tested values of n. But to be thorough, let's think about why this might work in general.

The code reverses the elements at even indices. So, for a list of length n, the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ... are reversed.

For example, for n=4: original [1,2,3,4] -> [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [5,2,3,4,1,6]

For n=7: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

It seems like this approach places larger numbers in the earlier even positions, which might help avoid the division condition.

But is there a case where this approach fails?

Let's try n=8:

Original list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check the condition:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 and p_2=2; 7 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 and p_3=5; 7 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 and p_4=4; 7 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 and p_5=3; 7 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 and p_6=6; 7 does not divide 6.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=7 and p_7=1; 7 does not divide 1.

- i=1, j=8: p_1=7 and p_8=8; 7 does not divide 8.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 and p_3=5; 2 does not divide 5.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 and p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_{i+1}=p_3=5 and p_{j+1}=p_5=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 and p_5=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 and p_6=6; 2 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_3=5 and p_{j+1}=p_7=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 and p_7=1; 2 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=8: p_2=2 and p_8=8; 2 divides 8, but p_{i+1}=p_3=5 and p_{j+1}=p_9 doesn't exist.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 and p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 and p_5=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 and p_6=6; 5 does not divide 6.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=5 and p_7=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=3, j=8: p_3=5 and p_8=8; 5 does not divide 8.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 and p_5=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 and p_6=6; 4 does not divide 6.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 and p_7=1; 4 does not divide 1.

- i=4, j=8: p_4=4 and p_8=8; 4 divides 8, but p_{i+1}=p_5=3 and p_{j+1}=p_9 doesn't exist.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 and p_6=6; 3 divides 6, but p_{i+1}=p_6=6 and p_{j+1}=p_7=1; 6 does not divide 1.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=3 and p_7=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=5, j=8: p_5=3 and p_8=8; 3 does not divide 8.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 and p_7=1; 6 does not divide 1.

- i=6, j=8: p_6=6 and p_8=8; 6 does not divide 8.

- i=7, j=8: p_7=1 and p_8=8; 1 divides 8, but p_{i+1} doesn't exist.

Seems valid.

Hmm, all these seem to work. Maybe this approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical reasoning behind this.

Let's consider that by reversing the even indices, we're pairing higher numbers with lower numbers in a specific way that avoids the division condition.

But to be absolutely sure, maybe I should think about the properties required for the permutation to be valid.

We need to ensure that for any two pairs (i,j), p_i doesn't divide p_j and p_{i+1} doesn't divide p_{j+1} simultaneously.

One way to prevent this is to arrange the permutation such that the ratios between elements at positions i and j are avoided in a way that prevents both divisions from happening.

But this is getting too abstract.

Given that the code seems to work for several test cases, and it's efficient (O(n) time per test case), maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smaller n where this approach fails.

Let's try n=3:

[1,2,3] -> [3,2,1], which is valid as per earlier check.

n=2:

[1,2] -> [2,1], which should be valid.

Check condition:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=2 and p_2=1; 2 does not divide 1.

Seems valid.

n=1:

Only [1], which trivially satisfies the condition.

So, for n=2 and n=1, it works.

Wait, but the problem states n >= 3, so n=1 and n=2 might not be considered, but the code would handle them if they were allowed.

I think the code is correct based on the test cases I've checked.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
