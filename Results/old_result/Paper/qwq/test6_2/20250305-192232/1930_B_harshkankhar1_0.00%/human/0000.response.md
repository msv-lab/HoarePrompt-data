Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not exist two different indices i and j (where i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. Let me try to understand it with an example. Take n=4 and the permutation [4,1,2,3].

Let's check all possible pairs of i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4 divides p_2=1? No, because 4 doesn't divide 1.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4 divides p_3=2? Yes, 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, but not the other way around.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4 divides p_4=3? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1 divides p_3=2? Yes, and p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1 divides p_4=3? Yes, but p_3=2 divides p_5? Wait, p_5 doesn't exist because n=4.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No.

So, in this permutation, there are no pairs i and j that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. That's good.

Now, looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n=4

Output: 4 1 2 3

Second test case:

n=3

Output: 1 2 3

In the first test case, as I just checked, it's valid. In the second test case, for n=3, all permutations seem to be valid, as mentioned in the note.

Now, looking at the given program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

So, the program defines a function func_1() that takes no arguments. Inside func_1(), it reads n from input, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based), and prints the list.

Wait, let's see what a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] does.

a[::2] refers to every second element starting from index 0. So, for n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]. a[::2] is [1,3]. Reversing [1,3] gives [3,1]. So, assigning back to a[::2], a becomes [3,2,1,4].

Wait, but in the sample input for n=4, the output is 4 1 2 3, but according to this code, for n=4, it would output [3,2,1,4], which is different from the sample output.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let's check with n=3.

For n=3, a=[1,2,3]. a[::2] = [1,3]. Reversing [1,3] gives [3,1]. Assigning back, a becomes [3,2,1], but the sample output for n=3 is 1 2 3, which is different.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.

Moreover, in the code, func_1() is called for each test case, but it seems to read n each time, which matches the problem description.

But the outputs don't match the sample outputs.

Wait, maybe I need to see if this code generates a valid permutation as per the problem's condition, even if it's different from the sample output.

So, for n=4, the code would produce [3,2,1,4]. Let's check if this permutation is valid.

Check all possible pairs i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 divides p_3=1? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=3 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=1? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=1 divides p_5? Out of range.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=1 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_4=4 divides p_5? Out of range.

Wait, seems like no invalid pairs here. So, [3,2,1,4] seems to be a valid permutation.

But the sample output is [4,1,2,3], which is also valid, as per the explanation.

So, multiple valid permutations exist for n=4.

Similarly, for n=3, the code produces [3,2,1], but the sample output is [1,2,3], and both are valid.

So, as long as the permutation generated is valid as per the condition, it's acceptable.

Now, does the code always generate a valid permutation?

Let's see for n=5.

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5]

Reversing [1,3,5] gives [5,3,1]

Assign back to a[::2], so a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Check if this is a valid permutation.

Check all pairs i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

Seems valid.

Another test case: n=6

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5]

Reversed: [5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=5 divides p_5=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? Yes.

Wait, p_3=3 divides p_5=1? 3 does not divide 1, so it's False.

So, even though p_2 divides p_4, p_3 does not divide p_5, so the condition is not violated.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=1? Yes, and p_5=1 divides p_6=6? Yes.

Wait, p_5=1 divides p_6=6? Yes, 1 divides any number.

So, in this case, for i=4 and j=5:

p_4=4 divides p_5=1? Yes.

p_5=1 divides p_6=6? Yes.

But according to the problem, i and j should be less than n, and i and j are both less than n=6.

Wait, the condition says 1 ≤ i, j < n, and i ≠ j.

So, n=6, i and j can be from 1 to 5, inclusive, with i ≠ j.

So, i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=1? Yes.

p_5=1 divides p_6=6? Yes.

But p_{i+1} = p_5=1 divides p_{j+1}=p_6=6? Yes.

So, this seems to violate the condition.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified that i and j are less than n, but p_{j+1} would be p_{5+1}=p_6, which is within the list.

So, does this mean that the permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6] is invalid because of i=4 and j=5?

If so, then the code is producing an invalid permutation for n=6.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one p exists, so maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"We do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}."

Wait, actually, it's "there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}."

So, in other words, for all pairs i, j where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j, it's not the case that both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In my earlier check for n=6, with p=[5,2,3,4,1,6], for i=4 and j=5:

p_4=4 divides p_5=1? No, because 4 does not divide 1.

So, the condition p_i divides p_j is False, so the whole "p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}" is False, which is what we want.

Wait, 4 does not divide 1, so p_i divides p_j is False.

Therefore, the condition "p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}" is False for this pair, which is acceptable.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 divides 1, but actually, 4 does not divide 1, because 1 is not a multiple of 4.

So, it's okay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Let me re-examine:

For i=4, j=5:

p_i = p_4 = 4

p_j = p_5 = 1

Does 4 divide 1? No, because 1 is not a multiple of 4.

Similarly, p_{i+1} = p_5 = 1

p_{j+1} = p_6 = 6

Does 1 divide 6? Yes.

But since p_i does not divide p_j, the entire condition "p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}" is False, which is what we want.

So, no problem here.

Therefore, the permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6] seems to be valid.

Alright, so perhaps the code does generate valid permutations for various n.

Let me try another n, say n=7.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check for pairs i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No.

So, no invalid pairs here.

Seems like the code generates a valid permutation for n=7.

Alright, so far, for n=3,4,5,6,7, the code seems to generate valid permutations.

Is there a pattern here?

It looks like the code is reversing the elements at even indices (0-based indexing).

So, for n=4: original [1,2,3,4] -> [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [5,2,3,4,1,6]

For n=7: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> [7,2,3,4,5,6,1]

It seems to reverse the elements at positions 0,2,4,....

Now, is this method guaranteed to produce a valid permutation for any n ≥ 3?

Let me think about it.

Suppose n is even.

For example, n=4: [3,2,1,4]

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

n=8: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

And for odd n, similar pattern.

Now, is there any pair i,j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}?

From the earlier checks, it seems not.

But to be sure, I need to see if there's any general reason why this reversal method avoids such pairs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical property here that ensures the condition is met.

Alternatively, perhaps this method doesn't always work, and I just haven't found the counterexample yet.

Let me try n=8.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=7 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No.

So, no invalid pairs here.

Seems fine.

What about n=9?

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9]

Reversed: [9,7,5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=9 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=1, j=8: p_1=9 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=8: p_2=2 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=3, j=8: p_3=7 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=4, j=8: p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=5, j=8: p_5=5 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=8: p_6=6 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=7, j=8: p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

All pairs seem to be fine.

So, up to n=9, the code generates valid permutations.

Is there a mathematical justification for this method?

Let's think about it.

By reversing the elements at even indices, we're essentially swapping the first and last even-positioned elements, the second and second-to-last, and so on.

In the permutations generated, the elements at even positions remain the same, while the elements at odd positions are reversed.

So, for n even, the first element is the highest odd number ≤ n, and so on.

But I'm not sure if this helps in ensuring the condition is met.

Alternatively, maybe this method doesn't guarantee validity, but it happens to work for small n.

I should check for larger n, but since n can be up to 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, I need to think of a way to verify this method efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a counterexample where the method fails.

Let's try n=10.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9]

Reversed: [9,7,5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=9 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=1, j=8: p_1=9 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=3, j=8: p_3=7 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=3, j=9: p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=5, j=8: p_5=5 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=5, j=9: p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=9: p_6=6 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=7, j=8: p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=7, j=9: p_7=3 divides p_9=1? Yes, and p_8=8 divides p_10=10? Yes.

Wait, for i=7 and j=9:

p_7=3 divides p_9=1? 3 does not divide 1, because 1 is not a multiple of 3.

Wait, 1 is not a multiple of 3, so p_7 divides p_9 is False.

Therefore, the entire condition "p_7 divides p_9 and p_8 divides p_10" is False because p_7 divides p_9 is False.

So, no issue here.

Thus, the permutation [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10] seems to be valid.

Alright, so even for n=10, it works.

Maybe I should consider a general n and see if I can find a pair i,j that violates the condition.

Suppose n is even.

Let n=2k.

The permutation is constructed by reversing the elements at even indices.

So, a[0] = n-1, a[2] = n-3, ..., a[2k-2] = 1, and a[1], a[3], ..., a[2k-1] remain 2,4,6,...,2k.

Wait, no.

Wait, in n=4: [3,2,1,4]

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

n=8: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

So, a[0] = n-1, a[2] = n-3, ..., a[2k-2] = 1, and a[1], a[3], ..., a[2k-1] are 2,4,6,...,2k.

Wait, no, in n=6: a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6.

Similarly, in n=8: a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6, a[7]=8.

So, yes, the elements at odd indices are 2,4,6,...,2k.

Now, suppose there exists i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Let's consider the positions.

If i and j are both even or both odd, their corresponding p_i and p_j are from the reversed even positions or the unchanged odd positions.

Wait, no, the indices are 0-based, and a[::2] are the even indices.

Wait, in code, list indices start from 0.

So, a[0], a[2], a[4],... are reversed.

For n=4: a=[3,2,1,4]

Indices:

0:3, 1:2, 2:1, 3:4

So, i and j refer to positions 1 to n, which correspond to indices 0 to n-1 in the list.

Wait, the problem mentions 1-based indexing for the permutation, while the code uses 0-based indexing for the list.

Need to be careful here.

Let's map the permutation indices to the list indices.

Permutation p_1 corresponds to a[0], p_2 to a[1], and so on.

So, in the condition, i and j are 1-based, referring to p_i and p_j, which correspond to a[i-1] and a[j-1].

So, in the code's list, a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1] correspond to p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.

Given that, let's see if there can be any i and j where a[i-1] divides a[j-1] and a[i] divides a[j].

Wait, p_i corresponds to a[i-1], p_{i+1} corresponds to a[i], p_j corresponds to a[j-1], p_{j+1} corresponds to a[j].

So, the condition is a[i-1] divides a[j-1] and a[i] divides a[j].

We need to ensure that there are no such i and j where both these conditions hold.

Now, in the permutation generated by the code, a[::2] is reversed.

So, a[0], a[2], a[4],... are in descending order, while a[1], a[3], a[5],... are in ascending order.

Specifically, a[0] = n-1, a[2] = n-3, ..., a[2k] = n-1-2k, and a[1]=2, a[3]=4, ..., a[2k+1]=2k+2.

Wait, for n even, a[1], a[3], ..., a[n-1] are 2,4,6,...,n.

For n odd, similar.

Wait, no, in n=4: a=[3,2,1,4]

n=5: a=[5,2,3,4,1]

n=6: a=[5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, in n=6, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6.

In n=5, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=1.

So, the odd-index elements (1-based) are 2,4,6,... up to n if n is even, or n-1 if n is odd.

While the even-index elements (1-based) are reversed from n-1, n-3, ..., down to 1.

Wait, no, in 1-based indexing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in 0-based indexing for the list.

a[0], a[2], a[4],... are reversed, i.e., starting from n-1, n-3, ..., down to 1.

While a[1], a[3], a[5],... are 2,4,6,... up to n.

So, in general, a[even] = n-1 - even, and a[odd] = 2 + (odd//2)*2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in n=4: a=[3,2,1,4]

n=5: a=[5,2,3,4,1]

n=6: a=[5,2,3,4,1,6]

n=7: a=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

n=8: a=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Wait, in n=8, a[0]=7, a[2]=5, a[4]=3, a[6]=1 (reversed even indices), and a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6, a[7]=8.

So, in general, for even n, a[even] = n-1 - even, and a[odd] = 2 + (odd//2)*2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see that a[even] decreases from n-1 to 1, and a[odd] increases from 2 to n with step 2.

So, a[even] = n - even - 1 (starting from 0).

Wait, in n=4:

a[0]=3, which is n-1=3.

a[2]=1, which is n-3=1.

Similarly, in n=5:

a[0]=5-0=5.

a[2]=5-2=3.

a[4]=5-4=1.

Wait, a[even]=n-even.

Wait, in n=6:

a[0]=5, which is n-1=5.

a[2]=3, n-3=3.

a[4]=1, n-5=1.

Wait, n-1 - even.

Wait, a[even] = n - even -1.

Yes, in general, a[even] = n - even -1.

And a[odd] = 2 + (odd//2)*2.

Wait, no, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6, etc.

So, a[odd] = odd +1.

Wait, no.

Wait, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6.

So, a[odd] = odd +1.

Wait, odd index, starting from 1.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6.

So, a[odd]=odd +1.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, odd indices are 1,3,5,...

So, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6, etc.

So, a[odd]=odd +1.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, a[1]=2, a[3]=4, a[5]=6.

So, a[odd]=odd +1.

Wait, but in 1-based indexing, p_2=a[1]=2, p_4=a[3]=4, p_6=a[5]=6, etc.

So, in general, p_{2k}=2k.

While p_{2k-1}=n-2k+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a general formula for p_i.

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the list a.

Given that a[even]=n - even -1.

And a[odd]=odd +1.

Wait, in n=4:

a[0]=3, a[1]=2, a[2]=1, a[3]=4.

Similarly, n=5:

a[0]=5, a[1]=2, a[2]=3, a[3]=4, a[4]=1.

Wait, perhaps a[even]=n - even.

Wait, in n=4:

a[0]=3=4-1.

a[2]=1=4-3.

Wait, not exactly.

Wait, a[even]=n - even.

In n=4:

a[0]=4-0=4, but in code, it's 3.

Wait, no, in n=4, a[0]=3, which is n-1=3.

Wait, a[even]=n-1 - even.

Wait, in n=4:

a[0]=3=4-1-0.

a[2]=1=4-1-2.

Yes, a[even]=n-1-even.

Similarly, in n=5:

a[0]=5-1-0=4, but in earlier example, a[0]=5.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps a[even]=n - even.

In n=4:

a[0]=4-0=4, but in code, it's 3.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's a[even]=n - even -1.

In n=4:

a[0]=4-0-1=3.

a[2]=4-2-1=1.

Similarly, in n=5:

a[0]=5-0-1=4, but in earlier example, a[0]=5.

Wait, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps it's a[even]=n - even.

In n=4:

a[0]=4-0=4, but in code, a[0]=3.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps a[even]=n - even - (n%2).

Wait, complicated.

Maybe it's easier to accept that a[even] are in descending order from n-1 step -2.

And a[odd] are in ascending order starting from 2.

So, a[even]=n-1 - (even//1)*2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Anyway, perhaps finding a general formula isn't necessary.

Instead, perhaps I can think about why this method avoids the condition.

Suppose we have i and j such that a[i-1] divides a[j-1] and a[i] divides a[j].

Given how a is constructed, perhaps such pairs don't exist.

But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern in the permutations generated and see if there's a way that ensures the condition is met.

Alternatively, maybe the method doesn't always work, and I need to find a counterexample.

Let me try n=15.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]

Reversed: [15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1]

Assign back: a = [15,2,13,4,11,6,9,8,7,10,5,12,3,14,1]

Now, check for i=7 and j=13:

p_7=a[6]=9

p_8=a[7]=8

p_13=a[12]=3

p_14=a[13]=14

Does 9 divide 3? Yes.

Does 8 divide 14? Yes.

So, this is a problem.

Wait, in terms of indices:

i=7, j=13.

a[6]=9 divides a[12]=3? Yes, because 3 is divisible by 9? Wait, no, 9 does not divide 3, because 3 is not a multiple of 9.

Wait, 9 does not divide 3.

Wait, 9 cannot divide 3 because 3 is less than 9.

So, p_7=9 divides p_13=3? No, because 9 does not divide 3.

So, no issue here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the list a = [15,2,13,4,11,6,9,8,7,10,5,12,3,14,1]

Let's map p_i to a[i-1]:

p_1=15

p_2=2

p_3=13

p_4=4

p_5=11

p_6=6

p_7=9

p_8=8

p_9=7

p_10=10

p_11=5

p_12=12

p_13=3

p_14=14

p_15=1

Now, check for i=7, j=13:

p_7=9 divides p_13=3? No, because
