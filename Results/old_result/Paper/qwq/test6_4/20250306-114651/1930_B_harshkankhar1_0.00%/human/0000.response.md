Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not exist two different indices i and j (where i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i â‰  j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Hmm, that means that for any two positions i and j, if the number at position i divides the number at position j, and the number at position i+1 divides the number at position j+1, then that's not allowed.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Let's consider all possible pairs of i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4 divides p_2=1? No, because 4 doesn't divide 1. So, this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4 divides p_3=2? Yes, 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, but not the other way around. So, this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4 divides p_4=3? No, 4 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1 divides p_3=2? Yes, and p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. So, this pair is fine.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1 divides p_4=3? Yes, but p_3=2 divides p_5? Wait, p_5 doesn't exist because n=4. So, we only consider i and j up to n-1, which in this case is 3. So, j can only be up to 3. Therefore, j=4 is out of bounds here.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

So, for n=4, the permutation [4,1,2,3] seems to satisfy the condition.

In the second test case, n=3, and the output is [1,2,3]. Let's check this:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1 divides p_2=2? Yes, and p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1 divides p_3=3? Yes, and p_2=2 divides p_4? Again, p_4 doesn't exist. So, this is fine.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

So, this permutation is also valid.

Now, looking at the program provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

This code defines a function func_1 that takes an input n, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based), and prints the list.

Let's see what this does for n=4:

Original list: [1,2,3,4]

Indices 0-based: 0,1,2,3

a[::2] are elements at indices 0 and 2: [1,3]

Reversing them: [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3], which is different from [3,2,1,4]. So, is this program correct?

Wait, maybe I misread the program. Let's check again.

The program is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

So, for each test case, it calls func_1, which reads n, creates a list from 1 to n, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the list.

For n=4:

Original list: [1,2,3,4]

a[::2]: [1,3]

Reversing [1,3]: [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

But in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3]. So, this doesn't match. Is [3,2,1,4] a valid permutation according to the problem's condition?

Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 divides p_2=2? No, 3 doesn't divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 divides p_3=1? No, 3 doesn't divide 1.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=3 divides p_4=4? No, 3 doesn't divide 4.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=1? No, 2 doesn't divide 1.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=1 divides p_5? Out of bounds.

So, seems fine.

Wait, but in the example, [4,1,2,3] is given, which is different from [3,2,1,4]. Both seem to be valid permutations according to the condition. So, maybe there are multiple valid permutations.

The problem says: "If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them."

So, as long as the permutation satisfies the condition, it's acceptable.

Now, let's see what the program does.

It creates a list from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices.

So, for n=3:

Original: [1,2,3]

a[::2]: [1,3]

Reversed: [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1]

But in the example, for n=3, the output is [1,2,3]. Again, different, but both should be valid.

Wait, but is [3,2,1] valid for n=3?

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 divides p_3=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=1? No.

So, it seems [3,2,1] is also valid.

Therefore, the program seems to be generating a different valid permutation from the one in the example, but it's still correct.

Now, is this method guaranteed to produce a valid permutation for any n?

Let's think about it.

The program generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices of the list [1,2,3,...,n].

So, for n=5:

Original: [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2]: [1,3,5]

Reversed: [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Is this valid?

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No, 3 doesn't divide 1.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

So, seems fine.

Another test: n=6

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2]: [1,3,5]

Reversed: [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=5 divides p_5=1? Yes, but p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, 2 divides 6.

Oh, wait, this seems problematic.

So, for i=1, j=5:

p_1=5 divides p_5=1? No, because 5 doesn't divide 1.

Wait, but 5 doesn't divide 1, so it's fine.

Wait, 5 doesn't divide 1, so the condition is not satisfied, so it's fine.

So, still okay.

Another check: i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No, 3 doesn't divide 1. So, fine.

i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=1? No.

i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

i=3, j=5: p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No.

So, seems [5,2,3,4,1,6] is valid.

Another test: n=2

Wait, n starts from 3, according to the problem.

But just to check, for n=2:

Original: [1,2]

a[::2]: [1]

Reversed: [1]

So, a remains [1,2]

Is this valid?

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1 divides p_2=2? Yes, and p_2=2 divides p_3? Out of bounds.

But n=2, but in the problem, n >=3, so maybe n=2 is not considered.

Wait, the problem says n >=3, so n=2 is not allowed.

Moving on.

Now, I need to confirm if the program's method always produces a valid permutation.

Let's try to find a general pattern.

The program reverses the elements at even indices.

So, for n=4: [3,2,1,4]

n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Seems like it places the largest numbers at the beginning.

Is there a pattern in the problem's example?

For n=4, the example output is [4,1,2,3]

For n=3, [1,2,3]

In the first test case, n=4, [4,1,2,3]

In the second test case, n=3, [1,2,3]

So, different permutations are provided as examples, but both are valid.

So, as long as the permutation doesn't have any i and j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, it's valid.

Now, to see if the program's method always produces such a permutation.

Let's consider n=7.

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2]: [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No.

So, seems valid.

Another test: n=8

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

a[::2]: [1,3,5,7]

Reversed: [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=7 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 divides p_7=1? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_7=1 divides p_8=8? p_7=1 divides p_8=8? Yes, but j=7 and j+1=8 is within bounds.

Wait, n=8, so j can be up to 7, since j < n.

So, i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_7=1 divides p_8=8? Yes.

Wait, but in this case, i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6 (yes), and p_6=6 divides p_7=1 (no, 6 doesn't divide 1). So, it's fine.

Similarly, i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No.

So, overall, seems valid.

Now, is there any n where this method fails?

Let me think about n=1 and n=2, but according to the problem, n >=3, so n=3 to n=10^5.

Wait, but in the program, it reads n from input, and assumes n >=3.

I need to check if there exists any n where the program's permutation doesn't satisfy the condition.

Let's think about n=9.

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

a[::2]: [1,3,5,7,9]

Reversed: [9,7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=9 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=1, j=8: p_1=9 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=8: p_2=2 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=3, j=8: p_3=7 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=4, j=7: p_4=4 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=4, j=8: p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=5, j=8: p_5=5 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=8: p_6=6 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=7, j=8: p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

So, seems valid.

Wait, in i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No. So, fine.

Another test: n=10

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

a[::2]: [1,3,5,7,9]

Reversed: [9,7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=9 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=1, j=8: p_1=9 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=1, j=9: p_1=9 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=7? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=7: p_2=2 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=2, j=8: p_2=2 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=2, j=9: p_2=2 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=3, j=7: p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=3, j=8: p_3=7 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=3, j=9: p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=5? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=5, j=7: p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No.

- i=5, j=8: p_5=5 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=5, j=9: p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=6, j=7: p_6=6 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=6, j=8: p_6=6 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=7, j=8: p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No.

- i=7, j=9: p_7=3 divides p_9=1? No.

- i=8, j=9: p_8=8 divides p_9=1? No.

So, seems valid.

Okay, so up to n=10, the program's method seems to produce valid permutations.

Is there a general way to see why this method works?

Let's think about the method: reversing the elements at even indices.

So, for n=4: [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, in n=6, a[::2]: [1,3,5] reversed to [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, but in n=4, a[::2]: [1,3] reversed to [3,1], so [3,2,1,4]

In n=5: [1,3,5] reversed to [5,3,1], so [5,2,3,4,1]

Seems like the largest numbers are placed at the beginning, but not always the maximum possible.

Wait, in n=4, 4 is at position 4.

In n=5, 5 is at position 1.

In n=6, 5 is at position 1, 6 at position 6.

Is there a pattern in the placement of larger numbers?

It seems that the larger numbers are placed at the earlier even indices.

But is there a better way to see why this method works?

Maybe I should think about the divisibility condition.

We need to ensure that for any i != j, p_i doesn't divide p_j and p_{i+1} doesn't divide p_{j+1}.

Alternatively, we need to avoid having p_i | p_j and p_{i+1} | p_{j+1} for any i != j.

One way to avoid this is to make sure that p_i is larger than p_j, or p_{i+1} is larger than p_{j+1}, or both.

But that's not necessarily the case in the permutations generated by the program.

For example, in n=4: [3,2,1,4]

Here, p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1, p_4=4

So, p_1=3 > p_2=2, p_2=2 > p_3=1, p_3=1 < p_4=4

So, it's not strictly decreasing or increasing.

Wait, maybe placing larger numbers at the beginning makes it less likely to have divisibility issues.

But I need a more concrete reason.

Alternatively, maybe this method ensures that for any i and j, if p_i divides p_j, then p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me consider the general case.

Suppose we have n, and we create a permutation where elements at even indices are reversed.

So, original list: 1,2,3,...,n

a[::2]: elements at indices 0,2,4,..., up to n-1

Reversing them.

So, for even n:

a[::2] = [1,3,5,...,n-1] reversed to [n-1, n-3, ...,1]

So, a becomes [n-1,2,n-3,4,...,1,n]

Wait, for n=4: [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, n=6: a[::2] = [1,3,5] reversed to [5,3,1]

So, a = [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Now, in this arrangement, the larger numbers are placed at the beginning, but not necessarily in decreasing order.

Wait, in n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Here, p_1=5, p_2=2, p_3=3, p_4=4, p_5=1, p_6=6

So, p_1=5 > p_2=2, p_2=2 < p_3=3, p_3=3 < p_4=4, p_4=4 > p_5=1, p_5=1 < p_6=6

So, it's not monotonic.

Is there a better way to see why this method avoids the condition?

Maybe I should consider that by reversing the even indices, we're making the sequence less regular, thus reducing the chances of having p_i | p_j and p_{i+1} | p_{j+1} for some i and j.

But this is too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's condition is related to avoiding certain patterns or dependencies between elements.

Wait, maybe I should look for a counterexample where the program's method fails
