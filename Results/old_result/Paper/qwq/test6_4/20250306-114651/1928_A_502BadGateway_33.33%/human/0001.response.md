Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, or if he's just wasting his time.

First, I need to understand the process step by step. Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of its sides, so he could either cut along the length or the width. Let's consider both options.

If he cuts parallel to the width (along the length), he would be dividing the length a into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the length (along the width), he divides b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles. He can rotate and move these pieces around to try and form a new rectangle. The question is whether this new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rectangles that are the same up to rotation are considered identical.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case, the rectangle is 1x1. It's impossible to cut this into two smaller rectangles since at least one of the pieces would have a side of zero, which doesn't make sense. So, no new rectangle can be formed, and the answer is "No."

In the second test case, 2x1, it can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles. From these, you can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation. So, again, "No."

In the third test case, 2x6, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles. From these, you can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 up to rotation). So, "Yes."

In the fourth test case, 3x2, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles. From these, you can form a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, but that's different from the original 3x2. So, "Yes."

In the fifth test case, 2x2, it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles. From these, you can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2. So, "Yes."

In the sixth test case, 2x4, it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles. From these, you can form a 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4. So, "Yes."

In the seventh test case, 6x3, it can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles. From these, you can only form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3 up to rotation. So, "No."

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "No" for 6x3, which matches my reasoning.

Looking at these examples, it seems that the key factor is whether the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the new combination of pieces forms a rectangle with different dimensions up to rotation.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose the original rectangle is a x b.

After cutting, we have two smaller rectangles. Let's say they are a x c and a x (b - c), if cutting along the width, or c x b and (a - c) x b, if cutting along the length.

Then, from these two pieces, we can try to form a new rectangle by placing them side by side or one on top of the other.

If we place them side by side, their widths add up, and if we place them one on top of the other, their heights add up.

So, for example, if we have two rectangles of a x c and a x (b - c), placing them side by side would give a rectangle of a x (c + (b - c)) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

Wait, that's the same as the original. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if we place them one on top of the other, we would get a rectangle of (a + a) x c, which is 2a x c, provided that c equals b - c, meaning c = b/2. So, only if b is even can we have c = b/2, and then the new rectangle would be 2a x (b/2).

Simplify that: 2a x (b/2) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

Wait, that seems to be the same area, but let's see the dimensions.

Wait, 2a x (b/2) is the same as a x b, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Hmm, seems like it's the same.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to combine them.

Let me consider rotating one of the pieces.

Suppose I have two rectangles of a x c and a x (b - c).

If I rotate one of them, say the a x c becomes c x a, and the other remains a x (b - c).

Then, if I place them side by side, I can have c x a and a x (b - c).

Wait, that might not form a rectangle directly.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the total area.

The total area is a * b, and we're dividing it into two rectangles, each with area proportional to the cut.

But the problem allows rotating and moving the pieces, so perhaps there's a way to rearrange them into a different rectangle.

Wait, in the sample input 3, 2x6, it's cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and then combined to form a 4x3 rectangle.

So, two 2x3 rectangles can be placed side by side to form a 4x3 rectangle.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, 3x2, cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be placed side by side to form a 3x2 rectangle, but that's the same as the original.

Wait, no, in the explanation, it says they can form a 1x6 rectangle.

Wait, how does that work?

If I have two 3x1 rectangles, I can place them one on top of the other to form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

Ah, that makes sense.

So, in this case, cutting along the length a, dividing it into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a.

Then, the two rectangles are a1 x b and a2 x b.

If I rotate one or both of them, I can try to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if I cut along the width b, dividing it into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b, resulting in two rectangles a x b1 and a x b2.

Again, by rotating and arranging them, I can try to form a new rectangle.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways of cutting and rearranging the pieces.

But this seems a bit too involved. There must be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the total area.

The total area is a * b.

After cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have the same area, a * b.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x * y = a * b.

Moreover, rectangles that are the same up to rotation are considered identical, so x y is considered the same as y x.

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a rectangle with integer sides x and y, such that x * y = a * b, and (x, y) is not the same as (a, b) up to rotation.

Wait, but there's more to it because Bob has specific ways of cutting and rearranging the pieces.

He can only cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides, and then rearrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle.

So, it's not just any rectangle with area a * b, but one that can be formed by combining two pieces obtained by such a cut.

So, I need to consider what possible new rectangles can be formed from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle in the allowed way.

Let's consider the two possible cuts:

1. Cutting parallel to the width (dividing the length a into a1 and a2):

- Resulting pieces: a1 x b and a2 x b.

- By rotating these pieces, the possible dimensions for the new rectangle are:

- Placing them side by side along the width: (a1 + a2) x b, which is a x b, same as original.

- Placing them side by side along the length: b x (a1 + a2), same as above.

- Placing one on top of the other: (a1 + a2) x b, same again.

- Rotating one piece: if I rotate one piece, say a1 x b becomes b x a1, and the other remains a2 x b.

- Then, placing them side by side:

- Along the width: (b + b) x a1 and a2, but that might not form a rectangle.

- Along the length: a1 x b and a2 x b, placed one on top of the other, giving (a1 + a2) x b, same as original.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider specific arrangements.

Let me consider an example.

Take the 2x6 rectangle.

Cut it into two 2x3 rectangles.

Then, place them side by side along the length: 2x3 and 2x3 placed side by side along the length give a 4x3 rectangle.

This is a new rectangle different from the original 2x6.

Similarly, in the 3x2 rectangle, cut into two 3x1 rectangles.

Place them side by side along the length: 3x1 and 3x1 placed side by side give a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

So, in both cases, by cutting and rearranging, a new rectangle is formed.

Now, in the 1x1 case, it can't be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so "No."

In the 2x1 case, cutting it into two 1x1 rectangles, and arranging them gives a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation, so "No."

In the 2x2 case, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them gives a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2, so "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and arranging them gives a 4x2 or 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation, but according to the sample output, it's "Yes." Wait, in the sample output, it's "Yes" for 2x4, but according to my reasoning, it should be "No" because 4x2 is the same as 2x4 up to rotation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the 2x4 case, if I cut it into two 2x2 rectangles, I can place them side by side to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4 up to rotation.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes," so there must be another way to cut and rearrange.

Wait, maybe I should cut it differently.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle along the other side.

Cutting parallel to the width, dividing b=4 into, say, 1 and 3.

Then, I have two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x3.

Now, from these two pieces, can I form a new rectangle?

If I place them side by side along the length: 2x1 and 2x3 placed side by side give a 2x4, which is the same as the original.

If I place them one on top of the other: 2x1 placed on top of 2x3 would not form a rectangle.

Alternatively, if I rotate one of them, say rotate the 2x1 to become 1x2, and then place it next to the 2x3.

Then, I have a 1x2 and a 2x3.

Placing them side by side along the length: 1x2 and 2x3 don't fit together directly.

Alternatively, placing them one on top of the other: 1x2 on top of 2x3 doesn't form a rectangle.

So, perhaps in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes," so maybe there's another way.

Wait, maybe I should cut differently.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 1x4 rectangles by cutting along the length.

Then, I have two 1x4 rectangles.

Placing them side by side along the width gives a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

So, in this case, "Yes."

Ah, so the way I cut the rectangle matters.

So, to maximize the possibility of forming a new rectangle, I should choose the cut that allows me to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, in the 2x4 case, cutting along the length into two 1x4 rectangles allows me to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, "Yes."

Similarly, in the 6x3 case, if I cut along the length into two 3x3 rectangles, I can only form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Alternatively, if I cut along the width into two 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles, and try to arrange them, I can't form a new rectangle different from the original.

Hence, "No."

So, the strategy is to find a way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles such that, by rearranging them (rotating and placing them differently), I can form a new rectangle with dimensions different from the original up to rotation.

Now, to generalize this, I need to find a condition based on a and b that allows me to do this.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: "No"

- 2x1: "No"

- 2x6: "Yes"

- 3x2: "Yes"

- 2x2: "Yes"

- 2x4: "Yes"

- 6x3: "No"

Looking for a pattern here.

In the "Yes" cases:

- 2x6 can be cut into two 2x3, forming a 4x3.

- 3x2 can be cut into two 3x1, forming a 6x1.

- 2x2 can be cut into two 1x2, forming a 1x4.

- 2x4 can be cut into two 1x4, forming a 1x8.

In the "No" cases:

- 1x1: can't be cut.

- 2x1: cutting into two 1x1, which only forms 1x2 or 2x1, same as original.

- 6x3: cutting into two 3x3, forming 3x6, same as original.

So, in the "Yes" cases, there's a possibility to double one dimension while halving the other, resulting in a different rectangle.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, cutting into two 2x3 and forming a 4x3.

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, cutting into two 1x4 and forming a 1x8.

So, it seems like if I can cut the rectangle in such a way that one dimension is doubled while the other is halved, leading to a different rectangle.

But in the 6x3 case, if I try to cut it into two 3x3, forming a 3x6, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Similarly, in the 2x1 case, cutting into two 1x1, forming a 1x2, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

In the 1x1 case, can't be cut.

So, perhaps the condition is whether b is even.

Wait, in the sample inputs:

- "Yes" for b even: 2x6 (b=6 even), 3x2 (b=2 even), 2x2 (b=2 even), 2x4 (b=4 even)

- "No" for b odd: 1x1 (b=1 odd), 2x1 (b=1 odd), 6x3 (b=3 odd)

Wait, but 6x3 has b=3 odd, which is "No," and 3x2 has b=2 even, which is "Yes."

So, perhaps it's related to whether b is even.

But in the 6x3 case, b=3 is odd, and it's "No."

In the 3x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, b=4 even, "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

In the 1x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

In the 2x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, b=3 odd, "No."

So, it seems that if b is even, it's "Yes," else "No."

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, b=3 odd, "No."

In the 2x4 case, b=4 even, "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

In the 2x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 1x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

In the 2x6 case, b=6 even, "Yes."

So, it seems that when b is even, it's "Yes," otherwise "No."

But why is that?

Let's think about it.

If b is even, then I can cut the rectangle along the length into two equal parts, each of size a x (b/2).

Then, by placing these two pieces side by side along the width, I can form a new rectangle of size (a + a) x (b/2) = 2a x (b/2).

But 2a x (b/2) is the same as a x b, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, but in the sample explanations, they formed different rectangles.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles and forming a 4x3 rectangle.

So, it's not just placing them side by side along the width to get 4x3.

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, cutting into two 1x4 rectangles and forming a 1x8 rectangle.

So, perhaps the condition is that a is even.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a=2 even.

In the 3x2 case, a=3 odd.

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even.

In the 2x4 case, a=2 even.

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, and it's "Yes."

Wait, but according to the previous reasoning, if a is even, I can cut along the width into two a/2 x b pieces and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

But in the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, but it's still "Yes."

So, perhaps it's sufficient that either a or b is even.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and it's "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, "No."

Wait, but according to this, it's "No," which contradicts the idea that if either a or b is even, it's "Yes."

Wait, no, in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and it's "No."

So, perhaps it's required that both a and b are even.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and it's "Yes."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's required that at least one of them is even.

But in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and it's "No."

So, that doesn't hold either.

Wait, perhaps it's that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, GCD(2,6)=2, "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, GCD(3,2)=1, "Yes."

Wait, no, GCD(3,2)=1, and it's "Yes."

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, GCD(2,1)=1, "No."

In the 2x2 case, GCD(2,2)=2, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, GCD(6,3)=3, "No."

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

GCD(6,3)=3, "No," but GCD(3,2)=1, "Yes."

Wait, no consistency here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b are both even, or at least one is even, but that doesn't hold consistently across the samples.

Wait, maybe it's that a and b are not both odd.

In the "No" cases, we have a=1,b=1; a=2,b=1; a=6,b=3.

In the "Yes" cases, at least one of a or b is even.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, "No."

Wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a is even.

In the "Yes" cases, a=2, a=3, a=2, a=2, a=6.

In the "No" cases, a=1, a=2, a=6.

Wait, a=2 is in both "Yes" and "No" cases.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, it's "No," but a=2 is even.

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, a=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x6 case, a=2 even, "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, "No."

In the 1x1 case, a=1 odd, "No."

So, when a is even, it's "Yes" sometimes and "No" sometimes.

When a is odd, it's "Yes" sometimes and "No" sometimes.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps it's about the ratio of a to b.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a=2, b=6, ratio 1:3.

After cutting and rearranging, forming a 4x3, which is ratio 4:3.

Similarly, in the 3x2 case, a=3, b=2, ratio 3:2.

After cutting, forming a 6x1, which is ratio 6:1.

In the 2x2 case, a=2, b=2, ratio 1:1.

After cutting, forming a 1x4, which is ratio 1:4.

In the 2x4 case, a=2, b=4, ratio 1:2.

After cutting, forming a 1x8, which is ratio 1:8.

In the 6x3 case, a=6, b=3, ratio 2:1.

After cutting, forming a 3x6, which is ratio 1:2, same as original up to rotation.

So, in cases where the new rectangle has a different ratio from the original, it's "Yes."

Otherwise, "No."

But in the 2x4 case, original ratio 1:2, new ratio 1:8, which is different, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, original ratio 2:1, new ratio 1:2, which is the same up to rotation, "No."

In the 3x2 case, original ratio 3:2, new ratio 6:1, which is different, "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, original ratio 1:1, new ratio 1:4, which is different, "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, original ratio 2:1, new ratio 1:2, same up to rotation, "No."

In the 1x1 case, can't be cut, "No."

So, it seems that if the new rectangle has a different ratio from the original, considering rotation, it's "Yes."

Otherwise, "No."

So, the key is to check if there's a way to cut and rearrange the pieces to form a rectangle with dimensions x and y such that x != y and (x, y) != (a, b) up to rotation.

Wait, but this seems too vague. I need a more concrete condition.

Let me think about the possible new rectangles that can be formed.

Suppose I cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, say rect1 and rect2.

Then, I can arrange them in different ways:

- Place them side by side along the width.

- Place them one on top of the other.

- Rotate one or both rectangles and then arrange them.

The goal is to see if any of these arrangements result in a rectangle that is different from the original up to rotation.

Let me consider that the total area is a * b.

The new rectangle must have the same area, so its dimensions must be such that x * y = a * b.

Moreover, it must be different from (a, b) up to rotation, meaning that (x, y) != (a, b) and (x, y) != (b, a).

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a pair (x, y) such that x * y = a * b and (x, y) != (a, b) and (x, y) != (b, a).

But, there's a constraint: the new rectangle must be formed from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle in the allowed way.

So, I need to ensure that such a pair (x, y) can be formed by combining the two pieces in some arrangement.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles with integer dimensions.

I need to see if these two rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions x and y, where x * y = a * b and (x, y) is different from (a, b) up to rotation.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

If GCD(a, b) > 1, then a and b share a common factor greater than 1, which might allow for more flexibility in cutting and rearranging.

But in the sample input, for 3x2, GCD(3,2)=1, and it's "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, GCD(2,1)=1, and it's "No."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 2.

In the 2x6 case, b=6 is even, "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, b=2 is even, "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, b=2 is even, "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, b=4 is even, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, b=3 is odd, "No."

In the 2x1 case, b=1 is odd, "No."

In the 1x1 case, b=1 is odd, "No."

So, it seems that if b is even, then "Yes," else "No."

But in the 3x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

In the 6x3 case, b=3 odd, "No."

In the 2x2 case, b=2 even, "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, b=4 even, "Yes."

In the 2x6 case, b=6 even, "Yes."

In the 1x1 case, b=1 odd, "No."

So, it seems that if b is even, then "Yes," else "No."

But why is that?

Because if b is even, I can cut the rectangle into two equal parts along the length, each of size a x (b/2).

Then, I can place these two pieces side by side along the width to form a new rectangle of size (a + a) x (b/2) = 2a x (b/2).

But 2a x (b/2) is the same as a x b, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, but in the sample explanations, they formed different rectangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider rotating the pieces.

If I have two pieces of a x (b/2), and I rotate one of them, I can arrange them differently.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, cutting into two 2x3 pieces, and then placing them side by side to form a 4x3 rectangle.

So, it's not just placing them side by side along the width, but arranging them in a different configuration.

So, perhaps, in general, if b is even, I can cut the rectangle into two a x (b/2) pieces and arrange them to form a new rectangle of size (2a) x (b/2), which is different from the original if 2a != b and b/2 != a.

Wait, but in the 2x6 case, 2a = 4 and b/2 = 3, which is different from the original 2x6.

Similarly, in the 3x2 case, cutting into two 3x1 pieces, and arranging them to form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

In the 2x2 case, cutting into two 1x2 pieces, and arranging them to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

In the 2x4 case, cutting into two 1x4 pieces, and arranging them to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

In the 6x3 case, b=3 is odd, so can't cut into two equal parts.

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, I can cut along the length into two 3x3 pieces, but arranging them only gives a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Alternatively, cutting along the width into, say, 6x1 and 6x2, but arranging these doesn't give a new rectangle.

Hence, "No."

Similarly, in the 2x1 case, cutting into two 1x1 pieces, and arranging them gives only a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Hence, "No."

In the 1x1 case, can't be cut.

Hence, "No."

So, it seems that if b is even, then "Yes," else "No."

Therefore, the condition is simply whether b is even.

Hence, the function func_1(a, b) should return 'yes' if b is even, else 'no.'

But wait, in the sample input, for a=3 and b=2 (even), it's "Yes," but according to this, it should be "Yes" only if b is even, which it is.

Similarly, for a=2 and b=1 (odd), it's "No."

For a=6 and b=3 (odd), it's "No."

For a=2 and b=2 (even), "Yes."

For a=2 and b=4 (even), "Yes."

For a=2 and b=6 (even), "Yes."

For a=1 and b=1 (odd), "No."

So, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the function func_1(a, b) should return 'yes' if b is even, else 'no.'

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting his original rectangle and rearranging the pieces.

## Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces.
   - We need to determine if the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are considered the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the width \( b \) of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two pieces and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If \( b \) is odd, it's not possible to form a different rectangle through such cuts.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - Check if \( b \) is even.
   - If \( b \% 2 == 0 \), output "Yes".
   - Otherwise, output "No".

## Solution Code

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

## Explanation
- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
  - Use the function `func_1(a, b)` to check if \( b \) is even.
  - Print "Yes" if \( b \) is even, otherwise print "No".

- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function takes two integers \( a \) and \( b \) as input.
  - It returns 'yes' if \( b \) is even, indicating that a different rectangle can be formed.
  - It returns 'no' if \( b \) is odd, indicating that no different rectangle can be formed.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(1) \) per test case, as it only involves a single modulo operation and a conditional check.
  - This makes it suitable for the constraints, where the number of test cases can be up to 10,000.

**Final Solution Code**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting his original rectangle and rearranging the pieces.

## Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces.
   - We need to determine if the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are considered the same.
