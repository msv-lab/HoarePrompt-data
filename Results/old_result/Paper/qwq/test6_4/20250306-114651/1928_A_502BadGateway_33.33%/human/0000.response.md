Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, or if he's just wasting his time.

First, I need to understand the process step by step. Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of its sides, so he could either cut along the length or the width. Let's consider both options.

If he cuts parallel to the width (along the length), he would be dividing the length a into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the length (along the width), he divides b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles. He can rotate and move these pieces around to try and form a new rectangle. The question is whether this new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rotations don't count as different.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For a 1x1 rectangle, it can't be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no new rectangle can be formed.

- For a 2x1 rectangle, cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation. So, no.

- For a 2x6 rectangle, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- For a 3x2 rectangle, cutting it into two 3x1 rectangles allows forming a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, but different from the original 3x2.

- For a 2x2 square, cutting it into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

- For a 2x4 rectangle, cutting it into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into a 4x2 or 2x4, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "Yes" for 2x4, meaning a new rectangle can be formed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think again. If Bob cuts the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 squares, and then arranges them into a 4x2 rectangle, but 4x2 is the same as 2x4 up to rotation, so it shouldn't be considered different. But the sample output says "Yes", meaning a different rectangle can be formed. Maybe I need to consider other ways of cutting.

Wait, perhaps there's more than one way to cut the rectangle. Let's consider both possible cuts: cutting along the length or along the width.

For the 2x4 rectangle:

- Cutting along the length (a): if a=2, cutting into two parts, say 1 and 1, resulting in two 1x4 rectangles. Arranging these can form a 2x4 or 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

- Cutting along the width (b): if b=4, cutting into, say, 2 and 2, resulting in two 2x2 squares. Arranging these can form a 4x2 rectangle, which again is the same as the original up to rotation.

But the sample output is "Yes", so there must be another way to cut it to get a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe the cut doesn't have to be in the middle. For example, cutting the 2x4 rectangle along the width into parts of 1 and 3, resulting in a 2x1 and a 2x3 rectangle. Then, arranging these, perhaps by placing them side by side to form a 2x4, which is the same as the original, or stacking them to form a 4x1 or 4x3 rectangle. Wait, a 4x1 is the same as 1x4, which would be different from the original 2x4.

But in the problem statement, it says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, 4x1 is the same as 1x4. Is 4x1 different from 2x4? Well, 4x1 has dimensions 4 and 1, while 2x4 has dimensions 2 and 4. These are different sets of dimensions, so they are different rectangles.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2x4, the output is "Yes", meaning a different rectangle can be formed. So, in this case, cutting into 2x1 and 2x3, and then arranging them into a 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought that 4x1 is different from 2x4, so it should be considered a different rectangle. So, the sample output is "Yes", which matches this.

But earlier, I thought that cutting into two squares of 2x2 would give a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4 up to rotation, so no new rectangle. But since there's at least one way to cut and rearrange to get a different rectangle, the answer is "Yes".

So, the rule seems to be: if there exists at least one way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a rectangle different from the original (up to rotation), then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, I need to find a general way to determine this for any given a and b.

Let's consider the possible cuts:

1. Cutting parallel to the width (dividing the length a into a1 and a2):

- After cutting, we have two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

- We can arrange these two rectangles in two ways:

- Place them side by side along the width: (a1 + a2) x b, which is the same as the original a x b.

- Place them side by side along the length: max(a1, a2) x (b + b), which is max(a1, a2) x 2b.

- Or, place one on top of the other: min(a1, a2) x 2b.

Wait, actually, when arranging two rectangles, there are limited ways to combine them into a new rectangle.

Given two rectangles of sizes c x d and e x f, to form a new rectangle, we can place them side by side along one dimension or stack them along the other.

But in this problem, since both pieces are from the same original rectangle, their dimensions are related.

In our case, after cutting, we have two rectangles of sizes a1 x b and a2 x b (with a1 + a2 = a).

If we place them side by side along the width, we get (a1 + a2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

If we place them side by side along the length, we get max(a1, a2) x (b + b) = max(a1, a2) x 2b.

But is this max(a1, a2) x 2b different from the original a x b?

Well, since a = a1 + a2, and max(a1, a2) is at least a/2, but it's not necessarily equal to a/2 unless a1 = a2.

So, in general, max(a1, a2) x 2b is different from a x b, unless max(a1, a2) x 2b equals a x b.

Wait, let's see:

If max(a1, a2) x 2b = a x b.

Assume a1 <= a2, so max(a1, a2) = a2.

Then, a2 x 2b = a x b => 2 a2 b = a b => 2 a2 = a => a2 = a/2.

So, only if a2 = a/2, which requires a to be even, and a1 = a - a2 = a/2.

But in this case, max(a1, a2) x 2b = (a/2) x 2b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

So, in this case, it's the same as the original.

Therefore, unless a1 and a2 are both equal to a/2, the new rectangle max(a1, a2) x 2b is different from the original a x b.

But, if a is even and a1 = a2 = a/2, then it's the same as the original.

Wait, but in the sample input of 2x4, if we cut into two 1x4 rectangles, and arrange them to form a 2x4, which is the same as the original.

But the sample output is "Yes", which suggests that there's another way to cut and rearrange to get a different rectangle.

So, perhaps I need to consider other ways of arranging the pieces.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider cutting along the other side.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width (dividing a into a1 and a2):

- Two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

- Arranging them:

- Side by side along the width: (a1 + a2) x b = a x b (same as original).

- Side by side along the length: max(a1, a2) x 2b.

- If a1 != a2, then max(a1, a2) x 2b != a x b, so it's a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, if a1 != a2, then max(a1, a2) x 2b != a x b.

But in the sample input of 2x4, a=2, b=4, cutting into a1=1, a2=1 is not possible because a1 + a2 = 2, and a1 = a2 =1, which is a/2, but a is even.

Wait, a=2 is even, a1=a2=1, which according to earlier, max(a1,a2)x2b =1x8, which is 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, it's different.

But the sample output is "Yes", meaning a different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in this case, cutting into two 1x4 rectangles and arranging them side by side along the length gives a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

So, in this case, it's "Yes".

But earlier, I thought that only when a is even, we can get a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No".

Wait, 6x3: cutting along a, a=6, b=3.

If we cut a into 3 and 3, then two 3x3 squares, arranging them side by side along the width gives 6x3 (same as original), or side by side along the length gives 3x6, which is the same as 6x3 up to rotation.

If we cut a into 2 and 4, then two rectangles 2x3 and 4x3.

Arranging them side by side along the width gives 6x3 (same as original).

Arranging them side by side along the length gives max(2,4)x6 =4x6, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", meaning no different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but according to my reasoning, 4x6 is different from 6x3 up to rotation.

Wait, no, 4x6 is the same as 6x4, which is different from 6x3.

But the sample output is "No", which contradicts my reasoning.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after rearranging, the new rectangle must have integer sides, and it must not be the same as the original up to rotation.

But in the case of 6x3, cutting into 2x3 and 4x3, and arranging them to form a 4x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x4, which is different from 6x3.

So, why is the sample output "No"?

Wait, maybe because 6x4 is considered the same as 4x6, but it's different from 6x3.

But according to the problem, two rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

Wait, but 6x4 and 4x6 are the same up to rotation, but both are different from 6x3.

So, perhaps in this case, 6x4 is considered a different rectangle from 6x3.

But the sample output is "No", meaning no different rectangle can be formed.

This contradicts my earlier thought.

I must have misunderstood the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, for example, 6x4 and 4x6 are considered the same.

But 6x4 is different from 6x3.

However, in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No", meaning that no different rectangle can be formed.

But according to my earlier reasoning, cutting into 2x3 and 4x3 and arranging them into a 4x6 (which is the same as 6x4), which is different from 6x3.

So, why is the sample output "No"?

Perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle must not only be different but also possible to form from the two pieces.

Wait, maybe it's impossible to form a 4x6 rectangle from a 2x3 and a 4x3 rectangle.

Let me think about how to arrange these two pieces.

I have a 2x3 rectangle and a 4x3 rectangle.

Option 1: Place them side by side along the width.

- Total width: 2 + 4 = 6, height: 3 => 6x3, same as original.

Option 2: Place them side by side along the length.

- Take the maximum height: max(2,4)=4, and total width: 3 + 3 =6 =>4x6.

So, 4x6 is different from 6x3.

But in the sample output, it's "No", meaning that this doesn't count as forming a different rectangle.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original, even after rotation.

In other words, if the sorted dimensions of the new rectangle are different from the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle, then it's considered different.

For example:

Original: 6x3, sorted dimensions: [3,6]

New: 4x6, sorted dimensions: [4,6]

Since [4,6] != [3,6], it's different.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", meaning it's not considered different.

This contradicts my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle must not only have different dimensions but also satisfy some other condition.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

"Thus, from the 2×6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because it can be cut into two 2×3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 4×3 rectangle, which is different from the 2×6 rectangle."

"However, from the 2×1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two 1×1 rectangles, and from these, only the 1×2 and 2×1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same."

"In the first test case, the 1×1 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it."

"In the fourth test case, the 3×2 rectangle can be cut into two 3×1 rectangles, and from these, the 1×6 rectangle can be formed."

"In the fifth test case, the 2×2 rectangle can be cut into two 1×2 rectangles, and from these, the 1×4 rectangle can be formed."

Looking at the sample input and output:

7

1 1 No

2 1 No

2 6 Yes

3 2 Yes

2 2 Yes

2 4 Yes

6 3 No

From this, I need to find a pattern or a rule to determine when it's "Yes" and when it's "No".

Looking at the dimensions:

1x1: can't be cut into two rectangles -> No

2x1: cutting into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which are the same as the original -> No

2x6: cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, which can form 4x3, which is different from 2x6 -> Yes

3x2: cutting into two 3x1 rectangles, which can form 1x6, which is different from 3x2 -> Yes

2x2: cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, which can form 1x4, which is different from 2x2 -> Yes

2x4: cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, which can form 4x2, which is the same as 2x4, but perhaps there's another way to cut and form a different rectangle -> Yes

6x3: cutting into two 3x3 rectangles, which can form 3x6, same as original, or cutting into 2x3 and 4x3, which can form 4x6, which is different from 6x3, but the output is No.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that in the case of 6x3, any way of cutting and rearranging still results in a rectangle that is the same as the original up to rotation.

But in the earlier thought, cutting into 2x3 and 4x3 and forming a 4x6, which is different from 6x3.

But the sample output is No, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original, even after rotation, and in the case of 6x3 and 4x6, they are considered different because [4,6] != [3,6].

But according to the sample output, it's No, so perhaps there's another constraint.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions.

Wait, in 6x3, the original dimensions are 6 and 3.

The new rectangle is 4x6, which has dimensions 4 and 6.

Comparing to the original, 6 is the same, but 4 is different.

So, perhaps if at least one dimension is different, it's considered a different rectangle.

But in this case, since 6 is the same as one of the original dimensions, maybe it's not considered different.

Wait, but in the explanation for the 2x6 rectangle, it's considered different because 4x3 is different from 2x6.

In that case, 4 is different from 2 and 6, and 3 is different from 2 and 6.

So, perhaps the rule is that the sorted dimensions of the new rectangle are different from the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle.

In the case of 2x6 and 4x3:

Sorted original: [2,6]

Sorted new: [3,4]

These are different.

In the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

Sorted original: [3,6]

Sorted new: [4,6]

These are different.

But according to the sample output, for 6x3, it's No, meaning no different rectangle can be formed.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle must not only have different dimensions but also satisfy that neither dimension is the same as any of the original dimensions.

In other words, for the new rectangle to be considered different, none of its dimensions should match any of the original dimensions.

So, for 2x6 and 4x3:

Original dimensions: 2 and 6

New dimensions: 4 and 3

None of the new dimensions match the original dimensions -> different rectangle.

For 6x3 and 4x6:

Original dimensions: 3 and 6

New dimensions: 4 and 6

One dimension (6) is the same as one of the original dimensions -> not considered different.

Therefore, in this case, it's "No".

This seems to align with the sample output.

Similarly, for 2x4:

Original dimensions: 2 and 4

Possible new rectangle: 4x2, which is the same as original.

Another possible new rectangle: 2x4, same as original.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "Yes", so there must be another way to cut and rearrange.

Wait, perhaps cutting along the width into 1x4 and 3x4 rectangles.

Arranging them side by side along the width: (1+3)x4=4x4, which is different from 2x4.

Sorted original: [2,4]

Sorted new: [4,4]

These are different -> "Yes".

Similarly, for 3x2:

Original: [2,3]

Possible new rectangle: 1x6

Sorted new: [1,6]

Different from original -> "Yes".

For 2x2:

Original: [2,2]

Possible new rectangle: 1x4

Sorted new: [1,4]

Different from original -> "Yes".

For 2x1:

Original: [1,2]

Possible new rectangle: 1x2

Sorted new: [1,2]

Same as original -> "No".

For 1x1:

Can't be cut -> "No".

For 6x3:

Original: [3,6]

Possible new rectangle: 4x6

Sorted new: [4,6]

Different from original, but since 6 is the same, according to this rule, it's different, but sample output is "No".

Wait, maybe the rule is that the new rectangle is considered different only if both dimensions are different from both original dimensions.

In the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

New dimensions: 4 and 6

Original dimensions: 3 and 6

Here, 6 matches, so it's not considered different.

In the case of 2x6 and 4x3:

New dimensions: 4 and 3

Original dimensions: 2 and 6

Neither 4 nor 3 matches 2 or 6 -> different.

In the case of 2x4 and 4x4:

New dimensions: 4 and 4

Original dimensions: 2 and 4

One dimension (4) matches original dimension -> not considered different.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes", which contradicts this rule.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle is considered different if at least one dimension is different and the area is the same.

Wait, but in all these cases, the area remains the same, since we're just rearranging the pieces.

Wait, no, the area remains the same, but the problem is about the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that the new rectangle is different if its sorted dimensions are not equal to the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle.

So, for original a x b, sorted dimensions are [min(a,b), max(a,b)].

New rectangle has dimensions c x d, sorted as [min(c,d), max(c,d)].

If [min(c,d), max(c,d)] != [min(a,b), max(a,b)], then it's different.

In the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

Sorted original: [3,6]

Sorted new: [4,6]

These are different -> should be "Yes", but sample output is "No".

Wait, perhaps there's another constraint.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, two rectangles are considered the same if their sorted dimensions are equal.

In other words, two rectangles are different if their sorted dimensions are different.

But according to this, 6x3 and 4x6 have sorted dimensions [3,6] and [4,6], which are different, so they should be considered different.

But the sample output is "No", meaning no different rectangle can be formed.

This suggests that there might be an additional constraint that I'm missing.

Perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from both original dimensions.

In other words, neither dimension of the new rectangle should match any dimension of the original rectangle.

In the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

New dimensions: 4 and 6

Original dimensions: 3 and 6

Here, 6 matches, so it's not considered different.

In the case of 2x6 and 4x3:

New dimensions: 4 and 3

Original dimensions: 2 and 6

Neither 4 nor 3 matches 2 or 6 -> different.

In the case of 2x4 and 4x4:

New dimensions: 4 and 4

Original dimensions: 2 and 4

4 matches original dimension -> not different.

But according to the sample output, for 2x4, it's "Yes", which suggests that there's another way to cut and rearrange to get a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe cutting differently.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle along the width into 1 and 3, getting two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x3.

Arranging them side by side along the width: (1+3)x2=4x2, which is the same as original.

Arranging them side by side along the length: max(2,2)x(1+3)=2x4, same as original.

Alternatively, arranging the 2x1 and 2x3 rectangles to form a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps arranging them in a T-shape or something, but since we can only move and rotate the rectangles, but they must remain intact, I think the only way to combine them is by placing them side by side along one dimension.

So, perhaps in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle, but the sample output is "Yes", so maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows cutting along the other side.

Wait, perhaps cutting along the width into 1 and 1, getting two 1x4 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 2x4, which is the same as original.

Alternatively, cutting along the height into 2 and 2, getting two 2x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 4x2, which is the same as original.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes", so there must be another way.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Perhaps the problem allows cutting into non-integer dimensions, but no, the problem states that the cuts are into integer sides.

Wait, perhaps cutting into different ratios.

For example, cutting the 2x4 rectangle along the width into 1 and 3, getting 2x1 and 2x3 rectangles.

Then, rotating the 2x1 rectangle to 1x2, and placing it next to the 2x3 rectangle.

But arranging a 1x2 and a 2x3 rectangle to form a new rectangle.

If I place the 1x2 on top of the 2x3, I get a total height of 2 + 2 = 4, and width 3, so 4x3.

But 4x3 is different from 2x4, sorted dimensions [3,4] vs [2,4], which are different.

So, in this case, it's "Yes".

But earlier, I thought that 4x3 is different from 2x4, but according to the sample input, for 6x3, 4x6 is different from 6x3, but it's "No".

Wait, perhaps the rule is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from both original dimensions.

In the case of 2x4 and 4x3:

Original dimensions: 2 and 4

New dimensions: 3 and 4

Here, 4 matches the original, but 3 doesn't.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes".

In the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

Original dimensions: 3 and 6

New dimensions: 4 and 6

Here, 6 matches the original, but 4 doesn't.

But the sample output is "No".

This suggests that if any dimension of the new rectangle matches any dimension of the original rectangle, it's not considered different.

Therefore, in the case of 2x4 and 4x3, since 4 matches the original, it's not considered different, so it should be "No", but the sample output is "Yes".

This inconsistency suggests that my understanding is incomplete.

Perhaps I need to consider more factors.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have an area equal to the original area and have different dimensions that are not proportional to the original dimensions.

Wait, but all new rectangles have the same area as the original.

So, perhaps the condition is that the new rectangle has sorted dimensions different from the sorted original dimensions.

But in the case of 6x3 and 4x6:

Sorted original: [3,6]

Sorted new: [4,6]

These are different, so it should be "Yes", but the sample output is "No".

This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the new rectangle cannot be obtained by rotating the original rectangle, and also cannot have any dimension equal to any original dimension.

In that case, for 6x3 and 4x6:

New dimensions: 4 and 6

Original dimensions: 3 and 6

Since 6 matches, it's not considered different -> "No".

For 2x4 and 4x3:

New dimensions: 3 and 4

Original dimensions: 2 and 4

Since 4 matches, it's not considered different -> "No".

But according to the sample output, for 2x4, it's "Yes", so perhaps there's another way to cut and rearrange.

Wait, maybe cutting into 1x4 and 1x4 rectangles, but that's not possible since a=2.

Wait, perhaps cutting along the height into 1 and 1, getting two 1x4 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 2x4, which is the same as original.

Alternatively, cutting along the width into 2 and 2, getting two 2x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 4x2, which is the same as original.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes", so there must be another way.

Wait, maybe cutting along the width into 1 and 3, getting a 2x1 and a 2x3 rectangle.

Then, arranging them side by side along the width: (1+3)x2=4x2, same as original.

Arranging them side by side along the height: max(2,2)x(1+3)=2x4, same as original.

Alternatively, arranging the 2x1 and 2x3 rectangles in a different configuration.

If I rotate the 2x1 rectangle to 1x2 and place it next to the 2x3 rectangle, how does that form a new rectangle?

Placing a 1x2 rectangle next to a 2x3 rectangle:

- If placed side by side along the width: total width 1 + 2 = 3, height 3 => 3x3.

- If placed side by side along the height: total height max(2,3)=3, width 2 + 1=3 =>3x3.

So, forming a 3x3 square, which is different from 2x4.

Sorted original: [2,4]

Sorted new: [3,3]

These are different -> "Yes".

This matches the sample output.

Similarly, for 6x3:

Original: [3,6]

Possible cutting and rearranging:

Cut along the width into 1 and 5: two rectangles 1x3 and 5x3.

Arranging them side by side along the width: (1+5)x3=6x3, same as original.

Arranging them side by side along the height: max(1,5)x3=5x6.

Sorted new: [5,6]

Compared to original [3,6], different -> should be "Yes", but sample output is "No".

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that the new rectangle must not have any dimension equal to any original dimension.

In this case, 5 and 6 compared to 3 and 6: 6 matches, so it's not considered different.

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, forming a 3x3 from a 2x4, with no matching dimensions, it's "Yes".

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2x4, it's "Yes", and for 6x3, it's "No".

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle where neither of the new dimensions matches any of the original dimensions, then output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

In the 2x4 case:

Original: [2,4]

Possible new rectangle: 3x3

New dimensions: 3 and 3

Neither 3 matches the original dimensions -> "Yes".

In the 6x3 case:

Original: [3,6]

Possible new rectangle: 5x6

New dimensions: 5 and 6

6 matches original dimension -> not different.

Another possible new rectangle: 4x6

New dimensions: 4 and 6

6 matches original dimension -> not different.

Another possible new rectangle: 3x6

New dimensions: 3 and 6

Both match original dimensions -> not different.

Hence, no different rectangle can be formed -> "No".

This seems consistent with the sample output.

Therefore, the rule is:

- After cutting and rearranging, if there exists a way to form a new rectangle where neither of its dimensions matches any of the original rectangle's dimensions, then output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient way to determine this for each test case.

Let's outline the steps:

1. For a given rectangle a x b, consider all possible ways to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.

2. For each way of cutting, consider all possible ways to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.

3. Check if any of these new rectangles have both dimensions different from both of the original rectangle's dimensions.

4. If such a new rectangle exists, output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

However, considering all possible cuts could be time-consuming, especially since t can be up to 10^4 and a and b can be up to 10^9.

I need a smarter way to determine this without iterating through all possible cuts.

Let's think about the possible cuts and arrangements.

First, consider cutting parallel to the width (dividing a):

- Choose a cut position k (1 <= k < a), creating two rectangles: k x b and (a - k) x b.

- When arranging these two rectangles, there are two ways:

a. Place them side by side along the width: (k + (a - k)) x b = a x b (same as original).

b. Place them side by side along the height: max(k, a - k) x (b + b) = max(k, a - k) x 2b.

- So, the new rectangle would be max(k, a - k) x 2b.

- For this to be different from the original, neither max(k, a - k) nor 2b should match a or b.

Similarly, consider cutting parallel to the height (dividing b):

- Choose a cut position m (1 <= m < b), creating two rectangles: a x m and a x (b - m).

- Arranging them:

a. Side by side along the width: (a + a) x m = 2a x m.

b. Side by side along the height: max(m, b - m) x (a + a) = max(m, b - m) x 2a.

- So, the new rectangle would be max(m, b - m) x 2a.

- For this to be different from the original, neither max(m, b - m) nor 2a should match a or b.

So, for cutting along a:

- New rectangle: max(k, a - k) x 2b

- Check if max(k, a - k) != a and max(k, a - k) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- New rectangle: max(m, b - m) x 2a

- Check if max(m, b - m) != a and max(m, b - m) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

Wait, but k and m are variables depending on the cut position.

I need to find if there exists at least one k or m such that the new rectangle dimensions satisfy the conditions.

Let's consider cutting along a:

- For some k, max(k, a - k) x 2b is different from a and b.

- Specifically, max(k, a - k) != a and max(k, a - k) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Wait, 2b is fixed for a given b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- max(m, b - m) x 2a is different from a and b.

- max(m, b - m) != a and max(m, b - m) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

But 2a is fixed for a given a.

This seems a bit messy.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle will have one dimension that is twice the original dimension, and the other dimension is the maximum of the two parts from the cut.

So, for cutting along a:

- New rectangle: max(k, a - k) x 2b

- To be different from original, max(k, a - k) != a and max(k, a - k) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- New rectangle: max(m, b - m) x 2a

- To be different from original, max(m, b - m) != a and max(m, b - m) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

But I need to find if there exists at least one k or m such that the new rectangle dimensions satisfy the conditions.

Wait, for cutting along a:

- max(k, a - k) can take values from max(1, a-1) to max(a-1, 1), which is a-1.

- So, max(k, a - k) can be from ceil(a/2) to a-1.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- max(m, b - m) can be from ceil(b/2) to b-1.

So, for cutting along a:

- New rectangle: max(k, a - k) x 2b

- Need to check if there exists a k such that max(k, a - k) != a and max(k, a - k) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Wait, but max(k, a - k) is always less than a, since k < a.

Wait, no, if k = a - 1, then max(k, a - k) = max(a - 1, 1) = a - 1.

Similarly, for k = 1, max(1, a - 1) = a - 1.

So, max(k, a - k) = a - 1 for any k from 1 to a - 1.

Therefore, for cutting along a:

- New rectangle: (a - 1) x 2b

- Check if (a - 1) != a and (a - 1) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- New rectangle: (b - 1) x 2a

- Check if (b - 1) != a and (b - 1) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic, as for some a and b, there might be multiple ways to cut, but in this approach, max(k, a - k) is always a - 1.

Is that correct?

Wait, no, for k from 1 to a - 1, max(k, a - k) is indeed a - 1.

So, for cutting along a, the new rectangle is always (a - 1) x 2b.

Similarly, for cutting along b, it's (b - 1) x 2a.

Then, to have a different rectangle, neither dimension should match the original dimensions.

So, for cutting along a:

- Check if (a - 1) != a and (a - 1) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- Check if (b - 1) != a and (b - 1) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

Wait, 2a != a is always true for a > 0, since a > 0.

Similarly, 2b != b is always true for b > 0.

So, for cutting along a:

- Check if (a - 1) != a and (a - 1) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Simplify:

- (a - 1) != a is always true.

- So, check (a - 1) != b and 2b != a and 2b != b.

Similarly, for cutting along b:

- Check (b - 1) != a and (b - 1) != b and 2a != a and 2a != b.

Simplify:

- (b - 1) != b is always true.

- So, check (b - 1) != a and 2a != b.

But 2a != b is not always true; it depends on a and b.

So, for cutting along a, the new rectangle is (a - 1) x 2b.

For this to be different from the original, we need (a - 1) != b and 2b != a.

Similarly, for cutting along b, the new rectangle is (b - 1) x 2a.

For this to be different from the original, we need (b - 1) != a and 2a != b.

Therefore, if either of these conditions is satisfied for any cut, then output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Wait, but in reality, there might be multiple ways to cut, and for each way, max(k, a - k) can be different.

Wait, in my earlier assumption, I thought max(k, a - k) is always a - 1, but that's not correct.

Actually, for k from 1 to floor(a/2), max(k, a - k) = a - k, which is from a - 1 to ceil(a/2).

Wait, more precisely, for k from 1 to floor(a/2), max(k, a - k) = a - k.

For k from ceil(a/2) to a - 1, max(k, a - k) = k.

So, max(k, a - k) ranges from ceil(a/2) to a - 1.

Similarly for b.

Therefore, for cutting along a, the new rectangle can have dimensions from ceil(a/2) to a - 1 for one dimension, and 2b for the other.

Similarly, for cutting along b, the new rectangle can have dimensions from ceil(b/2) to b - 1 for one dimension, and 2a for the other.

Now, to have a different rectangle, neither of the new dimensions should match any of the original dimensions.

So, for cutting along a:

- Check if there exists a max(k, a - k
