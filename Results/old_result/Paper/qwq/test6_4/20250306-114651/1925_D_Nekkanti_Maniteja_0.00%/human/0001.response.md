Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a certain friendship value. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children equiprobably and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that doesn't change.

I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship values can increase over time for friend pairs.

The answer should be in the form of p/q where p and q are coprime, and I need to compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7).

First, I need to understand the process:

1. There are n children, and m friend pairs with initial friendship values f_i.

2. For each excursion, a pair is chosen randomly from all possible pairs (n choose 2).

3. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

4. The friendship value of non-friend pairs is always 0 and doesn't change.

I need to find the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of choosing each pair over k excursions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, note that the total number of possible pairs is n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Each pair is chosen with equal probability in each excursion.

Now, for friend pairs, their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

For non-friend pairs, their friendship value is always 0.

So, for each excursion, the chosen pair's friendship value is added to the sum.

If it's a friend pair, their current friendship value is considered, and then it increases by 1 for future excursions.

If it's a non-friend pair, 0 is added, and nothing changes.

I need to find the expected sum of these friendship values over k excursions.

Let me consider the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let's denote the friendship value of friend pair j at time t as f_j(t).

Initially, f_j(0) = f_j.

Each time pair j is chosen, f_j increases by 1.

So, f_j(t) = f_j(0) + number of times pair j has been chosen up to time t.

Wait, but in this problem, the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions once chosen.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, it's not that the friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen, but rather it increases by 1 after they are chosen, and this increased value applies to all future excursions.

Wait, no: "their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, it's a permanent increase for future excursions.

Wait, but the problem says: "their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, when a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1, and this new value applies to all future excursions.

But, in the description, it says: "the friendship value of a pair who are friends is considered at the time of being chosen."

Wait, re-reading:

"Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen)."

So, the friendship value is considered at the time of being chosen, not after.

So, when a pair is chosen, their friendship value at that moment is added to the sum, and then, if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

So, the increase happens after being chosen, but in the sum, we consider the value at the time of choosing.

So, for each excursion, we add the current friendship value of the chosen pair (if they are friends), and then, if they are friends, increase their friendship value by 1 for future excursions.

Wait, but non-friend pairs have friendship value 0 and don't change.

So, for friend pairs, their friendship value starts at f_j and increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

But in the sum, we add their friendship value at the time of choosing, not after.

So, if a friend pair is chosen multiple times, each time their friendship value is added to the sum, and then it increases by 1 for future excursions.

Okay, so I need to compute the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choosing over k excursions.

This seems like a problem involving expectation and possibly linearity of expectation.

Let me think about linearity of expectation.

Let X be the total sum of friendship values over k excursions.

Then, X = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk, where Xi is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the i-th excursion.

By linearity of expectation, E[X] = E[X1] + E[X2] + ... + E[Xk].

So, I need to compute E[Xi] for each i from 1 to k and sum them up.

Now, each E[Xi] is the expected friendship value of the pair chosen in the i-th excursion.

But the choices are dependent because choosing a friend pair increases their friendship value for future excursions.

Wait, but in this problem, the teacher chooses pairs independently, meaning that each time a pair is chosen, it's chosen randomly from all possible pairs, independently of previous choices.

However, the friendship values can increase over time based on how many times they have been chosen in the past.

Wait, but the problem says: "the teacher can choose a pair of children more than once."

So, pairs can be chosen multiple times, and each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

But in the sum, we consider the friendship value at the time of choosing.

So, for each chosen pair, if they are friends, their current friendship value is added to the sum, and then their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

For non-friend pairs, their friendship value is always 0 and doesn't change.

Given that the choices are independent, meaning that each time a pair is chosen, it's chosen randomly from all possible pairs with equal probability, independently of previous choices.

This means that the choice in each excursion doesn't depend on previous choices, but the friendship values can change based on previous choices.

This seems quite involved.

Let me try to model this.

Let's denote the friendship value of friend pair j at time t as f_j(t).

Initially, f_j(0) = f_j.

Each time friend pair j is chosen at time t, f_j(t+1) = f_j(t) + 1.

And at time t, when a pair is chosen, if it's a friend pair, its current friendship value f_j(t) is added to the sum.

Non-friend pairs always have friendship value 0.

Since the choices are independent, the probability of choosing any particular pair in any excursion is the same, which is 2 / (n choose 2), but wait, n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so the probability of choosing any specific pair is 2 / (n*(n-1)).

Wait, actually, n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so the probability of choosing any specific pair is 1 / (n choose 2) = 2 / (n*(n-1)).

But since the choices are independent, the choice in each excursion doesn't depend on previous choices.

However, the friendship values do depend on previous choices because choosing a friend pair increases its friendship value for future excursions.

This seems tricky because the friendship values are dependent on the history of choices.

I need to find a way to compute the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choosing over k excursions.

Let me consider the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

For each friend pair j, let's define X_j as the sum of its friendship values over all the times it is chosen in the k excursions.

Then, X = sum over j of X_j.

So, E[X] = sum over j of E[X_j].

Now, for each friend pair j, E[X_j] is the expected sum of its friendship values each time it is chosen.

Since the choices are independent, the number of times pair j is chosen follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p, where p = 1 / (n choose 2).

Each time pair j is chosen, its friendship value at that time is added to the sum.

But its friendship value increases by 1 each time it is chosen.

Wait, no.

Wait, when pair j is chosen, its current friendship value is added to the sum, and then it increases by 1 for future excursions.

So, the friendship value increases after it is chosen.

So, the first time it is chosen, its friendship value is f_j.

The second time it is chosen, its friendship value is f_j + 1.

The third time, f_j + 2, and so on.

So, if pair j is chosen t times, the sum of its friendship values is f_j + (f_j + 1) + (f_j + 2) + ... + (f_j + t - 1) = t*f_j + (t*(t-1))/2.

So, E[X_j] = E[t * f_j + (t*(t-1))/2], where t is the number of times pair j is chosen.

Since t follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p, where p = 1 / (n choose 2).

So, E[t] = k * p = k / (n choose 2)

E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2 = k*(k-1)/(n choose 2)^2

Therefore, E[X_j] = E[t] * f_j + E[(t*(t-1))/2] = (k / (n choose 2)) * f_j + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2))

But wait, this seems off because the second term should account for the increasing friendship value.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it differently.

Let me consider that each time pair j is chosen, its friendship value at that time is f_j plus the number of times it has been chosen so far.

Wait, no.

Wait, initially, f_j(0) = f_j.

First time chosen: add f_j to the sum, then f_j(1) = f_j + 1.

Second time chosen: add f_j +1 to the sum, then f_j(2) = f_j + 2.

And so on.

So, if pair j is chosen t times, the total contribution to the sum is f_j + (f_j +1) + (f_j +2) + ... + (f_j + t -1) = t*f_j + (t*(t-1))/2

So, E[X_j] = E[t*f_j + (t*(t-1))/2] = f_j * E[t] + (E[t*(t-1)])/2

We have E[t] = k * p = k / (n choose 2)

E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2 = k*(k-1)/(n choose 2)^2

Therefore, E[X_j] = f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2))

But this seems incomplete because it doesn't account for the fact that the friendship value increases each time the pair is chosen.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the order of choices.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total expected sum over all k excursions.

Each excursion, a pair is chosen randomly, and if it's a friend pair, its current friendship value is added to the sum, and then its friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

Since the choices are independent, perhaps I can model the expected increase in friendship values separately.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen, and then compute the expected sum based on that.

Let me denote p = 1 / (n choose 2), the probability of choosing a specific friend pair in one excursion.

For each friend pair j, let t_j be the number of times it is chosen in k excursions.

t_j follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p.

The sum of friendship values for pair j is sum over t_j of f_j + (number of times chosen before the current choice)

Wait, this seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each friend pair j, each time it is chosen, its friendship value at that time is f_j plus the number of times it has been chosen so far minus one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the expected sum recursively.

Define E[X] as the expected sum over k excursions.

In the first excursion, we choose a pair uniformly at random.

If it's a non-friend pair, we add 0 to the sum.

If it's a friend pair j, we add f_j to the sum and then increase f_j by 1 for future excursions.

Then, for the next excursion, the friendship values have potentially changed.

This seems like a Markov process, where the state is the current friendship values of all friend pairs.

But with m friend pairs, and k up to 2e5, this seems too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, maybe I can consider that each friend pair contributes independently to the expected sum, considering the probability of being chosen in each excursion and the increase in their friendship value.

Given that the choices are independent, perhaps I can model the expected contribution of each friend pair separately and then sum them up.

Let me try that.

For a single friend pair j with initial friendship value f_j.

Let p = 1 / (n choose 2)

Let's compute the expected sum of its friendship values over k excursions.

Let t be the number of times it is chosen in k excursions.

t follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p.

Given that it is chosen t times, the sum of its friendship values is f_j + (f_j +1) + ... + (f_j + t -1) = t*f_j + t*(t-1)/2

Therefore, E[sum for pair j] = sum over t from 0 to k of Pr(t) * (t*f_j + t*(t-1)/2)

where Pr(t) = C(k, t) * p^t * (1-p)^(k-t)

This is E[t*f_j + t*(t-1)/2] = f_j * E[t] + E[t*(t-1)/2]

We know E[t] = k*p = k / (n choose 2)

E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2 = k*(k-1)/(n choose 2)^2

Therefore, E[sum for pair j] = f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2))

Wait, but this seems too simplistic, and I suspect it's missing something.

Wait, in reality, the friendship values of different pairs are independent only insofar as they are not affected by each other's choices.

But in this problem, choosing one friend pair increases only its own friendship value, not affecting others.

Therefore, perhaps the expected sum is just the sum over all friend pairs of their expected contributions.

So, E[X] = sum over j of E[sum for pair j]

Which would be sum over j of (f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2)))

Wait, but this seems odd because the second term doesn't depend on j.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E[t*(t-1)/2]

Actually, E[t*(t-1)/2] = (E[t*(t-1)]) / 2 = (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2

So, E[sum for pair j] = f_j * (k * p) + (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2

But p = 1 / (n choose 2)

So, E[sum for pair j] = f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2))

Now, sum over all friend pairs, E[X] = sum over j of E[sum for pair j] = sum over j of (f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(2*(n choose 2)^2)))

But this seems incorrect because the second term is independent of j, but there are m friend pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to multiply the second term by m.

Wait, no, each friend pair has its own t_j, and the increases are independent.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the total sum is the sum over all chosen pairs, and for each chosen pair, if it's a friend pair, add its current friendship value.

Given that choices are independent, maybe I can compute for each friend pair, the expected number of times it's chosen, and its expected friendship value at the time of each choice.

Then, E[X_j] = E[sum over times t when pair j is chosen of f_j + (number of times chosen before t)]

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the total expected sum as k times the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen pair.

Since choices are independent, the expected sum is just k times the expected friendship value of a single excursion.

So, E[X] = k * E[friendship value of a single excursion]

Now, E[friendship value of a single excursion] = sum over all friend pairs of Pr(pair j is chosen) * f_j(t)

But f_j(t) depends on how many times pair j has been chosen before time t.

This seems too involved.

Wait, maybe I can model this as follows:

Let's consider that in each excursion, the friendship value of a friend pair j is f_j plus the number of times it has been chosen before.

So, if a pair has been chosen t times before, its friendship value is f_j + t.

But since choices are independent, the number of times a pair has been chosen before time t is the number of previous excursions where it was chosen.

This seems too recursive.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the expected sum is the sum over all excursions of the expected friendship value of the chosen pair.

So, E[X] = sum from t=1 to k of E[friendship value at time t]

Now, at time t, the expected friendship value is the probability of choosing each friend pair times its friendship value at time t.

But the friendship value at time t depends on how many times it has been chosen before time t.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can model the expected friendship value at time t for a friend pair j as f_j plus the expected number of times it has been chosen before time t.

So, E[f_j(t)] = f_j + E[number of times chosen before t]

But since choices are independent, the expected number of times chosen before t is (t-1)*p, where p = 1 / (n choose 2)

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let p = 1 / (n choose 2)

For each friend pair j, let t_j be the number of times it is chosen in k excursions.

t_j follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p.

The sum of friendship values for pair j is sum from s=1 to t_j of f_j + (s-1)

Which is t_j * f_j + (t_j * (t_j - 1)) / 2

Therefore, E[sum for pair j] = E[t_j * f_j + (t_j^2 - t_j)/2] = f_j * E[t_j] + (E[t_j^2] - E[t_j])/2

We know E[t_j] = k * p = k / (n choose 2)

And E[t_j^2] = Var(t_j) + (E[t_j])^2 = k*p*(1-p) + (k*p)^2

So, E[t_j^2] = k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2

Therefore, E[sum for pair j] = f_j * (k*p) + (k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2 - k*p)/2

Simplify:

E[sum for pair j] = f_j * (k / (n choose 2)) + (k*p*(1 - p) + k^2 * p^2 - k*p)/2

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the expected sum is the sum over all k excursions of the expected friendship value of the chosen pair.

So, E[X] = k * E[friendship value of a single excursion]

Now, E[friendship value of a single excursion] = sum over all friend pairs of Pr(pair j is chosen) * f_j(t)

But f_j(t) is f_j plus the number of times pair j has been chosen before time t.

This seems too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expected friendship value at time t as f_j plus the expected number of times pair j has been chosen before time t.

So, E[f_j(t)] = f_j + E[number of times chosen before t] = f_j + (t - 1) * p

Then, E[sum for pair j] = sum from t=1 to k of Pr(pair j is chosen at time t) * E[f_j(t)]

But this still seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the choices are independent, and thus the expected sum is just k times the probability of choosing a friend pair times its expected friendship value.

But friendship values increase over time, so it's not straightforward.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the example in the problem to see if I can get some intuition.

In the second test case:

n=2, m=1, k=10

The only friend pair is (1,2) with f=1

Total pairs = 1 (since n=2)

So, in each excursion, the same pair is chosen every time.

So, first time: choose (1,2), add f=1, then f becomes 2

Second time: choose (1,2), add f=2, then f becomes 3

And so on up to 10 times.

So, sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55

Which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

n=3, m=1, k=2

Friend pair is (2,1) with f=1

Total pairs = 3

So, probability of choosing the friend pair in each excursion is 1/3

Expected sum:

There are two excursions.

In the first excursion:

Pr choose friend pair = 1/3, add f=1

Pr choose non-friend pair = 2/3, add 0

In the second excursion:

If friend pair was chosen in the first excursion:

Pr choose friend pair again = 1/3, add f=2 (since it was increased by 1 after the first choice)

If friend pair was not chosen in the first excursion:

Pr choose friend pair = 1/3, add f=1

Pr choose non-friend pair = 2/3, add 0

So, total expected sum:

Pr(friend first time) * [1 (first choice) + 2 (second choice)] + Pr(non-friend first time) * [0 (first choice) + Pr(friend second time) *1 + Pr(non-friend second time)*0]

Wait, let's compute it properly.

Let me define:

A: friend pair chosen in first excursion

B: friend pair chosen in second excursion

Then, E[X] = E[X1 + X2] = E[X1] + E[X2]

E[X1] = Pr(A) * f_A(1) + Pr(not A) * 0 = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3

E[X2] = Pr(B) * f_B(2) + Pr(not B) * 0

But f_B(2) depends on whether the friend pair was chosen in the first excursion.

Wait, more carefully:

E[X2] = Pr(B and A) * (f_A(1) +1) + Pr(B and not A) * f_A(1) + Pr(not B) * 0

Wait, this is getting messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of linearity of expectation, considering each friend pair separately.

Given that in this problem, m can be up to 1e5 and k up to 2e5, and t up to 5e4, I need an efficient solution, likely O(m + k) per test case.

So, perhaps
