Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array `a` of length `2n`, and it contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice. Then there's an integer `k` (between `1` and `n/2`), and I need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, with specific properties.

First, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem also mentions that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a sequence `x` is a subset of `y` if `x` can be obtained by deleting several elements from `y` and rearranging them in any order. So, order doesn't matter, and I can choose any elements from the first `n` for `l` and from the last `n` for `r`.

The main condition is that the XOR of elements in `l` should equal the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, no. Actually, each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice, but not necessarily once in each half. The problem says: "l is a subset of [a1, a2, ..., an]" and "r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, ..., a2n]". So, the first `n` elements are divided into two parts: the first half and the second half.

Wait, no. The array `a` has `2n` elements, with each number from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice. These two occurrences of each number can be anywhere in the array, but for the subsets `l` and `r`, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements.

Wait, but the array has `2n` elements, indexed from `1` to `2n`. The first `n` elements are `a1` to `an`, and the last `n` elements are `a{n+1}` to `a{2n}`.

So, I need to choose `l` from the first `n` elements and `r` from the last `n` elements, each of size `2k`, such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

I need to find such subsets `l` and `r`.

Given that, I need to find a way to select elements from the first `n` and the last `n` such that their XORs are equal.

First, I need to understand the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and it's its own inverse.

Given that, if I have two sets with equal XOR, then the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero.

But maybe that's too abstract for now.

Let me think about a simple approach.

One way to ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r` is to make sure that the XOR of all elements in `l` and `r` together is zero.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. If XOR of `l` equals XOR of `r`, then XOR of `l` XORed with XOR of `r` is zero, which means XOR of the union of `l` and `r` with even counts of each element would be zero.

But since `l` and `r` are subsets from different halves, and each number appears exactly twice in the whole array, I need to consider how the selections interact.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider the XOR of the first `n` elements and the XOR of the last `n` elements.

Let me denote:

- XOR_first = XOR of a1 to an

- XOR_last = XOR of a{n+1} to a{2n}

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the whole array, XOR_first XOR XOR_last should be zero, because each number is XORed twice, and XOR of a number with itself is zero.

So, XOR_first = XOR_last.

That's an important observation.

Given that, I need to find subsets `l` and `r` of sizes `2k` each, with l from the first half and r from the second half, such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Since XOR_first = XOR_last, and l is a subset of the first half, r is a subset of the second half, maybe I can use this to find such subsets.

But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about a simpler case.

Suppose k=1, so I need to pick 2 elements from the first half and 2 elements from the second half, such that their XORs are equal.

Given that XOR of the entire first half equals XOR of the entire second half, maybe I can select pairs that maintain this equality.

Alternatively, perhaps I can select elements such that the XOR difference is balanced.

This seems complicated.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=1

a = [1,2,2,1]

So, first half: [1,2], second half: [2,1]

Choose l=[2,1], r=[2,1], and 2 XOR 1 = 3 for both.

Okay, that makes sense.

In the second test case:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Choose l=[6,4], r=[1,3], and 6 XOR 4 = 2, and 1 XOR 3 = 2.

So, it works.

In the third test case:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First half: [1,2,3,4], second half: [1,2,3,4]

Choose l=[1,2], r=[1,2], and 1 XOR 2 = 3 for both.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First half: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Choose l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]

XOR of l: 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (5 XOR 1) XOR (3 XOR 3) = 4 XOR 0 = 4

XOR of r: 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = (6 XOR 2) XOR (4 XOR 4) = 4 XOR 0 = 4

So, they match.

From these examples, it seems that selecting pairs of identical elements works, since XOR of identical elements is zero, which can be balanced.

But the problem allows subsets with any order and any deletions, as long as the final XOR matches.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider that I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, and knowing that XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is also equal.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since XOR is involved, and we're dealing with subsets, maybe I can look into properties of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Let me think differently.

I can try to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half in such a way that the XOR of the selected elements in both subsets is equal.

One possible way is to select `k` pairs of identical elements, i.e., select both occurrences of `k` different numbers, one from the first half and one from the second half.

Wait, but `k` can be up to `n/2`, and there are only `n` unique numbers, each appearing twice.

Wait, but `k` is up to `floor(n/2)`, so for `n=2`, `k=1`; for `n=4`, `k=2`; etc.

If I select `k` pairs of identical elements, each pair consisting of one from the first half and one from the second half, then the XOR of the selected elements in `l` would be the XOR of `k` pairs, each being a number XORed with itself, which is zero, so overall XOR is zero for both `l` and `r`.

But I need to select `2k` elements, so selecting `k` pairs makes `2k` elements.

But in the first example, they selected [2,1] and [2,1], which are two pairs, and their XOR is 3, not zero.

Wait, in that case, it's not zero.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=1, so `2k=2` elements.

They selected [2,1] and [2,1], and 2 XOR 1 = 3 for both.

So, in this case, the XOR is not zero.

Wait, but according to my earlier idea, if I select pairs of identical elements, their XOR would be zero.

But in this case, it's not zero.

So, perhaps selecting identical pairs isn't the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I need to select different elements.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half, and ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

Given that, I can think of selecting subsets such that the XOR of `l` and `r` are equal.

One way to ensure this is to select subsets where the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` are both equal to half of the total XOR, or something like that.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that since XOR_first = XOR_last, then if I select a subset `l` from the first half with XOR equal to some value `s`, then I need to select a subset `r` from the second half with XOR also equal to `s`.

Given that XOR_last = XOR_first, and I'm selecting subsets with specific XOR, perhaps there's a way to find such subsets.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half, and I need the XOR of `l` to equal the XOR of `r`.

I can think of it as selecting subsets such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Which implies that XOR_l XOR XOR_r = 0, meaning that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` together is zero.

Given that, and knowing that the XOR of the entire first half equals the XOR of the entire second half, perhaps there's a relationship there.

Wait, perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of the unselected elements in both halves is also equal.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in the first half and once in the second half, or possibly both in the same half.

Wait, no, not necessarily. The problem doesn't specify where the duplicates are located; they could be in the same half or in different halves.

Wait, actually, since the first half is a1 to an, and the second half is a{n+1} to a{2n}, and each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, the two occurrences of a number could be both in the first half, both in the second half, or one in each.

But in terms of selecting subsets `l` and `r`, I need to select from their respective halves.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Let me try to count how many times each number appears in the first half and in the second half.

Let me denote:

- For each number i (1 to n), let’s say it appears `f_i` times in the first half and `2 - f_i` times in the second half.

Wait, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

So, if a number appears `f_i` times in the first half, it appears `2 - f_i` times in the second half.

Given that, `f_i` can be 0, 1, or 2.

- If `f_i = 0`, the number appears twice in the second half.

- If `f_i = 1`, the number appears once in the first half and once in the second half.

- If `f_i = 2`, the number appears twice in the first half.

Now, when selecting `l` and `r`, I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` from the second half.

I need to ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

I need to find a way to select these subsets accordingly.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, and that XOR of a set is simply the combination of all elements XORed together.

I need to find two sets `l` and `r` with equal XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the possible selections.

But given the constraints (n up to 50,000 and t up to 5000), I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Wait, but n can be up to 50,000 and t up to 5000, so total time should be acceptable as long as it's O(n) per test case.

But I need to find an efficient way to select the subsets.

Let me consider that since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR_l = XOR_r, perhaps there's a way to select subsets such that the remaining elements in both halves have the same XOR.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that XOR_l = XOR_r = XOR_first.

Because XOR_first = XOR_last, so if XOR_l = XOR_first, then XOR_r = XOR_first as well.

But I need to verify if that's possible.

Wait, but in the first test case, XOR_first = 1 XOR 2 = 3, and XOR_last = 2 XOR 1 = 3, so XOR_l = 2 XOR 1 = 3, XOR_r = 2 XOR 1 = 3, which matches.

In the second test case, XOR_first = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 3) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 1 XOR 3 = (6 XOR 3) XOR (4 XOR 1) = 5 XOR 5 = 0

XOR_last = 1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4 = (1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4) = (1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 4) since 5 XOR 5 = 0 = (1 XOR 6 = 7) XOR (3 XOR 4 = 7) = 7 XOR 7 = 0

So, XOR_first = XOR_last = 0.

In the solution, l = [6,4], r = [1,3], and 6 XOR 4 = 2, 1 XOR 3 = 2, so both are 2, which are equal, but not equal to XOR_first.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps XOR_l doesn't have to be equal to XOR_first.

Wait, but in this case, XOR_l = 2, which is not equal to XOR_first = 0.

So, my previous idea is wrong.

Back to square one.

Let me think differently.

I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of elements, where each pair consists of one element from the first half and one from the second half, and ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in both subsets is the same.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements in such a way that for each pair of identical elements, I select both, one for `l` and one for `r`.

But in the first test case, they selected [2,1] from both halves, which are identical elements.

In the second test case, they selected [6,4] from the first half and [1,3] from the second half, which are different elements.

So, perhaps selecting identical pairs isn't necessary.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the XOR properties of the selected elements.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first half is equal to the XOR of all elements in the second half.

Let me denote S = XOR of a1 to an = XOR of a{n+1} to a{2n}.

Now, suppose I select a subset `l` from the first half with XOR_l, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half would be S XOR XOR_l.

Similarly, if I select a subset `r` from the second half with XOR_r, the XOR of the remaining elements in the second half would be S XOR XOR_r.

But since S = S, we have S XOR XOR_l = S XOR XOR_r, which implies XOR_l = XOR_r.

So, to have XOR_l = XOR_r, I need to select subsets `l` and `r` such that the XOR of the selected elements in both subsets are equal.

But this seems tautological.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting subsets such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that, and knowing that S = XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps I can find subsets `l` and `r` such that XOR_l = XOR_r = some value.

But I need a way to find such subsets efficiently.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in the first half and once in the second half, depending on `f_i`.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, `f_i` can be 0, 1, or 2.

Let me categorize the numbers based on their frequency in the first half.

- If `f_i = 0`: the number appears twice in the second half.

- If `f_i = 1`: the number appears once in the first half and once in the second half.

- If `f_i = 2`: the number appears twice in the first half.

Now, for numbers with `f_i = 0`, I can only select both occurrences in `r`.

For numbers with `f_i = 2`, I can only select both occurrences in `l`.

For numbers with `f_i = 1`, I can select one in `l` and one in `r`.

Wait, but actually, since `l` is a subset of the first half and `r` is a subset of the second half, the selection is constrained by which half the elements are in.

Wait, more carefully:

- For numbers with `f_i = 0`: both occurrences are in the second half. So, in `r`, I can select 0 or 2 occurrences of this number.

- For numbers with `f_i = 1`: one occurrence is in the first half and one in the second half. So, in `l`, I can select 0 or 1 occurrence of this number, and in `r`, I can select 0 or 1 occurrence of this number.

- For numbers with `f_i = 2`: both occurrences are in the first half. So, in `l`, I can select 0, 1, or 2 occurrences of this number.

Given that, I need to select a total of `2k` elements for `l` and `r` each, such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

This seems like a complicated constraint to handle directly.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me consider that since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR_l = XOR_r, perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is also equal.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me consider building `l` and `r` step by step.

First, I can select pairs of identical elements, one from the first half and one from the second half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

But in the second test case, they didn't do that; they selected different elements.

Wait, perhaps I can select as many identical pairs as possible, and then fill the remaining spots with other elements.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can start by selecting numbers with `f_i = 1`, since they appear once in each half.

For each such number, I can choose to include it in `l` or in `r`, but not both.

Wait, but I need to select `2k` elements in total for `l` and `r`.

Wait, no, I need to select `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` elements for `r`, so total `4k` elements selected.

But given that some numbers appear twice, I need to be careful not to select the same element multiple times.

Wait, but since `l` is a subset of the first half and `r` is a subset of the second half, and the two halves are distinct in terms of their elements, I don't have to worry about overlapping selections.

Wait, no, actually, the same number can appear in both halves, but the elements are distinct in the array.

Wait, but in the array, each number appears twice, but the positions are distinct.

So, when selecting elements for `l` and `r`, I need to ensure that I'm selecting different positions, but numbers can be the same.

Wait, no, since `l` is a subset of the first half and `r` is a subset of the second half, and the first half and second half are distinct subsets of positions, I can select the same number in both `l` and `r`, as long as they are different positions.

So, for numbers with `f_i = 1`, I can choose to include the first half occurrence in `l` and the second half occurrence in `r`, or not include them at all.

For numbers with `f_i = 0`, I can include both second half occurrences in `r`.

For numbers with `f_i = 2`, I can include both first half occurrences in `l`.

Perhaps I can start by selecting as many numbers with `f_i = 0` and `f_i = 2` as possible, and then handle the numbers with `f_i = 1` accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can prioritize selecting numbers where both occurrences are in the same half.

For numbers with `f_i = 0`, both are in the second half, so I can select both for `r`.

For numbers with `f_i = 2`, both are in the first half, so I can select both for `l`.

Then, for numbers with `f_i = 1`, I can select one for `l` and one for `r`.

But I need to ensure that the total number of elements selected for `l` and `r` is `2k` each, and that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR_l = XOR_r, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` is equal to the XOR of the entire half.

But in the second test case, XOR_first = XOR_last = 0, but XOR_l = XOR_r = 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to find subsets `l` and `r` such that XOR_l = XOR_r, regardless of the XOR of the entire half.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can select `k` pairs of elements, where each pair consists of one element from the first half and one from the second half, and ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` is equal.

But I need to select `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` for `r`, so perhaps selecting `k` pairs where each pair consists of two elements from the first half and two from the second half.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I select `2k` elements from the first half for `l`, and `2k` elements from the second half for `r`, such that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

I can iterate through the first half and select elements for `l`, keeping track of the current XOR, and try to find a combination in the second half that matches that XOR for `r`.

But that seems too time-consuming for the given constraints.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, and I need to select
