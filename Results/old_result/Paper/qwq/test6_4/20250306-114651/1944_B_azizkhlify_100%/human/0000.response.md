Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `2n`, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in this array. I'm also given an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= floor(n/2)`.

I need to find two arrays, `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`. The array `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem says that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the original sequence and possibly rearranging the remaining elements. So, the order doesn't matter, and I can choose any elements from the first `n` for `l` and from the last `n` for `r`.

My goal is to select `2k` elements for `l` from the first `n` elements and `2k` elements for `r` from the last `n` elements such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, that means each number appears once in the first `n` elements and once in the last `n` elements, right? Wait, no. It's possible for a number to appear twice in the first `n` or twice in the last `n`, depending on how the array is arranged.

Wait, actually, no. Since the array is of length `2n` and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, but there's no restriction on where these two occurrences are. They could both be in the first `n`, both in the last `n`, or one in each.

But the problem defines:

- `l` is a subset of `[a1, a2, ..., an]`

- `r` is a subset of `[a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}]`

So, I need to choose `2k` elements from the first `n` for `l` and `2k` elements from the last `n` for `r`.

Given that, I need to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

I need to find such subsets.

First, I need to think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and it's its own inverse.

I need to find two sets of `2k` elements each, one from the first `n` and one from the last `n`, such that their XORs are equal.

An idea that comes to mind is to try to pair elements in a way that their XORs match, but that might be too time-consuming, especially given the constraints.

Given the constraints, `n` can be up to 5*10^4 and `t` (number of test cases) up to 5000, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 5*10^4, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think differently. Since I need the XOR of `l` to equal the XOR of `r`, that implies that the XOR of all elements in `l` and `r` together should be zero because l XOR r = 0 implies l = r.

Wait, actually, XOR is not quite like equality in that sense. Wait, no, if l XOR r = 0, then l = r, but in this case, l and r are sets of numbers, and I need their XORs to be equal, not necessarily the sets themselves to be equal.

Wait, more precisely, I need XOR of elements in l to be equal to XOR of elements in r.

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which implies that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

Which is the same as XOR(l + r) = 0, where l + r is the combined set of elements in l and r.

So, if I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of all elements in l and r together is zero, that would satisfy the condition.

But I need to select exactly `2k` elements for l and `2k` for r.

So, total of `4k` elements selected: `2k` from the first `n` and `2k` from the last `n`.

And their combined XOR should be zero.

But I need to make sure that I'm selecting exactly `2k` elements for l and r.

Wait, but in the initial approach, if I select `l` and `r` such that XOR(l) = XOR(r), then XOR(l + r) = XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

So, I need to select `l` and `r` such that XOR(l + r) = 0, and |l| = |r| = 2k.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where each number is a vector, and I need to select a subset of vectors such that their sum is zero.

But that might be too slow for the given constraints.

Alternatively, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`, or both in the first `n`, or both in the last `n`.

Wait, no, each number appears exactly twice in the entire array `a`, which consists of `2n` elements.

So, for each number from 1 to n, there are exactly two positions in `a` where it appears.

I need to choose `2k` elements from the first `n` and `2k` from the last `n`, such that the XOR of the chosen elements in both subsets is equal.

Given that, perhaps I can look at the XOR of all elements in the first `n` and the XOR of all elements in the last `n`.

Let me denote:

- XOR_first = XOR of all elements in the first `n`.

- XOR_last = XOR of all elements in the last `n`.

Since the entire array's XOR is XOR_first XOR XOR_last, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, actually, since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, the XOR of the entire array is zero because each number appears twice and XOR of a number with itself is zero.

Therefore, XOR_first XOR XOR_last = 0, which implies XOR_first = XOR_last.

That's an important observation.

So, XOR of the first `n` elements is equal to the XOR of the last `n` elements.

Given that, perhaps I can use this property to find subsets `l` and `r` with equal XOR.

But I need to select exactly `2k` elements for each.

Wait, maybe I can select subsets such that their XOR matches, leveraging the fact that XOR_first = XOR_last.

But I'm not sure yet.

Let me consider a simple example to get some intuition.

Take the first sample input:

2 1

1 2 2 1

So, n=2, k=1.

First n elements: 1,2

Last n elements: 2,1

I need to choose 2 elements for l from the first n, and 2 elements for r from the last n, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Choosing l = [2,1], r = [2,1], XOR(l) = 2 XOR 1 = 3, XOR(r) = 2 XOR 1 = 3, which matches.

Another choice could be l = [1,2], r = [1,2], which is the same.

So, in this case, it's straightforward because both subsets are the same.

But in more complex cases, it might not be so straightforward.

Look at the second sample input:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

Wait, n=6, k=1.

First 6 elements: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Last 6 elements: 1,6,3,5,5,4

I need to choose 2 elements for l from the first 6, and 2 elements for r from the last 6, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

In the sample output, l = [6,4], r = [1,3], and 6 XOR 4 = 2, and 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

So, how to generalize this?

I need a method to select `2k` elements from the first `n` and `2k` from the last `n` with equal XOR.

One approach is to find pairs of elements, one from the first `n` and one from the last `n`, that have the same value, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

But in the first sample, that's what happened: 2 and 1 are present in both halves.

But in the second sample, 6 is in both halves, 4 is in both halves, 2 is in both halves, 1 is in both halves, 3 is in both halves, 5 is only in the last half.

So, perhaps I can select pairs of equal elements, but in the second sample, they chose different elements.

Wait, in the second sample, l = [6,4], r = [1,3], which are different elements.

So, maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

But that seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select some elements for `l` from the first `n`, and some elements for `r` from the last `n`, and ensure that the combined XOR of these selections is zero.

Given that, I can iterate through the elements and make choices accordingly.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Another idea: since XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR is equal to some value, and since XOR_first = XOR_last, it's possible.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the first `n` and last `n`.

For each number from 1 to n, it can appear:

- Twice in the first `n`

- Twice in the last `n`

- Once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`

But wait, no. Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, it can appear:

- Twice in the first `n`

- Once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`

- Twice in the last `n`

So, for each number, I can have:

- both occurrences in the first `n`

- both in the last `n`

- one in each

I need to keep track of how many times each number appears in the first `n` and last `n`.

Let me denote:

- `l_count[i]`: number of times `i` appears in the first `n`

- `r_count[i]`: number of times `i` appears in the last `n`

Given that, `l_count[i] + r_count[i] = 2` for all `i` from 1 to n.

My goal is to select `2k` elements from the first `n` and `2k` from the last `n` such that XOR of selected elements in both subsets is equal.

I need to maximize the use of pairs where both elements are available in either half.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs where both elements are the same and available in both halves.

But in the second sample, they selected different elements.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the XOR properties more carefully.

Let me consider that I need to select subsets `l` and `r` such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which is equivalent to XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, meaning the XOR of the combined selected elements is zero.

So, I need to select `2k` elements from the first `n`, and `2k` from the last `n`, such that the XOR of all these selected elements is zero.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the elements and make choices accordingly.

But I need an efficient way to do this within the time constraints.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), and l is a subset of the first `n` and r is a subset of the last `n`, both of size `2k`.

I can try to select `l` as some subset of the first `n` and then select `r` such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that, since XOR_last is known, and XOR(r) should be equal to XOR(l), and r is a subset of the last `n` of size `2k`, I can try to find such a subset.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can select `l` to be any subset of the first `n` of size `2k`, compute its XOR, and then try to find a subset `r` in the last `n` of size `2k` with the same XOR.

But this might not be efficient enough, especially with the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and subsets.

I recall that in problems involving XOR and subsets, Gaussian elimination can be used to find subsets with a desired XOR value.

But given the constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that XOR_first = XOR_last to my advantage.

Let me consider that.

Since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), and l and r are subsets of the first `n` and last `n` respectively, both of size `2k`.

I can think of it as selecting subsets such that their XORs are equal to some value, but I need to find a way to efficiently select such subsets.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided code and see what approach it's taking.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

l = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

re = ul = ur = 0

res = []

for i in range(n):

l[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n,2*n):

r[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i],end=' ')

l[a[i]-1] =0

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

k = 2*k - ul

if k:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==1:

print(a[i],end=' ')

re +=1

res.append(a[i])

if re ==k:

break

print()

for i in res:

print(i,end=' ')

if ul != ur:

for i in range(n,2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i],end=' ')

r[a[i]-1] =0

ur +=2

if ul == ur:

break

print()

So, the code is trying to select elements for `l` and `r` in a specific way.

Let's understand what it's doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases `t`.

Then, for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a` of length `2n`.

It initializes two frequency arrays `l` and `r`, each of size `n`, to count the occurrences of each number in the first `n` and last `n` elements respectively.

Then, it iterates through the first `n` elements to count their frequencies in `l`, and through the last `n` elements to count their frequencies in `r`.

After that, it iterates through the first `n` elements again and checks if a number appears twice in the first `n` (`l[a[i]-1] == 2`). If so, it prints that number twice as part of `l`, sets `l[a[i]-1] = 0`, and increments `ul` by 2.

It does this until `ul` reaches `2k`, meaning it has selected `2k` elements for `l` from the first `n` where each selected number appears twice in the first `n`.

Then, it calculates `k = 2*k - ul`, which would be zero if `ul` already reached `2k`, or some negative value otherwise. But since `ul` cannot exceed `2k`, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, `ul` is incremented by 2 each time it finds a number that appears twice in the first `n`, and stops when `ul` reaches `2k`. So, `k = 2*k - ul` would be zero if `ul` reached `2k`, otherwise it would be negative. But since `ul` cannot exceed `2k`, perhaps the intention is to select remaining elements if `ul` is less than `2k`.

But in the code, if `k` is truthy (i.e., not zero), it proceeds to select elements where `l[a[i]-1] == 1`, meaning numbers that appear only once in the first `n`.

It prints these elements and adds them to the `res` list until it selects the required number of elements to make up `2k` in total for `l`.

Then, it prints a newline and prints the elements in `res`.

After that, if `ul != ur`, it tries to select elements from the last `n` that appear twice (`r[a[i]-1] == 2`), prints them twice, sets `r[a[i]-1] = 0`, increments `ur` by 2, and breaks when `ul == ur`.

Finally, it prints a newline.

But wait, `ur` is not being updated in this code, which might be a mistake.

Wait, `ur` is initialized to zero, and in the last loop, it increments `ur` by 2 each time it selects a number that appears twice in the last `n`. But `ur` is not being used elsewhere in the code, and it's not clear how it relates to the selection of `r`.

Moreover, the code only prints `l` and then prints `res` as part of `r`, but it's not clear if `res` is intended to be `r` or part of `l`.

This seems confusing.

Also, in the first loop, when selecting elements for `l` where `l[a[i]-1] == 2`, it prints them twice and sets `l[a[i]-1] = 0`. But in the second loop, when `l[a[i]-1] == 1`, it prints them once and adds to `res`.

But `res` is then printed again in the next line.

It's not clear how this ensures that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

Moreover, in the last loop, it seems to be trying to balance `ul` and `ur`, but `ur` is not being updated properly.

This suggests that the code might be incorrect.

Let me think of a different approach.

Given that XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), and l is a subset of the first `n` and r is a subset of the last `n`, both of size `2k`.

I can consider selecting `l` as a subset of the first `n` of size `2k`, and then select `r` as a subset of the last `n` of size `2k` such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that XOR_first = XOR_last, and I can select subsets appropriately, this should be possible.

But implementing this efficiently is challenging.

An alternative approach is to select `l` as any subset of the first `n` of size `2k`, compute its XOR, and then try to find a subset `r` in the last `n` of size `2k` with the same XOR.

But this is too slow for the given constraints.

Another idea is to use the fact that XOR_first = XOR_last, and try to select subsets such that their XOR matches.

Wait, perhaps I can select `l` to include some pairs that appear twice in the first `n`, and adjust `r` accordingly.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps I can select pairs of numbers that appear in both halves to balance the XOR.

But I need a clearer plan.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first `n` is equal to the XOR of all elements in the last `n`.

So, XOR_first = XOR_last.

Now, I need to select `l` from the first `n` and `r` from the last `n`, each of size `2k`, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which implies that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, meaning XOR(l + r) = 0.

Alternatively, XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can select `l` such that XOR(l) is some value, and then select `r` such that XOR(r) matches XOR(l).

But how to efficiently select such subsets?

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I select some elements for `l` and some for `r`, and keep track of the XORs as I go.

I can try to build `l` and `r` incrementally, ensuring that their XORs remain equal.

But this might not lead to an efficient solution.

Another idea: since XOR_first = XOR_last, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), perhaps I can select `l` to be a subset of the first `n` with XOR equal to XOR_first, and `r` to be a subset of the last `n` with XOR equal to XOR_last.

But that would require selecting subsets with specific XOR values, which is again complicated.

Wait, but since XOR_first = XOR_last, selecting `l` with XOR(l) = XOR_first and `r` with XOR(r) = XOR_last would satisfy XOR(l) = XOR(r).

But I need to select exactly `2k` elements for each.

This might not directly help.

I need to find a way to select `2k` elements for `l` from the first `n` and `2k` elements for `r` from the last `n` such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient solution, likely involving frequency counts and selecting elements accordingly.

Perhaps I can group elements based on their frequencies in the first and last `n`.

For example:

- If a number appears twice in the first `n`, I can select both instances for `l`.

- If a number appears twice in the last `n`, I can select both instances for `r`.

- If a number appears once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`, I can select one for `l` and one for `r`.

But I need to ensure that the total number of selected elements for `l` and `r` is `2k` each, and that their XORs are equal.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` for `r`, perhaps I can pair the occurrences of the same number and decide how to assign them to `l` and `r`.

But again, I need to ensure the XORs match.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs of identical numbers and assign them to `l` and `r` in a way that balances the XOR.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider that selecting two identical numbers in `l` or `r` will contribute zero to the XOR, since XORing a number with itself gives zero.

So, if I select pairs of identical numbers, their XOR contribution is zero.

Given that, perhaps I can select as many pairs as possible from both `l` and `r`, and then handle the remaining elements accordingly.

This might be a way to simplify the problem.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- For each number that appears twice in the first `n`, I can select both for `l`, which contributes zero to XOR(l).

- Similarly, for numbers that appear twice in the last `n`, I can select both for `r`, contributing zero to XOR(r).

- For numbers that appear once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`, I need to decide how to assign them to `l` and `r`.

Given that, perhaps I can first select all possible pairs from the first `n` and last `n` where the number appears twice in one half, and then handle the remaining pairs where the number appears once in each half.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, count the frequency of each number in the first `n` and last `n`.

Initialize `l` and `r` as lists to store the selected elements.

First, iterate through the numbers and for each number:

- If it appears twice in the first `n`, select both for `l`, adding them to `l`, and reduce the frequency.

- If it appears twice in the last `n`, select both for `r`, adding them to `r`, and reduce the frequency.

- If it appears once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`, I need to decide how to assign them.

After selecting as many pairs as possible from the first `n` and last `n`, I can then handle the remaining assignments to reach the required `2k` elements for `l` and `r`.

This seems like a plausible approach.

Let me see how this aligns with the provided code.

In the provided code, it seems to select elements that appear twice in the first `n` and add both to `l`, and then select elements that appear once in the first `n` to reach the required `2k` elements for `l`.

Then, it prints `res`, which seems to be part of `r`.

But it's not clear how it ensures that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Moreover, the variable `ur` is not being updated properly, which might be a mistake.

Given that, I suspect that the provided code might not be correct.

I need to think of a better way to ensure that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me consider that I can select `l` to be any subset of the first `n` of size `2k`, and then select `r` to be a subset of the last `n` of size `2k` such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that, and knowing that XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps there's a way to adjust the selections accordingly.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first `n` is equal to the XOR of all elements in the last `n`.

So, XOR_first = XOR_last.

Now, if I select a subset `l` from the first `n` with XOR(l), then to have XOR(r) = XOR(l), I need to select a subset `r` from the last `n` with XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that XOR of all elements in the last `n` is XOR_last, which is equal to XOR_first, perhaps I can find a subset `r` in the last `n` with XOR(r) = XOR(l).

This seems possible, but I need to ensure that such a subset exists and that I can select exactly `2k` elements for `r`.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select `2k` elements for `l` from the first `n` and `2k` elements for `r` from the last `n`, with XOR(l) = XOR(r), and given that XOR_first = XOR_last, perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that the symmetric difference of their selections balances out.

But this is too vague.

I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider that selecting pairs of identical numbers, one for `l` and one for `r`, might help in balancing the XOR.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers into those that appear twice in the first `n`, twice in the last `n`, or once in each.

Then, I can decide how many pairs to select from each group.

For example:

- For numbers that appear twice in the first `n`, selecting both for `l` adds zero to XOR(l).

- For numbers that appear twice in the last `n`, selecting both for `r` adds zero to XOR(r).

- For numbers that appear once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`, selecting one for `l` and one for `r` adds the number's value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r), so their XORs remain equal.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Group A: numbers that appear twice in the first `n`.

- Group B: numbers that appear twice in the last `n`.

- Group C: numbers that appear once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`.

For Group A, selecting both occurrences for `l` adds zero to XOR(l).

For Group B, selecting both occurrences for `r` adds zero to XOR(r).

For Group C, selecting one for `l` and one for `r` adds the number's value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r), so their XORs remain equal.

Given that, perhaps I can:

1. Select as many full pairs from Group A for `l` as possible, which adds zero to XOR(l).

2. Select as many full pairs from Group B for `r` as possible, which adds zero to XOR(r).

3. For the remaining required elements in `l` and `r`, select pairs from Group C, assigning one to `l` and one to `r`.

This way, the XORs of `l` and `r` remain equal.

Let me see if this works.

Suppose I have `k` pairs to select.

I can select up to floor(count_A / 2) pairs from Group A for `l`, each contributing zero to XOR(l).

Similarly, select up to floor(count_B / 2) pairs from Group B for `r`, each contributing zero to XOR(r).

Then, for the remaining pairs needed to reach `k`, select from Group C, assigning one to `l` and one to `r`, each contributing their value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r), keeping them equal.

This seems correct.

Let me see if this aligns with the provided code.

In the provided code, it seems to select elements that appear twice in the first `n` and add both to `l`, which aligns with selecting full pairs from Group A.

Then, it selects elements that appear once in the first `n` for `l`, which could be part of Group C.

But it's not clear how it handles Group B and ensures that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Moreover, the code doesn't seem to handle Group C properly, and it doesn't ensure that the XORs are equal.

Given that, I suspect that the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find two subsets, `l` and `r`, each of size `2k`, from the first `n` and last `n` elements of an array `a` of length `2n`, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. 

### Approach

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Count the frequency of each number in the first `n` and last `n` elements.
    
2. **Grouping Numbers**:
    - **Group A**: Numbers that appear twice in the first `n`.
    - **Group B**: Numbers that appear twice in the last `n`.
    - **Group C**: Numbers that appear once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`.

3. **Selecting Pairs**:
    - Select full pairs from Group A for `l` and from Group B for `r`. Each full pair contributes zero to the XOR.
    - For the remaining pairs needed to reach `2k`, select pairs from Group C, assigning one to `l` and one to `r`. This ensures that the XOR contributions from these pairs are equal for both `l` and `r`.

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - We count how many times each number appears in the first `n` and last `n` elements.
    
2. **Grouping Numbers**:
    - **Group A**: Numbers that appear twice in the first `n`.
    - **Group B**: Numbers that appear twice in the last `n`.
    - **Group C**: Numbers that appear once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`.

3. **Selecting Pairs**:
    - We select full pairs from Group A for `l` and from Group B for `r`. Each full pair contributes zero to the XOR.
    - For the remaining pairs needed to reach `2k`, we select pairs from Group C, assigning one to `l` and one to `r`. This ensures that the XOR contributions from these pairs are equal for both `l` and `r`.

This approach ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` have equal XOR values and are of the required size.
