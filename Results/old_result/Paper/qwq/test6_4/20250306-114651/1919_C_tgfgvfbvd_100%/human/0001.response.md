Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of numbers, and I need to split it into two subsequences: s and t. Then, for each of these subsequences, I have to calculate something called penalty, which is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the sequence. Finally, I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties from s and t.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], possible subsequences could be [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even an empty sequence.

The problem allows me to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, such that every element of the original array is in either s or t. So, it's like partitioning the array into two sequences, and each element goes into one of them.

The penalty for a sequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, for a sequence like [1, 3, 2], the penalty would be 1 because 3 < 2 is false, but 1 < 3 is true, so that counts as one penalty.

My goal is to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties from s and t.

I need to find a way to split the original array into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing adjacent pairs in both subsequences is minimized.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. Let's think about this step by step.

First, if I could arrange the elements in such a way that in each subsequence, the elements are non-increasing, then the penalty for each subsequence would be zero because there would be no increasing adjacent pairs. But is that possible?

Well, if I have a sequence where all elements are non-increasing, then splitting it into one subsequence with all elements would give me zero penalty. But in general, the sequence might be arbitrary, so I might need to split it into two subsequences to achieve zero penalty.

Wait a minute, maybe I can think in terms of partitioning the sequence into two non-increasing subsequences. If I can partition the original sequence into two subsequences where each subsequence is non-increasing, then the total penalty would be zero, which is the minimal possible.

So, the problem reduces to whether I can partition the sequence into two non-increasing subsequences.

But, in general, this might not always be possible. For example, if the sequence has a strictly increasing subsequence of length more than two, I might not be able to partition it into two non-increasing subsequences without having some increasing pairs.

Wait, actually, if I have a sequence where the number of elements that are part of an increasing subsequence is more than the capacity of one subsequence, I might need to use the second subsequence to handle them.

This seems a bit vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of non-increasing subsequences needed to partition the sequence. This is related to the concept of the " Dilworth's theorem " in order theory, which states that the minimal number of chains (in this case, non-decreasing subsequences) needed to partition a poset is equal to the size of the largest antichain. But in this problem, we have two subsequences, and we want them to be non-increasing.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed, but I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let's look at the examples provided:

First test case:

5

1 2 3 4 5

A possible split is s=[2,4,5], t=[1,3]. Penalty is p(s)=2 (since 2<4 and 4<5) + p(t)=1 (since 1<3) = 3.

But is this the minimal penalty? What if I split s=[1,2,3,4,5], t=[]? Then p(s)=4 (1<2,2<3,3<4,4<5) + p(t)=0 =4, which is worse than 3.

Another split: s=[1,3,5], t=[2,4]. p(s)=2 (1<3,3<5) + p(t)=1 (2<4) =3, same as before.

Is there a way to get a lower penalty? Let's try s=[1,2,4], t=[3,5]. p(s)=2 (1<2,2<4) + p(t)=1 (3<5) =3 again.

It seems like 3 is the minimal penalty I can get for this case.

Wait, but according to the note, in the first test case, a possible way to split is s=[2,4,5], t=[1,3], with penalty 2 +1=3. But is there a way to get a lower penalty, say 2? Let's try.

Suppose s=[1,3,5], t=[2,4]. p(s)=2 + p(t)=1 =3.

Or s=[1,2,5], t=[3,4]. p(s)=2 + p(t)=1=3.

I can't seem to find a split that gives a penalty less than 3. So, perhaps 3 is the minimal penalty for this case.

Second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

A possible split is s=[8,3,1], t=[2,1,7,4,3]. p(s)=0 (since 8>3>1) + p(t)=1 (since 1<7) =1.

Is there a way to get a lower penalty, say 0? Let's see.

If I split s=[8,3,2,1,1], t=[7,4,3]. p(s)=0 + p(t)=0 (since 7>4>3) =0.

Wait, is that a valid split? Let's check if s and t are both subsequences of the original array.

Original array: 8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3

s: 8,2,1,1 (positions 1,2,4,5)

t: 3,7,4,3 (positions 3,6,7,8)

Wait, but in s, the elements are 8,2,1,1, which are in the original order, and t has 3,7,4,3, which are also in the original order. So, yes, this is a valid split.

In this split, p(s)=0 (since 8>2>1>1) + p(t)=0 (since 3>7 is false, but p(t) counts the number of times an element is less than the next one, which in this case, 3<7 is true, so p(t)=1.

Wait, no, p(t) would be 1 because 3<7.

So, the penalty is 0 +1=1.

Is there a way to get penalty 0? That would require both s and t to have no increasing adjacent pairs.

In the split above, t has 3<7, which is an increasing pair.

Is there a different split where neither s nor t has any increasing pairs?

Let's try s=[8,3,1,1], t=[2,7,4,3].

s: 8>3>1>1 (no increasing pairs)

t: 2<7>4>3 (only 2<7 is an increasing pair)

So, p(s)=0 + p(t)=1=1.

Same as before.

Another split: s=[8,3,1], t=[2,1,7,4,3].

s: 8>3>1 (no increasing pairs)

t: 2>1<7>4>3 (has 1<7, which is an increasing pair)

p(s)=0 + p(t)=1=1.

Again, same penalty.

Is there a split where t has no increasing pairs?

Let's try s=[8,2,1,1], t=[3,7,4,3].

s: 8>2>1>1 (no increasing pairs)

t: 3>7>4>3 (no increasing pairs, since 3<7 is false, 7>4, 4>3)

Wait, 3<7 is false because 3<7 is true, but p(t) counts the number of times b_i < b_{i+1}, so in t, 3<7 is true, so p(t)=1.

So, p(s)=0 + p(t)=1=1.

Still the same.

Is there a split where t has no increasing pairs?

Let's try s=[8,3,1,7,4,3], t=[2,1].

s: 8>3>1<7>4>3 (has 1<7, which is an increasing pair)

p(s)=1

t: 2>1 (no increasing pairs)

p(t)=0

Total penalty=1+0=1.

Same as before.

Seems like I can't get below penalty 1 in this test case.

According to the note, a possible split is s=[8,3,1], t=[2,1,7,4,3], with penalty 0+1=1.

So, it seems that 1 is the minimal penalty for this test case.

Hence, the minimal penalty is 1.

Third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

A possible split is s=[], t=[3,3,3,3,3]. p(s)=0 + p(t)=0=0.

Since all elements are equal, there are no increasing pairs in t.

Hence, minimal penalty is 0.

Fourth test case:

1

1

A possible split is s=[1], t=[].

p(s)=0 + p(t)=0=0.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Possible split s=[2,1], t=[].

p(s)=0 (since 2>1) + p(t)=0=0.

Alternatively, s=[2], t=[1]. p(s)=0 + p(t)=0=0.

So, minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that if I can partition the sequence into two non-increasing subsequences, then the penalty would be zero. If that's not possible, the penalty would be the number of increasing pairs that can't be avoided.

Wait, but in the second test case, I couldn't get penalty zero, even though I tried to partition into two non-increasing subsequences. Maybe it's not possible to have both s and t non-increasing in that case.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both subsequences.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of decreasing pairs, but since each pair can be either increasing or decreasing, and I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs, it's similar to maximizing the number of decreasing pairs.

But that seems too vague.

Maybe I can model this as a graph problem, where each element is a node, and edges represent the order constraints.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Suppose I iterate through the array, and for each element, I decide which subsequence to assign it to, in a way that minimizes the penalty.

I can maintain two sequences, s and t, and try to assign each new element to the sequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

But how do I determine that?

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the last elements of s and t, and assign the current element to the sequence where it is less than or equal to the last element, to avoid creating an increasing pair.

If I can't assign it to either without creating an increasing pair, then I have to assign it to the sequence where it creates the least number of new increasing pairs.

Wait, maybe I need to track the number of increasing pairs in each sequence as I build them.

This seems too vague.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The reference solution seems to be implementing a greedy algorithm.

It initializes two variables, a and b, to keep track of the smallest elements in s and t, respectively.

It sets a and b to infinity initially.

Then, for each element in the array, it checks:

- If a > b, it swaps a and b. This ensures that a is the smaller of the two.

- If the current element l[x] is less than or equal to a, it assigns it to s and sets a to l[x].

- Else, if l[x] is less than or equal to b, it assigns it to t and sets b to l[x].

- Else, it assigns it to s, sets a to l[x], and increments the counter c.

Finally, it prints c, which seems to be the minimal penalty.

Wait, this seems similar to the patience sorting algorithm or the way to find the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed.

In fact, this algorithm is similar to the way to find the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed, but here it's adapted to have only two subsequences.

Let me see how this works.

By maintaining two variables, a and b, which represent the smallest ending elements of the two subsequences s and t.

Initially, a and b are infinity.

For each element l[x] in the array:

- If l[x] is less than or equal to a, assign it to s and set a to l[x].

- Else, if l[x] is less than or equal to b, assign it to t and set b to l[x].

- Else, assign it to s, set a to l[x], and increment c.

What does c represent? It seems to represent the number of times we had to start a new subsequence in s when we couldn't assign to either s or t without violating the non-increasing property.

Wait, but in this algorithm, we only have two subsequences, s and t.

So, c counts the number of times we had to assign an element to s, starting a new increasing sequence in s.

Wait, but in the first test case, with array [1,2,3,4,5], let's see how this algorithm works.

Initialize a = inf, b = inf

For l[0]=1:

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. So a=inf, b=inf.

1 <= a (inf), so assign to s, set a=1.

c=0.

s=[1], t=[].

For l[1]=2:

a=1, b=inf.

a > b? No.

2 <= a (1)? No.

2 <= b (inf)? Yes, assign to t, set b=2.

c=0.

s=[1], t=[2].

For l[2]=3:

a=1, b=2.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. So a=2, b=1.

3 <= a (2)? No.

3 <= b (1)? No.

So, assign to s, set a=3, c=1.

s=[1,3], t=[2].

For l[3]=4:

a=3, b=1.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. So a=1, b=3.

4 <= a (1)? No.

4 <= b (3)? No.

So, assign to s, set a=4, c=2.

s=[1,3,4], t=[2].

For l[4]=5:

a=4, b=3.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. So a=3, b=4.

5 <= a (3)? No.

5 <= b (4)? No.

So, assign to s, set a=5, c=3.

s=[1,3,4,5], t=[2].

Total c=3, which matches the first test case.

So, in this algorithm, c counts the number of times we had to assign an element to s, starting a new increasing sequence in s.

Wait, but in this case, s=[1,3,4,5], which has three increasing pairs: 1<3, 3<4, 4<5, so p(s)=3.

t=[2], p(t)=0.

Total penalty is 3+0=3, which matches the first test case.

So, c seems to be counting the number of increasing pairs in s.

Wait, but in s=[1,3,4,5], there are three increasing pairs, and c=3.

In the algorithm, c is incremented each time we assign an element to s and set a to that element, except for the first assignment.

So, in this case, c is equal to the number of increasing pairs in s.

Wait, but in the second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

Let's apply the algorithm.

Initialize a=inf, b=inf.

l[0]=8:

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. a=inf, b=inf.

8 <= a (inf), assign to s, set a=8.

c=0.

s=[8], t=[].

l[1]=2:

a=8, b=inf.

a > b? No.

2 <= a (8)? Yes, assign to s, set a=2.

c=0.

s=[8,2], t=[].

l[2]=3:

a=2, b=inf.

a > b? No.

3 <= a (2)? No.

3 <= b (inf)? Yes, assign to t, set b=3.

c=0.

s=[8,2], t=[3].

l[3]=1:

a=2, b=3.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. a=3, b=2.

1 <= a (3)? Yes, assign to s, set a=1.

c=0.

s=[8,2,1], t=[3].

l[4]=1:

a=1, b=2.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. a=2, b=1.

1 <= a (2)? Yes, assign to s, set a=1.

c=0.

s=[8,2,1,1], t=[3].

l[5]=7:

a=1, b=1.

a > b? No.

7 <= a (1)? No.

7 <= b (1)? No.

So, assign to s, set a=7, c=1.

s=[8,2,1,1,7], t=[3].

l[6]=4:

a=7, b=1.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. a=1, b=7.

4 <= a (1)? No.

4 <= b (7)? Yes, assign to t, set b=4.

c=1.

s=[8,2,1,1,7], t=[3,4].

l[7]=3:

a=1, b=4.

a > b? Yes, swap a and b. a=4, b=1.

3 <= a (4)? Yes, assign to s, set a=3.

c=1.

s=[8,2,1,1,7,3], t=[3,4].

Total c=1, which matches the second test case.

In this case, p(s)= number of times an element is less than the next one in s.

s: 8>2>1>1<7>3, so p(s)=1 (1<7)

t: 3<4, so p(t)=1.

Total penalty =1+1=2, but according to the note, the penalty is 0+1=1.

Wait, but in the note, they have s=[8,3,1], t=[2,1,7,4,3], with p(s)=0 + p(t)=1=1.

But in this algorithm, s=[8,2,1,1,7,3], t=[3,4], with p(s)=1 + p(t)=1=2.

But the algorithm outputs c=1, which seems to be less than the actual penalty.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated p(s).

Wait, in s=[8,2,1,1,7,3], p(s) counts the number of times an element is less than the next one.

So, 8<2? No

2<1? No

1<1? No

1<7? Yes, so one increasing pair

7<3? No

So, p(s)=1.

t=[3,4], p(t)=1 (3<4)

Total penalty=1+1=2, but the algorithm outputs c=1.

So, c is not exactly equal to the total penalty, but in this case, it's less than the actual penalty.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, it's printing c=1, but the actual penalty is 2.

But in the note, they have a split with penalty 1.

Wait, maybe c is not directly the penalty, but related to it.

Wait, perhaps c is the minimal penalty.

But in the first test case, c=3 and total penalty is 3.

In the second test case, c=1 and total penalty is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe c is the minimal penalty.

But in the third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

Initialize a=inf, b=inf.

l[0]=3: assign to s, a=3, c=0.

l[1]=3: assign to t, b=3, c=0.

l[2]=3: assign to s, a=3, c=0.

l[3]=3: assign to t, b=3, c=0.

l[4]=3: assign to s, a=3, c=0.

Total c=0, which matches the minimal penalty.

Fourth test case:

1

1

Initialize a=inf, b=inf.

l[0]=1: assign to s, a=1, c=0.

Total c=0.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Initialize a=inf, b=inf.

l[0]=2: assign to s, a=2, c=0.

l[1]=1: assign to s, a=1, c=0.

s=[2,1], t=[].

p(s)=0 (2>1) + p(t)=0=0.

Total penalty=0, which matches c=0.

So, in these cases, c equals the minimal penalty.

But in the second test case, c=1, but the total penalty seems to be 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated p(t).

In s=[8,2,1,1,7,3], p(s)=1 (1<7)

t=[3,4], p(t)=1 (3<4)

Total penalty=2.

But according to the note, there is a split with penalty 1.

So, maybe the algorithm is not always giving the minimal penalty.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm is correct, and in this case, c=1 is the minimal penalty, even though my calculation suggests total penalty=2.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps c counts the number of times we have to start a new increasing sequence in s, and p(t) is always less than or equal to c.

Wait, but in this case, p(t)=1 and c=1.

In the first test case, c=3 and p(t)=1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about what c represents.

Each time we assign an element to s and set a to that element, and increment c, it means that we are starting a new increasing sequence in s.

So, c counts the number of increasing runs in s.

In the first test case, s=[1,3,4,5], which has three increasing pairs, so p(s)=3, and c=3.

In the second test case, s=[8,2,1,1,7,3], p(s)=1, but c=1.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, c=1, but p(s)=1.

So, perhaps c equals p(s).

Then, the total penalty is p(s) + p(t), which in this case is 1+1=2, but the note shows a split with penalty 1.

So, maybe the algorithm doesn't always give the minimal total penalty.

Alternatively, perhaps c is equal to the minimal total penalty.

But in the first test case, c=3 and total penalty is 3.

In the second test case, c=1, but total penalty is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps c is a lower bound on the total penalty, and in some cases, it's equal to the minimal penalty.

But I'm getting too confused.

Let me think about the algorithm differently.

This algorithm seems to be a greedy algorithm that tries to minimize the number of increasing runs in s, and assigns elements to t when possible to avoid
