Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the total coins I get back are more than the total coins I bet.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For each test case, I have n (1 to 50), and for each outcome, k_i (2 to 20). There can be up to 10^4 test cases, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which seems manageable.

So, the goal is to find n integers x_1 to x_n, all at least 1 and up to 10^9, such that the sum S = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n is less than k_i * x_i for every i.

In other words, for each i, S < k_i * x_i.

I need to find such x_i's that satisfy this condition for all i.

Let me try to rearrange the inequality:

S < k_i * x_i

Which means x_i > S / k_i

But since S is the sum of all x's, including x_i, this seems a bit circular.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that for each i, x_i needs to be large enough so that k_i * x_i is greater than the sum of all other x's plus x_i.

Wait, sum of all x's is S, and k_i * x_i should be greater than S.

So, k_i * x_i > S

But S = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n

So, k_i * x_i > x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n

For each i, this inequality must hold.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a way to find x_i in terms of k_i.

Let me consider that x_i is proportional to some function of k_i.

Suppose I set x_i = c / k_i for some constant c.

But x_i needs to be integer, and c needs to be chosen such that S < k_i * x_i for all i.

Wait, x_i = c / k_i, then S = sum(c / k_i) over all i.

Then, k_i * x_i = k_i * (c / k_i) = c

So, S < c for all i.

But S is sum(c / k_i), and S < c.

So, sum(c / k_i) < c

Divide both sides by c: sum(1 / k_i) < 1

So, sum(1 / k_i) < 1 is a necessary condition for the existence of such x_i's.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible that sum(1 / k_i) >= 1, in which case, there's no solution, and I should output -1.

So, first, I need to check if sum(1 / k_i) < 1.

If not, output -1.

Otherwise, find x_i's such that S < min(k_i * x_i) over all i.

But how to find such x_i's?

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of k_i's.

Then, it initializes den as the first k_i, and iteratively computes the least common multiple (LCM) of den and each k_i.

Finally, it computes vprod as den divided by each k_i, and then sets den as den minus the sum of vprod.

If den <= 0, it outputs -1; otherwise, it outputs vprod.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand what's happening.

First, it computes the LCM of all k_i's, stored in den.

Then, vprod is den divided by each k_i, so vprod[i] = den / k_i.

Then, sum of vprod is sum(den / k_i for all i).

Then, den is updated to den - sum(vprod).

If den <= 0, output -1; else, output vprod.

Wait, this seems off.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 3

k = [3, 2, 7]

Compute den = LCM(3,2,7) = 42

vprod = [42/3, 42/2, 42/7] = [14, 21, 6]

sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41

den = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0

So, output [14, 21, 6]

Now, check if S = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 < 3*14 = 42, 2*21 = 42, 7*6 = 42.

Yes, 41 < 42 in all cases.

Another test case:

n = 2

k = [3, 3]

den = LCM(3,3) = 3

vprod = [3/3, 3/3] = [1,1]

sum(vprod) = 2

den = 3 - 2 = 1 > 0

Output [1,1]

Check S = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3*1 = 3 and 3*1 = 3.

Yes, 2 < 3.

Another test case:

n = 5

k = [5,5,5,5,5]

den = LCM(5,5,5,5,5) = 5

vprod = [5/5,5/5,5/5,5/5,5/5] = [1,1,1,1,1]

sum(vprod) = 5

den = 5 - 5 = 0 <= 0

Output -1

This seems correct.

Another test case:

n = 6

k = [7,9,3,17,9,13]

den = LCM(7,9,3,17,9,13)

LCM of these is 7*9*17*13 = 14385 (since 9 is 3^2, and 7,17,13 are primes)

vprod = [14385/7, 14385/9, 14385/3, 14385/17, 14385/9, 14385/13]

= [2055, 1598.333, 4795, 846.176, 1598.333, 1106.538]

Wait, but in the code, it's using integer division, so vprod = [14385 // 7, 14385 // 9, 14385 // 3, 14385 // 17, 14385 // 9, 14385 // 13]

= [2055, 1598, 4795, 846, 1598, 1106]

sum(vprod) = 2055 + 1598 + 4795 + 846 + 1598 + 1106 = let's calculate:

2055 + 1598 = 3653

3653 + 4795 = 8448

8448 + 846 = 9294

9294 + 1598 = 10892

10892 + 1106 = 12000 - 8 = 11992

Wait, but 1598 + 1106 = 2704

Plus 9294 is 12000 - 8 = 11992

Wait, but 1598 + 1106 is actually 2704, and 9294 + 2704 = 12000 - 8 = 11992, wait, no, 9294 + 2704 = 12000 - 8 = 11992, but actually, 9294 + 2704 = 12000 - 8 = 11992, but that's not correct.

Wait, 9294 + 2704 = 12000 - 8 = 11992, but 12000 - 8 is 11992, which matches.

Then den = 14385 - 11992 = 2393 > 0

So, output [2055,1598,4795,846,1598,1106]

Check S = 11992 < 7*2055 = 14385, 9*1598 = 14382, 3*4795=14385, 17*846=14382, 9*1598=14382, 13*1106=14378

So, 11992 < 14378, the smallest k_i * x_i is 14378, so it's correct.

Another test case:

n = 3

k = [6,3,2]

den = LCM(6,3,2) = 6

vprod = [6//6, 6//3, 6//2] = [1,2,3]

sum(vprod) = 1+2+3=6

den = 6 - 6 = 0 <=0

Output -1

Which matches the sample output.

Last test case:

n =5

k= [9,4,6,8,3]

den = LCM(9,4,6,8,3) = LCM(9,4,6,8) = LCM(36,6,8)=LCM(36,8)=72

vprod = [72//9, 72//4, 72//6, 72//8, 72//3] = [8,18,12,9,24]

sum(vprod) = 8+18+12+9+24=61

den =72 -61=11>0

Output [8,18,12,9,24]

Check S=61 <9*8=72, 4*18=72,6*12=72,8*9=72,3*24=72

Yes, 61<72 in all cases.

So, the approach seems to work.

Now, let's understand why this works.

The key is to find x_i such that for all i, S < k_i * x_i.

Let’s denote S = sum(x_i)

We need S < k_i * x_i for all i.

Let’s rearrange:

S < k_i * x_i => x_i > S / k_i

But S = sum(x_j for all j)

So, x_i > sum(x_j for all j) / k_i

This seems tricky.

The solution uses the LCM of all k_i's and sets x_i = LCM / k_i.

Then, it computes den = LCM - sum(x_i)

If den > 0, it outputs x_i; else, -1.

Why does this work?

Let’s see.

By setting x_i = LCM / k_i, we ensure that k_i * x_i = LCM.

Then, S = sum(LCM / k_i for all i)

We need S < LCM.

Because if S < LCM, then S < k_i * x_i for all i, since k_i * x_i = LCM.

So, the condition reduces to sum(LCM / k_i for all i) < LCM.

Divide both sides by LCM:

sum(1 / k_i) < 1

So, the condition sum(1 / k_i) < 1 is necessary and sufficient for the solution to exist.

In the code, it computes den = LCM - sum(LCM / k_i)

If den > 0, it means sum(LCM / k_i) < LCM, which is equivalent to sum(1 / k_i) < 1.

Hence, the approach is correct.

Moreover, the x_i's are set to LCM / k_i, which are integers since LCM is a multiple of each k_i.

Also, x_i >= 1, as k_i >=2 and LCM is at least k_i.

Hence, this satisfies all the constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
