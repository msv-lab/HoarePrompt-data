Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a "beautiful" array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] equals a[i + 1], and then replace a[i] with a[i - 1].

So, in other words, if the elements on both sides of an element are the same, I can change that element to match them. This operation can be repeated as many times as I want.

My goal is to make the array no longer beautiful by removing the least number of elements possible. If I can't make it not beautiful no matter how many elements I remove, I should return -1.

Let me think about what it means for an array to be beautiful. If I can make all elements the same using those operations, that means there's a way to propagate values through the array, equalizing everything.

Conversely, if I remove some elements, I want to disrupt this property so that it's impossible to make all remaining elements equal using those operations.

First, I need to consider the cases where it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. The problem mentions that in some cases, it's impossible, and I should return -1.

Looking at the example, there's a case where the array is all the same elements, and it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. That makes sense because no matter how many elements you remove from an array where all elements are identical, you can still make the remaining elements equal (since they already are).

Another case is when the array has only one element; it's already not beautiful because there are no indices i where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1, so no operations can be performed. But according to the problem, single-element arrays are considered beautiful, I think. Wait, let's check the problem statement.

"Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] = a[i + 1], and replace a[i] with a[i - 1]."

So, for arrays with less than 3 elements, there are no indices i where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1, so no operations can be performed. But the problem says "the given array a is beautiful," so I have to assume that even for arrays with less than 3 elements, they are considered beautiful for some reason. Maybe because they already have all elements equal, or some other reason.

Wait, in the example, for n=1, the output is -1, meaning it's impossible to make it not beautiful. So, single-element arrays are considered beautiful, and removing the only element would make the array empty, which might still be considered beautiful or perhaps not, but according to the problem, it's impossible to make it not beautiful.

I need to clarify what constitutes a non-beautiful array. An array is not beautiful if it's impossible to make all its elements equal by using the specified operations.

Given that, I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is not beautiful.

First, I need to understand the properties of beautiful arrays.

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1:

n=3

a=[2,2,2]

This is already beautiful because all elements are equal. Removing any element will still leave the array with all elements equal, or a single element, which is still considered beautiful. Hence, output is -1.

Example 2:

n=5

a=[1,2,1,2,1]

This is beautiful, but removing one element can make it not beautiful. For instance, removing the last element gives [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful because you can't make all elements equal by the given operations.

Example 3:

n=1

a=[1]

It's beautiful, and removing the only element makes it empty, which is considered impossible to make not beautiful, so output is -1.

Example 4:

n=7

a=[3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

This is beautiful, but removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

From these examples, it seems that if the array has all elements equal, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements because any subset will still have all elements equal.

Similarly, if the array has a run of identical elements, removing elements from that run might not disrupt the beauty.

I need to find a general approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

First, I need to characterize when an array is not beautiful.

An array is not beautiful if it's impossible to make all elements equal using the given operations.

Considering the operation: choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] = a[i + 1], and replace a[i] with a[i - 1].

This operation allows me to change a[i] to a[i - 1] if the neighbors are equal.

So, if I have a sequence where a[i - 1] = a[i + 1], I can set a[i] to a[i - 1], effectively making a[i] equal to its neighbors.

By repeating this operation, I can propagate values through the array, potentially equalizing everything.

However, if there are conflicting values that cannot be equalized through these operations, then the array is not beautiful.

Wait, but the problem states that the given array is beautiful, meaning it's always possible to make all elements equal using these operations.

Wait, no. It says "the given array a is beautiful," meaning it's already beautiful, and I need to make it not beautiful by removing elements.

So, I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is not beautiful.

Given that, and knowing that the array is initially beautiful, I need to disrupt its beauty by removing elements.

I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove so that the remaining array cannot be made entirely equal by using the operations.

First, I need to understand what makes an array not beautiful.

An array is not beautiful if it's impossible to make all elements equal using the operations.

Given the operation, it seems that as long as the array can be transformed into an array where all elements are equal, it's beautiful.

So, to make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removing some elements, the remaining array cannot be transformed into an array with all elements equal.

I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove to achieve this.

Let me think about the properties of the array that allow it to be beautiful.

Given the operation, it seems that if there are runs of identical elements, I can propagate those values to equalize the array.

However, if there are conflicting values that cannot be equalized through these operations, then the array is not beautiful.

Wait, but the problem says that the given array is beautiful, so all arrays given are beautiful, and I need to make them not beautiful by removing elements.

So, I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is not beautiful.

Given that, I need to find a way to disrupt the array's property that allows it to be beautiful.

Let me consider that an array is beautiful if all elements can be made equal by propagating values through the operations.

To make it not beautiful, I need to have at least two different values that cannot be made equal through the operations.

In other words, I need to have at least two different values in the array such that there's no way to propagate one value to the other.

This seems a bit vague. Let's think differently.

Perhaps, I can consider that in a beautiful array, all elements are connected through a chain of equal neighbors, allowing the propagation of values.

If I remove elements in such a way that the array is split into parts where each part can be equalized, but the parts themselves have different values, then the whole array cannot be equalized.

Wait, but if I remove elements, I'm reducing the array, and I need to ensure that the remaining array cannot be made beautiful.

I need to find a minimal set of elements to remove so that the remaining array cannot be made beautiful.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, it's possible to make all elements equal by propagating values through the operations.

So, if I can find a value that can be propagated to all elements through a series of operations, the array is beautiful.

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that no single value can be propagated to all remaining elements.

One way to think about this is to consider connected components where elements are connected if they are equal and adjacent.

In a beautiful array, all such connected components can be connected through operations to make the whole array equal.

So, to make it not beautiful, I need to break these connections in such a way that there are at least two disconnected components with different values that cannot be equalized.

In other words, I need to remove elements so that the remaining array has at least two separate runs of identical values that are different.

Wait, but I need to minimize the number of removals, so I need the smallest number of removals that achieve this.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I try to remove elements to prevent the array from being made entirely equal.

If the array is already all equal, like in the first example, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, so output is -1.

In the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], removing one element can make it not beautiful.

For instance, removing the last element gives [1,2,1,2], which cannot be made entirely equal because there are 1s and 2s that cannot be equalized through the operations.

Similarly, in the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which cannot be made entirely equal because the 5 cannot be equalized with the 3s through the operations.

So, in these cases, removing a certain number of elements disrupts the ability to equalize the array.

I need to generalize this.

Perhaps, the minimal number of removals needed is equal to the minimal number of elements in the largest run of identical elements.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, in the second example, the largest run of identical elements is 1 (since no three consecutive elements are the same), but removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth example, there are runs of three 3s, and removing three elements disrupts this.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of removals needed to break all possible equalizations.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal number of removals needed to ensure that no single value can be propagated to the entire array.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number of removals needed to ensure that there are at least two different values that cannot be equalized.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I can consider that in a beautiful array, it's possible to make all elements equal by propagating values through the operations.

So, if I can find a value that can reach all positions through the operations, the array is beautiful.

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that no single value can reach all positions.

In other words, I need to remove elements so that the remaining array has at least two disconnected components in terms of value propagation.

This seems similar to graph connectivity, where elements are nodes, and edges exist between equal adjacent elements.

In this graph, if the graph is connected, the array is beautiful, because values can propagate through the connections.

To make it not beautiful, I need to disconnect the graph by removing nodes (elements), so that there are at least two disconnected components with different values.

In graph theory, the minimal number of nodes to remove to disconnect a graph is the vertex connectivity.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful is equal to the vertex connectivity of this graph.

But calculating vertex connectivity is too slow for the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a value, say x, and consider all positions where a[i] = x.

If I can make the entire array equal to x, then the array is beautiful.

Similarly, for any other value y, if I can make the entire array equal to y, it's still beautiful.

So, in order to make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that there is no single value that can be propagated to the entire array.

In other words, for every value x in the remaining array, there should be at least one element in the array that cannot be equal to x through the operations.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in order for the array to be beautiful, it must be possible to make all elements equal to some value x.

To prevent this, I need to ensure that for any x, not all elements can be made equal to x.

In other words, there should be at least two different values in the array such that they cannot be equalized through the operations.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider that if the array has only one unique value, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, as any subset will still have all elements equal.

Similarly, if the array has two unique values, and they are alternating in such a way that they cannot be equalized, then removing zero elements is sufficient, but the problem states that the array is beautiful, so perhaps this is not possible.

Wait, but in the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], it's beautiful, meaning that it's possible to make all elements equal through operations.

But how?

Wait, in this array, if I choose i=2, since a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, I can set a[2]=1, making the array [1,1,1,2,1].

Then, I can choose i=3 again, since a[2]=1 and a[4]=2, but a[2] != a[4], so no operation can be performed.

Wait, but in this case, after one operation, the array becomes [1,1,1,2,1], and no further operations can be performed because a[3]=1 and a[4]=2 are different.

But according to the problem, the array is beautiful, meaning that it's possible to make all elements equal.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the operation.

Let me read the operation again: choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] = a[i + 1], and replace a[i] with a[i - 1].

In the array [1,2,1,2,1], I can choose i=2 because a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, so set a[2]=1, making [1,1,1,2,1].

Then, choose i=4 because a[3]=1 and a[5]=1, set a[4]=1, making [1,1,1,1,1].

So, it's possible to make all elements equal to 1.

Alternatively, is it possible to make all elements equal to 2?

Let's see: starting from [1,2,1,2,1], choose i=3 because a[2]=2 and a[4]=2, set a[3]=2, making [1,2,2,2,1].

Then, choose i=2 because a[1]=1 and a[3]=2, but a[1] != a[3], so no operation.

Similarly, choose i=4 because a[3]=2 and a[5]=1, but a[3] != a[5], so no operation.

So, the array [1,2,2,2,1] cannot be made entirely equal to 2 because there are 1s that cannot be changed.

But since in the first step, I could make all elements equal to 1, the array is considered beautiful.

So, in this case, to make it not beautiful, I need to remove some elements so that it's impossible to make all remaining elements equal.

In the example, removing the last element gives [1,2,1,2], which cannot be made entirely equal.

Let's see why.

Starting with [1,2,1,2], I can choose i=2 because a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, set a[2]=1, making [1,1,1,2].

Then, choose i=3 because a[2]=1 and a[4]=2, but a[2] != a[4], so no operation.

Now, the array is [1,1,1,2], which cannot be made entirely equal because there's a 2 that cannot be changed.

Alternatively, starting with [1,2,1,2], choose i=3 because a[2]=2 and a[4]=2, set a[3]=2, making [1,2,2,2].

Then, choose i=2 because a[1]=1 and a[3]=2, but a[1] != a[3], so no operation.

Now, the array is [1,2,2,2], which cannot be made entirely equal because there's a 1 that cannot be changed.

Hence, the array [1,2,1,2] is not beautiful.

Therefore, by removing one element from the original array, I can make it not beautiful.

So, in this case, the minimal number of removals is 1.

In the first example, where all elements are equal, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, so output is -1.

In the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which cannot be made entirely equal because the 5 cannot be changed to 3 through operations.

Hence, the minimal number of removals is 3.

Wait, but is there a way to make it not beautiful by removing fewer elements?

Let's see.

If I remove only two elements, for example, the first two elements, giving [3,5,3,3,3].

Is this beautiful?

Can I make all elements equal?

Starting with [3,5,3,3,3], I can choose i=2 because a[1]=3 and a[3]=3, set a[2]=3, making [3,3,3,3,3]. So, it's still beautiful.

Alternatively, remove the first and the last elements, giving [3,3,5,3,3].

Is this beautiful?

Starting with [3,3,5,3,3], choose i=3 because a[2]=3 and a[4]=3, set a[3]=3, making [3,3,3,3,3]. Still beautiful.

Another removal: remove the first and the second elements, giving [3,5,3,3,3].

As before, choose i=2 to set a[2]=3, making [3,3,3,3,3]. Still beautiful.

So, removing two elements doesn't make it not beautiful.

Only by removing three elements can I make it not beautiful, as in the example.

Hence, the minimal number of removals is 3.

So, in general, I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove so that the remaining array cannot be made entirely equal through the operations.

I need to find a way to calculate this minimal number efficiently.

Given the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 3*10^5 with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 3*10^5, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Let me think about what characterizes a not beautiful array.

A not beautiful array is one where it's impossible to make all elements equal through the operations.

Given the operation, which allows changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], I need to ensure that after removals, there are at least two different values that cannot be equalized through these operations.

In other words, there are at least two disconnected components in terms of value propagation.

Considering the array as a graph where nodes are elements, and edges exist between equal adjacent elements, making the array not beautiful would require disconnecting this graph into at least two components with different values.

In graph theory, the minimal number of nodes to remove to disconnect a graph is the vertex connectivity.

However, calculating vertex connectivity is too slow for these constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, all elements are connected through equal values, allowing propagation.

To make it not beautiful, I need to break this connectivity.

So, perhaps the minimal number of removals needed is equal to the minimal number of elements that, when removed, disconnect the graph.

In other words, the vertex connectivity of the graph.

But again, calculating vertex connectivity is too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps in this specific case, there's a simpler way to compute it.

Let me consider runs of identical elements.

If I have a run of identical elements, they are all connected.

To disconnect the array, I need to remove elements that separate these runs.

So, perhaps the minimal number of removals is equal to the length of the smallest run.

Wait, in the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], the smallest run is of length 1 for each value, but removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], the smallest run is of length 1 (the single 5), and removing three elements (the three 3s surrounding the 5) makes it not beautiful.

This doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the frequency of the most frequent value.

If I remove all occurrences of the most frequent value, the remaining array cannot be made beautiful.

But in the first example, all elements are 2, so removing any elements doesn't help.

In the second example, both 1 and 2 appear twice, and removing one element can make it not beautiful.

In the fourth example, 3 appears six times, and 5 appears once; removing three elements (all 3s surrounding the 5) makes it not beautiful.

This seems related to the minimal number of removals needed to reduce the frequency of the most frequent value.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of removals needed to make no single value appear in all connected components.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I can iterate through the array and find the minimal number of removals needed to break the ability to equalize the array.

I need to find
