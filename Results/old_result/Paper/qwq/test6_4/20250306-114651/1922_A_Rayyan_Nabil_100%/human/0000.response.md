Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem describes two conditions:

1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to find a template t such that:

- a matches t according to the rules.

- b matches t according to the rules.

- c does not match t according to the rules.

I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make the template's letter at that position lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider position i:

- If I make t[i] lowercase, then a[i], b[i], and c[i] must all be equal to t[i] for a and b to match, and c[i] must be equal to t[i] for c to match. But I want c to not match, so if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then making t[i] lowercase would make c match, which is not what I want. So in this case, I cannot make t[i] lowercase.

- If a[i] == b[i] but c[i] is different, then making t[i] lowercase would make a and b match, and c not match, which is good.

- If a[i] != b[i], then it's impossible to make both a and b match the template at this position if t[i] is lowercase, because t[i] can only be one value.

Wait, let's think again.

If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] must equal t[i], and b[i] must equal t[i], and c[i] must equal t[i] to match. But I want c to not match, so if a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then making t[i] lowercase would make a and b match, and c not match, which is good.

If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then making t[i] lowercase would make a and b match, but c also matches, which is bad. So in this case, I cannot make t[i] lowercase.

If a[i] != b[i], then it's impossible to make both a and b match the template at this position if t[i] is lowercase, because t[i] can only be one value that a[i] and b[i] must both equal, which is impossible if they are different.

So, in summary:

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], then t[i] can be lowercase.

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], then t[i] cannot be lowercase.

- If a[i] != b[i], then t[i] cannot be lowercase.

Now, what if I make t[i] uppercase?

If t[i] is uppercase, then:

- a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- c[i] must be the same as the lowercase version of t[i] to not match.

Wait, no. For c to not match, at least one position must not satisfy the condition. So, for t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- b[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- c[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]) to match, or same to not match.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i."

So, for c to not match, it must be that c[i] is the same as the lowercase version of t[i] at some position.

So, for t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i)) to not match.

Wait, actually, for c to not match, it must violate the condition for at least one position. So, if t[i] is uppercase, c must have c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) to not match.

So, to make c not match, for some i, t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Or t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i].

But I need to find if there exists any t such that a and b match, and c does not match.

I need to ensure that for all positions where t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i] for at least one i.

Or for positions where t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) for at least one i.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that t can be a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

I need to choose for each position i whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, based on a, b, and c.

Let's think about each position independently.

For each position i, I have to decide:

- Make t[i] lowercase: then a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i].

- Make t[i] uppercase: then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, no. For t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]) to match, or same to not match.

So, for c to not match, there must be at least one position where:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

At the same time, for a and b to match, for all positions:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

This seems tricky. Maybe I can look for positions where a and b are equal and c is different, and make t[i] lowercase for those positions.

For positions where a and b are equal and c is equal, I cannot make t[i] lowercase, because then c would match.

For positions where a and b are different, I cannot make t[i] lowercase, because a and b cannot both equal t[i].

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], I can make t[i] lowercase.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], I cannot make t[i] lowercase.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], I cannot make t[i] lowercase.

Now, for positions where t[i] is uppercase, I need to ensure that a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) for at least one position.

Wait, no. For c to not match, it's sufficient that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition, whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase.

But for a and b to match, all positions must satisfy their conditions.

So, perhaps I can try to construct t step by step.

Let me consider each position:

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], then set t[i] to lowercase a[i]. This way, a and b match, and c does not match at this position.

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], then I cannot set t[i] to lowercase, because c would match. So, I need to set t[i] to uppercase. But then, I need to ensure that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]). But c[i] == a[i], and t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) can be anything except a[i]. Wait, this is confusing.

Let me think differently.

I need to find if there exists at least one position where:

- Either t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

At the same time, for all positions:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

This seems too vague. Maybe I should look for positions where a and b are equal and c is different, and make t[i] lowercase for those positions. For other positions, make t[i] uppercase.

Wait, but in the positions where a and b are equal and c is equal, I cannot make t[i] lowercase, because c would match.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], set t[i] to lowercase a[i]. This ensures that a and b match, and c does not match at this position.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], set t[i] to uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i]. But then, for c to not match, I need c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which contradicts because c[i] == a[i], and lowercase(t[i]) != a[i]. So, c would not match at this position.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase and lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], then c[i] == a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches the template at this position, which is not what I want.

I need c to not match at least one position.

So, in this case, if I set t[i] to uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], then c[i] == a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position. So, perhaps I should set t[j] to lowercase where a[j] == b[j] and a[j] != c[j], ensuring c does not match at that position.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], I set t[i] to uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], so c matches at this position.

But I already have one position where c does not match (from t[j] lowercase), so overall, c does not match the template.

Wait, no. For c to not match, it's sufficient that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition.

So, if I have at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], that's enough for c to not match the template.

Positions where t[i] is uppercase: c must have c[i] != lowercase(t[i]) to match, or c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) to not match.

But in the positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], I set t[i] to uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], so c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

In the positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], set t[i] to lowercase a[i], so c[i] != t[i], meaning c does not match at this position.

So, in this case, c does not match at least one position, which is sufficient.

Therefore, such a template exists if for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], set t[i] to lowercase a[i].

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], set t[i] to uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then it's impossible to have a and b match the same template.

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], I cannot set t[i] to lowercase, because then a[i] and b[i] cannot both equal t[i].

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must set t[i] to uppercase, and choose lowercase(t[i]) such that a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

Also, for c to not match, I need at least one position where:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

In the previous strategy, I have at least one position (where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]) where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], which satisfies the condition for c to not match.

But, I need to ensure that for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can set t[i] to uppercase and choose lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], if possible.

Given that a[i] and b[i] are both lowercase letters, and t[i] can be any uppercase or lowercase letter, I can choose t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) is different from both a[i] and b[i], since there are 26 letters.

Wait, but a[i], b[i], and c[i] are all lowercase letters.

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I need to set t[i] to uppercase, and choose t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i].

Since there are 26 letters, and a[i] and b[i] are different, I can always choose t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) is different from both a[i] and b[i].

Then, for c to match at this position, c[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]), which is possible.

But in the positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], I set t[i] to lowercase a[i], so c[i] != t[i], which ensures c does not match at that position.

Therefore, such a template exists if for all positions where a[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and for positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], set t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and for positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], set t[i] lowercase to a[i].

This way, a and b match the template, and c does not match at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or positions where a[i] != b[i] and I can ensure c does not match.

Wait, no. Even if a[i] != b[i], I can still make t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and ensure that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position, which is already ensured by positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], as explained earlier.

Therefore, such a template exists if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or positions where a[i] != b[i].

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], I can still make t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and ensure that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position, which is already ensured by positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

So, as long as there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or positions where a[i] != b[i], I can construct such a template.

Wait, but if a[i] != b[i], I have to set t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position, which is already ensured by positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

So, overall, such a template exists if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or positions where a[i] != b[i].

But actually, positions where a[i] != b[i] allow me to set t[i] uppercase and choose lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], ensuring that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position, which is ensured by positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Therefore, the template exists if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or positions where a[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] != b[i], I can still make t[i] uppercase and choose lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], ensuring that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

But I need c to not match at least one position, which is ensured by positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Therefore, the template exists if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

If there is no such position, then I cannot make c not match the template.

Hence, the condition is that there exists at least one position i where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] != b[i], I have to set t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches at this position.

So, as long as there is at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] lowercase at that position, making c not match there, and set t[j] uppercase for positions where a[j] != b[j], ensuring a and b match there.

Therefore, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one position i where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Otherwise, it's "NO".

Wait, but in the example:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

In the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c". Here, a[0] != b[0], so I need to set t[0] uppercase with lowercase(t[0]) != 'a' and != 'b'. Then, c[0] = 'c', which is different from lowercase(t[0]) (assuming lowercase(t[0]) is not 'c'), so c matches at this position. But I need c to not match at least one position. However, since a[0] != b[0], I cannot make c not match because c matches at this position. But according to the explanation, in the first test case, you can use the template "C", making a and b match, and c does not match. Wait, let's see.

If t = "C", which is uppercase, then:

- For a: a[0] = 'a', which must be different from lowercase(t[0]) = 'c'. 'a' != 'c', so a matches.

- For b: b[0] = 'b', which must be different from 'c'. 'b' != 'c', so b matches.

- For c: c[0] = 'c', which must be different from 'c'. 'c' != 'c' is false, so c does not match.

Hence, it's "YES".

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa".

For position 1: a[0]='a', b[0]='b', c[0]='a'. a[0] != b[0].

For position 2: a[1]='a', b[1]='b', c[1]='a'. a[1] != b[1].

So, for both positions, a[i] != b[i]. So, I have to set t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != 'a' and != 'b' for both positions.

Then, for c, c[i] = 'a', which is != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches at both positions. Hence, c matches the template, which is not what I want. So, "NO".

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder".

I need to find if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u k k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Comparing a and b:

Positions where a[i] == b[i]: positions 5 to 10 (f o r c e s).

Checking if a[i] != c[i] at these positions:

Position 5: f != c

Position 6: o != o

Position 7: r != c

Position 8: c == c

Position 9: e != d

Position 10: s != r

So, positions 5,7,9,10 have a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Hence, "YES".

In the fourth test case, n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc".

Comparing a and b:

Position 1: a == a, and a != c[0]=a → no, a[0]==c[0]

Position 2: c != b, so cannot make t[1] lowercase.

Position 3: c == d, so cannot make t[2] lowercase.

So, no position where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]. Hence, "NO".

Therefore, the condition is: there exists at least one position i where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

So, in code, for each test case, iterate through the positions and check if there exists any i where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]. If yes, then "YES", else "NO".

Looking at the given program:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1(n, a, b, c):

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

return 'YES'

return 'NO'

def func_2():

t = int(input().strip())

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input().strip())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))

for result in results:

print(result)

Wait, in func_1, it checks if there exists any position i where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. If yes, then "YES", else "NO".

But according to my reasoning, it should check if there exists any position i where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

So, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me double-check.

I thought it should be "a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]".

But in the first test case:

n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c"

a[0] != b[0], but according to the program, a[0] != c[0] (a != c) and b[0] != c[0] (b != c), which is a != c and b != c.

In this case, a != c and b != c, so it returns "YES", which matches the expected output.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should check a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

Wait, perhaps there is another way to look at it.

Let me consider that for a and b to match the template, and c to not match, it's equivalent to finding a position where a and b are both different from c at that position when t[i] is uppercase.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. Then, I can set t[i] to uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) = some letter
