Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of applications: those with 1x1 icons and those with 2x2 icons. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a square of four cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, obviously.

The task is to figure out the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons for the given number of each type of application.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. We have t test cases, each consisting of two integers x and y, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively. For each test case, I need to output the minimum number of screens required.

Looking at the example, there are 11 test cases with their expected outputs. I need to make sure that my solution matches these outputs.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making 15 cells per screen. A 1x1 icon uses one cell, and a 2x2 icon uses four cells. However, since the screen is divided into cells, I need to ensure that the 2x2 icons are placed in such a way that their four cells are contiguous and form a square.

But the problem seems to imply that the icons can be placed optimally, so I don't need to worry about the specific arrangement, just the total cell usage.

Wait, but it's not just about the total cell usage because of the way 2x2 icons occupy cells. For example, one screen has 15 cells, but if I place a 2x2 icon, it occupies four cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons. But perhaps there's a better way to pack them.

Let me try to calculate the minimum number of screens required.

First, consider the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes up four cells. So, y 2x2 icons will take up 4y cells.

Then, the 1x1 icons take up x cells.

So, total cell requirement is 4y + x cells.

Each screen has 15 cells, so naively, the number of screens required would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But this might not be correct because of the way 2x2 icons must be placed.

Wait, in the grid, not any four cells can form a 2x2 icon; they have to be in a 2x2 block.

So, I need to consider the placement constraints.

Let me see how many 2x2 blocks can fit into a 5x3 grid.

A 5x3 grid can fit how many 2x2 blocks?

In a 5x3 grid, the number of possible 2x2 blocks is (5-1)x(3-1) = 4x2 = 8 blocks.

Wait, no. Actually, in a 5-row, 3-column grid, the number of 2x2 squares is (5-2+1)x(3-2+1) = 4x2 = 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons.

So, each screen can hold up to 8 2x2 icons.

But each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so 8 icons would take 32 cells, but a screen only has 15 cells. That can't be right.

Wait, no. Each 2x2 icon occupies four cells, but placing one 2x2 icon blocks those four cells for other icons.

So, in terms of cell usage, each 2x2 icon uses four cells, but placing them optimally can allow more 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should think differently.

Perhaps I should calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons first, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Let's see.

Each screen can hold up to 8 2x2 icons, but that would require 32 cells, which is more than the 15 cells available. So that can't be right.

Wait, no. A 2x2 icon takes four cells, so in a 15-cell screen, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can be placed is floor(15/4) = 3 icons per screen.

Wait, but in terms of grid positions, in a 5x3 grid, you can't just place three 2x2 icons arbitrarily; their positions overlap.

Looking back, in a 5x3 grid, the number of possible non-overlapping 2x2 blocks is limited.

Let me try to visualize this.

Let's draw a 5x3 grid:

Rows: 1,2,3,4,5

Columns: A,B,C

So cells are A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, etc., up to C5.

A 2x2 icon can be placed starting at A1, A2, A3, A4; B1, B2, B3, B4; C1, C2, C3, C4.

Wait, no. A 2x2 icon starting at A1 would cover A1, B1, A2, B2.

Similarly, starting at A2: A2, B2, A3, B3.

A3: A3, B3, A4, B4.

A4: A4, B4, A5, B5.

Similarly, starting at B1: B1, C1, B2, C2.

B2: B2, C2, B3, C3.

B3: B3, C3, B4, C4.

B4: B4, C4, B5, C5.

So, the possible positions for 2x2 icons are:

- A1

- A2

- A3

- A4

- B1

- B2

- B3

- B4

That's 8 possible positions, as I calculated earlier.

But each position occupies four cells, and some positions overlap.

For example, positions A1 and A2 overlap in A2 and B2.

Similarly, positions A1 and B1 overlap in B1 and C1.

So, I need to maximize the number of non-overlapping 2x2 icons.

But this seems tricky.

Maybe I should consider that each screen can hold a certain number of 2x2 icons without overlapping, and the rest can be filled with 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to model this.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case, x=1, y=1.

The output is 1, meaning one screen is sufficient to place one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon.

Looking at the diagram, it shows a screen with one red 2x2 icon and one green 1x1 icon, with the rest being blue (empty).

So, in this arrangement, one screen can handle both.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4.

The output is 2, meaning two screens are needed to place 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, x=0, y=3, the output is 2.

So, three 2x2 icons require two screens.

Wait, each screen can hold up to how many 2x2 icons?

From earlier, in one screen, you can place up to two 2x2 icons without overlapping.

For example, placing one at A1 and one at B3.

A1: A1, B1, A2, B2

B3: B3, C3, B4, C4

These don't overlap, so two 2x2 icons per screen.

Similarly, another possible non-overlapping pair could be A2 and B4.

A2: A2, B2, A3, B3

B4: B4, C4, B5, C5

Again, no overlap.

So, perhaps each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Let me verify this.

If I place three 2x2 icons in one screen, there will be overlapping cells.

For example, A1, A3, and B2.

A1: A1, B1, A2, B2

A3: A3, B3, A4, B4

B2: B2, C2, B3, C3

Here, B2 is overlapping between A1 and B2, and B3 is overlapping between A3 and B2.

So, this doesn't work.

Hence, maximum of two 2x2 icons per screen without overlapping.

Therefore, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y/2).

But wait, in the fourth test case, x=0, y=3, which should be ceil(3/2)=2 screens, which matches the sample output of 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, y=1, which would require ceil(1/2)=1 screen, which matches the output of 1.

In the third test case, y=4, ceil(4/2)=2 screens, which matches the output of 2.

In the tenth test case, y=2, ceil(2/2)=1 screen, but the output is 2, which contradicts this.

Wait, in the tenth test case, x=8, y=2, output is 2.

According to my earlier logic, y=2, ceil(2/2)=1 screen, but the output is 2.

So, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Perhaps I need to consider both x and y together.

Let me think differently.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon uses 1 cell.

So, total cells used are 4y + x.

The minimum number of screens needed would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But in the tenth test case, x=8, y=2, so 4*2 + 8 = 16 cells, which would require ceil(16/15)=2 screens, matching the sample output of 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, 4*1 + 1 = 5 cells, ceil(5/15)=1 screen.

In the third test case, 4*4 + 12 = 28 cells, ceil(28/15)=2 screens.

In the fourth test case, 4*3 + 0 = 12 cells, ceil(12/15)=1 screen, but the sample output is 2, which contradicts this.

Wait, in the fourth test case, x=0, y=3, output is 2.

According to my calculation, ceil(12/15)=1 screen, but sample output is 2.

That suggests my approach is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to consider that not any arrangement of 2x2 icons will fit optimally into the screen.

Maybe there is a limit to how many 2x2 icons can be placed in a screen due to their size and position.

Let me consider the screen grid again.

A 5x3 grid:

Rows: 1,2,3,4,5

Columns: A,B,C

A 2x2 icon occupies four cells in a square.

Let me see how many non-overlapping 2x2 icons can be placed in one screen.

From earlier, placing one at A1 and one at B3 seems possible without overlapping.

Similarly, placing one at A2 and one at B4.

But placing three 2x2 icons will inevitably lead to overlapping cells.

Hence, maximum of two 2x2 icons per screen.

Therefore, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y/2).

Then, for the remaining screens, we can place 1x1 icons.

Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, but if there are 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the number of screens based on both x and y.

Let me try to think of an algorithm.

First, calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y/2).

Then, calculate the remaining cells available in these screens after placing the 2x2 icons.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so for screens_y screens, the total cells used by 2x2 icons are min(y, screens_y*2)*4.

Then, the remaining cells in these screens_y screens are screens_y*15 - min(y, screens_y*2)*4.

Then, the remaining x icons can be placed in these remaining cells.

If x is greater than the remaining cells, then additional screens are needed: screens_x = ceil((x - remaining_cells)/15).

Then, the total screens needed would be screens_y + screens_x.

Let me try this with the fourth test case: x=0, y=3.

screens_y = ceil(3/2) = 2.

Remaining cells in two screens: 2*15 - 2*4 = 30 - 8 = 22 cells.

Since x=0, no need for additional screens. So total screens = 2, matching the sample output.

In the first test case: x=1, y=1.

screens_y = ceil(1/2) = 1.

Remaining cells: 1*15 - 1*4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

x=1, which is less than 11, so no additional screens needed. Total screens = 1.

In the third test case: x=12, y=4.

screens_y = ceil(4/2) = 2.

Remaining cells: 2*15 - 2*4 = 30 - 8 = 22.

x=12, which is less than 22, so no additional screens needed. Total screens = 2.

In the tenth test case: x=8, y=2.

screens_y = ceil(2/2) = 1.

Remaining cells: 1*15 - 1*4*2 = 15 - 8 = 7.

x=8, which is greater than 7, so screens_x = ceil((8-7)/15) = ceil(1/15)=1.

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2, matching the sample output.

Seems consistent.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b * 2

if t % 5 == 0:

t = t // 5

else:

t = t // 5 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

First, it reads the number of test cases n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it calculates t = b * 2.

So, t = 2 * y.

Then, it calculates t // 5, with some adjustment based on modulo.

If t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5; else, t = t // 5 + 1.

This seems like it's calculating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, but not exactly matching my earlier logic.

Wait, in my logic, screens_y = ceil(y / 2), which is equivalent to ceil(y / 2).

But t = b * 2 = 2 * y.

Then t // 5, with adjustment for modulo.

Wait, 5 comes from the number of rows, which is 5.

Wait, perhaps they are thinking differently.

Let me see.

t = b * 2 = 2 * y.

Then, if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5; else, t = t // 5 + 1.

So, this is calculating ceil(2 * y / 5).

But why 2 * y / 5?

Wait, in my earlier logic, screens_y = ceil(y / 2), which is equivalent to ceil(y / 2).

But ceil(y / 2) is equal to ceil(2y / 4), but that doesn't seem directly related.

Maybe there's a different way to look at it.

Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the number of 2x2 icons that can be placed in a screen.

Wait, in a 5x3 grid, you can place up to two 2x2 icons per screen without overlapping, as we saw earlier.

So, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But in the code, it's calculating ceil(2y / 5).

Is ceil(y / 2) equal to ceil(2y / 5)?

Wait, for y=1, ceil(1 / 2)=1, ceil(2 / 5)=1, matches.

For y=2, ceil(2 / 2)=1, ceil(4 / 5)=1, matches.

For y=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, ceil(6 / 5)=2, matches.

For y=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, ceil(8 / 5)=2, matches.

For y=5, ceil(5 / 2)=3, ceil(10 / 5)=2, does not match.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

According to my earlier logic, ceil(5 / 2)=3 screens, but ceil(10 / 5)=2 screens, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps their approach is different.

Let me see what their approach is.

They calculate t = b * 2 = 2y.

Then, t // 5, with adjustment for modulo to get ceil(2y / 5).

Then, t1 = t * 15 / 5 = t * 3, but wait, no.

Wait, t1 = t * 15 - b * 4.

Wait, t is ceil(2y / 5), and t1 is t * 15 - y * 4.

Wait, perhaps they are calculating the total cells available in t screens, minus the cells used by y 2x2 icons.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so y 2x2 icons use 4y cells.

Then, in t screens, there are 15t cells available.

So, remaining cells are 15t - 4y.

If remaining cells >= x, then t screens are sufficient.

Else, need additional screens for the remaining x icons.

So, t2 = x - (15t - 4y), and then calculate additional screens needed as ceil(t2 / 15), and add to t.

This seems similar to my earlier logic.

In my logic, screens_y = ceil(y / 2), which is equivalent to t = ceil(y / 2).

Then, remaining cells = 15 * t - 4 * y.

If remaining cells >= x, then total screens = t.

Else, additional screens = ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15).

Total screens = t + additional screens.

But in their code, t is ceil(2y / 5), which may or may not be equal to ceil(y / 2).

As we saw earlier, for y=5, ceil(5 / 2)=3, but ceil(10 / 5)=2, which is less than 3.

So, their calculation of t is not matching my calculation of screens_y.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Let me consider that in a 5x3 grid, you can place up to two 2x2 icons without overlapping, as we saw earlier.

So, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y / 2).

But in their code, t = ceil(2y / 5).

Is ceil(y / 2) equal to ceil(2y / 5)?

From earlier, for y=1, both are 1.

For y=2, both are 1.

For y=3, both are 2.

For y=4, both are 2.

For y=5, ceil(y / 2)=3, ceil(2y / 5)=2.

So, for y=5, their calculation gives t=2, but according to my logic, it should be 3.

But according to the earlier reasoning, in a 5x3 grid, you can place up to two 2x2 icons per screen.

So, for y=5 icons, you would need ceil(5 / 2)=3 screens.

But their t = ceil(2*5 / 5)=2, which is less than 3.

This suggests a discrepancy.

Looking back at the sample input, when y=3, output is 2, which matches ceil(3 / 2)=2.

But according to their calculation, t=ceil(6 / 5)=2, which matches.

Similarly, for y=5, which is in the sample input, output is 5.

Wait, in the sample input, y=9 for the last test case.

Wait, the last test case is 0 9, output is 5.

Let me check for y=9.

According to my logic, ceil(9 / 2)=5 screens.

According to their calculation, t=ceil(18 / 5)=4, which is less than 5.

But the sample output is 5 screens.

So, their calculation seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me see.

In their code, t = ceil(2y / 5).

Then, t1 = t * 15 - y * 4.

If t1 >= x, then t screens are sufficient.

Else, additional screens needed are ceil((x - t1) / 15), and total screens = t + additional screens.

In the case y=9, t=ceil(18 / 5)=4.

Then, t1 = 4*15 - 9*4 = 60 - 36 = 24.

If x=0, then t1=24 >= 0, so total screens = 4.

But the sample output for x=0, y=9 is 5 screens.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

This suggests that their calculation is underestimating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
