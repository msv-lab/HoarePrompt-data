Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, I need to buy k tickets for my employees over n days, where each day the price per ticket is given by a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying exactly k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Suppose n=3, m=2, k=3, and a=[1, 2, 3].

If I buy 1 ticket on day 1, it costs 1. Then, from day 2 onwards, the price increases by 1, so a2 becomes 3, a3 becomes 4.

Then, on day 2, I can buy up to 2 tickets at price 3 each, but maybe it's better to buy fewer.

Wait, maybe there's a better strategy.

Alternatively, if I buy 2 tickets on day 1, it costs 2*1=2, and then from day 2 onwards, the price increases by 2, so a2 becomes 4, a3 becomes 5.

Then, on day 2, I need to buy 1 more ticket at price 4, totaling 2 + 4 = 6.

Comparing to the first strategy: buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), then maybe buy 2 on day 2 at price 3 each, totaling 1 + 6 = 7, which is worse than 6.

So, buying more on earlier days might be better, but I need to consider the increase in future prices.

Wait, in the first strategy, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 costs 2 + 4 = 6.

In the second strategy, buying 1 on day 1 and 2 on day 2 costs 1 + 6 = 7.

So, buying more on earlier days seems better in this case.

But is this always the case? Let's try another example.

Suppose n=2, m=1, k=2, a=[1, 100].

If I buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), then day 2 price is 101, buy 1 on day 2 (cost 101), total 102.

If I buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), and 1 on day 2 (cost 100), total 101.

Wait, m=1, so I can't buy more than 1 per day.

Wait, in this case, both strategies are the same since m=1.

Let me try n=2, m=2, k=2, a=[1, 100].

If I buy 2 on day 1, cost 2*1=2, then day 2 price becomes 102, but I don't need to buy more.

Total cost: 2.

Alternatively, buy 1 on day 1 (cost 1), then day 2 price is 101, buy 1 on day 2 (cost 101), total 102.

So, buying as many as possible on the earliest days seems better when possible.

But, if m is small or k is large, it might not be possible.

I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Let's consider that each ticket bought on a certain day will have its price increased by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x1 on day 1, then x2 on day 2, and so on, up to xn on day n, with the constraints that sum(xi) = k and xi <= m for all i.

The total cost would be:

sum over i from 1 to n of xi * (ai + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of xj)

This seems complicated. Maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me think about the impact of buying a ticket on a particular day.

Each ticket bought on day i costs ai plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy xi tickets on day i, the cost for those xi tickets is xi * (ai + sum(xj for j from 1 to i-1))

I need to minimize the total cost, which is sum over i from 1 to n of xi*(ai + sum(xj for j from 1 to i-1))

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

This looks similar to scheduling problems where you have to decide the order of operations that affect future costs.

I recall that in some problems, sorting the days in a certain order can help.

Perhaps I should sort the days based on their base prices, and buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest base prices, considering the constraints.

But, there's a catch: the days are ordered in time, and buying on earlier days affects the prices on later days.

So, it's not straightforward to just sort the days by price.

Wait, maybe I can select a subset of days to buy tickets, and determine how many to buy each day.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the example in the problem.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

One optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1

- Buy 0 on day 2

- Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 4)

- Buy 2 on day 4 (cost 2*(2 +1)=6), total 10.

Another possible way:

- Buy 2 on day 1 (cost 16), then prices increase by 2 for remaining days: [8+2=10,6+2=8,4+2=6,2+2=4]

- Buy 1 on day 4 (cost 4), total 20.

This is worse than the first strategy.

Another strategy:

- Buy 1 on day 3 (cost 4), prices increase by 1 for remaining days: [6+1=7,4+1=5,2+1=3]

- Buy 2 on day 4 (cost 2*3=6), total 10.

Same as the first strategy.

So, seems buying on later days with lower prices is better, but need to consider the increase in prices for future days.

Wait, in this case, buying on day 3 and day 4 is better than buying on day 1 and day 4.

Because buying on day 1 increases the prices for days 2,3,4, which might be worse if those days have lower base prices.

So, perhaps I should buy on days with lower base prices, but not so late that the increase affects many previous days.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the constraints.

n can be up to 3*10^5, and k can be up to 10^9.

So, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Given the constraints, I need something fast.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the days based on their base price a_i, and try to buy tickets on the days with the lowest a_i.

- However, since the days are ordered, buying on earlier days affects the prices on later days.

- Maybe I can select a subset of days to buy tickets, and compute the total cost considering the increases.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as selecting which days to buy tickets on, and how many to buy each day, considering the price increases.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider another perspective.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, and the number of tickets on each day.

Then, the total cost can be computed as sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum over i of (x_i * a_i) + (sum over j < i of x_i * x_j)

So, it's the sum of individual ticket costs plus some cross terms.

This seems tricky to minimize directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to prioritize days with lower a_i, but also consider the impact on future days.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize days with the lowest a_i - sum(x_j for j < i), where sum(x_j for j < i) is the total tickets bought on previous days.

But sum(x_j for j < i) depends on the choices made for previous days.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the number of tickets bought so far and the remaining days.

But with n up to 3*10^5, dynamic programming might be too slow unless it's highly optimized.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Suppose I buy x tickets on day i, then the cost for those x tickets is x * a_i plus x * sum of tickets bought on previous days.

- If I denote s = sum of tickets bought on previous days, then the cost for buying x on day i is x * (a_i + s).

- Since s increases with each day, the cost per ticket on day i is a_i + s.

- So, to minimize the total cost, I should buy tickets on days where a_i + s is smallest.

- But s depends on the previous choices, so it's interdependent.

This seems circular.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as a greedy algorithm: always buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the smallest a_i + s, where s is the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

But implementing this directly might be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that s increases by the number of tickets bought on each day.

So, if I buy x1 on day i1, then x2 on day i2, etc., s for day i2 is x1, for day i3 is x1 + x2, and so on.

This seems complicated to manage directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the set of days on which I buy tickets, and the number of tickets on each day, subject to the constraints that sum(x_i) = k and x_i <= m for all i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum over i of (x_i * a_i) + x_i * sum over j < i of x_j)

Which is sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * sum over j < i of x_j)

The second term is sum over all pairs (i,j) with j < i of x_i * x_j)

This seems like a complicated expression to minimize.

Maybe I need to consider the dual problem or find a way to simplify this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a linear programming problem, but that would be too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the incremental cost of buying an additional ticket on a certain day.

If I buy one more ticket on day i, the cost is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the marginal cost on day i is a_i + sum(x_j for j < i).

To minimize the total cost, I should prioritize buying tickets on days where the marginal cost is lowest.

But again, this depends on the sum of x_j for j < i, which is not known in advance.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the smallest a_i, considering the constraints.

But, since the days are ordered in time, and buying on earlier days increases the prices on later days, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can select a subset of days to buy tickets, such that the sum of tickets bought is k, and the total cost is minimized.

This sounds like a selection problem.

Let me consider that I need to choose q days to buy tickets, where q is between 1 and min(n, ceil(k/m)).

Then, for each possible q, I can choose the q days with the smallest a_i, and buy as many tickets as possible on those days, considering the constraints.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Suppose I choose to buy tickets on days i1, i2, ..., iq, where i1 < i2 < ... < iq.

Then, on day i1, I can buy up to m tickets at price a_i1 plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days, which is 0, so just a_i1.

On day i2, I can buy up to m tickets at price a_i2 plus the number of tickets bought on day i1.

Similarly, on day i3, the price is a_i3 plus the number of tickets bought on day i1 and i2, and so on.

This seems manageable.

Let me consider that for a fixed q, I can select the q days with the smallest a_i, and buy m tickets on each of them, except possibly the last one where I may buy fewer if k is not a multiple of m.

But I need to account for the price increases.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days based on a_i and select the q smallest a_i, and buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining on the q-th day.

Then, compute the total cost accordingly.

Let me try this approach with the first example.

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

Select q=2 days: days with a=2 and a=4.

Buy m=2 on the first selected day (a=2), but since it's day 4, buying 2 on day 4 costs 2*(2 + sum of previous purchases).

Previous purchases are 0, so 2*2=4.

Then, buy 1 on the second selected day (a=4), which is day 3, at price 4 + 2 (from previous purchase) =6, so 1*6=6.

Total cost:4+6=10, which matches the first strategy.

Another way: select q=1 day, say the smallest a_i=2.

Buy all 3 on day 4 at price 2 +0=2, so 3*2=6.

But, according to the problem, is this allowed?

Wait, but in the problem, it's mentioned that buying x tickets on day i increases the price for future days by x.

So, if I buy 3 on day 4, then for days 1 to 3, the price increases by 3.

But, since day 4 is the last day, there are no future days to consider.

So, total cost is indeed 3*2=6.

But in the first strategy, it was 10.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, if I buy 3 on day 4, then the prices for days 1 to 3 increase by 3, but since I'm buying on day 4, I don't need to consider days 1 to 3 anyway.

So, total cost is indeed 3*2=6.

But in the example, the first strategy was buying 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4 for a total of 10.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, in the example, buying 1 on day 3 costs 4, and then buying 2 on day 4 costs 2*(2 +1)=6, total 10.

But according to my earlier thought, buying 3 on day 4 alone would cost 3*2=6, which is better.

So, why is that not considered in the example?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

" If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . "

So, buying on day i affects the prices on days i+1 onwards.

Therefore, buying on day 4 affects no future days, since there are no days after day 4.

Therefore, buying all 3 on day 4 should cost 3*2=6, which is better than the first strategy of 10.

But in the example, they chose to buy 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4 for a total of 10.

Why is that?

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Let me look back at the example in the problem.

In the first test case, they say:

- Buy 0 on day 1. Prices for remaining days: [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2. Prices for remaining days: [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3. Cost:4. Prices for remaining day: [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4. Cost:6.

Total:10.

But according to my earlier thought, buying all 3 on day 4 should cost only 6.

Is there a mistake in the problem or in my understanding?

Wait, perhaps buying on day 4 affects the prices for days 1 to 3, but since I'm not buying on days 1 to 3, it doesn't matter.

Wait, no, the price increase applies to future days, but if I buy on day 4, there are no future days to consider.

So, buying on day 4 doesn't affect any prices because there are no days after day 4.

Therefore, buying all 3 on day 4 should cost 3*2=6, which is better than 10.

So, why didn't the example consider this?

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that I can't buy on a day if I haven't bought on previous days.

But the problem doesn't say that.

It says I can buy up to m tickets per day, and the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy on day 4 only, then the price per ticket is a_4 plus the total number of tickets bought on days 1,2,3, which is 0, so a_4 +0.

Therefore, buying all 3 on day 4 should cost 3*a_4=6.

But in the example, they chose to buy 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4 for a total of 10.

Why is that?

Is there a mistake in the example or in my understanding?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that buying on day 3 affects day 4.

Wait, no, buying on day 3 would increase the price for day 4.

But in the example, they bought 1 on day 3, so day 4's price increases by 1, so a4 becomes 2+1=3.

Then, buying 2 on day 4 costs 2*3=6, plus the 4 from day 3, total 10.

But if I buy all 3 on day 4, then no previous purchases, so a4+0=2, total 6.

So, in this case, buying all on day 4 is better.

Perhaps the example is just showing one possible strategy, not necessarily the optimal one.

So, maybe the optimal answer is 6 for the first test case, not 10.

But in the sample output, it's 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let's look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

4 2 8

8 6 4 2

5 100 1

10000 1 100 10 1000

6 3 9

5 5 5 5 5 5

Sample Output:

10

64

1

72

So, for the first test case, the output is 10, but according to my earlier thought, buying all on day 4 should cost 6, which is better than 10.

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the price increase applies to all remaining days, including the day of purchase.

Wait, the problem says: "all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, the day of purchase, the price is a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, in the first strategy:

- Buy 0 on day 1. Prices for remaining days: [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2. Prices for remaining days: [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3. Cost:4. Prices for remaining day: [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4. Cost:6.

Total:10.

If I buy all 3 on day 4:

- Buy 0 on day 1. Prices for remaining days: [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2. Prices for remaining days: [4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 3. Prices for remaining day: [2]

- Buy 3 on day 4. Cost:6.

Total:6.

So, why is the sample output 10?

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, let's read the problem statement again.

"the price per ticket at day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert organizers have implemented the following measures:

- A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day.

- If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x ."

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all j < i.

Wait, in the first strategy, buying 1 on day 3 at price 4: a_3=4, sum of x_j for j <3 is 0, so cost is 1*4=4.

Then, buying 2 on day 4 at price 2 + sum of x_j for j <4 which is 1, so 2+1=3 per ticket, total 6.

So, total cost is 4+6=10.

But if I buy all 3 on day 4:

- On day 4, sum of x_j for j <4 is 0, so price per ticket is 2+0=2, total 6.

So, indeed, buying all on day 4 is better, costing 6, which is less than 10.

But in the sample output, it's 10.

Wait, perhaps in the first test case, buying all on day 4 is allowed and costs 6, but in the second test case, buying all on day 1 is better, but m=2 and k=8, so need to buy 2 on day 1, 2 on day 2, 2 on day 3, and 2 on day 4.

With a=[8,6,4,2], so:

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost 2*8=16, prices for days 2,3,4 increase by 2.

- New prices: day2:6+2=8, day3:4+2=6, day4:2+2=4.

- Buy 2 on day 2: cost 2*8=16, prices for days 3,4 increase by 2 more.

- New prices: day3:6+2=8, day4:4+2=6.

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 2*8=16, price for day4 increases by 2 more.

- New price: day4:6+2=8.

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 2*8=16.

- Total:16+16+16+16=64.

But according to the sample output, it's 64.

But in the first test case, k=3, m=2, n=4, a=[8,6,4,2].

If I buy all 3 on day 4, cost=3*2=6, which is better than 10.

But the sample output is 10, not 6.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the problem allows buying on any subset of days, but the days must be in order.

Wait, no, you have to consider the days in sequence.

Wait, perhaps you cannot skip days.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't say that.

You can choose on which days to buy tickets, but the price increases apply to future days based on previous purchases.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.

Let me try to formalize the cost.

Let x_i be the number of tickets bought on day i, with 0 <= x_i <= m, and sum(x_i) = k.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

Total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize this.

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

This looks similar to assignment problems, but it's not straightforward.

Let me consider that the cost per ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the earlier I buy a ticket, the higher the cost per ticket, because it increases the price for all future days.

Wait, no, actually, buying a ticket on an earlier day increases the price for future days, which might make buying on future days more expensive.

So, there's a trade-off: buying on an earlier day is cheaper in terms of a_i, but it makes future days more expensive.

Hence, I need to find a balance.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to buy as many as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, but considering the impact on future days.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying all on day 4 is better, as a_4=2 is the lowest, and it doesn't affect future days since it's the last day.

In the second test case, buying as much as possible on day 1 might be better, but as we've seen, it leads to higher prices on future days.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

If I buy 2 on day1, cost=16, new prices [8+2=10,6+2=8,4+2=6,2+2=4]

Then buy 2 on day2, cost=16, new prices [8+2=10,6+2=8,4+2=6]

Wait, no, the prices already increased by 2 from day1, so day2's price is 8, plus 2 from day1's purchase, total 10.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, when you buy x tickets on day i, the prices for days j > i increase by x.

So, buying 2 on day1, prices for days 2,3,4 increase by 2.

So, day2:6+2=8, day3:4+2=6, day4:2+2=4.

Then, buying 2 on day2, prices for days 3 and 4 increase by 2 more.

So, day3:6+2=8, day4:4+2=6.

Then, buying 2 on day3, price for day4 increases by 2 more.

So, day4:6+2=8.

Finally, buying 2 on day4, cost=16.

Total=64.

Is there a better way?

Suppose I buy as much as possible on the days with the lowest a_i.

In this case, a=[8,6,4,2], sorted is [2,4,6,8].

So, the days with the lowest a_i are day4, day3, day2, day1.

So, buying on day4 first: buy m=2 tickets, cost=2*2=4, now k=6 remaining.

Then, buy on day3: buy m=2 tickets, cost=2*(4+2)=12, total=16.

Then, buy on day2: buy m=2 tickets, cost=2*(6+4)=20, total=36.

Then, buy on day1: buy remaining 2 tickets, cost=2*(8+6)=28, total=64.

Same as before.

Is there a better way?

Wait, perhaps buying less on earlier days to minimize the price increases.

Let me try buying only 1 ticket on day4, cost=1*2=2, k=7 remaining.

Then, buy 1 on day3, cost=1*(4+1)=5, total=7.

Then, buy 1 on day2, cost=1*(6+2)=8, total=15.

Then, buy 1 on day1, cost=1*(8+3)=11, total=26.

Continue until k=0.

This seems worse.

Another approach: buy as much as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases.

But in this case, it seems buying on day4 is best, but with m=2, I can only buy 2 on day4, then prices increase for days1-3.

Then, buy on day3, etc.

Wait, perhaps in this case, buying all on day4 is not possible because m=2 and k=8, so need to buy on multiple days.

Hence, it's complicated.

I need a general approach.

Let me think about the following:

Suppose I select q days to buy tickets, where q is the smallest integer such that q*m >=k.

Then, I select the q days with the smallest a_i.

Then, I buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and k - (q-1)*m tickets on the q-th day.

Then, compute the total cost accordingly.

Wait, but the days are ordered, and selecting q days needs to consider the price increases.

This seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i, and select the q days with the smallest a_i.

Then, assign as many tickets as possible to these days, considering the constraints.

But again, the price increases complicate things.

Wait, maybe I can model this as choosing q days, and then buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining on the q-th day, and compute the total cost accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I select q days, and sort them in increasing order of a_i.

Let's say the selected days are i1 < i2 < ... < iq.

Then, on day i1, the price per ticket is a_i1 plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days, which is 0.

So, cost on day i1 is x1 * a_i1.

On day i2, the price per ticket is a_i2 plus x1.

So, cost on day i2 is x2 * (a_i2 + x1).

Similarly, on day i3, the price per ticket is a_i3 plus x1 + x2.

So, cost on day i3 is x3 * (a_i3 + x1 + x2).

And so on.

So, total cost is sum over j from 1 to q of xj * (aj + sum over l from 1 to j-1 of xl)

Subject to sum(xj) = k and xj <= m for all j.

This seems like a sum of series.

Wait, perhaps I can find a formula for the total cost.

Let me denote s_j = sum over l from 1 to j of x_l.

Then, the total cost is sum over j from 1 to q of x_j * (a_j + s_j - x_j)

Which simplifies to sum over j of (x_j * a_j + x_j * s_j - x_j^2)

But s_j = s_{j-1} + x_j, with s_0 =0.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of s_j as the cumulative sum up to day j.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me consider that s_j = sum_{l=1}^j x_l.

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^q x_j * (a_j + s_j - x_j) = sum_{j=1}^q (x_j * a_j + x_j * s_j - x_j^2)

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over all tickets of the price at which they are bought.

Each ticket bought on day j has a price of a_j plus the number of tickets bought on previous days up to that point.

So, if I buy x_j tickets on day j, each of them has a price of a_j plus the sum of x_l for l < j.

Wait, more precisely, the j-th ticket bought on day j has a price of a_j plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days plus the number of tickets bought on day j before it.

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider the total cost in terms of the sum of a_j times x_j plus the sum of x_j times the sum of x_l for l < j.

Which is sum_{j=1}^q (x_j * a_j) + sum_{j=1}^q (x_j * sum_{l=1}^{j-1} x_l)

This is equal to sum_{j=1}^q x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^q x_j * s_{j-1}

Where s_{j-1} = sum_{l=1}^{j-1} x_l

So, total cost is sum_{j=1}^q x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^q x_j * s_{j-1}

This seems better.

Now, I need to minimize this expression subject to sum_{j=1}^q x_j = k and x_j <= m for all j.

This still seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can fix q, the number of days to buy tickets, and choose the q days with the smallest a_j.

Then, assign x_j to each day, with x_j <= m, and sum x_j =k.

But, the cost also depends on the order of the days.

Wait, maybe I can select q days, sort them in increasing order of a_j, and assign x_j accordingly.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me consider that for a fixed q, I can choose q days, and buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining on the q-th day.

Then, compute the total cost based on the cumulative sum.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the cumulative sum of x_j and find a formula.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving cumulative sums and minimization, prefix sums or suffix sums can be useful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the days in order and compute the cumulative cost incrementally.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[q][s] as the minimum cost to buy s tickets using the first q days.

Then, dp[q][s] = min over x in [0, m] of dp[q-1][s - x] + x * (a_q + sum_{l=1}^{q-1} previous_x_l)

But this seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over j of x_j * a_j + sum over j of x_j * sum over l < j of x_l

Which is sum over j of x_j * a_j + sum over all pairs (j,l) with l < j of x_j * x_l

This seems like sum over j of x_j * a_j + sum over j > l of x_j * x_l

This is still not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the sum over j > l of x_j * x_l as 1/2 * ( (sum_j x_j)^2 - sum_j x_j^2 )

Because sum_{j != l} x_j * x_l = (sum_j x_j)^2 - sum_j x_j^2

And since sum_j x_j =k, it's k^2 - sum
