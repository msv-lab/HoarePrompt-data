Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent. Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people. Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My task is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or output -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and preferences clearly.

- Introverts: Each needs a tent alone.
- Extroverts: Each needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals: Can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

Given that, I need to minimize the number of tents used while satisfying everyone's preferences.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since introverts need their own tents, the number of tents required for them is simply 'a' (the number of introverts).

Now, for extroverts and universals, it's a bit more complicated. Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, for each extrovert, we need to have two other people (which can be universals or other extroverts) in the same tent.

But wait, extroverts need to be in a tent with two others, meaning that each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people: the extrovert and two others.

So, if I have 'b' extroverts, I need to group them in tents of three, where each tent has one extrovert and two others (which can be universals or other extroverts).

Wait, no. Actually, each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, but it's not necessarily that each tent contains only one extrovert. Wait, actually, if a tent has one extrovert and two universals, that satisfies the extrovert's preference. But could a tent have more than one extrovert?

Wait, no. If a tent has two extroverts, then each of them needs two others, which would require four people in total (two extroverts and two universals). But that would mean each extrovert has two others with them, satisfying their preference.

Wait, but the problem says "each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others", meaning that the tent must contain exactly three people: one extrovert and two others.

Wait, no, it says "each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

So, each tent that contains at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

But, it doesn't specify how many extroverts can be in such a tent.

Wait, let's read it again: "each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

So, for each extrovert, the tent they are in must have exactly three people, including themselves and two others.

But, it doesn't specify that each tent can have only one extrovert.

Wait, actually, if a tent has one extrovert and two universals, that satisfies the extrovert's preference.

Alternatively, if a tent has two extroverts and one universal, does that satisfy both extroverts' preferences?

Each extrovert in that tent has two others with them (the other extrovert and the universal), so yes, that satisfies their preferences.

Similarly, a tent with three extroverts would each have two others with them, satisfying their preferences.

So, tents containing extroverts can have one, two, or three extroverts, as long as the total number of people in the tent is three.

Given that, I need to group extroverts and universals into tents of three, where each tent has at least one extrovert.

Wait, no. The problem says "each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others", but it doesn't say that extroverts must be in a tent with at least one extrovert. It just specifies that extroverts want to be with two others.

Wait, actually, re-reading the problem:

"Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

But it doesn't specify that the tent must contain more than one extrovert.

So, tents can have:

- One extrovert and two universals.

- Two extroverts and one universal.

- Three extroverts.

All of these satisfy the extroverts' preferences, as each extrovert is with two others.

Similarly, universals are flexible and can be in any tent configuration: alone, with one other, or with two others.

Given that, I need to minimize the total number of tents.

So, the total number of tents will be the number of tents for introverts plus the number of tents for extroverts and universals.

The number of tents for introverts is simply 'a'.

For extroverts and universals, I need to group them into tents of up to three people, with the constraint that each extrovert is in a tent with exactly three people.

Wait, no: each tent that contains an extrovert must have exactly three people, but tents without extroverts (only universals) can have one, two, or three people.

But in this problem, since we have to satisfy the extroverts' preferences, the tents with extroverts must have exactly three people, but tents with only universals can have one, two, or three people.

Wait, but the problem says "each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

But it doesn't specify anything about tents without extroverts.

However, to minimize the number of tents, I should try to fill the tents as much as possible, i.e., prefer tents with three people.

But I need to make sure that all extroverts are in tents with exactly three people.

So, I need to group 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals into tents of three, where each tent has at least one extrovert.

Wait, no. The problem says that tents with extroverts must have exactly three people, but tents with only universals can have one, two, or three people.

But to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents that contain three people.

So, I should try to group as many people as possible into tents of three, especially those that include extroverts.

Let me think about the total number of people: a introverts, b extroverts, and c universals.

Total people: a + b + c.

Each introvert needs their own tent, so that's 'a' tents.

The remaining people are b extroverts and c universals, totaling b + c people.

These need to be grouped into tents, each containing up to three people, with the constraint that any tent containing at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

But, tents with only universals can have one, two, or three people.

Wait, but to minimize the total number of tents, I need to minimize the number of tents for the extroverts and universals.

Given that, I should maximize the number of tents that contain three people, especially those that include extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, but universals can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

So, I need to assign all extroverts to tents of exactly three people, and assign universals to fill these tents or to their own tents if necessary.

Let me think about it differently.

First, assign all introverts to their own tents: that's 'a' tents.

Then, for the extroverts and universals, I need to group them into tents of three, where each tent has at least one extrovert.

Wait, no, that's not what the problem says.

The problem says that each tent that contains an extrovert must have exactly three people, but it doesn't say that all tents must have at least one extrovert.

So, tents with only universals can have one, two, or three people, but tents with extroverts must have exactly three people.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents that contain three people, especially those that include extroverts.

Let me consider that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly three people, and universals can be used to fill these tents or be in their own tents.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but with the constraint that each tent has exactly three people.

Wait, no.

Wait, each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people, but multiple extroverts can share a tent, as long as the tent has exactly three people.

Wait, but if a tent has two extroverts and one universal, that's three people, satisfying the extroverts' preferences.

Similarly, a tent with three extroverts would also satisfy their preferences.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, up to three.

Wait, but the problem says that each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people, but it doesn't specify how many extroverts can be in such a tent.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should try to have as many extroverts as possible in tents with three people, including extroverts and universals.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of extroverts and how they need to be grouped into tents of three.

Let me consider that each tent that includes at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts placed in tents with three people.

Let me consider the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Letâ€™s denote the number of tents needed for extroverts as the number of tents required to accommodate 'b' extroverts, with each tent containing at least one extrovert and exactly three people.

So, if I have 'k' tents for extroverts, each tent has at least one extrovert and exactly three people.

Therefore, each such tent can accommodate up to two extroverts (since if a tent has one extrovert, it needs two universals, and if it has two extroverts, it needs one universal, and if it has three extroverts, it needs zero universals).

Wait, no.

Wait, if a tent has one extrovert, it needs two universals to make it three people.

If a tent has two extroverts, it needs one universal.

If a tent has three extroverts, it needs no universals.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

Therefore, I should prefer having tents with three extroverts, then tents with two extroverts and one universal, and finally tents with one extrovert and two universals.

But I have to consider the number of universals available.

So, let's think in terms of the number of tents needed for extroverts.

Let me define a function that calculates the number of tents needed for 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

I need to group 'b' extroverts into tents of three people, where each tent has at least one extrovert.

To minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

So, I should prioritize having as many tents with three extroverts as possible, then tents with two extroverts and one universal, and finally tents with one extrovert and two universals.

Given that, let's calculate the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

First, see how many tents can have three extroverts.

Let's say I have 'b' extroverts.

The maximum number of tents with three extroverts is floor(b / 3).

Let's allocate that many tents.

So, number of tents with three extroverts: floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts: b % 3.

If b % 3 == 0, then all extroverts are placed in tents with three extroverts.

If b % 3 == 1, then after placing floor(b / 3) tents with three extroverts, I have one extrovert left.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, I have two extroverts left.

Now, for the remaining extroverts, I need to place them in tents with universals.

If I have remaining extroverts:

- If remaining extroverts == 1, I need to place this extrovert in a tent with two universals.

- If remaining extroverts == 2, I can place them in a tent with one universal.

Wait, but if I have two extroverts left, I can place them in a tent with one universal, making it three people.

Similarly, if I have one extrovert left, I need to place them in a tent with two universals.

So, in total, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

But, I need to ensure that there are enough universals to fill these tents.

Let's see:

- For each tent with three extroverts: 0 universals needed.

- For each tent with two extroverts and one universal: 1 universal needed.

- For each tent with one extrovert and two universals: 2 universals needed.

So, if I have floor(b / 3) tents with three extroverts, and ceil(b % 3) tents with the remaining extroverts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of universals needed based on the number of tents and the remaining extroverts.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have 'b' extroverts.

Each tent that includes an extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but with the constraint that each tent has exactly three people.

Wait, no.

Wait, since each tent that includes an extrovert must have exactly three people, and extroverts can share tents with other extroverts and universals, I need to group extroverts into tents of three, maximizing the number of extroverts per tent.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, i.e., have as many tents with three extroverts as possible.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

But, I need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in these tents.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have floor(b / 3) tents with three extroverts, then I have b % 3 extroverts left.

For the remaining extroverts:

- If b % 3 == 0: no remaining extroverts, so total tents for extroverts is floor(b / 3).

- If b % 3 == 1: need one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: need one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

So, total tents for extroverts:

- floor(b / 3) + ceil(b % 3)

Which is essentially ceil(b / 3).

But I need to ensure that there are enough universals for the remaining extroverts.

Specifically:

- If b % 3 == 1: need two universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: need one universal.

So, total universals needed for extroverts' tents:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 universals.

- If b % 3 == 1: 2 universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: 1 universal.

Then, after assigning universals to extroverts' tents, the remaining universals can be assigned to their own tents.

So, the total number of tents is:

- Tents for introverts: a

- Tents for extroverts: ceil(b / 3)

- Tents for universals: ceil((c - required universals for extroverts' tents) / 3)

Wait, but I need to make sure that the universals assigned to extroverts' tents are accounted for.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of universals needed for extroverts' tents and then see how many tents are needed for the remaining universals.

Let me formalize this.

Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts:

- Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(b / 3)

Calculate the number of universals needed for these tents:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 universals.

- If b % 3 == 1: 2 universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: 1 universal.

So, universals needed for extroverts' tents:

- (b % 3) * (2 - b % 3)

Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Let me define a function that calculates the number of universals needed for extroverts' tents based on b.

def universals_needed(b):

if b == 0:

return 0

remainder = b % 3

if remainder == 0:

return 0

elif remainder == 1:

return 2

elif remainder == 2:

return 1

So, universals_needed(b) returns 0 if b % 3 == 0, 2 if b % 3 == 1, and 1 if b % 3 == 2.

Then, the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

Then, the remaining universals are c - universals_needed(b).

If c - universals_needed(b) < 0, it's impossible, so return -1.

Otherwise, the number of tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((c - universals_needed(b)) / 3).

Finally, the total number of tents is a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - universals_needed(b)) / 3).

But, I need to make sure that the remaining universals are non-negative.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: a.

2. Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts: ceil(b / 3).

3. Calculate the number of universals needed for extroverts' tents:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0

- If b % 3 == 1: 2

- If b % 3 == 2: 1

4. Check if c >= universals_needed(b). If not, return -1.

5. Calculate the remaining universals: c - universals_needed(b).

6. Calculate the number of tents needed for the remaining universals: ceil((c - universals_needed(b)) / 3).

7. Total tents = a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - universals_needed(b)) / 3).

Wait, but in the problem, tents for universals can have 1, 2, or 3 people, so ceil((c - universals_needed(b)) / 3) is correct.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
