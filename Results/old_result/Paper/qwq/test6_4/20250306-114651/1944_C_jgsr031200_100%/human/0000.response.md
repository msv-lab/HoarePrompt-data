Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have Alice and Bob playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but does not add it to `c`. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find the final score if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, MEX of [0,1,2] is 3, MEX of [0,1,3] is 2, and MEX of [1,2,3] is 0.

So, Alice wants the MEX of `c` to be as large as possible, and Bob wants it to be as small as possible. Since Alice picks elements for `c`, she can choose which elements to include in `c`, but Bob can influence this by deleting elements that Alice might want.

Let's think about how the game progresses. The total number of turns is `n`, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting first. So, if `n` is even, both play `n/2` times each. If `n` is odd, Alice plays `(n+1)/2` times, and Bob plays `(n-1)/2` times.

Wait, no. Actually, since Alice goes first, and they alternate, Alice will always play ceil(n/2) times, and Bob will play floor(n/2) times.

But in this game, Alice is the one choosing elements for `c`, and Bob is just deleting elements from `a`, but not adding to `c`.

Wait, no, Bob deletes an element from `a` without adding it to `c`. So, in each turn:

- Alice: picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, deletes it from `a`.

- Bob: picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`.

So, in total, `c` will have ceil(n/2) elements, since Alice plays ceil(n/2) times.

Wait, but actually, Alice plays ceil(n/2) times, but Bob plays floor(n/2) times. Each time Alice plays, she adds one element to `c`, and each time Bob plays, he deletes one element from `a` without adding to `c`. So, the size of `c` will be ceil(n/2), because Alice adds one element each time she plays.

But, wait, Bob is also deleting elements from `a`, so the pool of elements available for Alice decreases.

Wait, no, Bob deletes elements from `a`, which removes them from the pool for Alice's future picks, but doesn't affect the elements already in `c`.

Wait, but Bob can strategically delete elements to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the final `c` will have ceil(n/2) elements, since Alice gets to pick ceil(n/2) times. Bob gets to delete floor(n/2) elements, but only from `a`, not from `c`.

Wait, no, Bob deletes from `a`, not from `c`.

So, Alice picks elements for `c`, and Bob can delete elements from `a`, which might be elements that Alice hasn't picked yet.

I need to find the MEX of `c` after all elements are exhausted.

I need to think about what elements Alice can include in `c` despite Bob's deletions.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.

Wait, no, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible in `c`, but Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

Wait, actually, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many of the smaller integers in `c`, so that the smallest missing integer is as large as possible.

Wait, no, that's not correct. To maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many of the smallest integers possible in `c`, so that the first missing integer is as large as possible.

But Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain integers in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of which elements Alice can guarantee to include in `c`, given that Bob is trying to prevent her from including certain elements.

Let me consider the frequency of each integer in `a`.

Suppose an integer `x` appears `k` times in `a`. Alice wants to include `x` in `c` as many times as possible, but Bob can delete some occurrences of `x`.

I need to determine how many times Alice can include `x` in `c`.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick a particular element.

Wait, but elements are being deleted as they are picked or deleted by Bob.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include in `c` up to ceil(n/2) elements, and Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

But Bob deletes from `a`, not from `c`.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the available elements at each step.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the MEX.

The MEX is the smallest missing integer in `c`.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she wants to include as many of the smallest integers in `c`.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain smallest integers in `c`.

So, perhaps, for each integer `x`, starting from 0 upwards, I can determine whether Alice can include `x` in `c` despite Bob's efforts.

If Alice can ensure that `x` is in `c`, then the MEX will be higher.

If Bob can prevent `x` from being in `c`, then the MEX will be `x`.

So, for each `x`, I need to check if Alice can include `x` in `c`, given that Bob is trying to prevent it.

If Alice can include all `x` from 0 to `k-1` in `c`, but cannot include `k`, then the MEX will be `k`.

So, I need to find the smallest `x` such that Bob can prevent `x` from being in `c`.

Now, how do I determine for a particular `x`, whether Alice can include it in `c`?

Let's consider the frequency of `x` in `a`, say `freq[x]`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting.

Alice wants to include `x` in `c`, Bob wants to prevent it.

So, for `x`, the number of times it appears in `a` is `freq[x]`.

Alice can pick `x` on her turn and add it to `c`.

Bob can pick `x` on his turn and delete it, preventing Alice from adding it to `c`.

So, for each `x`, the number of times Alice can include it in `c` is ceil(freq[x]/2).

Because for every two occurrences of `x`, Alice and Bob can each take one.

If freq[x] is odd, Alice gets the extra one.

So, Alice can include ceil(freq[x]/2) instances of `x` in `c`.

But since `c` can have at most ceil(n/2) elements, and Alice chooses which ones to include.

But in this context, since we're considering MEX, we care about whether `x` is present in `c` at least once.

So, for `x` to be in `c`, Alice needs to include at least one instance of `x` in `c`, provided that there is at least one left when it's her turn.

But Bob can delete instances of `x` to prevent Alice from including it.

Wait, no, Bob can only delete from `a`, not from `c`.

Wait, but Bob deletes from `a`, which are the elements available for Alice to pick.

So, if Bob deletes an `x` from `a`, it's no longer available for Alice to pick.

So, for each `x`, the number of times it's available for Alice to pick is freq[x] minus the number of times Bob deletes it.

Since Bob wants to minimize the MEX, he will try to delete elements that Alice wants to include in `c`.

Specifically, for small `x`, Bob will try to delete `x` to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.

So, for each `x`, the number of times Alice can include `x` in `c` is max(freq[x] - floor(freq[x]/2), 0).

Wait, perhaps.

Because Bob can delete floor(freq[x]/2) instances of `x`, and Alice can pick the remaining ceil(freq[x]/2) instances.

But actually, it's more about the turn order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of moves.

Total moves are `n`, with Alice making ceil(n/2) moves and Bob making floor(n/2) moves.

For each `x`, the number of times Alice can include `x` in `c` is the number of times `x` is in `a`, minus the number of times Bob deletes it.

Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements in total, but he has to decide which ones to delete.

To minimize the MEX, Bob would want to delete elements that Alice wants to include in `c`, particularly the smaller `x`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the availability of `x` when it's Alice's turn.

For a particular `x`, if freq[x] > 0 when it's Alice's turn, she can pick it and add it to `c`.

But Bob can delete `x` on his turn, reducing freq[x].

So, to prevent Alice from picking `x`, Bob needs to delete all occurrences of `x` before it's Alice's turn again.

But Alice gets to pick first, and she can choose to pick `x` if it's available.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick `x` before Bob can delete all remaining `x`.

This seems complicated.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include in `c` up to ceil(n/2) elements, and Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

I need to find the smallest `x` such that, after Alice's selections and Bob's deletions, `x` is not in `c`.

In other words, for each `x`, starting from 0 upwards, I need to check if Alice can include `x` in `c` despite Bob's deletions.

If Alice can include `x` in `c`, then MEX is higher; otherwise, MEX is `x`.

To determine if Alice can include `x` in `c`, I need to see if, after Bob deletes as many elements as he can, there are still some `x` left for Alice to pick.

Given that Alice picks first, and they alternate turns.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and the number of deletions Bob can make.

If freq[x] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one `x` in `c`, because Bob can delete at most floor(n/2) elements.

If freq[x] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can delete all occurrences of `x`, preventing Alice from including any in `c`.

Wait, but this might not be entirely accurate, because Bob has to delete elements across all turns, not just targeting `x`.

Wait, actually, Bob can choose which elements to delete, so he can prioritize deleting `x` to prevent Alice from including it.

So, if freq[x] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all `x`, preventing Alice from including any in `c`.

If freq[x] > floor(n/2), then even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, some of which could be `x`, Alice can still pick at least one `x` to include in `c`.

Wait, but Bob might choose to delete other elements to maximize the MEX.

Wait, no, Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he would try to prevent Alice from including small `x` in `c`.

So, for each `x`, starting from 0 upwards, check if freq[x] > floor(n/2).

If freq[x] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include `x` in `c`, because Bob can't delete all occurrences of `x`.

If freq[x] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can delete all occurrences of `x`, preventing Alice from including it in `c`.

So, the smallest `x` for which freq[x] <= floor(n/2) is the MEX.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Let me test this with the first example.

First test case:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

floor(n/2) = 2

Check x=0: freq[0]=2 > 2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

Check x=1: freq[1]=2 > 2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

So, according to this, MEX should be 0, but in the example, it's 2.

Hmm, so my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include ceil(freq[x]/2) instances of `x` in `c`, and Bob can delete floor(freq[x]/2) instances.

Wait, but that might not account for the turn order.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the unique elements in `a` and for each unique element, determine how many times Alice can include it in `c`.

Then, select the smallest `x` such that Alice can include at least one `x` in `c`.

Wait, no, actually, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many small `x` as possible.

So, perhaps, sort the unique elements, and for each `x`, in order, check if Alice can include it in `c`.

If she can, include it, and proceed to the next `x`.

When she can't include a particular `x`, that `x` is the MEX.

But how do I determine if Alice can include `x` in `c`?

Given that Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, not necessarily targeting `x`.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total number of deletions Bob can make, and see how many `x` are left for Alice to pick.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider the example again.

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

floor(n/2)=2

Alice can pick ceil(n/2)=2 elements for `c`.

Bob can delete 2 elements.

If Bob deletes two 0's, then `c` will have two 1's, MEX is 0.

But in the explanation, they have a different sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[0,1], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a=[1], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[], c=[1,0]

So, c=[1,0], MEX is 2.

But according to my earlier thought, if Bob deletes two 0's, c has two 1's, MEX is 0.

But in the example, they show MEX is 2.

Wait, perhaps Bob cannot delete two 0's in a row.

Let's see the sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[0,1], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a=[1], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[], c=[1,0]

So, in this sequence, Bob couldn't delete two 0's in a row because in his first turn, he deleted one 0, and in his second turn, he deleted 1.

So, Alice was able to pick both 1 and 0.

So, perhaps, if Bob deletes a 0 first, Alice can pick the remaining 0 in her next turn.

Alternatively, if Bob deletes 1 first, then Alice can pick 0.

Wait, let's see:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[0,0], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a=[0], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 0, a=[], c=[1,0]

Again, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

Or,

- Alice picks 0, a=[0,1,1], c=[0]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,1], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[1], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[], c=[0,1]

Again, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Or,

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[0,1], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a=[1], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[], c=[1,0]

Again, MEX=2.

It seems that no matter what Bob does, Alice can include both 0 and 1 in `c`, so MEX is 2.

But earlier, I thought if Bob deletes two 0's, then c has two 1's, MEX is 0, but in practice, Bob can't delete two 0's in a way that prevents Alice from picking a 0.

Because Alice picks first, and Bob can only delete one element per turn.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick `x` before Bob can delete all remaining `x`.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of the number of turns.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some games, the outcome can be determined by the number of available moves and the players' objectives.

In this case, Alice wants to maximize the MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick each `x`.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the possible MEX values and check if Alice can achieve a higher MEX.

But that seems inefficient for the given constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the frequency of each `x` and determine how many of them Alice can include in `c`.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(freq[x]/2) instances of `x` in `c`, because for every two occurrences of `x`, Alice and Bob can each take one, and if freq[x] is odd, Alice gets the extra one.

So, for each `x`, Alice can include ceil(freq[x]/2) instances in `c`.

Then, to find the MEX, I need to find the smallest `x` such that ceil(freq[x]/2) == 0, meaning Alice cannot include any `x` in `c`.

Wait, but in the first example, freq[0]=2, ceil(2/2)=1; freq[1]=2, ceil(2/2)=1.

So, Alice can include 0 and 1 in `c`, so MEX is 2.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

freq[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

freq[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

freq[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

freq[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

So, Alice can include 0,1,2,3 in `c`, so MEX is 4.

But in the sample output, it's 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

But in the sample output, it's 1, but according to my earlier logic, Alice can include all of 0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4, but it's given as 1.

So, my earlier logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can only include ceil(freq[x]/2) elements in `c`, but the total number of elements she can add to `c` is ceil(n/2).

So, she has to choose which elements to include in `c`.

In the second test case, n=4, ceil(n/2)=2.

So, Alice can include 2 elements in `c`.

If she includes 0 and 1, then MEX is 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements in a way that forces Alice to include certain elements.

Wait, but in the second test case, if Alice includes any two distinct elements, the MEX would be the smallest missing integer.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(freq[x]/2) instances of `x` in `c`.

But in reality, she can include up to ceil(freq[x]/2) instances, but she is limited by the total number of elements she can add to `c`, which is ceil(n/2).

So, perhaps I need to prioritize including smaller `x` in `c` to maximize the MEX.

But in the second test case, with n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], ceil(n/2)=2.

Alice can include any two elements.

To maximize the MEX, she would include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Looking back at the problem, it says that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Given that, in the second test case, the output is 1, which suggests that Bob can force the MEX to be 1.

How is that possible?

Let's think about the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Alice starts.

Possible moves:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a=[], c=[0,2]

MEX is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob picks 3, a=[], c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

Wait, in this case, MEX is 0 because 0 is missing in c=[1,2].

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating MEX.

Wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in c.

So, for c=[0,2], MEX is 1.

For c=[1,2], MEX is 0.

So, in the first sequence, MEX is 1; in the second, MEX is 0.

So, the minimal MEX that Bob can achieve is 0.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the roles.

Wait, Alice wants to maximize the MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, in this game, Alice and Bob are playing optimally.

The final MEX is the one that results from both playing optimally.

Given that, in the second test case, the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob cannot prevent Alice from including both 0 and 1 in `c`.

Wait, in the first sequence, c=[0,2], MEX=1; in the second, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the minimal MEX that Bob can achieve is 0.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that `c` must contain distinct elements, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, actually, the problem allows multiple instances of the same number in `c`, but MEX is based on the unique elements in `c`.

Wait, no, MEX is defined based on the array `c`, not necessarily unique elements.

But in the first test case, c=[1,0], which has MEX=2.

In the second test case, c=[0,2], MEX=1; c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, in the second test case, the minimal MEX that Bob can achieve is 0, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Find game's final score if both players play optimally."

So, both players play optimally.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3].

Possible sequences:

1. Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

   Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

   Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

   Bob picks 3, a=[], c=[0,2]

   MEX=1

2. Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

   Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

   Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

   Bob picks 3, a=[], c=[1,2]

   MEX=0

3. Alice picks 2, a=[0,1,3], c=[2]

   Bob picks 0, a=[1,3], c=[2]

   Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[2,1]

   Bob picks 3, a=[], c=[2,1]

   MEX=0

4. Alice picks 3, a=[0,1,2], c=[3]

   Bob picks 0, a=[1,2], c=[3]

   Alice picks 1, a=[2], c=[3,1]

   Bob picks 2, a=[], c=[3,1]

   MEX=0

So, in sequences 2,3,4, MEX=0.

Only in sequence 1, MEX=1.

So, if both play optimally, Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would aim for MEX=0.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is based on the unique elements in `c`.

Wait, no, the problem says "the MEX of c", without specifying uniqueness.

But in the examples, duplicates are allowed in `c`.

Wait, in the first example, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

If c=[1,1], MEX=0.

Wait, no, in the first example, they have c=[1,0], which has MEX=2.

But if c=[1,1], MEX=0.

So, it seems that duplicates are allowed in `c`, and MEX is based on the unique elements present in `c`.

Wait, but in the first example, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

If c=[1,1], MEX=0.

So, perhaps MEX is based on the set of unique elements in `c`.

Assuming that, then in the second test case, c=[0,2], MEX=1; c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Bob can force MEX=0 by deleting 0, forcing Alice to have c=[1,2].

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is determined by the final `c`, and Bob can influence which elements are in `c` by deleting elements from `a`.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements that Alice would want to pick.

In the second test case, if Bob deletes 0 and 1, then c could be [2,3], MEX=0.

Wait, but freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1.

Bob can delete two elements, say 0 and 1.

Then, c=[2,3], MEX=0.

Alternatively, Bob can delete 2 and 3, then c
