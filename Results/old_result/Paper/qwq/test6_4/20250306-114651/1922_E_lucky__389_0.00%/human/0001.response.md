Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with length at most 200, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. Each test case has its own X, and there can be up to 1000 test cases.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the description, it's a sequence of numbers from the array that are in strictly increasing order, and the positions in the array are maintained. For example, in the array [1, 3, 2], the increasing subsequences are [], [1], [3], [2], [1,3], and [1,2]. So, there are 6 increasing subsequences in this case.

I also need to note that two subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions in the array, even if the elements are the same. For example, in [2,2], there are two different subsequences of [2], one for each position.

My task is to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences. If it's impossible, I should output -1.

Let me think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated. For a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be determined by considering all possible subsets of the array that are in increasing order.

But calculating this directly seems complicated, especially since X can be up to 10^18. So, I need a smarter way to construct the array to achieve exactly X increasing subsequences.

I recall that in binary representation, any number can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2. Maybe I can use this idea here.

Let's consider an array that is strictly increasing. For example, [1,2,3,4,...]. In this case, every subset is an increasing subsequence. The total number of subsets is 2^N, including the empty subsequence. So, for a strictly increasing array of length N, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

Wait, but in the problem, an empty subsequence is also considered increasing, as per the note. So, for a strictly increasing array of length N, there are 2^N increasing subsequences.

But in the problem, X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60. So, if I take N=60, 2^60 is 1.2e18, which is within the range. But the problem allows N up to 200, which is more than enough.

But the problem is that X can be any number up to 10^18, not just powers of 2. So, I need a way to combine arrays in such a way that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

I need to think about how to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2, since each power of 2 corresponds to a strictly increasing subarray of a certain length.

Wait, but X is up to 10^18, which is manageable with 60 bits in binary representation. But the problem allows N up to 200, which is more than enough.

Let me consider constructing an array that consists of multiple non-overlapping increasing subsequences, each of which contributes a certain number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, but in reality, the increasing subsequences can overlap in complex ways, so I need a better approach.

Maybe I can think of the array as consisting of "blocks", where each block is a decreasing subarray, and between blocks, the elements are increasing.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

I recall that in a single decreasing subarray, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of elements plus one (for the empty subsequence). Because in a decreasing subarray, the only increasing subsequences are the single elements and the empty subsequence.

Wait, let's verify that. Take [3,2,1]. The increasing subsequences are: [], [3], [2], [1]. So, indeed, 4 subsequences, which is N+1, where N=3.

Similarly, for [4,3,2,1], it would be 5 subsequences.

So, in general, a decreasing subarray of length N has N+1 increasing subsequences.

Now, if I have multiple decreasing blocks, say [3,2,1,4,5,6], then it's [3,2,1] and [4,5,6]. The total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each block.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see: in [3,2,1,4,5,6], the increasing subsequences can be formed by choosing any increasing subsequence from the first block and any from the second block, but since they are separated and the second block starts after the first, and the second block is increasing, it's more complicated.

Actually, I think the correct way is to consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each block, because the blocks are separated and the elements between blocks are ordered in a way that allows combining subsequences from different blocks.

Wait, but in the example [3,2,1,4,5,6], the increasing subsequences would be:

From the first block: [], [3], [2], [1]

From the second block: [], [4], [5], [6], [4,5], [4,6], [5,6], [4,5,6]

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is (4) * (8) = 32, but actually, it's not that simple because you can mix subsequences from different blocks if they are increasing.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me look for a way to represent X as a sum of certain values related to array structures.

I found that in an array that is strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

In an array that is strictly decreasing, it's N+1.

Maybe I can combine these properties to achieve any X.

Wait, but X can be any value up to 10^18, so I need a way to combine different structures to reach exactly X.

Let me consider representing X in binary. Each bit in the binary representation of X corresponds to a power of 2.

Now, if I can construct arrays where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly 2^k for some k, then by combining these arrays in a certain way, I can achieve any X.

But how do I combine them?

If I have two arrays A and B, and I concatenate them, and if there are no interactions between A and B that affect the increasing subsequences, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in A and B.

Wait, but in reality, concatenating two arrays allows for combining their subsequences, so the total number might not be simply the product.

Wait, perhaps if the second array starts with elements larger than any in the first array, then the increasing subsequences can be combined by taking any subsequence from the first and any from the second, and concatenating them.

In that case, the total number of increasing subsequences would be (number in A) * (number in B).

Because for each subsequence in A, I can append any subsequence in B to it, as long as the first element of B is greater than the last element of A.

So, if A is strictly increasing and B is strictly increasing, and all elements in B are greater than all in A, then the number of increasing subsequences in the concatenation is (2^N) * (2^M), where N and M are the lengths of A and B.

But this seems too restrictive, as I want to be able to represent any X, not just products of powers of 2.

Wait, maybe I need a way to add the number of subsequences, not multiply.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent X as a sum of certain values related to array structures.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a single element in the array. The number of increasing subsequences is 2 (the empty subsequence and the single element).

If I have two elements, a < b, then the number is 4: [], [a], [b], [a,b].

If a > b, then it's 3: [], [a], [b].

Wait, but in the problem, subsequences are different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

So, in [2,2], it's 4: [], [2], [2], [2,2]. But since positions matter, they are considered different.

Wait, but in my earlier example, [3,2,1,4,5,6], I think my initial assumption about the product is incorrect.

Maybe I need to consider the array as a sequence of elements where each element can be included or not in the subsequence, as long as it's increasing.

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a way to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct corresponding array parts for each power.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, if I have arrays with 2^k increasing subsequences, and I can concatenate them in a way that the total number is the product, then I can represent X as the product of these 2^k's.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 2^60 (which is about 1.2e18), so I would need at least 60 bits.

But the problem allows N up to 200, which is more than enough to represent X as a product of up to 200 powers of 2.

Wait, but actually, 2^60 is about 1.2e18, which is larger than 10^18, so N=60 would suffice for X=10^18.

But the problem allows N up to 200, which is more than sufficient.

But I need to ensure that the construction works for any X up to 10^18.

Let me think about how to construct such an array.

Suppose I represent X in binary. Let's say X is 13, which is 1101 in binary, which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

So, I need to construct an array that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

If I can construct arrays with 2^3=8, 2^2=4, and 2^0=1 increasing subsequences, and combine them in a way that the total is 8 + 4 + 1 = 13, that would work.

But earlier, I thought that concatenating arrays where each part is strictly increasing would result in the product of their subsequence counts, not the sum.

So, perhaps I need a different way to combine them.

Wait, maybe if I have multiple parts where each part is a decreasing subarray, and they are separated in such a way that subsequences cannot cross between parts, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the subsequences in each part.

Let me check this idea.

Take two decreasing subarrays: [3,2,1] and [6,5,4], with no interactions between them.

The number of increasing subsequences in [3,2,1] is 4 (N+1=3+1), and in [6,5,4] is 4.

If I concatenate them to [3,2,1,6,5,4], what are the increasing subsequences?

Well, since 6 > 1, I can have subsequences like [3,6], [2,6], [1,6], [3,5], etc.

Wait, that complicates things, because now there are more increasing subsequences that cross between the two parts.

So, my initial idea is flawed.

Perhaps I need to ensure that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple parts.

How can I achieve that?

If I make sure that in between parts, there are elements that are smaller than the previous parts, then it might prevent subsequences from crossing.

Wait, for example, if I have [3,2,1,-1,5,4,3,-2,...], where each part is decreasing and separated by smaller elements, perhaps that would prevent crossing.

Let me try.

Take [3,2,1,-1,5,4,3,-2].

In this array, any increasing subsequence cannot include elements from different decreasing blocks because the separating elements are smaller.

For example, from [3,2,1,-1,5,4,3,-2], the increasing subsequences would be from the first block [3,2,1,-1], which has 5 subsequences (N+1=4+1), and the second block [5,4,3,-2], which has another 5.

Total would be 10, which is the sum of the subsequences from each block.

Is that correct?

Wait, but in reality, you can have subsequences that include elements from different blocks if the later elements are larger than earlier ones.

For example, [1,-1,5] is an increasing subsequence.

So, again, my idea is not working.

This seems more complicated than I thought.

Let me try a different approach.

I recall that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for j in 0 to i-1 if a[j] < a[i])

The total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i.

But implementing this to construct the array is too time-consuming for large X.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the minimal array that achieves X increasing subsequences.

Given that N can be up to 200, which is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X to construct the array.

Let me think about X in binary.

Suppose X = 13, which is 1101 in binary, which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

I need to construct an array that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

If I can construct arrays with 2^k increasing subsequences and combine them appropriately, that might work.

But earlier attempts showed that concatenating arrays multiplies their subsequence counts, which isn't helpful for summing to X.

Wait, maybe I need to use a combination of increasing and decreasing parts.

Let me consider an array that is partially increasing and partially decreasing.

For example, [1,2,3,0].

The increasing subsequences are:

[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [1,2,0], [1,3,0], [2,3,0], [1,2,3,0].

Wait, that's 15 subsequences, which is 2^4 -1 +1 = 16, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

I found that in some problems, to achieve a specific count, you can use the binary representation to determine the structure.

Perhaps I can represent X as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is essentially its binary representation, and then construct corresponding array parts for each power.

Then, combine these parts in a way that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of the individual parts' contributions.

But earlier, I saw that concatenating parts might not give a sum, but a product.

Wait, maybe if I arrange the array so that the parts are independent, meaning that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple parts, then the total number would be the sum.

But in practice, it's hard to ensure that no subsequence spans across parts, especially if there are overlaps in values.

Perhaps I need to separate the parts with elements that are smaller than all previous parts, to prevent any increasing subsequence from crossing over.

Wait, let's try.

Suppose I have parts [3,2,1], [-10], [5,4,3], [-20], [7,6,5], etc.

Each decreasing part has N+1 subsequences.

But in reality, you can still have increasing subsequences that include the separating elements.

For example, [1, -10, 5] is increasing.

So, this approach won't work.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in a decreasing subarray of length N, the number of increasing subsequences is N+1.

In a strictly increasing subarray of length N, it's 2^N.

If I can arrange the array such that it has multiple decreasing blocks, separated in a way that no increasing subsequence can span across them, then the total number would be the sum of (N_i + 1) for each block.

But in practice, it's difficult to prevent spanning subsequences.

Alternatively, maybe I can arrange the array to have a specific tree-like structure, where subsequences don't overlap in certain ways.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, you can represent X as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and then construct corresponding array parts.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, X in binary is a sum of distinct powers of 2.

So, for X=13 (1101 in binary), it's 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

If I can construct arrays that contribute 2^3=8, 2^2=4, and 2^0=1 subsequences, and combine them in a way that the total is 13, that would work.

But how?

If I concatenate arrays where each part is a decreasing subarray, the total number would be the product of (N_i +1) for each block, which might not help.

Wait, perhaps if I arrange the array in a way that some parts are forced to be separate, I can control the total count.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider an array that starts with a strictly increasing sequence.

For example, [1,2,3,...,k].

This has 2^k increasing subsequences.

If I set k such that 2^k <= X < 2^{k+1}, then I can start with an array of length k, which gives 2^k subsequences, and then adjust with additional elements to reach exactly X.

But how do I adjust to reach exactly X?

I can remove some subsequences by adding elements in a specific way.

Wait, but removing subsequences might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can add elements in a way that introduces exactly the number of subsequences needed to reach X.

This sounds promising.

Let's think about it.

Suppose I have an array with k elements, strictly increasing, giving 2^k subsequences.

If I need exactly X subsequences, where X <= 2^k, I can try to add elements in a way that reduces the total number of subsequences to X.

But I need to reduce the number of subsequences by exactly 2^k - X.

How can I do that?

Perhaps by adding elements that are smaller than some existing elements, thereby breaking some of the increasing subsequences.

Wait, but it's not clear how to precisely control the number of subsequences removed.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, I construct a corresponding array part that contributes 2^b subsequences, where b is the bit position.

Then, by combining these parts appropriately, I can achieve the total of X subsequences.

But earlier attempts showed that concatenating parts multiplies their subsequence counts, which isn't helpful for summing to X.

Wait, unless I can arrange the parts so that their contributions add up, rather than multiply.

But I don't see a way to do that directly.

Perhaps I need to use a combination of increasing and decreasing parts.

Wait, maybe I can have a decreasing chain where I can control the number of subsequences more precisely.

Wait, in a decreasing chain of length N, there are N+1 increasing subsequences, as only single elements and the empty subsequence are increasing.

So, for example, [3,2,1] has 4 increasing subsequences: [], [3], [2], [1].

Similarly, [4,3,2,1] has 5.

So, if I have multiple decreasing chains with no interactions, the total number would be the product of (N_i +1) for each chain.

Wait, but earlier I saw that this isn't the case because subsequences can span across chains if there are elements that allow it.

So, this approach is flawed.

Let me consider a different strategy.

I recall that in binary, X can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.

So, if I can construct array parts that contribute exactly 2^b subsequences for various b, and combine them in a way that the total is X, that would work.

But again, concatenating such parts multiplies their subsequence counts, which isn't helpful for summing to X.

Wait, unless I can arrange the parts so that their contributions don't interfere.

But I don't see a straightforward way to do that.

Perhaps I need to look for a different mathematical approach.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is equal to the sum over all i of the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i.

If I can control the number of subsequences ending at each position, maybe I can achieve any X.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is related to the number of inversions or some other property, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have an array of length N, and I add an element at the end.

The number of new increasing subsequences ending with the new element is equal to the number of elements before it that are less than it, plus one (for the empty subsequence).

Wait, actually, the number of increasing subsequences ending with the new element is equal to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by taking any subsequence that ends with an element less than the new element and appending the new element to it, plus the new element itself.

This sounds like dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j < i if a[j] < a[i]) + 1.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences is sum(dp[i] for all i).

This is similar to the standard dynamic programming approach for counting the number of increasing subsequences.

But using this to construct the array seems too time-consuming, especially for large X.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for X=1, the empty subsequence is already included, so I need at least one element in the array to make the total number of increasing subsequences equal to 1, but actually, with N=0, which is not allowed since N >=1.

Wait, but N=0 is not allowed, as the array must have at least one element.

Wait, but according to the problem, N can be at least 1.

Wait, no, the problem says "the array of integers of length at most 200", but it doesn't specify a minimum length, but in the example, N=1 is used.

So, N can be 0, but in the problem, the array must have at least one element, I think.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the array of integers of length at most 200", but it doesn't specify a minimum length.

But in the example, N=1 is used.

Wait, in the first example, N=1.

So, N can be 1.

But in the problem statement, it says "the array of integers of length at most 200", but it doesn't say if N can be 0.

Probably N >=1.

But in programming, often arrays can be empty, but here, since it's "at most 200", and positive integers, I'll assume N >=1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "a positive integer n", which implies n >=1.

So, N >=1.

Alright.

So, I need to find N >=1, N <=200, and an array of N integers, such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, and N=60 would suffice for a strictly increasing array, but N can be up to 200, which is more than enough.

But I need a general way to construct the array for any X.

Let me consider that for a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

So, for X=2^k, I can just have a strictly increasing array of length k.

But X can be any value up to 10^18, so I need to represent X as a sum of distinct 2^k's, which is its binary representation.

But as I thought earlier, concatenating parts with 2^k subsequences would multiply their counts, not sum them.

Wait, unless I can arrange the parts so that their contributions add up.

Perhaps if I have multiple decreasing blocks, each contributing N_i +1 subsequences, and arrange them in a way that no increasing subsequence can span across blocks, then the total number would be the sum of the individual contributions.

But in practice, it's hard to prevent spanning subsequences.

Wait, maybe if I separate the blocks with elements that are smaller than all previous elements and all following elements, it might help.

For example, [3,2,1,-10,5,4,3,-20,7,6,5], where each decreasing block is separated by elements that are smaller than any in the previous or following blocks.

In this case, any increasing subsequence can only be within one block, because any element from a separator would break the increasing property.

Wait, but in this arrangement, you can still have subsequences that include the separator and elements from the next block.

For example, [-10,5], which is increasing.

So, this approach still allows subsequences to span across blocks.

This is problematic.

I need a way to completely isolate the blocks so that no increasing subsequence can span across them.

Alternatively, maybe I can arrange the array in a way that the only increasing subsequences are within each block, and no subsequences can cross blocks.

But I don't see a straightforward way to do that.

Perhaps I need to accept that constructing such an array is not feasible for arbitrary X, and output -1 in such cases.

But the problem says "If there are several answers, you can print any of them", implying that at least one solution exists for the given X.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "your task is to find an array ... such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or report that there is no such array."

So, it's possible that for some X, no such array exists.

But in the example, for X=2,3,5,13,37, there are solutions.

Wait, but in the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists for the given X, or you can output -1.

But in practice, I need to determine whether a solution exists or not.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider that for any X >=1, there exists an array with N <=200 that achieves exactly X increasing subsequences.

Given that N can be up to 200, which allows for up to 2^200 increasing subsequences, which is way larger than 10^18, it's plausible that a solution exists for any X up to 10^18.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, for X=1, the only way is to have an empty array, but N >=1, so perhaps X=1 is impossible.

Wait, but with N=1, the array has two increasing subsequences: [] and [a1].

So, for X=1, it's impossible because the smallest N=1 gives 2 subsequences.

Wait, but X starts from 2 in the problem, so X=1 is not an issue.

Given that X >=2, and N >=1, with N <=200, it's likely that a solution exists for any X up to 10^18.

So, perhaps I can focus on constructing the array for any given X, without worrying about impossibility.

Now, how to construct such an array.

Let me consider representing X in binary.

For example, X=13 is 1101 in binary, which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

So, I need to construct parts that contribute 8, 4, and 1 subsequences, and combine them in a way that the total is 13.

If I can arrange the parts so that their contributions add up, rather than multiply, that would work.

But as I thought earlier, concatenating parts multiplies their contributions.

Wait, unless I can arrange the parts to be completely separate, with no possible increasing subsequence spanning across them.

Perhaps if I arrange the parts in a way that any subsequence spanning across them is not increasing, by making the separator elements smaller than all previous and following elements.

For example, [3,2,1,-10,5,4,3,-20,7,6,5].

In this array, the blocks are [3,2,1], [-10], [5,4,3], [-20], [7,6,5].

But as I saw earlier, subsequences like [-10,5] are still increasing, so this doesn't fully separate the blocks.

This approach isn't working.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with a strictly increasing array of length K, which gives 2^K increasing subsequences.

If X is a power of 2, say X=2^K, then I can just set N=K and make the array strictly increasing.

But X can be any value up to 10^18, so I need a way to adjust K to make 2^K =X.

But X isn't necessarily a power of 2.

So, perhaps I need to set K such that 2^K >=X, and then adjust the array to remove the excess subsequences.

But removing subsequences precisely to reach X seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that a decreasing array of length N has N+1 increasing subsequences.

So, for example, for X=5, I can have a decreasing array of length 4, which has 5 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, for X=13, I can have a decreasing array of length 12, which has 13 increasing subsequences.

Wait, but a decreasing array of length N has N+1 increasing subsequences, which is linear in N, but X can be up to 10^18, which would require N up to 10^18, but N is at most 200.

So, this approach isn't feasible for large X.

Wait, but N=200 would only give 201 increasing subsequences for a decreasing array, which is far less than 10^18.

So, this approach only works for small X.

Hence, it's not useful for large X.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that in a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

If I can have N=60, which is within 200, then 2^60 is about 1.2e18, which covers up to X=1e18.

But I need to handle any X up to 1e18, not just powers of 2.

So, perhaps I can start with a strictly increasing array of length K, where 2^K >=X, and then modify the array to reduce the number of increasing subsequences to exactly X.

But how?

One way is to introduce elements that break some of the increasing subsequences.

For example, by adding elements that are smaller than some previous elements, thereby invalidating some subsequences.

But controlling exactly how many subsequences are removed is tricky.

Perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or some other combinatorial identity to achieve this.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, I construct a corresponding array part that contributes 2^b subsequences, and arrange these parts in a way that their contributions add up to X.

But as before, concatenating parts multiplies their contributions, which isn't helpful for summing to X.

Wait, unless I can arrange the parts so that their contributions don't interfere.

Perhaps if I arrange the parts in a way that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple parts, their contributions would add up.

But in practice, it's difficult to prevent spanning subsequences.

Alternatively, maybe I can arrange the parts in a tree-like structure, where each part is a child of another, but this seems too complicated.

I need a simpler way.

Let me consider that for X=2, I can have an array of length 1, with any integer, say [0].

Then, the increasing subsequences are [] and [0], totaling 2.

Similarly, for X=4, I can have [0,1], which has [], [0], [1], [0,1], totaling 4.

For X=5, perhaps [0,1,-1], which has:

[], [0], [1], [0,1], [-1], [0,-1], [1,-1].

Wait, that's 7 subsequences, which is more than 5.

I need exactly 5.

Alternatively, [0,1,0], which has:

[], [0], [1], [0,1], [0], [0,0], [1,0].

Wait, positions matter, so [0] appears twice, but as different subsequences.

So, it's 6 subsequences, still not 5.

This isn't working.

Let me try [0,0].

Subsequences are:

[], [0], [0], [0,0].

So, 4 subsequences.

Still not 5.

Wait, perhaps [0,1,-1].

Subsequences:

[], [0], [1], [0,1], [-1], [0,-1], [1,-1].

That's 7 subsequences.

Not equal to 5.

I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a decreasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is N+1.

So, for X=5, I can have a decreasing array of length 4, like [4,3,2,1], which has 5 increasing subsequences: [], [4], [3], [2], [1].

Yes, that works for X=5.

Similarly, for X=13, I can have a decreasing array of length 12, but that would require N=12, which is within 200.

But earlier, I saw that for X=13, the answer provided is an array of length 5: [2,2,3,4,2].

Let me check how many increasing subsequences this array has.

Possible increasing subsequences:

[], [2], [2], [3], [4], [2], [2,3], [2,4], [2,4], [2,3], [2,4], [2,3,4], [2,3,4], [2,4], [2,3,4].

Wait, considering positions, there are multiple [2]'s.

Let's label them as [2_a], [2_b], [2_c], [3], [4].

Then, the increasing subsequences are:

[], [2_a], [2_b], [2_c], [3], [4], [2_a,3], [2_a,4], [2_b,3], [2_b,4], [2_c,3], [2_c,4], [2_a,3,4], [2_b,3,4], [2_c,3,4].

So, that's 15 subsequences, which is more than 13.

But in the example, it's given as a solution for X=13.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the example, for X=13, the array is [2,2,3,4,2].

Let's list all possible increasing subsequences:

1. []

2. [2] (first 2)

3. [2] (second 2)

4. [3]

5. [4]

6. [2,3] (first 2 and 3)

7. [2,4] (first 2 and 4)

8. [2,3] (second 2 and 3)

9. [2,4] (second 2 and 4)

10. [3,4]

11. [2,3,4] (first 2, 3, 4)

12. [2,3,4] (second 2, 3, 4)

13. [2,3,4] (first 2, 3, 4) - wait, is this duplicated?

Wait, perhaps some subsequences are being double-counted.

But according to the problem, subsequences are different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

So, in this case, there are multiple [2]'s, and each can be part of different subsequences.

But in the example, it's claimed that this array has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps the answer provided is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe the number of increasing subsequences is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of increasing subsequences is calculated as the number of unique sequences, regardless of the positions.

But the problem states that subsequences are different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

So, in this case, [2] from the first position and [2] from the second position are considered different.

Similarly, [2,3] where 2 is from the first position and [2,3] where 2 is from the second position are considered different.

So, in the array [2,2,3,4,2], there are:

- []: 1

- Single elements: 5

- Pairs: [2,3], [2,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4], [2,3], [2,4]: 7

- Triples: [2,3,4], [2,3,4], [2,3,4]: 3

Total: 1 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 16, but the example claims it's 13.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different positions in the array, they are considered different."

So, in this array [2,2,3,4,2], the subsequence [2,3,4] can be formed in multiple ways:

1. First 2, 3, 4

2. Second 2, 3, 4

3. First 2, 3, fourth 2 (but fourth 2 is less than 4, so [2,3,2] is not increasing)

So, only two valid [2,3,4] subsequences.

Similarly, for pairs:

- [2,3]: first 2 and 3, second 2 and 3

- [2,4]: first 2 and 4, second 2 and 4

- [3,4]: 3 and 4

So, total subsequences:

- []: 1

- Single elements: 5

- Pairs: 4 ([2,3] x2, [2,4] x2)

- Triples: 2 ([2,3,4] x2)

Total: 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12

But the example claims 13 for this array.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Looking back, maybe [2,4] using first 2 and fourth 2 is not increasing, since fourth 2 is less than or equal to the first 2.

Wait, no, positions must be increasing, so fourth 2 comes after first 2, but the value is not greater, so [2,2] is not strictly increasing.

Therefore, only [2,3] and [2,4] where the second element is greater than the first.

So, [2,3] x2, [2,4] x2, [3,4] x1.

And triples: [2,3,4] x2.

Total: 1 (empty) + 5 (single) + 4 (pairs) + 2 (triples) = 12.

But the example shows 13, so perhaps I'm missing one.

Wait, maybe [2,3,4] using the second 2 and 3 and 4 is only one, since positions are different but elements are the same.

But according to the problem, different positions are considered different subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the pairs.

Wait, [2,3]: first 2 and 3, second 2 and 3: 2 subsequences.

[2,4]: first 2 and 4, second 2 and 4: 2 subsequences.

[3,4]: one subsequence.

Total pairs: 4 + triples: 2 + single:5 + empty:1 =12.

Wait, perhaps [2] from the first position, [2] from the second, and [2] from the fourth are all considered different, totaling 3 [2]'s.

Wait, but I already counted all 5 single elements.

Wait, maybe I missed a subsequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Given that the example claims 13 for this array, and I'm getting 12, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, maybe [2,4] using first 2 and fourth 2 is invalid, but perhaps [2,3,4] using first 2, third 3, fourth 2 is invalid, so only one [2,3,4].

Wait, no, positions must be strictly increasing, so positions 1,3,4: [2,3,4], positions 2,3,4: [2,3,4].

Only these two.

Total: 1 +5 +4 +2=12.

Hmm.

Perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe the number of increasing subsequences is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the subsequence [2,3,4] using positions 1,3,4 is valid, and [2,3,4] using positions 2,3,4 is valid, and no other [2,3,4].

So, total: 1 +5 +4 +2=12.

But the example claims 13.

Wait, perhaps there is a [2,4] using first 2 and fourth 2, but that's not increasing since 2 is not less than 2.

So, only [2,3] x2 and [2,4] x2, but actually, [2,4] is only valid if 4 > 2, which it is, but positions are increasing.

Wait, positions 1 and 4: [2,4], positions 2 and 4: [2,4].

Both are valid increasing subsequences.

So, total pairs: 4.

Triples: 2.

Total: 12.

I'm still getting 12, but the example shows 13.

Wait, perhaps there is an error in the example.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider all possible combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that constructing the array is possible and focus on implementing the algorithm as per the given code.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func_1():

x = int(input())

x -=1

subseq_lens = []

mx =0

while x !=0:

i=0

while 2**(i+1)<=x+1:

i +=1

if i ==0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i)

x -=2**i -1

mx = max(mx,i)

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1,len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

print(len(ansv))

for i in range(len(ansv)):

print(ansv[i],end=' ')

print()

So, it seems that the code first subtracts 1 from X, then represents X-1 in a certain way, decomposing it into a sum of 2^i -1 for various i.

Then, it constructs an array based on these i's.

Wait, let's see.

First, x -=1.

Then, in the loop, it finds the largest i such that 2^{i+1} <= x+1.

Then, it appends i to subseq_lens, subtracts 2^i -1 from x, and repeats.

Finally, it constructs the array by first creating a strictly increasing sequence of length mx, and then appending some elements based on sub
