Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find an array of length n such that exactly k of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of an array a is obtained by taking the elements starting from the x-th position and then wrapping around to the beginning. For example, if n=4 and x=2, the cyclic shift would be [a2, a3, a4, a1].

A sorted array is one where each element is less than or equal to the next element. So, for a given cyclic shift, I need to check if it satisfies a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an.

My task is to create an array where exactly k out of the n possible cyclic shifts are sorted.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2

The array [1,1] is given, and both cyclic shifts are [1,1] and [1,1], both of which are sorted.

In the second test case:

n=3, k=1

The array [69420, 69, 420] is given, and only one of the three cyclic shifts is sorted.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=2

It's impossible to have exactly two sorted cyclic shifts, hence the output is -1.

So, I need to find a general way to construct such arrays for given n and k, or determine when it's impossible.

Let me think about the properties of the array that would make exactly k cyclic shifts sorted.

First, if k = n, that means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. What would that imply about the array?

If all cyclic shifts are sorted, then the array must be constant, i.e., all elements are equal. Because if any two elements are different, say ai < aj for some i and j, then in some cyclic shift, aj would come before ai, making that shift unsorted.

Wait, no. Actually, if the array is strictly increasing, all shifts would be sorted except those that wrap around and have a smaller element following a larger one.

Wait, no. If the array is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3], then the cyclic shifts are [1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2]. Only the first one is sorted, since [2,3,1] has 3 > 1, and [3,1,2] has 3 > 1.

So, for k = n, the array must be constant. That makes sense because if any element is different, some shift will not be sorted.

Similarly, for k = 1, perhaps there's a specific arrangement where only one cyclic shift is sorted.

Looking back at the second test case, [69420, 69, 420], only one shift is sorted.

Let me check:

- [69420, 69, 420]: 69420 > 69, so not sorted.

- [69, 420, 69420]: 69 ≤ 420 ≤ 69420, so sorted.

- [420, 69420, 69]: 420 ≤ 69420 but 69420 > 69, so not sorted.

Hence, only one sorted shift.

Is there a pattern here?

Perhaps for k=1, an array where the elements are in increasing order except for one wrap-around that makes it unsorted.

Wait, but in the example, [69420,69,420], it's not strictly increasing, but one shift is sorted.

Alternatively, maybe for k=1, the array can be arranged in a way that only the original sorted order is sorted, and all other shifts are not.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider the number of sorted cyclic shifts for a given array.

Suppose I have an array a1, a2, ..., an.

A cyclic shift by x positions is sorted if and only if the sequence ax, ax+1, ..., an, a1, ..., ax-1 is sorted.

I need exactly k such shifts.

Let me think about the minimal element in the array.

In a sorted array, the minimal element is at the first position.

In a cyclically sorted array, the minimal element is at some position, and the array is sorted from that point onwards.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of local minima or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of rotations in sorted arrays.

I recall that in a rotated sorted array, there is a unique rotation point where the array wraps around.

But in this problem, I need exactly k sorted shifts, which might correspond to k rotation points or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as being sorted in a circular manner.

In a circular array, there can be multiple segments where the array is sorted.

I need to find an arrangement where exactly k starting points lead to a sorted sequence when traversed circularly.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider small values of n and see what's possible.

For n=1:

- Only one shift, which is the array itself. So, k=1 is always possible. Any single element array is sorted.

For n=2:

- If k=1: [2,1]. Shifts are [2,1] (not sorted) and [1,2] (sorted). So, only one sorted shift.

- If k=2: [1,1]. Both shifts are [1,1], which are sorted.

So, for n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

For n=3:

- If k=1: [3,1,2]. Shifts are [3,1,2] (not sorted), [1,2,3] (sorted), [2,3,1] (not sorted). So, only one sorted shift.

- If k=2: Is it possible? Let's try [1,2,3]. Shifts are [1,2,3] (sorted), [2,3,1] (not sorted), [3,1,2] (not sorted). Only one sorted shift.

- [1,3,2]: Shifts are [1,3,2] (not sorted), [3,2,1] (not sorted), [2,1,3] (not sorted). No sorted shifts.

- [2,1,3]: Shifts are [2,1,3] (not sorted), [1,3,2] (not sorted), [3,2,1] (not sorted). No sorted shifts.

- [2,3,1]: Shifts are [2,3,1] (not sorted), [3,1,2] (not sorted), [1,2,3] (sorted). Only one sorted shift.

- [3,1,2]: Shifts are [3,1,2] (not sorted), [1,2,3] (sorted), [2,3,1] (not sorted). Only one sorted shift.

- [3,2,1]: Shifts are [3,2,1] (not sorted), [2,1,3] (not sorted), [1,3,2] (not sorted). No sorted shifts.

So, for n=3, k=1 is possible, k=2 is not possible, and k=3 is only possible if all elements are equal.

Wait, for n=3, k=3 would require [a,a,a], which is sorted in all shifts.

So, for n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible, but k=2 is not.

Similarly, for n=4:

- k=1: [4,1,2,3]. Shifts:

  - [4,1,2,3] (not sorted)

  - [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

  - [2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

  - [3,4,1,2] (not sorted)

  Only one sorted shift.

- k=2: Is it possible? Let's try [1,2,4,3]. Shifts:

  - [1,2,4,3] (sorted except 4 > 3)

  - [2,4,3,1] (4 > 3, 3 < 1)

  - [4,3,1,2] (4 > 3, 1 < 2)

  - [3,1,2,4] (3 > 1, 2 < 4)

  No shifts are fully sorted.

- [1,3,2,4]: Shifts:

  - [1,3,2,4] (3 > 2)

  - [3,2,4,1] (3 > 2, 4 > 1)

  - [2,4,1,3] (2 < 4, 1 < 3)

  - [4,1,3,2] (4 > 1, 3 < 2)

  Only [2,4,1,3] is not fully sorted.

Wait, no. For [1,3,2,4]:

- [1,3,2,4]: 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 2 > 4 → not sorted

- [3,2,4,1]: 3 > 2 ≤ 4 > 1 → not sorted

- [2,4,1,3]: 2 ≤ 4 ≥ 1 ≤ 3 → not sorted

- [4,1,3,2]: 4 > 1 ≤ 3 ≥ 2 → not sorted

So, no sorted shifts.

Is there any array for n=4 and k=2?

Let's try [1,2,3,4]: All shifts are sorted only if the shift is [1,2,3,4], which is one shift.

- [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1] (4 > 1)

- [3,4,1,2] (4 > 1)

- [4,1,2,3] (4 > 1)

Only one sorted shift.

- [1,2,4,3]: Shifts:

  - [1,2,4,3] (4 > 3)

  - [2,4,3,1] (4 > 3, 3 < 1)

  - [4,3,1,2] (4 > 3, 1 < 2)

  - [3,1,2,4] (3 > 1, 2 < 4)

  No sorted shifts.

- [1,3,2,4]: As above, one shift is sorted.

- [2,1,3,4]: Shifts:

  - [2,1,3,4] (2 > 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 4)

  - [1,3,4,2] (1 ≤ 3 ≤ 4 ≥ 2)

  - [3,4,2,1] (3 ≤ 4 ≥ 2 < 1)

  - [4,2,1,3] (4 > 2 ≥ 1 ≤ 3)

  Only [1,3,4,2] is sorted.

  Wait, is [1,3,4,2] sorted? 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 4 ≥ 2 → No, because 4 > 2.

  So, no sorted shifts.

Seems like for n=4, k=2 is not possible.

Wait, maybe [1,1,2,2]:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (1 ≤ 2 ≤ 2 ≥ 1 → not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (2 ≤ 2 ≥ 1 ≤ 1 → not sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (2 ≥ 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 2 → not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Hmm.

Is there any array for n=4 and k=2? It seems not.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=4, only [a,a,a,a] works.

So, for n=4, k=1 and k=4 are possible, but k=2 and k=3 are not.

Wait, for k=3, let's see.

Is there an array where three out of four cyclic shifts are sorted?

Suppose we have [1,1,1,2]:

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,1] (1 ≤ 1 ≤ 2 ≥ 1 → not sorted)

- [1,2,1,1] (1 ≤ 2 ≥ 1 ≤ 1 → not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1] (2 ≥ 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 1 → not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another attempt: [1,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,1] (2 ≤ 3 ≤ 3 ≥ 1 → not sorted)

- [3,3,1,2] (3 ≤ 3 ≥ 1 ≤ 2 → not sorted)

- [3,1,2,3] (3 ≥ 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3 → not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Seems like for n=4, k=3 is impossible.

So, for n=4, only k=1 and k=4 are possible.

Is there a pattern here?

It seems that for any n, k=1 and k=n are possible, but other values of k are not possible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

For n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible.

For n=4, k=1 and k=4 are possible.

So, perhaps, in general, for any n, k=1 and k=n are possible, and no other values of k are possible, except possibly k=0, but k=0 isn't allowed since k >=1.

Wait, but for n=1, k=1 is the only possibility.

For n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

For n=3, only k=1 and k=3 are possible.

For n=4, only k=1 and k=4 are possible.

So, it seems that for n >=2, only k=1 and k=n are possible.

But in the problem's example, for n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible, and for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=3, k=1 is possible, and for n=3, k=2 is impossible, and for n=3, k=3 is possible only if all elements are equal.

So, in general, for any n, only k=1 and k=n are possible.

Wait, but for n=1, only k=1 is possible.

For n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

For n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible.

For n=4, k=1 and k=4 are possible.

So, it seems that for any n, k=1 and k=n are possible, and no other values of k are possible.

Therefore, in the program, for k=1 and k=n, we can construct such arrays, and for other values of k, it's impossible.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())

res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]

print(*res)

So, for k == n, it outputs an array of all 1's, which is correct because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.

For k == 1, it outputs range(n), which is [0,1,2,...,n-1], but is this correct?

Wait, in the example for n=3, k=1, the output is [69420,69,420], which is not in increasing order, but one of its shifts is sorted.

So, perhaps for k=1, we need an array that is sorted in a way that only one cyclic shift is sorted.

But the program uses range(n), which is [0,1,2,...,n-1]. For n=3, this would be [0,1,2]. But all shifts of this array are:

- [0,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,0] (1 ≤ 2 ≤ 0 → not sorted)

- [2,0,1] (2 ≥ 0 ≤ 1 → not sorted)

So, only one sorted shift, which is correct.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1, [0,1] would have shifts [0,1] (sorted) and [1,0] (not sorted), which is correct.

But for k=1, is there any n where this doesn't hold?

Wait, for n=1, k=1, [0] is sorted, which is correct.

For n=4, k=1, [0,1,2,3] would have only one sorted shift, which is [0,1,2,3], and the other shifts would not be sorted.

So, seems correct.

For k=n, outputting all elements equal is correct, as all shifts will be sorted.

For other values of k, it outputs [-1], which is correct because those cases are impossible.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, for k=1, the output is [69420,69,420], which is not the same as range(n). But both are valid as long as only one shift is sorted.

So, the program outputs range(n) for k=1, which is valid, but not the only possible solution.

But since the problem says "if there are multiple solutions, print any of them," it's acceptable.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See the explanation above.}} \]
