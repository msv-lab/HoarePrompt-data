Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n x n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, each cell represented by its coordinates (x, y), where x and y are both between 1 and n inclusive.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these n cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. It's essentially the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between two points. So, in a grid, it's the total number of blocks you'd have to walk if you can only move horizontally and vertically.

Now, I need to choose n cells such that the number of unique distances between any two cells is as large as possible. So, I need to maximize the size of the set of these distances.

Looking at the examples provided:

For n=2:

- Cells: (1,1) and (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- Unique distances: {0,1}

- Size: 2

For n=3:

- Cells: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances: various calculations leading to unique distances {0,1,2,3}

- Size: 4

For n=4, n=5, and n=6, similar arrangements are given with increasing grid sizes.

From these examples, it seems like there's a pattern in choosing the cells to maximize the number of unique distances.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t -= 1

n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n + 1):

print('1', end=' ')

print(i)

print(' ')

This code reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads n and then prints n cells where all cells have x=1 and y ranging from 1 to n.

So, for n=2, it would print:

1 1

1 2

For n=3:

1 1

1 2

1 3

And so on.

Now, I need to determine if this approach maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze this.

In this arrangement, all chosen cells are in the first row (x=1), and their y-coordinates range from 1 to n.

So, for any two cells (1, y1) and (1, y2), the Manhattan distance is |1-1| + |y1 - y2| = 0 + |y1 - y2| = |y1 - y2|.

Therefore, all distances between these cells are simply the absolute differences in their y-coordinates.

Given that y coordinates range from 1 to n, the possible distances are 0, 1, 2, ..., up to n-1.

But wait, distance 0 occurs for a cell to itself, which is always included since it's the distance of a cell to itself.

So, the unique distances would be 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, which totals to n distinct distances.

Wait, but in the first example with n=2, the unique distances are {0,1}, which is n=2.

In the second example with n=3, the unique distances are {0,1,2,3}, which is n+1=4.

Hmm, that doesn't match up.

Wait, in n=3, distances should be 0,1,2 according to my earlier reasoning, but in the example, it's {0,1,2,3}.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second example, the cells chosen are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).

Let's calculate the distances:

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, unique distances: {0,1,2,3}

Wait, so in this case, the maximum distance is 3, which is n=3.

But according to my earlier arrangement where all cells are in the first row, for n=3, distances would be 0,1,2.

But in the example, they have distances up to 3.

Wait, so perhaps my arrangement is missing some potential distances.

Wait, in the example for n=3, they have a distance of 3, which is achieved by the cells (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.

In my arrangement, the maximum distance would be n-1=2.

So, in my arrangement, for n=3, distances are 0,1,2.

But in the example, they have an additional distance of 3.

Wait, but n=3, the maximum possible Manhattan distance in a 3x3 grid is 4, from (1,1) to (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.

But in their arrangement, they have distances up to 3, but not 4.

Wait, perhaps their arrangement is not achieving the maximum possible unique distances either.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me think about the maximum possible unique Manhattan distances for a given n.

The Manhattan distance can range from 0 up to 2(n-1), since in the largest grid, from one corner to the opposite corner, the distance is |1 - n| + |1 - n| = 2(n-1).

But in our selection of n cells, we need to choose cells such that the set of distances between them is as diverse as possible.

So, perhaps selecting cells in a way that they are spread out to cover more possible distances.

Looking back at the code, it selects all cells in the first row, which limits the distances to 0 through n-1.

But in the example for n=3, they have distances up to 3, which is greater than n-1=2.

So, their arrangement achieves more unique distances.

Therefore, the code's approach is not optimal.

Wait, but in the example for n=3, they have 4 unique distances: {0,1,2,3}.

If n=3, the maximum possible unique distances would be how many?

Well, in a 3x3 grid, the possible distances are 0,1,2,3,4.

But with only 3 cells, we can't achieve all possible distances, but we can maximize the number of unique distances with the chosen cells.

In the example, they achieve 4 unique distances, which seems better than the code's approach which achieves only 3 unique distances (0,1,2).

Hence, the code's approach is suboptimal.

So, perhaps I need to find a better way to select the cells.

Looking at the examples provided in the problem statement:

For n=2: cells (1,1) and (1,2), unique distances {0,1}

For n=3: cells (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), unique distances {0,1,2,3}

For n=4: cells (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), unique distances {0,1,2,3,4,5}

For n=5: cells (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5), unique distances {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

For n=6: cells (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1), unique distances {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

So, in each case, they are selecting cells in a way that the unique distances include a range of values, not just from 0 to n-1.

Hence, the code's approach is indeed incorrect because it doesn't maximize the number of unique distances.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
