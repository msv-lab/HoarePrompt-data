Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command in the string, I need to output the product of the current array elements modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking. I have to process each command in order, output the product modulo m each time, and then modify the array by removing an element from the left or right accordingly. After each command, the array gets smaller by one element, and finally, it will be empty after all commands are processed.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient because the constraints are quite large. The number of test cases can be up to 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases can be up to 2*10^5. So, I need an O(n) solution per test case to pass within reasonable time limits.

Let me think about how to compute the product modulo m efficiently. If I were to compute the product naively each time by multiplying all remaining elements and then taking modulo m, it would be O(n^2), which is too slow for the given constraints. So, I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo m as I remove elements from either end.

One efficient way to handle this is to keep track of the product as I remove elements. I can start with the full product of the array modulo m and then, for each command, divide the product by the element being removed (considering modulo m), and update the product accordingly.

Wait, but division under modulo m is not straightforward, especially if m is not a prime number. I need to be careful with how I handle the division under modulo m. If m is not prime, I can't always compute the modular inverse. So, maybe there's another way.

Another approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m. For example, compute the product of elements from the start up to each position and from the end up to each position, all modulo m. Then, for each command, depending on whether it's 'L' or 'R', I can determine which part of the array is still remaining and compute the product accordingly.

But I need to think carefully about how the commands affect the remaining array. Each 'L' command removes the leftmost element, and each 'R' command removes the rightmost element. So, the order of removals is determined by the string s.

This seems similar to maintaining a deque or a queue where elements are removed from the front or back based on the commands.

Let me consider the example provided to see if I can find a pattern.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

Processing:

1. Output product of [3,1,4,2] mod 6: 3*1*4*2 = 24 mod 6 = 0

   Then, s[0] = 'L', remove leftmost element 3 -> a = [1,4,2]

2. Output product of [1,4,2] mod 6: 1*4*2 = 8 mod 6 = 2

   s[1] = 'R', remove rightmost element 2 -> a = [1,4]

3. Output product of [1,4] mod 6: 1*4 = 4 mod 6 = 4

   s[2] = 'R', remove rightmost element 4 -> a = [1]

4. Output product of [1] mod 6: 1 mod 6 = 1

   s[3] = 'L', remove leftmost element 1 -> a = []

So, the output is 0 2 4 1

I need to generate this sequence for each test case efficiently.

Now, thinking about how to implement this efficiently, maybe I can iterate from the end of the string s, keeping track of the current product modulo m, and update it based on whether I'm adding an element back or removing one.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let's think differently.

Suppose I process the commands in reverse order, starting from the end of s, and keep track of the current product. But I need to handle the removals accordingly.

Actually, perhaps a better approach is to maintain a window of the current array elements and update the product as I remove elements from either end.

But maintaining a product of a dynamic set of elements sounds tricky. Maybe using logarithms for multiplication, but that would introduce precision errors, which isn't acceptable for integer modulo operations.

Another idea: Since I'm removing elements from either end, the remaining array is always a subarray that is a suffix or a prefix, depending on the sequence of removals.

Wait, no, it's more complex than that because 'L' and 'R' commands interleave, so the remaining array isn't necessarily a contiguous subarray.

Wait, actually, yes, it is. Because we're only removing from the left or right, the remaining array is always a contiguous subarray.

For example, starting with [3,1,4,2]

After 'L': remove 3, remaining [1,4,2]

After 'R': remove 2, remaining [1,4]

After 'R': remove 4, remaining [1]

After 'L': remove 1, remaining []

So, the remaining array is always a contiguous subarray.

Therefore, I can think of the remaining array as being defined by a left and right pointer.

Initially, left = 0, right = n-1

For each 'L' command, left +=1

For each 'R' command, right -=1

And at each step, I need to compute the product of a[left..right] modulo m.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I can precompute prefix products modulo m.

Let me define prefix[i] = a[0]*a[1]*...*a[i] mod m

And suffix[i] = a[n-1]*a[n-2]*...*a[i] mod m

Then, the product of a[left..right] can be computed as prefix[right] * inverse(prefix[left-1]) mod m, assuming left > 0.

But again, this involves division under modulo m, which requires computing inverses, and that's only possible if the element has an inverse modulo m, i.e., if it's coprime with m.

But in this problem, m can be any positive integer, not necessarily prime, so elements may not have inverses.

I need a different approach that avoids division under modulo m.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I start with the full product modulo m, and then, for each step, I divide by the element being removed and multiply by its inverse, if it exists. But again, inverses may not exist.

Alternatively, I can keep track of the product and update it by multiplying by the inverse of the removed element, but again, inverses may not exist.

This seems problematic.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the product and the removed elements separately and compute the product of the remaining elements each time.

But that still seems inefficient.

Let me look at the sample input and output again to see if there's a pattern I can exploit.

Sample Input:

4

4 6

3 1 4 2

LRRL

5 1

1 1 1 1 1

LLLLL

6 8

1 2 3 4 5 6

RLLLRR

1 10000

10000

R

Sample Output:

0 2 4 1

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 4 4 4

0

Looking at the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s=LRRL

Output: 0 2 4 1

As explained earlier.

Second test case:

n=5, m=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1], s=LLLLL

Output: 0 0 0 0 0

Since any product modulo 1 is 0.

Third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s=RLLLRR

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

Let's see:

Initial product: 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720 mod 8 = 0

s[0]='R', remove rightmost element 6, a=[1,2,3,4,5], product=1*2*3*4*5=120 mod 8=0

s[1]='L', remove leftmost element 1, a=[2,3,4,5], product=2*3*4*5=120 mod 8=0

s[2]='L', remove leftmost element 2, a=[3,4,5], product=3*4*5=60 mod 8=4

s[3]='L', remove leftmost element 3, a=[4,5], product=4*5=20 mod 8=4

s[4]='R', remove rightmost element 5, a=[4], product=4 mod 8=4

s[5]='R', remove rightmost element 4, a=[]

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

Fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000, a=[10000], s=R

Output: 0

Since 10000 mod 10000=0

So, in all cases, the output is a sequence of product modulo m at each step.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this sequence for each test case.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the commands are given in a string s, and I need to process them in order, I can simulate the process step by step.

But simulating each step naively would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute the product modulo m in O(1) or O(log n) time per step.

Given that m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, perhaps I can find a way to handle the product updates efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of the entire array modulo m, and then, for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But again, division under modulo m requires inverses, which may not exist.

Alternative idea: Instead of dividing, I can keep track of the product and the removed elements separately, and compute the product of the remaining elements using inclusion-exclusion or some other method.

But that seems complicated and inefficient.

Let me think differently.

Since m can be up to 10^4, which is small, perhaps I can factorize m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems overkill and may not necessarily solve the division problem.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m by keeping track of the exponents of the prime factors in m.

But this is getting too complicated for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that since m can be factored into its prime factors, and the product of the array elements modulo m can be computed by computing the product modulo each prime power in m's factorization and then combining them.

But again, this seems too involved for this problem.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product of the array, and then, for each removal, multiply the product by the inverse of the removed element modulo m, but only if the removed element is coprime with m.

But if it's not coprime, then I can't compute the inverse, and I need to handle that case differently.

This seems messy.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I precompute the product of all elements in the array modulo m.

Then, for each 'L' command, I remove the leftmost element, which means I need to divide the current product by that element and take modulo m.

Similarly, for 'R' command, I remove the rightmost element and divide the product by that element modulo m.

But again, division under modulo m requires inverses, which may not exist.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the product and the greatest common divisor (GCD) with m, and adjust accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product modulo m/gcd(m, removed_element).

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the properties of modulo operation.

If I have product = (old_product * inverse(removed_element) ) mod m, but inverse may not exist.

Alternatively, I can write product = (old_product / removed_element) mod m.

But division under modulo m is tricky.

An alternative approach is to keep track of the product and the removed elements, and compute the product of the remaining elements each time.

But this seems inefficient for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can use logarithms to convert multiplication to addition, but that would introduce floating-point precision issues, which is not acceptable for integer operations.

Another idea: Since m can be up to 10^4, which is small, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m by keeping a list of exponents for each prime factor of m.

But again, this seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each step, I need to compute the product of a subarray defined by the current left and right pointers.

If I can find a way to compute this product modulo m in O(1) time per step, that would be ideal.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute prefix products and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, compute the product as prefix[right] * suffix[left] mod m.

But this is similar to my earlier idea, which still involves division under modulo m.

Wait, no, actually, prefix[right] already includes the product up to a[right], and suffix[left] includes the product from a[left] onwards.

But in this case, prefix and suffix would overlap, and I need to adjust for the overlapping part.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I process the commands in reverse order, starting from the end of s, and build up the product step by step.

Wait, that might be a better approach.

Let me try that.

If I start from the last command and work backwards, I can build the array step by step by adding elements to either end.

In other words, starting from an empty array, I can add elements to the left or right based on the commands in reverse order.

Then, for each step, I can compute the product of the current array.

But I need to compute the product modulo m efficiently.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have a current product p, which is the product of the current array modulo m.

Initially, the array is empty, so the product is 1 (the multiplicative identity).

Then, as I add elements to either end, I multiply p by the new element modulo m.

But in the original problem, we are removing elements from either end and need to compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the full product divided by the product of removed elements.

Let me define:

Let full_product = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[n-1] mod m

Then, for each sequence of removals, the remaining product is full_product divided by the product of all removed elements so far, modulo m.

But again, division under modulo m is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of removed elements and compute the inverse of that product modulo m, then multiply it with the full_product to get the remaining product.

But this again requires computing inverses, which may not exist.

I need to find a way around this.

Let me consider that m can be factored into its prime factors, and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved and time-consuming for the time constraints.

Is there a simpler way?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the commands from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the current product, and updating it by multiplying by the element added at each step.

But I need to map the elements to their positions based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I count the number of 'L' commands before each 'R' command and vice versa.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Let me think about the positions of the elements that are removed at each step.

I can simulate the process using a deque or a double-ended queue, where I can remove elements from either end based on the commands.

But simulating this would take O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable since the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

But I need to compute the product modulo m at each step efficiently.

So, perhaps I can maintain the current product modulo m, and update it accordingly as I remove elements.

Wait, but as I remove elements, I need to divide the product by the removed element, which again brings me back to the division under modulo m problem.

Is there a way to handle this without computing inverses?

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and the removed elements separately, and compute the product divided by the product of removed elements using some mathematical properties.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that m is up to 10^4, which is small, so perhaps I can compute the product modulo m directly without division.

But I need a way to handle the division efficiently.

Another idea: Since m is small, I can store the exponents of each prime factor in m and keep track of them separately.

Then, for each step, I can update the exponents accordingly and compute the product modulo m from the exponents.

But this seems complicated and may not be efficient enough.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the factorization of m and handle each prime power separately.

Then, for each prime power, I can compute the product of the array elements modulo that prime power, and keep track of the exponents.

Finally, combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me look back at the sample input and output again.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s=LRRL

Output: 0 2 4 1

As we saw earlier.

In the second test case:

n=5, m=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1], s=LLLLL

Output: 0 0 0 0 0

Since any product modulo 1 is 0.

In the third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s=RLLLRR

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

And in the fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000, a=[10000], s=R

Output: 0

Since 10000 mod 10000 = 0

So, in all cases, the output is the product of the remaining array elements modulo m at each step.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this sequence for each test case.

Let me consider that m can be up to 10^4, which is small, so perhaps I can handle the product modulo m directly without division.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it by multiplying by the inverse of the removed element, but only if the removed element is coprime with m.

If it's not coprime, then I need to handle it differently.

But this seems error-prone and complicated.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, so it can have multiple prime factors.

Handling inverses only when they exist might lead to incorrect results.

I need a way to handle all cases correctly without relying on inverses.

Another idea: Since the array elements are up to 10^4 and m is up to 10^4, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m step by step, keeping track of the current product and updating it based on the removed elements.

But again, I run into the division problem.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, determine which elements are still in the array and compute the product accordingly.

But this seems too slow if not done efficiently.

Let me think about the number of 'L' and 'R' commands.

Let's say there are l 'L' commands and r 'R' commands, with l + r = n.

After processing all 'L' commands, the remaining array is a[l:], and after processing 'R' commands, it's a[l: n - r].

Wait, no, it's more complicated because 'L' and 'R' commands are interleaved.

I need a way to track which elements are removed at each step and compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to compute the product modulo m for each step, and the constraints are such that an O(n) per test case solution is expected.

So, perhaps there's a way to compute the product incrementally as I remove elements.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the commands from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the current product and updating it by multiplying by the element added at each step.

But I need to map the elements to their positions based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands defines a specific order in which elements are removed.

So, perhaps I can determine the order in which elements are removed and compute the product accordingly.

Wait, actually, I can find the order in which elements are removed by simulating the process.

For example, in the first test case:

s = "LRRL"

Step 1: 'L', remove leftmost element 3, remaining [1,4,2]

Step 2: 'R', remove rightmost element 2, remaining [1,4]

Step 3: 'R', remove rightmost element 4, remaining [1]

Step 4: 'L', remove leftmost element 1, remaining []

So, the order of removal is: 3,2,4,1

At each step, the product is:

Step 1: 3*1*4*2 mod 6 = 24 mod 6 = 0

Step 2: 1*4*2 mod 6 = 8 mod 6 = 2

Step 3: 1*4 mod 6 = 4 mod 6 = 4

Step 4: 1 mod 6 = 1

So, output is 0 2 4 1

Similarly, in the third test case:

s = "RLLLRR"

Order of removal:

First 'R', remove rightmost element 6, remaining [1,2,3,4,5]

Then 'L', remove leftmost element 1, remaining [2,3,4,5]

Then 'L', remove leftmost element 2, remaining [3,4,5]

Then 'L', remove leftmost element 3, remaining [4,5]

Then 'R', remove rightmost element 5, remaining [4]

Then 'R', remove rightmost element 4, remaining []

So, order of removal: 6,1,2,3,5,4

Products:

Step 1: 1*2*3*4*5*6 mod 8 = 720 mod 8 = 0

Step 2: 1*2*3*4*5 mod 8 = 120 mod 8 = 0

Step 3: 2*3*4*5 mod 8 = 120 mod 8 = 0

Step 4: 3*4*5 mod 8 = 60 mod 8 = 4

Step 5: 3*4 mod 8 = 12 mod 8 = 4

Step 6: 4 mod 8 = 4

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

So, perhaps I can determine the order of removal based on the commands and then compute the product at each step accordingly.

But I need an efficient way to determine the order of removal.

Wait, perhaps I can use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end, and move them according to the 'L' and 'R' commands.

For example, in the first test case:

s = "LRRL"

Initialize left=0, right=3

Step 1: 'L', remove a[left]=3, left+=1 -> left=1, right=3

Step 2: 'R', remove a[right]=2, right-=1 -> left=1, right=2

Step 3: 'R', remove a[right]=4, right-=1 -> left=1, right=1

Step 4: 'L', remove a[left]=1, left+=1 -> left=2, right=1

Now, left > right, array is empty.

So, the order of removal is 3,2,4,1, which matches the earlier observation.

Similarly, in the third test case:

s = "RLLLRR"

Initialize left=0, right=5

Step 1: 'R', remove a[right]=6, right-=1 -> left=0, right=4

Step 2: 'L', remove a[left]=1, left+=1 -> left=1, right=4

Step 3: 'L', remove a[left]=2, left+=1 -> left=2, right=4

Step 4: 'L', remove a[left]=3, left+=1 -> left=3, right=4

Step 5: 'R', remove a[right]=5, right-=1 -> left=3, right=3

Step 6: 'R', remove a[right]=4, right-=1 -> left=3, right=2

Now, left > right, array is empty.

Order of removal: 6,1,2,3,5,4, which matches the earlier observation.

So, I can simulate the process using two pointers, left and right, and remove elements accordingly.

At each step, I need to compute the product of a[left..right] modulo m.

But how can I compute this product efficiently without recomputing it from scratch each time?

One way is to keep track of the current product and update it based on the element being removed.

Wait, but removing an element changes the product in a way that requires division by that element, which brings us back to the division under modulo m problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m and use them to compute the product of a[left..right] efficiently.

Let me define:

prefix[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i] mod m

suffix[i] = a[n-1] * a[n-2] * ... * a[i] mod m

Then, the product of a[left..right] can be computed as:

(prefix[right] * inverse(prefix[left-1])) mod m, for left > 0

Similarly, for left = 0, it's prefix[right]

But again, this requires computing inverses, which may not exist.

This seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of a[left..right] as prefix[right] * inverse(suffix[left]) mod m

But suffix[left] is a[left] * a[left+1] * ... * a[n-1] mod m

So, inverse(suffix[left]) would be the inverse of that product, which again requires that suffix[left] has an inverse modulo m, which may not be the case.

This seems too risky.

Let me consider that m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, so it can have multiple prime factors, and computing inverses may not always be possible.

I need a different approach.

Another idea: Since m is small, I can iterate through all test cases and compute the product for each step directly, without trying to optimize it further.

But given that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and for each step, I need to compute the product of up to 2*10^5 elements, this would be too slow.

I need a way to compute the product modulo m in O(1) or O(log n) time per step.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the factorial of the array elements and use that to compute the product of any subarray.

But factorials may not help here, and computing factorials modulo m would still require division, which brings us back to the same problem.

Let me consider that in programming contests, when division under modulo m is needed, and m is not prime, one common approach is to factorize m into its prime factors, compute the product modulo each prime power, and then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved for this problem, and the time constraints may not allow it.

I need a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps I can handle the cases where m is 1 separately, since any product modulo 1 is 0.

And for m > 1, I can try to compute the product modulo m without division.

But I still need an efficient way to update the product as elements are removed.

Another idea: Since the array elements are up to 10^4, and m is up to 10^4, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m by keeping track of the exponents of each prime factor in m.

Then, for each step, I can update the exponents accordingly and compute the product modulo m from the exponents.

But this seems too complicated and time-consuming.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, an O(n) per test case solution should be acceptable.

Given that, perhaps I can accept that computing the product at each step naively is too slow, and look for a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the full product modulo m, and then, for each removal, multiply the full product by the inverse of the removed element, but only if the removed element is coprime with m.

If it's not coprime, then I need to handle it differently.

But this seems error-prone.

Let me consider that in programming contests, sometimes problems are designed such that m is a prime number, but in this problem, m can be any positive integer, so it's more general and challenging.

I need to find a way to handle division under modulo m without computing inverses.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements directly without dividing.

But I need to find a way to update the product efficiently as elements are removed.

Let me consider that for each 'L' command, I remove the leftmost element, which is a[left], and for 'R' command, I remove the rightmost element, which is a[right].

So, if I can keep track of the product of a[left..right] modulo m, I can output that before removing the appropriate element.

But how to compute a[left..right] efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the commands in reverse order, starting from the last command, and build up the array and the product step by step.

Then, for each step, I can compute the product of the current array.

But I need to map the elements to their positions based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

This seems complicated, but maybe it's manageable.

Let me try to formalize this approach.

Initialize an empty array.

Iterate through the commands from the end to the beginning.

For each command:

- If it's 'L', add the corresponding element to the left of the array.

- If it's 'R', add the corresponding element to the right of the array.

At each step, compute the product of the current array modulo m.

Then, the sequence of products computed in reverse order will be the desired output.

Wait, but I need to map the elements to their positions based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can use two pointers to keep track of where to insert the elements.

Let me try with the first test case:

s = "LRRL"

Reverse s: "LRRD"

Wait, s is "LRRL", reverse is "LRRD", but since we're adding elements in reverse order, I need to handle it carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a deque.

Let me try to simulate this.

Initialize an empty deque.

Iterate through s from the end to the beginning:

s[3] = 'L', add a[0] to the left of the deque.

s[2] = 'R', add a[1] to the right of the deque.

s[1] = 'R', add a[2] to the right of the deque.

s[0] = 'L', add a[3] to the left of the deque.

So, after all additions, the deque is: a[3], a[0], a[1], a[2]

Which is [1,3,1,4]

Wait, but in the original array, a = [3,1,4,2]

This doesn't match the original array, so this approach seems flawed.

Perhaps I need a different way to map the elements to their positions based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

This seems too complicated, and I'm not making progress.

Let me consider that the problem might expect a different approach.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to implement an efficient solution, but I need to verify if it's correct.

Let me analyze the provided program step by step.

The function func() is defined to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases t from input.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read the array a.

- Read the string t.

- Count the number of 'L's in t and store it in l.

- Initialize some variables: k, q1, q2, y.

- y is initialized as a list of n zeros.

- Determine the initial value of k based on the last command.

- If the last command is 'L', set k = a[l-1] % m, set q1 = l-2, q2 = l

- Else, set k = a[l] % m, set q1 = l-1, q2 = l+1

- Set y[-1] = k

- Then, iterate from n-2 down to 0:

- If t[i] == 'R', k = k * a[q2] % m, q2 +=1

- Else, k = k * a[q1] % m, q1 -=1

- Set y[i] = k

- Finally, print the list y as space-separated integers.

I need to understand what this code is doing.

It seems to be computing the product of the remaining array elements modulo m for each step, but I need to verify if it's doing it correctly.

Looking at the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], t="LRRL"

l = t.count('L') = 2

So, l=2

Initialize k, q1, q2, y

y = [0,0,0,0]

t[-1] = 'L', so k = a[2-1] = a[1] =1 %6=1

q1 = 2-2=0

q2 =2

y[3] =1

Then, i=2:

t[2]='R', so k =1 * a[2] %6=1*4=4%6=4, q2=3

y[2]=4

i=1:

t[1]='R', k=4* a[3] %6=4*2=8%6=2, q2=4

y[1]=2

i=0:

t[0]='L', k=2* a[0] %6=2*3=6%6=0, q1=-1

y[0]=0

So, y=[0,2,4,1], which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for the second test case:

n=5, m=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1], t="LLLLL"

l=5

k = a[5-1]=a[4]=1%1=0

q1=5-2=3

q2=5

y[4]=0

i=3:

t[3]='L', k=0*a[3]=0*1=0%1=0, q1=2

y[3]=0

i=2:

t[2]='L', k=0*a[2]=0*1=0%1=0, q1=1

y[2]=0

i=1:

t[1]='L', k=0*a[1]=0*1=0%1=0, q1=0

y[1]=0

i=0:

t[0]='L', k=0*a[0]=0*1=0%1=0, q1=-1

y[0]=0

So, y=[0,0,0,0,0], matching the sample output.

Third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], t="RLLLRR"

l=t.count('L')=3

t[-1]='R', so k=a[3] %8=4%8=4

q1=3-1=2

q2=3+1=4

y[5]=4

i=4:

t[4]='R', k=4*a[4]=4*5=20%8=4, q2=5

y[4]=4

i=3:

t[3]='L', k=4*a[2]=4*3=12%8=4, q1=1

y[3]=4

i=2:

t[2]='L', k=4*a[1]=4*2=8%8=0, q1=0

y[2]=0

i=1:

t[1]='L', k=0*a[0]=0*1=0%8=0, q1=-1

y[1]=0

i=0:

t[0]='R', k=0*a[5]=0*6=0%8=0, q2=6

y[0]=0

So, y=[0,0,0,4,4,4], matching the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000, a=[10000], t="R"

l=0

t[-1]='R', so k=a[0] %10000=10000%10000=0

q1=-1

q2=1

y[0]=0

Which matches the sample output.

So, in all sample test cases, the program produces the correct output.

Now, I need to verify if this program is correct in general.

Looking at the logic:

- It counts the number of 'L's in t and stores it in l.

- Depending on the last command:

- If it's 'L', it sets k to a[l-1] % m, q1 to l-2, q2 to l

- If it's 'R', it sets k to a[l] % m, q1 to l-1, q2 to l+1

- Then, it initializes y[-1] = k

- Then, iterates from n-2 down to 0:

- If t[i] == 'R', multiplies k by a[q2] % m and increments q2

- Else, multiplies k by a[q1] % m and decrements q1

- Sets y[i] = k

I need to understand why this works.

It seems to be building the product of the remaining array elements in reverse order.

The variable k represents the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

By starting from the last command and building up k accordingly, it seems to correctly compute the product for each step.

The choice of initial k based on the last command seems to handle the base case correctly, as shown in the sample test cases.

The variables q1 and q2 are used to track the indices of the array elements to be included in the product based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

Overall, the program seems to implement an efficient and correct solution to the problem, as it produces the correct output for the sample inputs and follows a logical approach to compute the product of the remaining array elements modulo m for each command.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}} \]
