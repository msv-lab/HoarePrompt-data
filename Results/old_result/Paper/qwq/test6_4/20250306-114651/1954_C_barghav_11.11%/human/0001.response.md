Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, both of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after these swaps.

First, I need to understand what swapping digits means in this context. For example, if x is 73 and y is 31, swapping the first digits would make x=33 and y=71, and swapping the second digits would make x=71 and y=33. The example shows that swapping the second digits gives a higher product: 71 * 33 = 2343, compared to 73 * 31 = 2263. So, swapping can indeed increase the product.

Now, I need a general strategy to maximize the product of x and y by swapping digits at the same positions. Since multiplication is involved, I should think about how each digit contributes to the overall product.

One approach is to consider that in multiplication, higher place values have more significant impact on the product. So, for each position, I should decide whether swapping that position's digits would lead to a higher product.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I can think in terms of greedy algorithms, where at each step, I make the locally optimal choice, hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.

Let me consider the digits from the most significant (leftmost) to the least significant (rightmost). For each position, I can choose whether to swap or not, based on which choice maximizes the product up to that point.

Wait, but multiplication isn't just about adding up digits; it's about multiplying them in their respective place values. This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or a mathematical property that can help simplify this.

Let me think about the properties of multiplication. One thing I recall is that for two numbers with the same digit sum, the product is maximized when the numbers are as close to each other as possible. But in this problem, the digit sums might change based on swapping, so that might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to sort the digits in a certain manner to maximize the product.

Wait, maybe I should consider the sorted versions of x and y. If I sort the digits of x and y independently and then pair them in a certain way, maybe that would help.

Actually, there's a concept in mathematics called the rearrangement inequality, which says that for two sequences, the sum of their products is maximized when both sequences are ordered in the same order (both ascending or both descending).

But in this problem, I'm dealing with multiplication of two numbers, not sum of products. However, perhaps a similar idea can be applied.

Let me think differently. Since x and y have the same length, and I can swap their digits at each position independently, I can consider each position separately.

For each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap. I need to make this choice for each position to maximize the product of the two numbers.

But considering all possible combinations would be exponential in the number of digits, which is not feasible for large inputs.

So, I need a smarter way to decide for each position whether to swap or not.

Maybe I can consider the impact of swapping on the overall product.

Let me consider two digits, a and b, at the same position in x and y. If I swap them, x becomes with b in that position, and y becomes with a in that position.

I need to compare the product before and after the swap.

Let me denote the rest of the number (without this position) as x' and y'.

So, before swap:

product = (x' * 10 + a) * (y' * 10 + b)

After swap:

product = (x' * 10 + b) * (y' * 10 + a)

I need to see under what conditions the swap increases the product.

Let me compute the difference between the two products:

difference = (x' * 10 + b) * (y' * 10 + a) - (x' * 10 + a) * (y' * 10 + b)

Expanding both terms:

First term: x' * y' * 100 + x' * a * 10 + y' * b * 10 + a * b

Second term: x' * y' * 100 + x' * b * 10 + y' * a * 10 + a * b

Difference: (x' * a * 10 + y' * b * 10 + a * b) - (x' * b * 10 + y' * a * 10 + a * b) = x' * a * 10 - x' * b * 10 + y' * b * 10 - y' * a * 10 = 10 * (x' * (a - b) + y' * (b - a)) = 10 * (x' - y') * (a - b)

So, difference = 10 * (x' - y') * (a - b)

Therefore, the swap increases the product if and only if difference > 0, which is equivalent to 10 * (x' - y') * (a - b) > 0

Since 10 is positive, this simplifies to (x' - y') * (a - b) > 0

This means that swapping is beneficial if (x' > y' and a > b) or (x' < y' and a < b)

In other words, if the current prefix of x is greater than that of y, and a > b, or if the current prefix of x is less than that of y, and a < b, then swapping is beneficial.

Wait, but this seems a bit too involved, especially since x' and y' change as I move from left to right.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that for the most significant digit, I want the larger digit to be in the number that will benefit more from it.

But again, this seems vague.

Perhaps I can think of sorting the digits in each position and deciding based on that.

Wait, maybe I can iterate from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, and at each position, decide whether to swap or not, based on the current state of x and y.

But keeping track of the exact values of x' and y' at each step might not be efficient, especially since the numbers can be up to 100 digits long.

I need a more efficient approach.

Looking back at the difference formula: difference = 10 * (x' - y') * (a - b)

I can see that the sign of the difference depends on the sign of (x' - y') * (a - b)

If x' > y' and a > b, then (x' - y') > 0 and (a - b) > 0, so difference > 0, meaning swap increases the product.

Similarly, if x' < y' and a < b, then (x' - y') < 0 and (a - b) < 0, so difference > 0, meaning swap increases the product.

In other cases, swap decreases the product.

So, based on this, I can decide for each position whether to swap or not.

But the problem is that x' and y' change as I move from left to right.

Wait, perhaps I can process the digits from left to right, making decisions based on the current prefixes.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize x' and y' as empty strings.

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

Consider the current digits a = x[i], b = y[i]

If x' > y' and a > b, or x' < y' and a < b, then swap them.

Otherwise, keep them as they are.

Then, append the chosen digits to x' and y'.

Proceed to the next position.

This seems like a reasonable greedy approach.

Let me test this logic with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

73

31

Initialize x' and y' as empty.

First position (most significant digit):

x' = '' (0), y' = '' (0)

a = 7, b = 3

Since x' = y', neither condition is met, so don't swap.

So, x' += '7', y' += '3'

Now, x' = '7', y' = '3'

Second position:

a = 3, b = 1

x' = '7' (7), y' = '3' (3)

7 > 3 and 3 > 1? 7 > 3 is true, but 3 > 1 is also true, so swap.

So, x' += '1', y' += '3'

Thus, x = '71', y = '33'

Product: 71 * 33 = 2343

Without any swaps, 73 * 31 = 2263, which is less.

So, this seems correct.

Another sample input:

2

5

Initialize x' and y' as empty.

First position:

x' = '', y' = ''

a = 2, b = 5

x' = y', so don't swap.

x' += '2', y' += '5'

x' = '2', y' = '5'

Second position:

a = '', b = '' (since both have only one digit)

But wait, this is a single-digit input. Maybe I need to handle it differently.

Wait, the input specifies that x and y have the same length, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

So, in this case, x = 2, y = 5.

Since they have the same length, which is 1.

So, position 0:

x' = '' (0), y' = '' (0)

a = 2, b = 5

x' = y', so don't swap.

So, x' += '2', y' += '5'

Thus, x = '2', y = '5'

Product: 2 * 5 = 10

If I swap, x = '5', y = '2', product is 5 * 2 = 10, same as before.

So, no need to swap.

But in the sample output, it's 5 and 2.

So, swapping was done, but the product is the same.

Maybe in cases where products are equal, any arrangement is acceptable.

Or perhaps the problem allows swapping even if it doesn't increase the product.

But according to the problem statement, "maximize the product ... If there are multiple answers, print any of them."

So, in this case, both (2,5) and (5,2) have the same product, so either is acceptable.

Thus, the approach seems correct.

Another sample input:

3516

3982

Let's apply the approach.

Initialize x' and y' as empty.

First position:

x' = '', y' = ''

a = 3, b = 3

x' = y', so don't swap.

x' += '3', y' += '3'

x' = '3', y' = '3'

Second position:

a = 5, b = 9

x' = '3' (3), y' = '3' (3)

x' = y', so don't swap.

x' += '5', y' += '9'

x' = '35', y' = '39'

Third position:

a = 1, b = 8

x' = '35' (35), y' = '39' (39)

35 < 39 and 1 < 8, so swap.

x' += '8', y' += '1'

x' = '358', y' = '391'

Fourth position:

a = 6, b = 2

x' = '358' (358), y' = '391' (391)

358 < 391 and 6 > 2, so don't swap.

x' += '2', y' += '6'

x' = '3582', y' = '3916'

But the sample output is:

3912

3586

Hmm, which is different from my result of 3582 and 3916.

Let me check the products:

3582 * 3916 = 14,050,752

3912 * 3586 = 14,050,752

So, both arrangements give the same product.

Perhaps there are multiple ways to arrange the digits to achieve the maximum product.

The problem says, "If there are multiple answers, print any of them."

So, both are acceptable.

Thus, my approach seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, in the third position, according to my earlier rule, since x' = 35 < y' = 39, and a = 1 < b = 8, so swap.

Then, x' becomes '358', y' becomes '391'.

In the fourth position, x' = 358 < y' = 391, and a = 6 > b = 2, so don't swap.

Thus, x = '3582', y = '3916'

But the sample output is x = '3912', y = '3586'

Wait, that's different.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after swapping at some positions, the prefixes change, and thus the decisions for subsequent positions change.

Wait, no, in my approach, I'm making decisions based on the current prefixes.

In the first position, x'='' , y''='', so don't swap.

In the second position, x'='3', y'='3', so don't swap.

In the third position, x'='35', y'='39', so swap.

In the fourth position, x'='358', y'='391', so don't swap.

Thus, x='3582', y='3916'

But in the sample output, x='3912', y='3586'

How did they get that?

Wait, perhaps they swapped different positions.

Let me see.

If I swap the first position:

x='3516' becomes '3916', y='3982' becomes '3582'

Then, swap the third position:

x='3916' becomes '3986', y='3582' becomes '3512'

Wait, but this doesn't match the sample output.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe their approach is different.

But since both arrangements give the same product, and the problem allows any of them, my approach is still valid.

Thus, I can proceed with this logic.

Now, to implement this in code.

Given that the numbers can be up to 100 digits, it's efficient to handle them as strings.

So, read x and y as strings.

Then, iterate from the first digit to the last.

At each position, compare the current prefixes of x and y, and decide whether to swap the current digits based on the conditions.

Wait, but comparing prefixes at each step can be time-consuming if done naively.

To optimize, I can keep track of the comparison result of the prefixes.

Initialize a variable, say, comparison_result.

At the beginning, since both prefixes are empty, consider x' == y'.

Then, for each position:

- Compare x'[0:i] and y'[0:i]

- If x'[0:i] > y'[0:i], set comparison_result to >0

- If x'[0:i] < y'[0:i], set comparison_result to <0

- If equal, set to 0

- Then, decide whether to swap based on comparison_result and the current digits

But this can be optimized.

Actually, at each step, the comparison_result can be updated based on the previous comparison and the current digits.

For example, if in the previous step, x'[0:i-1] > y'[0:i-1], and the i-th digits are being compared.

If the i-th digits are equal, then x'[0:i] == y'[0:i]

If the i-th digit of x is greater than that of y, then x'[0:i] > y'[0:i], and so on.

This way, I can avoid repeated string comparisons.

So, I can initialize comparison_result = 0

Then, for each position i from 0 to n-1:

if comparison_result == 0:

if a[i] > b[i]:

comparison_result = 1

elif a[i] < b[i]:

comparison_result = -1

else:

comparison_result remains 0

elif comparison_result > 0:

if a[i] > b[i]:

comparison_result remains >0

elif a[i] < b[i]:

comparison_result could change, but since we've already have x' > y', and a[i] < b[i], perhaps x'[0:i] still > y'[0:i]?

Wait, no, if x'[0:i-1] > y'[0:i-1], and a[i] < b[i], then x'[0:i] might be less than y'[0:i], depending on the magnitudes.

This seems complicated.

Maybe it's better to compare the prefixes numerically at each step, but that could be inefficient for very large numbers.

Alternatively, since the numbers are represented as strings, I can keep track of whether x' > y' based on the lexicographical comparison of the strings up to position i.

In Python, strings can be compared directly.

So, at each step, compare x'[0:i] and y'[0:i], and decide based on that.

But for efficiency, especially with large strings, I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the comparison results for all prefixes.

But that still seems inefficient.

Maybe I can find a smarter way to decide for each position whether to swap or not, without repeatedly comparing the prefixes.

Let me consider that the prefixes are being built step by step, and at each step, I can decide based on the current state.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the digits in each position, considering the impact on the overall product.

But I'm going in circles here.

Maybe I should look at the reference solution or think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that to maximize the product, I should maximize the sum of x and y, since if x + y is larger, x * y might be larger.

But that's not necessarily true, because for a fixed sum, the product is maximized when x and y are as close as possible.

But in this problem, I can adjust the digits to make x and y as desired.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of digit pairing.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two digits, a and b, and I need to decide which one goes to x and which to y.

I need to assign a and b to x and y in a way that maximizes the product.

Given that multiplication is commutative, but in this case, the position matters because of the place value.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the place value.

Let me denote the place values as p from the highest to the lowest.

So, p decreases from left to right.

For each position, I have two digits, a and b, and I need to assign one to x and one to y.

I need to maximize the product (sum over a*p in x and b*p in y).

Wait, no, it's (sum of a*p in x) multiplied by (sum of b*p in y).

This is a multiplication, not a sum.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can model this as an optimization problem, but that might not be feasible for large inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for higher place values, I should assign higher digits to the number that is already larger.

Wait, that might not be precise.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix x and try to maximize y, or vice versa.

But since they are interdependent, that might not work.

Wait, perhaps I can consider sorting the digits in each position and assigning them accordingly.

But that doesn't make much sense.

Let me consider another approach.

Since I can swap digits at the same positions between x and y any number of times, I can think of assigning each pair of digits (a_i, b_i) to positions in x and y.

Wait, no, the swaps are positional, meaning I can only swap the i-th digits of x and y.

I cannot move digits to different positions.

So, for each position i, I can choose to swap x_i and y_i or not.

Thus, for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

To maximize the product, I need to make these choices optimally.

Given that the decisions are independent for each position, perhaps I can make a local decision for each position based on the current state of x and y prefixes.

Earlier, I derived that swapping at position i is beneficial if (x' > y' and a_i > b_i) or (x' < y' and a_i < b_i), where x' and y' are the prefixes up to position i-1.

This seems like a good heuristic.

To implement this, I need to keep track of the comparison of the prefixes up to the current position.

I can iterate from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, keeping track of whether x is greater than, less than, or equal to y based on the digits seen so far.

At each step, I can decide whether to swap the current digits based on the current comparison and the values of the digits.

This should work efficiently, as it only requires simple comparisons at each step.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

Define a function func_1() to handle each test case.

Read x and y as strings.

Initialize an empty list for the chosen digits of x and y.

Initialize a variable to keep track of the comparison of the prefixes, say, comp = 0

Iterate over each position from 0 to n-1:

if comp == 0:

if x[i] > y[i]:

don't swap

comp = 1 if x[i] > y[i] else -1 if x[i] < y[i] else 0

elif comp > 0:

if x[i] > y[i]:

don't swap

else:

swap

elif comp < 0:

if x[i] < y[i]:

don't swap

else:

swap

Append the chosen digits to the respective lists.

After processing all positions, join the lists into strings and print them.

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seemed to work.

Let me code this.

But looking back at the given program, it seems different.

In the given program:

def func_1():

a = list(input())

b = list(input())

for i in range(len(a)):

if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:

n = min(a[i], b[i])

m = max(a[i], b[i])

a[i] = m

b[i] = n

else:

n = min(a[i], b[i])

m = max(a[i], b[i])

a[i] = n

b[i] = m

for i in range(len(a)):

print(a[i], end='')

print()

for i in range(len(b)):

print(b[i], end='')

print()

So, it's dividing the digits into two halves.

For the first half (positions from 0 to len(a)//2 - 1), it sets a[i] to the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and b[i] to the minimum.

For the second half, it sets a[i] to the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and b[i] to the maximum.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, for the first half of the digits (more significant digits), it assigns the larger digit to x and the smaller to y.

For the second half, it does the opposite: assigns the smaller digit to x and the larger to y.

This seems like a different approach.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Considering that in the first half (more significant digits), assigning larger digits to x and smaller to y would make x larger and y smaller.

In the second half (less significant digits), assigning smaller digits to x and larger to y would make x smaller and y larger.

But the effect on the product isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to balance the sums of the digits in x and y.

But since multiplication is not commutative in the same way as addition, this might not lead to the maximum product.

However, in the sample input, this approach seems to work.

For example:

First sample input:

x=73, y=31

len(a)=2, len(a)//2 -1 =0

So, for i=0:

n=min(7,3)=3, m=max(7,3)=7

a[0]=7, b[0]=3

for i=1:

n=min(3,1)=1, m=max(3,1)=3

a[1]=1, b[1]=3

So, x=71, y=33

Product: 71*33=2343

Without swapping any digits: 73*31=2263

So, it's better.

In the second sample input:

x=2, y=5

len(a)=1, len(a)//2 -1=-1, which is less than 0, so no swap in the first half.

For i=0:

n=min(2,5)=2, m=max(2,5)=5

a[0]=2, b[0]=5

So, x=2, y=5

Product: 10

If we swap: x=5, y=2, product is still 10.

So, same as before.

Third sample input:

x=3516, y=3982

len(a)=4, len(a)//2 -1=1

So, for i=0:

n=min(3,3)=3, m=max(3,3)=3

a[0]=3, b[0]=3

for i=1:

n=min(5,9)=5, m=9

a[1]=9, b[1]=5

for i=2:

n=min(1,8)=1, m=8

a[2]=1, b[2]=8

for i=3:

n=min(6,2)=2, m=6

a[3]=2, b[3]=6

So, x=3912, y=3586

Product: 3912*3586=14,050,752

Alternative arrangement: x=3582, y=3916, product is the same.

So, it works.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let me try to think of a case where this approach might fail.

Suppose x=12, y=21

According to the given program:

len(a)=2, len(a)//2 -1=0

for i=0:

n=min(1,2)=1, m=2

a[0]=2, b[0]=1

for i=1:

n=min(2,1)=1, m=
