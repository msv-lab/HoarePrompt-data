Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's an integer k, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. 

Specifically:

- l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array (a1 to an).

- r should be a subset of the last n elements of the array (a_{n+1} to a_{2n}).

- The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, l and r are any collections of 2k elements from the first n and last n elements, respectively, and the order doesn't matter because XOR is associative and commutative.

So, the key operation here is XOR, which is bitwise exclusive or. For a set of numbers, the XOR is calculated by performing XOR on all of them together. I need to make sure that the XOR of the elements in l is equal to the XOR of the elements in r.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, that means that in the first n elements, some numbers from 1 to n appear once, and some appear twice, and similarly for the last n elements.

Wait, no. Actually, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array of length 2n, and the array is split into two parts of n elements each, it's possible that some numbers appear once in the first part and once in the second part, or twice in one part and not at all in the other.

But hold on, the problem says "each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a." So, for each number from 1 to n, there are exactly two positions in the array where it appears.

Given that, when I split the array into two parts of n elements each, some numbers will have both occurrences in the first part, some will have both in the second part, and some will have one in each.

But the problem defines l as a subset of the first n elements and r as a subset of the last n elements.

I need to choose 2k elements from the first n for l and 2k elements from the last n for r, such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Also, k can be from 1 to floor(n/2), inclusive.

The problem also mentions that at least one such pair always exists, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Given the constraints, t can be up to 5000, and n can be up to 5*10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 5*10^4.

So, efficiency is important here, as the total number of elements across all test cases can be up to 5*10^4 * 2 = 10^5.

Now, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to process each test case individually.

For each test case, I have n and k, and an array of 2n elements.

I need to split the array into two parts: the first n elements (lft) and the last n elements (rgt).

My goal is to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

I need to find a way to select these subsets.

Let me consider the properties of XOR.

XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter, and I can group elements in any way.

Also, XOR-ing a number with itself results in 0.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, that means that in the first n elements, some numbers appear once, and some appear twice.

Similarly, in the last n elements, some numbers appear once, and some appear twice.

Wait, no. Actually, for each number from 1 to n, it appears exactly twice in the entire array, which is divided into two parts of n elements each.

So, for each number, its two occurrences can be:

- Both in the first n elements (lft).

- Both in the last n elements (rgt).

- One in lft and one in rgt.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt such that their XORs are equal.

I need to find a way to select these subsets.

Let me think about the total XOR of all elements in lft and rgt.

Wait, actually, since the entire array's XOR is the XOR of all elements from 1 to n appearing twice.

But since XOR is associative and commutative, and XOR-ing a number with itself results in 0, the total XOR of the entire array is 0, because each number appears twice.

Wait, is that correct?

Actually, no. If a number appears twice, its XOR is 0, and 0 XORed with any number of 0s is still 0. But if a number appears an even number of times, its contribution to the total XOR is 0, and if it appears an odd number of times, its contribution is the number itself.

But in this problem, each number appears exactly twice, which is even, so the total XOR of the entire array is 0.

Therefore, XOR of lft is equal to XOR of rgt, because XOR of lft XOR XOR of rgt equals XOR of the entire array, which is 0, so XOR of lft equals XOR of rgt.

Wait, but I need to select subsets l and r from lft and rgt respectively, such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

So, I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt where XOR of l equals XOR of r.

Given that, and knowing that the total XOR of lft is equal to the total XOR of rgt (since total XOR of the entire array is 0), I need to find subsets l and r with equal XOR values.

I need a way to select these subsets efficiently.

Let me consider the XOR values.

Let me denote XOR of lft as X and XOR of rgt as X, since XOR of lft and rgt are equal.

Now, I need to select subsets l from lft and r from rgt, each with 2k elements, such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

Given that, and since XOR is involved, I need to find a way to select elements such that their XOR matches.

This seems tricky, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the frequencies of the numbers in lft and rgt.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, in lft and rgt, the numbers can appear in different ways.

Let me think about the numbers that appear twice in lft and twice in rgt.

Wait, no. For each number, it can appear:

- Twice in lft and not in rgt.

- Twice in rgt and not in lft.

- Once in lft and once in rgt.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt with equal XOR.

I need to find a way to pair the selections from lft and rgt such that their XORs match.

Let me consider grouping the numbers based on their occurrences in lft and rgt.

Let me try to categorize the numbers:

1. Numbers that appear twice in lft: Let's call them type A.

2. Numbers that appear twice in rgt: Type B.

3. Numbers that appear once in lft and once in rgt: Type C.

So, for type A numbers, both occurrences are in lft.

For type B, both are in rgt.

For type C, one in lft and one in rgt.

Now, when selecting subsets l and r, I need to consider how these type A, B, and C numbers contribute to the XOR.

Let me think about the XOR values.

Let me denote:

- XOR of all type A numbers: XA

- XOR of all type B numbers: XB

- XOR of all type C numbers: XC

Since each number appears exactly twice, and considering the categories:

- Type A numbers contribute XA to lft's XOR.

- Type B numbers contribute XB to rgt's XOR.

- Type C numbers contribute XC to both lft and rgt's XOR, but since one is in lft and one in rgt, their contributions are split.

Wait, actually, since XOR is commutative and associative, and each type C number appears once in lft and once in rgt, their XOR contributions cancel out when considering lft XOR rgt.

But since lft XOR rgt is 0 (as the entire array's XOR is 0), then XA XOR XB XOR XC XOR XC = 0, which simplifies to XA XOR XB = 0, meaning XA = XB.

So, the XOR of type A numbers equals the XOR of type B numbers.

This seems useful.

Now, I need to select subsets l from lft and r from rgt, each with 2k elements, such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

Given that, and knowing that XA = XB, perhaps I can find a way to select elements such that their XOR matches.

Let me consider selecting elements in pairs.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that since XA = XB, and I need to select subsets l from lft and r from rgt with equal XOR, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR is equal to some target value.

But what should that target value be?

Given that, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR is equal to the XOR of some combination of the numbers.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt, and I need to maximize or minimize something, but no, just to make their XOR equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select k pairs from lft and k pairs from rgt, but not necessarily pairs, but subsets of size 2k.

Wait, but k can be up to floor(n/2), and 2k would be up to n.

So, 2k can be up to n, meaning I might need to select up to n elements from lft and n from rgt.

But the constraints allow that.

Wait, but n can be up to 5*10^4, and t up to 5000, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 5*10^4, so it's manageable.

Now, perhaps I can find a way to select elements such that their XOR matches.

But how?

Let me consider that for type A numbers, since both occurrences are in lft, selecting both would give XOR 0.

Similarly, for type B, selecting both gives XOR 0.

For type C, selecting one from lft and one from rgt would give the same number XORed in both subsets.

Wait, maybe that's a way.

Let me think about type C numbers first.

For type C numbers, since one occurrence is in lft and one in rgt, if I select the one from lft in subset l and the one from rgt in subset r, their XOR contributions would be the same.

So, for each type C number, selecting its occurrence in lft and in rgt would make their XOR contributions equal.

Similarly, for type A numbers, selecting both occurrences in l would give XOR 0.

Similarly, for type B numbers, selecting both in r would give XOR 0.

So, perhaps I can select pairs of type A numbers and type B numbers to make their XOR contributions cancel out.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me try to select subsets l and r in such a way that their XORs are equal.

One approach could be to select subsets such that the XOR difference between l and r is zero.

But how to achieve that efficiently?

Let me consider the XOR of l and r.

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which implies that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

Which is equivalent to XOR(l XOR r) = 0.

But I need to select subsets l and r from lft and rgt respectively.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to look for some properties of XOR and subset selection.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for subsets of lft and rgt that have the same XOR value.

But with the constraint that both subsets have size 2k, it complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR equals a specific value.

But what value should that be?

Given that, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR equals the XOR of some predefined set.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that since XA = XB, and I need to select subsets l from lft and r from rgt with equal XOR.

Perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR equals some value, and since XA = XB, it's possible.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Identify type A, B, and C numbers.

- For type C numbers, since one is in lft and one is in rgt, selecting both in their respective subsets would make their XOR contributions equal.

- For type A numbers, selecting both in l would give XOR 0.

- Similarly, for type B numbers, selecting both in r would give XOR 0.

- So, perhaps I can pair type A and type B numbers to balance the XOR.

But I need a clearer strategy.

Let me consider that I can select pairs of type C numbers, one from lft and one from rgt, and their XOR contributions would be equal.

Similarly, for type A numbers, selecting both in l would give XOR 0, and for type B numbers, selecting both in r would give XOR 0.

So, perhaps I can select as many type C pairs as possible, and fill the remaining spots with type A and type B pairs.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in total for l and r.

Let me think differently.

Let me try to select k pairs from lft and k pairs from rgt.

Each pair can be either two identical numbers (for type A or type B) or two different numbers.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers into their types and handle them separately.

Let me try to categorize the numbers as type A, B, and C.

- Type A: numbers that appear twice in lft.

- Type B: numbers that appear twice in rgt.

- Type C: numbers that appear once in lft and once in rgt.

Given that, I can list out the numbers in each category.

Then, for type C numbers, selecting one from lft and one from rgt would make their XOR contributions equal.

For type A numbers, selecting both in l would give XOR 0.

Similarly, for type B numbers, selecting both in r would give XOR 0.

So, perhaps I can select pairs of type C numbers, and for type A and B, select pairs that give XOR 0.

Then, combine them in such a way that the total XOR of l equals the total XOR of r.

Wait, perhaps I can select subsets l and r by combining selections from type A, B, and C.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let s_c be the number of type C pairs selected.

- Let s_a be the number of type A pairs selected.

- Let s_b be the number of type B pairs selected.

Then, the total number of elements selected from lft would be 2*s_a + s_c, and from rgt would be 2*s_b + s_c.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements from lft and 2k from rgt.

So, I have:

2*s_a + s_c = 2k

2*s_b + s_c = 2k

Subtracting these two equations, I get:

2*s_a - 2*s_b = 0 => s_a = s_b

So, s_a = s_b

Let me denote s = s_a = s_b

Then, 2*s + s_c = 2k => s_c = 2k - 2*s

Since s_c has to be non-negative, 2k - 2*s >= 0 => s <= k

Also, s_c has to be an integer, but since s is integer, s_c will be integer.

So, for each s from 0 to k, I can set s_c = 2k - 2*s

Then, I need to select s type A pairs, s type B pairs, and s_c type C pairs.

But I need to make sure that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that, let's see what the XOR of l and r would be.

- For type A pairs selected, each pair selected gives XOR 0.

- For type B pairs selected, each pair selected gives XOR 0.

- For type C pairs selected, each pair selected gives XOR of the number, since it's the same number in l and r.

Wait, no.

Wait, for type C, selecting one from lft and one from rgt, both subsets l and r would have the same number, so their XOR contributions would be the same.

Wait, but XOR is not about the presence of numbers, it's about the bitwise XOR of their values.

So, if I select a type C number in l and the same number in r, then XOR of l would have that number, and XOR of r would have that number, so their XORs would have that number included in both.

But since XOR is associative and commutative, and I'm selecting the same number in both subsets, their XORs would have that number appearing twice, which effectively cancels out.

Wait, but I'm selecting single instances, not pairs.

Wait, no, I'm selecting subsets l and r, each with 2k elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for type C numbers, selecting one from lft and one from rgt would make their XOR contributions equal, because both subsets would have that number once.

For type A numbers, selecting both in l would give XOR equal to 0 (since a XOR a = 0).

Similarly, for type B numbers, selecting both in r would give XOR equal to 0.

So, perhaps I can select s type C pairs, and for the remaining, select type A and type B pairs to make up the required 2k elements.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the total XOR of l equals the total XOR of r.

Given that, perhaps selecting s type C pairs, and then selecting s type A pairs and s type B pairs would balance the XOR.

But I need to verify this.

Let me think about the XOR contributions.

- For each type C pair selected, the XOR of l and r both include that number once, so their XORs would both have that number included.

- For type A pairs selected, selecting both in l gives XOR 0.

- For type B pairs selected, selecting both in r gives XOR 0.

So, if I select s type C pairs, s type A pairs, and s type B pairs, then:

- XOR of l = (XOR of s type C numbers) XOR (XOR of s type A pairs, each giving 0) = XOR of s type C numbers.

- XOR of r = (XOR of s type C numbers) XOR (XOR of s type B pairs, each giving 0) = XOR of s type C numbers.

Thus, XOR of l equals XOR of r.

This seems to work.

So, this is a possible way to select the subsets.

Given that, I can choose s from 0 to k, and set s_c = 2k - 2*s.

Then, select s type A pairs, s type B pairs, and s_c type C pairs.

But I need to make sure that I have enough type A pairs, type B pairs, and type C pairs available.

Let me denote:

- na: number of type A pairs available.

- nb: number of type B pairs available.

- nc: number of type C pairs available.

Then, for each s from 0 to k, check if s <= na, s <= nb, and s_c = 2k - 2*s <= nc.

If such an s exists, then I can select s type A pairs, s type B pairs, and s_c type C pairs.

Then, assemble l and r accordingly.

This seems like a viable approach.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to categorize the numbers into type A, B, and C, and count the available pairs.

Let me think about how to categorize the numbers.

First, I need to find for each number, in which parts its two occurrences lie.

Given that, I can iterate through the array and record the positions of each number.

Let me try to do that.

For each number from 1 to n:

- Find its two positions in the array.

- Based on whether both are in lft, both are in rgt, or one in each, categorize it as type A, B, or C.

But given the time constraints, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider using dictionaries or lists to keep track of the positions.

But with n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, I need an efficient way.

Wait, since each number appears exactly twice, I can create a dictionary mapping each number to its two positions.

Then, based on whether both positions are < n (type A), both >= n (type B), or one < n and one >= n (type C).

But I need to do this efficiently.

Let me think about the implementation.

In code, I can:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array of 2n elements.

- Split the array into lft (first n elements) and rgt (last n elements).

- Create a dictionary to store the positions of each number.

- Iterate through the array and record the positions.

- Then, categorize the numbers into type A, B, and C based on their positions.

- Count the number of available type A pairs, type B pairs, and type C pairs.

- Then, find an s in 0 to k such that s <= na, s <= nb, and s_c = 2k - 2*s <= nc.

- If such an s exists, then select s type A pairs, s type B pairs, and s_c type C pairs.

- Assemble l and r accordingly.

- Output l and r.

But this seems a bit involved, and I need to make sure it's efficient.

Let me think about optimizing this.

Given that n can be up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 5*10^4, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

So, I need to make sure that my implementation runs in linear time.

Now, to categorize the numbers into type A, B, and C, I can:

- For each number, find its two positions.

- Based on the positions, categorize it.

- Count the number of type A pairs, type B pairs, and type C pairs.

Then, for each possible s from 0 to k, check if s <= na, s <= nb, and s_c = 2k - 2*s <= nc.

If such an s exists, proceed to select the pairs.

But I need to make sure that s_c is non-negative, so 2k - 2*s >= 0 => s <= k.

Also, s_c should be even, but since s_c = 2k - 2*s, which is always even, that's fine.

Wait, no, 2k - 2*s is always even, but in terms of pairs, it's fine.

Now, to implement this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute the counts of type A, B, and C pairs.

Then, iterate over possible s and find a valid s that satisfies the conditions.

Once I have s, I can select s type A pairs, s type B pairs, and s_c type C pairs.

Then, construct l and r accordingly.

But I need to make sure that I select the actual elements, not just the counts.

Let me think about how to select the pairs.

For type A pairs, since both occurrences are in lft, I can select any s type A pairs available.

Similarly, for type B pairs, select s type B pairs.

For type C pairs, select s_c type C pairs, selecting one from lft and one from rgt for each.

Then, assemble l and r by including the selected elements.

But I need to make sure that the total number of elements in l and r is exactly 2k each.

Given that, with s type A pairs (2*s elements in l), s type B pairs (2*s elements in r), and s_c type C pairs (s_c elements in l and s_c elements in r), the totals would be:

- l: 2*s (from type A) + s_c (from type C) = 2*s + s_c = 2*k

- r: 2*s (from type B) + s_c (from type C) = 2*s + s_c = 2*k

Which matches the required sizes.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the reference solution, it seems to be doing something different.

Let me look at the given code.

The code is:

def func():

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

lft = lst[:n]

rgt = lst[n:]

ldb = []

rdb = []

sng = []

lft.sort()

rgt.sort()

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

sng.append(lft[i])

for i in range(1, n):

if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:

rdb.append(rgt[i])

sz = 0

for elem in ldb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

sz = 0

for elem in rdb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

print()

sz += 1

Alright, so the code is doing the following:

- Read T, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array of 2n elements.

- Split the array into lft (first n elements) and rgt (last n elements).

- Sort both lft and rgt.

- Initialize lists ldb, rdb, and sng.

- Iterate through lft to find duplicate elements and single elements.

- For lft:

- If lft[i] == lft[i-1], it's a duplicate, add to ldb.

- If lft[i] != lft[i+1] and i < n-1, it's single, add to sng.

- Similarly, iterate through rgt to find duplicates and add to rdb.

- Then, for l, select elements from ldb in pairs and from sng individually until reaching 2k elements.

- Similarly, for r, select elements from rdb in pairs and from sng individually until reaching 2k elements.

- Print l and r accordingly.

Wait, but in the code, it seems that sng is used for both l and r, which might not be correct, because sng contains elements from lft that appear only once.

But in reality, for type C numbers, their occurrences are split between lft and rgt.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's analyze it further.

In the code:

- lft and rgt are sorted.

- ldb collects duplicates from lft.

- rdb collects duplicates from rgt.

- sng collects singles from lft.

Then, for l, it selects pairs from ldb and singles from sng.

Similarly, for r, it selects pairs from rdb and singles from sng.

But sng contains singles from lft, which correspond to type C numbers, whose other occurrence is in rgt.

So, when selecting a single from sng for l, I need to make sure that the corresponding element in rgt is selected for r.

But in the code, it seems to select singles from sng for both l and r, which might not be correct.

Wait, no, in the code, for l, it selects from ldb and sng, and for r, it selects from rdb and sng.

But sng is defined as singles from lft.

So, for type C numbers, their other occurrence is in rgt.

But in the code, it seems to select sng elements for both l and r, which might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Wait, in the code, sng is defined as elements in lft that appear only once.

But for type C numbers, which appear once in lft and once in rgt, their single occurrence in lft is added to sng.

Then, when selecting for l, it selects these singles from sng, and presumably, for r, it should select the corresponding elements from rgt.

But in the code, for r, it selects from rdb and sng.

Wait, but sng is defined as singles from lft.

So, when selecting from sng for r, it's selecting the same elements again, which are actually in rgt.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to select the corresponding element from rgt for type C numbers.

But in the code, it's selecting sng elements for both l and r, which is wrong because sng elements are from lft.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

2 1

1 2 2 1

Here, n=2, k=1

lft = [1,2]

rgt = [2,1]

After sorting:

lft = [1,2]

rgt = [1,2]

ldb: duplicates in lft: 2 (since 2 appears twice)

rdb: duplicates in rgt: 2 (since 2 appears twice)

sng: singles in lft: none

So, for l: select 2 and 2 (from ldb), but since k=1, and 2k=2, so select 2 and 2.

For r: select 2 and 2 (from rdb).

But in reality, in lft, 2 appears only once, so ldb should be empty.

Wait, no, in lft, 2 appears only once, because lft is [1,2], so no duplicates.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, in lft = [1,2], rgt = [2,1]

After sorting:

lft = [1,2]

rgt = [1,2]

Then, in lft, no duplicates, so ldb is empty.

sng is [1,2]

Similarly, in rgt, no duplicates, rdb is empty.

Then, for l: select from ldb (empty) and from sng: select 2 elements (since k=1, 2k=2), so select 1 and 2.

Similarly, for r: select from rdb (empty) and from sng: select 1 and 2.

So, l = [1,2], r=[1,2]

Which matches the first sample output.

But in this case, it worked, but is it generally correct?

Let me consider another sample.

Take the second sample:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

So, n=6, k=1

lft = [6,4,2,1,2,3]

rgt = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

After sorting:

lft = [1,2,2,3,4,6]

rgt = [1,3,4,5,5,6]

Then, ldb: duplicates in lft: 2

rdb: duplicates in rgt: 5

sng in lft: 1,3,4,6

So, for l: select from ldb: 2 and 2 (but k=1, 2k=2), but since s_c =2k -2*s, if s=0, s_c=2, which is <= number of type C pairs.

Wait, but in the code, it selects from ldb in pairs and from sng individually.

So, for s=0, s_c=2, which is <= number of type C pairs.

Number of type C pairs: for type C numbers, which are numbers that appear once in lft and once in rgt.

From lft: 1,3,4,6

From rgt: 1,3,4,6

So, type C numbers are 1,3,4,6

Type A: none in lft

Type B: 5 in rgt

So, na=0, nb=1 (for 5), nc=4 (for 1,3,4,6)

Then, for s from 0 to k=1:

if s=0: s_c=2k-0=2 <= nc=4, so possible.

Then, select s_c=2 type C pairs: select any 2 from 1,3,4,6

Say, select 1 and 3.

Then, l: 1 and 3 from lft

r: 1 and 3 from rgt

Then, XOR of l: 1 XOR 3 = 2

XOR of r: 1 XOR 3 = 2

Which matches.

Alternatively, select 1 and 6: l:1 XOR 6 = 7, r:1 XOR 6 =7

Similarly, matches.

So, this seems correct.

In the code, it selects from ldb (duplicates in lft), which in this case is 2, but since s=0, it doesn't select from ldb.

Then, selects s_c=2 from sng, which are 1,3,4,6.

Selects 1 and 3, for example.

Similarly, for r, selects from rdb (duplicates in rgt), which is 5, but since s=0, doesn't select from rdb.

Then, selects s_c=2 from sng, which are 1,3,4,6 from rgt.

Selects 1 and 3.

So, l:1,3 from lft

r:1,3 from rgt

Which matches.

Similarly, in the code, it seems to select from sng for both l and r, which in this case coincides with selecting the type C pairs.

But is this general?

Let me consider another case.

Suppose n=4, k=1

lft: [1,1,2,3]

rgt: [2,3,4,4]

Then, type A: 1 (appears twice in lft)

type B: 4 (appears twice in rgt)

type C: 2 and 3 (appear once in lft and once in rgt)

Then, na=1 (type A:1)

nb=1 (type B:4)

nc=2 (type C:2,3)

Then, for s from 0 to k=1:

if s=0: s_c=2k-0=2 <= nc=2, possible.

Then, select s_c=2 type C pairs: select 2 and 3.

So, l:2 and 3 from lft

r:2 and 3 from rgt

XOR of l:2 XOR 3 =1

XOR of r:2 XOR 3 =1

Matches.

Alternatively, s=1: s_c=2-2*1=0 <= nc=2

Then, select s=1 type A pair (1,1 from lft), s=1 type B pair (4,4 from rgt), and s_c=0 type C pairs.

Then, l:1,1 from lft

r:4,4 from rgt

XOR of l:1 XOR 1=0

XOR of r:4 XOR 4=0

Which matches.

So, both s=0 and s=1 are possible.

Now, in the code, it seems to select from ldb (duplicates in lft), rdb (duplicates in rgt), and sng (singles in lft).

In this case, ldb=[1], rdb=[4], sng=[] for lft.

Wait, no, in lft: [1,1,2,3]

After sorting: [1,1,2,3]

Then, in the code:

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i-1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

elif i < n-1 and lft[i] != lft[i+1]:

sng.append(lft[i])

So, for lft=[1,1,2,3]

i=1: lft[1]==lft[0]==1, so ldb.append(1)

i=2: lft[2]!=lft[1], and i=2 < n-1=3, so sng.append(2)

i=3: lft[3]!=lft[2], but i=3 >= n-1=3, so no sng.append

So, ldb=[1], sng=[2]

Similarly, for rgt=[2,3,4,4]

After sorting: [2,3,4,4]

Then, ldb for rgt:4

rdb=[4]

sng for lft is [2]

Then, for l:

select from ldb: select 1 and 1 (since k=1, 2k=2)

But k - sz >=2, so select 1 and 1

Then, sz=2 >=k=1, so don't select from sng.

So, l=[1,1]

For r:

select from rdb: select 4 and 4

Then, sz=2 >=k=1, so don't select from sng.

So, r=[4,4]

Then, XOR of l:1 XOR 1=0

XOR of r:4 XOR 4=0

Which matches.

But in this case, it didn't select from sng, which is fine.

But what if k=2 and n=4?

Wait, k can be up to floor(n/2)=2 for n=4.

Let's try n=4, k=2

lft=[1,1,2,3]

rgt=[2,3,4,4]

Then, type A:1

type B:4

type C:2,3

na=1 (1)

nb=1 (4)

nc=2 (2,3)

Then, for s from 0 to 2:

if s=0: s_c=4-0=4 > nc=2, invalid.

s=1: s_c=4-2=2 <= nc=2, valid.

s=2: s_c=4-4=0 <= nc=2, valid.

So, possible with s=1 or s=2.

For s=1:

select 1 type A pair (1,1 from lft), 1 type B pair (4,4 from rgt), and s_c=2 type C pairs (select 2 and 3).

Then, l:1,1 from lft + 2 and 3 from lft = [1,1,2,3]

r:4,4 from rgt + 2 and 3 from rgt = [4,4,2,3]

But wait, in rgt, 2 and 3 appear only once each.

Wait, rgt=[2,3,4,4]

So, for type C numbers, 2 and 3 are in both lft and rgt once each.

So, selecting 2 and 3 from lft for l, and 2 and 3 from rgt for r is possible.

Then, l:1,1,2,3 from lft

r:4,4,2,3 from rgt

Then, XOR of l:1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 3 =1

XOR of r:4 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 3 =1

Which matches.

Similarly, for s=2:

select 2 type A pairs: but na=1, which is less than s=2, so invalid.

Wait, na=1, nb=1, s cannot be 2.

So, only s=1 is possible.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, na=1, nb=1, s=1 is possible, s_c=2.

But earlier, I thought s=2 is possible, but na=1 < s=2, so invalid.

So, only s=1 is possible.

Now, in the code, for k=2:

select from ldb: ldb=[1], rdb=[4], sng=[2] for lft.

Then, for l:

select from ldb: select 1 and 1 (since k - sz >=2, sz=
