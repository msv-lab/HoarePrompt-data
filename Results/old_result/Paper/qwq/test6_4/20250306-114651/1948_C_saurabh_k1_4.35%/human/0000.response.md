Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right, and no arrow points outside the grid. There's a robot starting at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell. Every second, two things happen: first, the robot moves left, right, up, or down (but it can't go outside the grid or skip the move), and then it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

My task is to determine whether the robot can reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell, for each test case.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly. The robot has two steps each second:

1. It moves left, right, up, or down, but it can't go outside the grid or skip the move.

2. Then, it moves again according to the arrow in its current cell.

Given that, I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that can take the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

First row: >><<

Second row: >>><

So, the grid looks like this:

Row 1: > > < <

Row 2: > > < >

The example says one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Let's simulate that:

- Start at (1,1). Arrow is '>', so if I move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow '>', which would take me to (1,3).

- But according to the description, after moving left, right, up, or down, then move according to the arrow.

Wait, I think I need to be more precise.

Let's think about the two steps:

1. The robot chooses a direction to move: left, right, up, or down.

2. Then, it moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the possible movements more carefully.

Let me consider the grid as a graph where each cell is a node, and there are edges based on the possible moves.

But that might be too time-consuming for large n, given the constraints.

Wait, the constraints say that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(str, input()))

b = list(map(str, input()))

if b[n - 2] == str('<'):

print('No')

else:

print('Yes')

It seems that the code is checking if the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is '<'. If it is, then it prints 'No'; otherwise, 'Yes'.

Is this correct? Let's see.

In the first test case:

b = >>><

n = 4

b[n-2] = b[2] = '<'

According to the code, it should print 'No', but in the example output, it's 'YES'.

Wait, that's contradictory. So, maybe the code is wrong.

Wait, let's check the indices carefully.

In Python, indices start at 0, so b[n-2] is the (n-1)-th column, which is the second-to-last column in row 2.

In the first test case, b[2] = '<', so according to the code, it should print 'No', but the example output is 'YES'.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Maybe I miscounted the indices. Let's confirm.

n = 4

Columns are 1 to 4.

b = >>><

Indices in Python: b[0] = '>', b[1] = '>', b[2] = '<', b[3] = '>'

So, b[n-2] = b[2] = '<'

But in the example, the output is 'YES', which contradicts the code's 'No'.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look at the second test case:

n = 2

a = ><

b = ><

According to the code:

b[n-2] = b[0] = '<'

So, it should print 'No', but the example output is 'YES'.

Another contradiction.

Third test case:

n = 4

a = >>><

b = >><<

b[n-2] = b[2] = '<'

So, code prints 'No', and example output is 'NO'.

Fourth test case:

n = 6

a = >><<><

b = ><>>><

b[n-2] = b[4] = '>'

So, code prints 'Yes', and example output is 'YES'.

Hmm, so in test cases where b[n-2] is '<', the code prints 'No', and in other cases, 'Yes'.

But in the first and second test cases, where b[n-2] is '<', the example output is 'YES', which contradicts the code.

Wait, but in the first test case, b[2] = '<', and the output is 'YES'.

In the second test case, b[0] = '<', and output is 'YES'.

In the third test case, b[2] = '<', output is 'NO'.

In the fourth test case, b[4] = '>', output is 'YES'.

So, it's inconsistent.

Maybe there's a pattern here that I'm missing.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the key is to see if we can reach column n in row 2.

Let me consider that the robot needs to be in cell (2,n).

To get there, it could come from cell (2, n-1), moving right, and then follow the arrow in cell (2, n-1).

If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is '>', then it would move to cell (2,n).

If the arrow is '<', it would move to cell (2, n-2).

So, if b[n-2] is '<', it can't directly reach cell (2,n) from (2,n-1).

But perhaps there are other ways to reach (2,n).

For example, maybe the robot can come from cell (1,n), and move down to cell (2,n).

Or maybe from cell (2, n-1), move to (2,n), but only if b[n-2] is '>', according to the above logic.

Wait, but in the first test case, even though b[n-2] = '<', it's still possible to reach (2,n).

How is that possible?

Let's look at the path described in the first example:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

So, it's not necessarily coming from (2,n-1) to (2,n).

There might be other paths.

Perhaps the code is incorrect because it only considers one possible path, but there could be multiple ways to reach (2,n).

So, maybe the code is incomplete.

Let me think about a proper approach.

I need to model the movement of the robot.

Each second, the robot chooses a direction (left, right, up, down), moves there, and then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

Given that, it's like the robot has control over its first move each second, and then is forced to move according to the arrow.

Also, the grid has only two rows, which might simplify things.

I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that can lead the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where edges are possible moves, and see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But with n up to 2*10^5, building a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the robot can move in any direction in the first step, and then follow the arrow.

Wait, but it has to choose a direction each second.

This seems quite involved.

Maybe I can think in terms of possible positions the robot can be in after certain moves.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that the robot can move to any cell in the grid, given enough time, because it can choose its initial direction each second.

But I need to find if there's a way to reach (2,n).

Perhaps I can consider that the robot can move to any cell in the same row by choosing to move left or right initially, and then following the arrows.

But arrows can create cycles or paths that lead in certain directions.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose the robot is in cell (r,c). It can choose to move left, right, up, or down.

But it can't move outside the grid.

After moving, it then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, effectively, each move is a combination of the chosen direction and then the arrow's direction.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as transitions between states.

But again, with large n, it needs to be efficient.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move to any adjacent cell each second, and then be forced to move according to the arrow.

Wait, no, it's not exactly that.

Wait, actually, the robot first moves in the chosen direction, and then moves according to the arrow in the cell it's in after the first move.

So, effectively, from cell (r,c), if it chooses to move right, it goes to (r,c+1), then follows the arrow there.

Similarly for left, up, down.

But up and down only make sense if it's not on the edge.

Wait, row 1 can go down to row 2, and row 2 can go up to row 1.

But no up from row 1 or down from row 2, since there are only two rows.

Wait, no, the problem says it can't move outside the grid, but it can move up from row 2 to row 1, and down from row 1 to row 2.

But not up from row 1 or down from row 2, as there's no row 0 or row 3.

So, from row 1, it can move right or left according to the arrow, or down to row 2, then follow the arrow.

From row 2, it can move right or left according to the arrow, or up to row 1, then follow the arrow.

Wait, but the arrow in the cell tells it to move left or right, not up or down.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

Firstly, the robot moves left, right, up, or down (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move);

then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, the arrow moves are in the direction of the arrow, which are left or right.

So, after the initial move (up, down, left, or right), it then moves left or right according to the arrow in the cell it's in after the first move.

This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to formalize the movement.

Let's denote the robot's position at time t as (r_t, c_t).

At time t+1:

1. The robot chooses a direction: left, right, up, or down.

- If it chooses left, it moves to (r_t, c_t - 1), if that cell exists.

- If it chooses right, it moves to (r_t, c_t + 1), if that cell exists.

- If it chooses up, it moves to (r_t - 1, c_t), if that cell exists.

- If it chooses down, it moves to (r_t + 1, c_t), if that cell exists.

- It can't choose a direction that would take it outside the grid.

2. Then, it moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

- If the arrow is '<', it moves to (r_t + dr, c_t - 1), where dr is the row difference from the initial move.

- If the arrow is '>', it moves to (r_t + dr, c_t + 1), where dr is the row difference from the initial move.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the arrow's direction.

After the first move, the robot is in a new cell, say (r', c'), and the arrow in that cell is either '<' or '>'.

- If it's '<', it moves to (r', c' - 1), if that cell exists.

- If it's '>', it moves to (r', c' + 1), if that cell exists.

So, effectively, from (r_t, c_t):

- Choose a direction: left, right, up, or down to move to (r', c').

- Then, move to (r', c' ± 1) based on the arrow in (r', c').

- The new position is (r', c''), where c'' = c' ± 1, depending on the arrow.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can model this as possible transitions from each cell.

For each cell (r,c), and for each initial move direction, I can compute the final position after following the arrow.

Then, I can see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of possible movements and see if I can reach column n in row 2.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can choose to move to any adjacent cell in the first step, and then follow the arrow.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot can control its initial move each second, so it can choose to move in a way that allows it to progress towards the target.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions it can reach from its current position.

But I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since the grid has only two rows, maybe I can consider the movement in terms of columns and the row the robot is in.

Let me try to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Define dp[r][c] as whether the robot can be in cell (r,c).

Initialize dp[1][1] = True.

Then, for each cell, based on possible previous moves, set dp[r][c] accordingly.

But with n up to 2*10^5, this would be O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.

But I need to implement it efficiently.

Let me try to think about how to compute dp[r][c].

For each cell (r,c), I need to see if there's a way to reach it from some previous cell.

Given the movement rules, it's a bit complicated.

Let me consider the possible ways to reach (r,c):

- The robot could have moved to (r,c) in the first step and then followed the arrow.

- Or, it could have moved to some cell (r',c') in the first step and then followed the arrow to (r,c).

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the possible previous positions.

Given that, for each cell (r,c), I can consider the possible cells that can lead to it.

Let me consider that.

Suppose the robot ends up in (r,c). How did it get there?

It must have been in some cell (r',c') after its initial move and then followed the arrow to (r,c).

So, (r',c') -> (r,c) based on the arrow in (r',c').

Given that, I can consider for each cell (r,c), what are the possible (r',c') that can lead to it.

Let's consider:

- If the arrow in (r',c') is '<', then (r',c' - 1) = (r,c).

- If the arrow in (r',c') is '>', then (r',c' + 1) = (r,c).

So, (r',c') is such that:

- If arrow in (r',c') is '<', then c' = c + 1.

- If arrow in (r',c') is '>', then c' = c - 1.

And r' can be r, r-1, or r+1, depending on the initial move.

Wait, no.

Actually, after the initial move to (r',c'), it then moves according to the arrow to (r'', c''), which is (r,c).

So, (r'', c'') = (r', c' ± 1), depending on the arrow.

Therefore, (r,c) = (r', c' + direction), where direction is -1 or +1 based on the arrow.

So, c = c' + direction.

Therefore, c' = c - direction.

So, if arrow is '<', direction = -1, so c' = c + 1.

If arrow is '>', direction = +1, so c' = c - 1.

And r' can be r, r-1, or r+1, provided that the initial move is valid.

Wait, but the initial move can't go outside the grid.

So, for each cell (r,c), possible previous cells (r',c') are:

- For each possible initial move direction, and ensuring that the arrow move leads to (r,c).

This is getting too complicated for my current understanding.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move to any adjacent cell in the first step, and then follow the arrow.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where edges represent possible moves from one cell to another, and then see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But again, with n up to 2*10^5, building a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that since the grid has only two rows, I can think in terms of possible movements between the two rows and within the same row.

Perhaps I can model the movement within each row and between rows separately.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrows, or switch rows by moving up or down and then following the arrows.

But I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since the arrows only point left or right, and the robot can choose to move up or down, perhaps I can consider the movement in terms of possible column transitions.

Let me try to think in terms of columns and possible row transitions.

For each column, the robot can be in row 1 or row 2.

It can move within the same row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrows.

Or, it can switch rows by moving up or down and then following the arrows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column transitions for each row.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can move between rows at any column where the arrow allows it.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider that if the robot is in row 1, column c, and chooses to move down, it goes to row 2, column c, and then follows the arrow in row 2, column c.

Similarly, if it's in row 2, column c, and chooses to move up, it goes to row 1, column c, and then follows the arrow in row 1, column c.

If it chooses to move left or right, it moves to the adjacent column in the same row and then follows the arrow there.

Wait, but the arrow only moves left or right, not up or down.

Wait, no, the arrow moves are in the direction of the arrow, which is left or right.

So, after the initial move (up, down, left, or right), it then moves left or right according to the arrow in the new cell.

This seems like a two-step process.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define a function that, given the current position (r,c), returns all possible positions it can reach in one second.

So, for each possible initial move direction, compute the position after the initial move and then after following the arrow.

Then, collect all such positions as possible next positions.

Then, I can perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from (1,1) to see if I can reach (2,n).

But with n up to 2*10^5, a standard BFS would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Perhaps I can find a way to model the movement such that I can determine reachability in linear time.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows at any column where the arrow allows it.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible column transitions for each row.

Let me try to model the movement within each row and between rows.

Suppose I have two rows: a and b.

Each row has arrows that dictate how the robot moves within that row.

The robot can also choose to switch rows by moving up or down, provided it's not on the edge.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row as a graph where edges are determined by the arrows, and between rows at each column.

But again, with large n, I need an efficient way to compute reachability.

Maybe I can consider that the robot can move within a row by following the arrows and choosing to move left or right.

Additionally, it can switch rows at any column by choosing to move up or down, provided the target row is within bounds.

Wait, but moving up from row 1 is not possible, and moving down from row 2 is not possible.

So, from row 1, it can only move down to row 2, and from row 2, it can only move up to row 1.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row and the switches between rows.

But I need a way to model this efficiently.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrows.

Additionally, at any column, it can choose to switch rows, provided it's allowed.

So, perhaps I can model the movement within each row separately and then consider the switches between rows.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of possible column transitions for each row.

For row 1:

- If the arrow is '>', the robot can move to the next column in row 1 or switch to row 2 and move to the next column.

- If the arrow is '<', the robot can move to the previous column in row 1 or switch to row 2 and move to the previous column.

Similarly for row 2.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model the movement as a finite state machine, where the states are the row and column positions, and the transitions are based on the choices the robot makes.

But again, with large n, this might not be efficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot has control over its initial move each second, so it can choose to move in a way that allows it to progress towards the target.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions it can reach from its current position.

But I need a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since the grid has only two rows, maybe I can consider the movement in terms of possible column transitions when switching rows.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can move between rows at any column, provided it chooses to move up or down, and then follow the arrow in the new row.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in such a way that I can track possible columns in each row that are reachable.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think in terms of possible movements within each row and between rows.

Within a row, the robot can move left or right according to the arrows.

Between rows, it can switch rows at any column.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach any column in row 1 and any column in row 2, provided that the arrows allow it.

But I need to see if it can reach column n in row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column n in row 2 if it can reach column n-1 in row 2 and the arrow in column n-1 is '>', or if it can reach column n in row 1 and choose to move down to row 2.

But in that case, I need to see if it can reach column n in row 1.

This seems like a recursive relationship.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define dp[r][c] as whether the robot can reach cell (r,c).

Initialize dp[1][1] = True.

Then, for each cell, based on possible previous moves, set dp[r][c] accordingly.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize dp as a 2x(n+1) array, initialized to False.

Set dp[0][1] = True (since rows are 0-indexed in Python).

Then, for each column from 1 to n:

- For each row r in 0 and 1:

- If dp[r][c] is True:

- It can move left, right, up, or down.

- If it chooses to move left:

- Move to (r, c-1), then follow the arrow.

- If it chooses to move right:

- Move to (r, c+1), then follow the arrow.

- If it chooses to move up:

- Move to (r-1, c), then follow the arrow.

- If it chooses to move down:

- Move to (r+1, c), then follow the arrow.

- After following the arrow, set dp[new_r][new_c] = True.

But this is still too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the robot can control its initial move, so perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions it can reach by choosing to move in a certain direction and then following the arrow.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can choose to move to any adjacent cell in the grid, provided it follows the arrow after the initial move.

But I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since the arrows only point left or right, maybe I can model the movement within each row as a graph where edges are determined by the arrows, and between rows at each column.

But again, with large n, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows at any column, provided it chooses to move up or down.

So, perhaps I can model the movement in such a way that I can track possible columns in each row that are reachable.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can reach any column in row 1 or row 2 if it can reach the previous or next column in the same row, or switch rows at any column.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I try to see if the robot can reach column n in row 2.

To reach (2,n), it needs to be in column n-1 in row 2 and the arrow in (2,n-1) is '>', or it needs to be in column n in row 1 and choose to move down to row 2.

So, dp[1][n] depends on dp[1][n-1] and arrow in (1,n-1) is '>', or dp[0][n] and choosing to move down.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define dp[r][c] = True if the robot can reach cell (r,c).

Initialize dp[0][0] = True.

Then, for each cell, dp[r][c] = True if any of the following is True:

- From some previous cell (pr, pc), the robot can choose a direction to move to (r', c'), then follow the arrow to (r, c).

This seems too vague to implement efficiently.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot can control its initial move each second, so perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions it can reach from its current position.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution.

Maybe I can consider that the robot can reach any column in row 1 or row 2 if it can reach the previous or next column in the same row, or switch rows at any column.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column transitions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can move between rows at any column, and within a row, it can move according to the arrows.

Given that, maybe I can model the movement within each row separately and then consider the switches between rows.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think in terms of possible movements within each row.

In row 1:

- The robot can move left or right according to the arrows in row 1.

Similarly, in row 2:

- The robot can move left or right according to the arrows in row 2.

Additionally, at any column, the robot can choose to switch rows by moving up or down, provided it's allowed.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row as a graph where edges are determined by the arrows, and between rows at each column.

But again, with large n, I need an efficient way to compute reachability.

Maybe I can consider that the robot can reach any column in row 1 or row 2 if it can reach the previous or next column in the same row, or switch rows at any column.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column transitions for each row.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where nodes are (row, column), and edges are possible moves based on the initial move and the arrow.

But with n up to 2*10^5, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move to any adjacent cell in the grid, provided it follows the arrow after the initial move.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible positions it can reach from its current position.

But I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since the grid has only two rows, maybe I can model the movement in terms of possible column transitions when switching rows.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column c in row 2 if it can reach column c in row 1 and choose to move down, provided the arrow in row 1, column c allows it to move down to row 2.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me try to look back at the code provided.

The code simply checks if b[n-2] == '<'. If it is, then it prints 'No'; otherwise, 'Yes'.

But in the first test case, b[n-2] = b[2] = '<', but the example output is 'YES'.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
