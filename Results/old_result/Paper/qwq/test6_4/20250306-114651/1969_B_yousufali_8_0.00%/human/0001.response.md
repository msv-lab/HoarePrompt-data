Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. I need to do this for multiple test cases, and the input constraints are that there can be up to 10^4 test cases, each with a string of up to 2*10^5 characters, and the total sum of all string lengths across test cases is up to 2*10^5.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the string "10", and I perform a cyclic shift on the entire string. It becomes "01", which is sorted. The cost is 2, since the length of the substring is 2.

Another example: "11000". If I choose substring [1,3], which is "110", and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "011". So the string turns into "01100". Then, if I choose [2,4], which is "110", and shift it, it becomes "011", so the string is now "00110". Finally, choosing [3,5], which is "110", and shifting it to "011", the string becomes "00011". The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

But is there a better way? Maybe fewer operations or operations on smaller substrings.

I need to find a general approach that works for any binary string and minimizes the total cost.

Let me think about what needs to happen for the string to be sorted. All 0s need to be before all 1s. So, in the final string, there should be a point where everything to the left is 0 and everything to the right is 1.

In the original string, there might be 1s that are before 0s, and I need to move those 1s to the right of the 0s.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front of that substring. So, if I have a substring "10", shifting it once gives "01", which swaps the positions of 1 and 0.

Wait, but it's not just swapping; it's moving the last character to the front.

Let's see: for "10", shifting once gives "01". For "110", shifting once gives "011". For "11000", shifting [1,3] gives "01100", which moves the last character '0' of the substring "110" to the front.

So, it's like rotating the substring by one position to the left.

I need to find a way to use these rotations to move the 1s to the right and the 0s to the left.

One idea is to consider the positions where the string has a '1' followed by a '0'. These are the inversion points where the string is not sorted. I need to fix these inversions by moving the '1' to the right of the '0'.

Each cyclic shift on a substring can fix one inversion at a time, but possibly affecting other parts of the string.

I need to find a sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to calculate the minimum cost without simulating each shift.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to understand the expected behavior.

First sample input: "10" -> output 2. By shifting the entire string, it becomes "01" with cost 2.

Second sample input: "0000" -> output 0. It's already sorted, so no operations needed.

Third sample input: "11000" -> output 9. As shown in the example, with three shifts each of cost 3.

Fourth sample input: "101011" -> output 5.

Fifth sample input: "01101001" -> output 11.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can compute the minimum cost directly.

Let me think about the problem differently. Since each shift affects a substring of length k, and costs k, I need to find a way to correct the string with shifts that cover the necessary parts efficiently.

Another approach: since the string consists only of 0s and 1s, I can think of the positions where 1s and 0s are misplaced and calculate the cost to move them to their correct positions.

But shifts are not direct moves; they are rotations that affect multiple characters at once.

Wait, maybe I can model this as inversion counts or something similar in sorting algorithms.

In a sorted array, the number of inversions is zero, but in this case, inversions represent the disorder in the string.

However, in this problem, the operation is not swapping two elements but rotating a substring.

I need to find a way to relate the number of inversions to the cost of operations needed to sort the string.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the positions where the string differs from the sorted version and calculate the cost based on the distance those characters need to be moved.

Let me consider what the sorted string should look like. It should have all 0s followed by all 1s. To determine the position where the 0s end and 1s begin, I can find the maximum number of 0s that can be placed at the beginning.

Wait, but since I can perform operations to move 1s to the right and 0s to the left, I need to find the optimal way to do that.

Let me consider the prefix sums. If I know the number of 1s in the prefix up to each position, I can determine where the transition from 0 to 1 should happen.

Suppose I have the string "101011". The sorted version should be "001111". So, in the sorted string, the first two characters are '0' and the last four are '1'.

In the original string, I have '1' at positions 1,3,5,6; '0' at positions 2,4.

I need to move the '1's at positions 1,3,5,6 to be after the '0's at positions 2,4.

Each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' incurs a certain cost based on the operation used.

But how do I calculate the minimum cost to achieve this?

Let me consider that each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' requires a shift that covers both the '1' and the '0'.

Wait, but shifts can be on any substring, not just the immediate neighbors.

I need a more systematic approach.

I recall that in bubble sort, the number of swaps needed is equal to the number of inversions. But in this case, each shift can affect multiple inversions at once.

Maybe I can think of each shift as correcting multiple inversions in one operation.

But I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

This seems tricky. Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or a known algorithm for this.

Let me think about the positions where the string is not sorted. Specifically, where a '1' appears before a '0'.

In the string "101011", the pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) are inverted because s1=1 and s2=0, s3=1 and s4=0, s5=1 and s6=1 (but s5 and s6 are not inverted since both are '1').

Wait, but s5 and s6 are both '1', so they are sorted.

So, in "101011", the inverted pairs are (1,2) and (3,4).

If I can find all such inverted pairs, maybe the cost is related to the number of such pairs.

But in the first sample, "10" has one inverted pair, and the cost is 2.

In the third sample, "11000" has three inverted pairs: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Wait, but according to the example, the cost is 9, which is 3 shifts of length 3 each.

Wait, but 3 shifts of length 3 equals 9, which seems to correspond to the number of inverted pairs, which is 6 in this case. But in the first sample, one inverted pair costs 2, not 1.

This doesn't seem consistent.

Maybe it's not directly related to the number of inverted pairs.

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix the positions of the '0's and see how many '1's are to their left.

For each '0', count the number of '1's before it. Summing this over all '0's gives the total number of inversions.

In "101011":

- Position 2: '0', number of '1's before it: 1 (position 1)

- Position 4: '0', number of '1's before it: 2 (positions 1 and 3)

Total inversions: 1 + 2 = 3.

In "11000":

- Position 3: '0', number of '1's before it: 2 (positions 1 and 2)

- Position 4: '0', number of '1's before it: 2 (positions 1 and 2)

- Position 5: '0', number of '1's before it: 2 (positions 1 and 2)

Total inversions: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

But according to the sample, the cost is 9 for "11000", which is higher than the number of inversions.

So, perhaps the cost is not directly equal to the number of inversions.

Wait, maybe the cost is related to the positions of the '0's and the '1's.

Let me consider that to move a '1' past a '0', I need to perform a shift that includes both the '1' and the '0', and the cost is the length of that shift.

If I can group the shifts to correct multiple inversions at once, I can minimize the total cost.

This sounds similar to grouping inversions and correcting them in batches.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

Suppose I have a '0' at position j and a '1' at position i, where i < j. To move the '1' past the '0', I can perform a shift on the substring from i to j.

The cost would be j - i + 1.

But if there are multiple such inversions, I need to find a way to group them to minimize the total cost.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the prefix sums again.

Let me compute the number of '1's in the prefix up to each position.

For "101011":

Prefix sums:

- Position 1: 1

- Position 2: 1

- Position 3: 2

- Position 4: 2

- Position 5: 3

- Position 6: 4

In the sorted string, all '0's come before '1's. So, in the sorted string, the number of '1's in the prefix up to position k should be the total number of '1's in the string minus the number of '1's that are moved to the end.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of '1's that need to be moved to the end and calculate the cost based on their positions.

Let me count the total number of '1's in the string. For "101011", there are 4 '1's. In the sorted string, they should be at the last 4 positions.

So, the '1's at positions 1,3,5,6 need to be moved to positions 5,6,7,8.

Wait, but the string length is 6, so positions 7 and 8 don't exist. I need to adjust this thinking.

Actually, in the sorted string, the '1's should be at positions 3 to 6 for "101011". Wait, no.

Wait, "101011" has 4 '1's and 2 '0's, so in sorted order, it should be "001111".

So, in the original string, '1's at positions 1,3,5,6 need to be moved to positions 3,4,5,6.

Similarly, '0's at positions 2 and 4 need to be moved to positions 1 and 2.

So, I need to move '1's from positions 1 and 3 to positions 5 and 6.

How can I calculate the cost for this?

Each shift operation can move a '1' past a '0' by shifting a substring that includes both.

But I need to find the minimal total cost.

This seems similar to the problem of sorting permutations with reversals, but here it's about cyclic shifts and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

I need a more efficient way to compute this.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample: "10" -> cost 2.

Second sample: "0000" -> cost 0.

Third sample: "11000" -> cost 9.

Fourth sample: "101011" -> cost 5.

Fifth sample: "01101001" -> cost 11.

I need to find a formula that can compute these costs directly.

Let me consider that for each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0', I can perform a shift that covers both and pay the cost equal to the length of the shift.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the problem as moving each '1' that is before some '0' to the right of all '0's.

Each such move can be done by performing a shift that includes the '1' and all the '0's after it.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the positions where the string changes from '1' to '0' and perform shifts to fix those transitions.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the string and count the number of '1's that are before any '0's, and calculate the cost based on their positions.

Wait, but I need to consider the overlaps and find a way to group the shifts efficiently.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them plus something.

Wait, in "101011", there are two '0's:

- First '0' at position 2 has one '1' before it.

- Second '0' at position 4 has two '1's before it.

Total is 1 + 2 = 3, but the sample output is 5, which is more than 3.

In "11000", there are three '0's:

- First '0' at position 3 has two '1's before it.

- Second '0' at position 4 has two '1's before it.

- Third '0' at position 5 has two '1's before it.

Total is 6, but the sample output is 9, which is higher.

So, perhaps the cost is not just the sum of the number of '1's before each '0', but something else.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the positions of the '0's minus some offset.

But that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix the positions of the '0's and see how much it costs to move the '1's past them.

For each '0' at position j, for each '1' at position i < j, I need to move the '1' past the '0'. To do that, I can perform a shift on the substring from i to j, which costs j - i + 1.

But if I do this for each inversion separately, the total cost would be high.

Instead, I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like optimizing the way shifts are performed to cover multiple inversions at once.

Perhaps I can find contiguous blocks of inversions and perform shifts on those blocks.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define that a shift on a substring [l, r] can correct all inversions where a '1' at position i < r is moved past a '0' at position j > i.

So, performing a shift on [l, r] corrects all inversions where '1's before some '0's within the substring.

I need to cover all inversions with such shifts, minimizing the total cost.

This sounds like a classic optimization problem, possibly solvable with dynamic programming.

Let me consider defining dp[i], where dp[i] is the minimal cost to sort the first i characters of the string.

Then, dp[i] can be computed based on dp[j] for j < i, plus the cost of shifting some substring from j+1 to i.

But I need to find the right way to define the transitions.

This seems too vague. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look at the problem again. Since the string consists only of '0's and '1's, perhaps I can count the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's and calculate the cost based on their positions.

Wait, but I need to consider the minimal cost to perform these movements using shifts.

Another idea: since shifting a substring can be seen as moving the last character to the front, it can be used to rearrange the substring in a specific way.

Perhaps I can model this as reversing parts of the string, similar to sorting permutations with reversals.

But in this problem, it's about cyclic shifts, not reversals.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted, minimized.

Wait, but I need a way to calculate that directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's multiplied by some factor.

But in the first sample, there's one inversion and the cost is 2, which is higher than the number of inversions.

In the third sample, there are six inversions and the cost is 9, which is higher.

So, perhaps the cost is not directly proportional to the number of inversions.

Wait, maybe the cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, multiplied by the position of the '0'.

Wait, in "101011":

- '0' at position 2: 1 '1' before it.

- '0' at position 4: 2 '1's before it.

Total: 1 + 2 = 3.

But the sample output is 5, which is more than 3.

In "11000":

- '0' at position 3: 2 '1's before it.

- '0' at position 4: 2 '1's before it.

- '0' at position 5: 2 '1's before it.

Total: 6.

But the sample output is 9, which is 6 + 3.

Wait, 6 plus the number of '0's?

No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' plus the positions of the '0's.

But in "101011", it would be 1 + 2 + positions 2 and 4, which is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9, which is higher than the sample output of 5.

This doesn't match.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' can be shifted in groups.

For example, in "101011", I can perform shifts to move the '1's to the right in a grouped manner.

Perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's that need to be moved plus something.

But again, this is too vague.

Wait, maybe I can think of the problem as moving each '1' that is before some '0' to the right of all '0's.

Each such move can be done by performing a shift that includes the '1' and the '0's after it.

The cost would be the length of the shift, which is the position of the '0' minus the position of the '1' plus one.

But if I do this for each '1' and '0' pair separately, the total cost would be high.

Instead, I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to grouping similar operations in sorting algorithms to reduce the total number of steps.

Perhaps I can find runs of '1's that need to be moved and perform shifts on those runs.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have '0's at positions p1, p2, ..., pk and '1's at positions q1, q2, ..., qm.

I need to move all '1's that are before some '0' to the right of all '0's.

For each '1' that needs to be moved, I can calculate the minimal cost to move it past all the '0's it is before.

But this seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider precomputing the prefix sums of '1's.

For example, in "101011", the prefix sums are:

- pos 1: 1

- pos 2: 1

- pos 3: 2

- pos 4: 2

- pos 5: 3

- pos 6: 4

In the sorted string, the '1's should be at the end.

So, the number of '1's before a '0' indicates how many '1's need to be moved past that '0'.

But I need to find a way to group these movements.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, multiplied by the number of positions each '1' needs to be shifted.

But I need to think about the cost in terms of the shifts performed.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in bubble sort, the number of swaps needed is equal to the number of inversions.

But in this problem, each shift can affect multiple inversions at once.

Perhaps I can find a way to group inversions and perform shifts that correct multiple inversions simultaneously.

But I need a way to calculate the minimal cost without simulating each shift.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the distance they need to be moved.

But I need to relate this to the shifts performed.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a series of shifts that move blocks of '1's past blocks of '0's.

For example, in "101011", I can perform shifts to move the '1's at positions 1 and 3 past the '0's at positions 2 and 4.

I need to find a sequence of shifts that achieves this with minimal total cost.

This still doesn't give me a concrete formula.

Let me consider that for each '0', I need to move all '1's before it past this '0'.

Each such movement can be done with a shift that includes the '1' and the '0', costing j - i + 1, where i is the position of the '1' and j is the position of the '0'.

But if I perform a shift on a larger substring that includes multiple '1's and '0's, I can correct multiple inversions at once.

So, perhaps I can group the inversions and perform shifts that cover multiple inversions, thereby reducing the total cost.

This sounds promising, but I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift cost to move them past the '0'.

But I need to find a way to calculate this without iterating over each inversion separately.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of '1's that need to be moved past each '0', and add the appropriate cost based on the positions.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

First sample: "10" -> cost 2.

Second sample: "0000" -> cost 0.

Third sample: "11000" -> cost 9.

Fourth sample: "101011" -> cost 5.

Fifth sample: "01101001" -> cost 11.

Let me try to compute something for these samples.

For "10":

- One inversion: (1,2)

- Cost: 2

For "0000":

- No inversions

- Cost: 0

For "11000":

- Inversions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)

- Total inversions: 6

- Sample cost: 9

For "101011":

- Inversions: (1,2), (3,4)

- Total inversions: 2

- Sample cost: 5

For "01101001":

- Let's count the inversions:

- '0' at position 1: 0 '1's before it

- '1' at position 2: 1 '0' before it

- '1' at position 3: 1 '0' before it

- '0' at position 4: 2 '1's before it

- '1' at position 5: 3 '0's before it

- '0' at position 6: 3 '1's before it

- '0' at position 7: 3 '1's before it

- '1' at position 8: 4 '0's before it

Total inversions: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 17

But the sample cost is 11, which is less than 17, so just summing the number of '1's before each '0' isn't the cost.

Wait, perhaps the cost is the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by some factor.

In "101011", sum is 1 + 2 = 3, but cost is 5.

In "11000", sum is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, but cost is 9.

So, maybe the cost is sum multiplied by something like the number of '0's or positions.

But 3 multiplied by 2 is 6, which is not matching the sample cost of 5.

In "01101001", sum is 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 17, but cost is 11.

This suggests that the cost is not directly related to the sum of '1's before each '0'.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that for each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0', I can perform a shift that moves the '1' past one '0' at a time, each costing a certain amount.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved past each '0', and the cost is the position of the '0' minus the position of the '1' plus one.

But calculating this for each inversion separately would be inefficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift cost to move them past the '0'.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the positions where the string is not sorted and perform shifts on those regions.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximal substrings that are already sorted and only perform shifts on the unsorted parts.

But in the given problem, shifts can be performed on any substring, not just unsorted parts.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift length needed to move the '1' past the '0'.

But I need to find a way to calculate this without iterating over each inversion separately.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of '1's that have not yet been moved past the '0's.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a counter for the number of '1's seen so far.

Initialize the total cost to 0.

Iterate through the string:

- If the character is '1', increment the '1's counter.

- If the character is '0', add the current '1's counter to the total cost.

This is similar to counting the number of inversions.

In "101011":

- pos 1: '1' -> ones = 1

- pos 2: '0' -> cost += 1, cost=1

- pos 3: '1' -> ones = 2

- pos 4: '0' -> cost += 2, cost=3

- pos 5: '1' -> ones = 3

- pos 6: '1' -> ones = 4

Total cost = 3

But the sample output is 5, which is higher.

Similarly, in "11000":

- pos 1: '1' -> ones = 1

- pos 2: '1' -> ones = 2

- pos 3: '0' -> cost += 2, cost=2

- pos 4: '0' -> cost += 2, cost=4

- pos 5: '0' -> cost += 2, cost=6

Total cost = 6

But the sample output is 9, which is higher.

So, perhaps there is an additional factor.

Wait, maybe the cost is not just the number of '1's before each '0', but the positions as well.

Let me try to adjust the formula.

Perhaps the cost is the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them multiplied by the distance they need to be moved.

But I need to relate this to the shift operations.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that for each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0', the minimal shift cost is the position of the '0' minus the position of the '1' plus one.

But summing this over all inversions would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift length, which is the distance between the '1' and the '0' plus one.

But again, this seems too slow.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the position of the '0'.

In "101011":

- '0' at pos 2: 1 '1' before it -> cost += 1*2 = 2

- '0' at pos 4: 2 '1's before it -> cost += 2*4 = 8

Total cost = 10, which is higher than the sample output of 5.

Not matching.

In "11000":

- '0' at pos 3: 2 '1's before it -> cost += 2*3 = 6

- '0' at pos 4: 2 '1's before it -> cost += 2*4 = 8

- '0' at pos 5: 2 '1's before it -> cost += 2*5 = 10

Total cost = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24, which is way higher than the sample output of 9.

Definitely not this.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift length needed to move the '1' past the '0'.

But I need to find a way to compute this without iterating over each inversion separately.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to group the shifts.

Suppose I perform a shift on a substring that contains multiple '1's and '0's, thereby correcting multiple inversions in one operation.

For example, in "11000", shifting [1,3] ("110" -> "011") corrects two inversions at once, costing 3.

Then, shifting [3,5] ("110" -> "011") corrects one inversion, costing 3.

Total cost is 6, but the sample output is 9.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform additional shifts to fully sort the string.

In "11000", after first shift [1,3]: "11000" -> "01100"

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the sample.

So, in this case, three shifts of length 3 each.

Is there a pattern here?

In "101011", perhaps two shifts of length 3 each could sort it.

Wait, let's try:

Original: "101011"

Shift [1,3]: "101011" -> "011011"

Now, the string is "011011"

Shift [4,6]: "011011" -> "011011" (no change, already sorted?)

Wait, "011011" is not sorted. I need to move the '1' at position 5 past the '0' at position 4.

So, perform another shift [4,6]: "011011" -> "10111", which is "01111".

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, "011011", shifting [4,6]: "011011" -> "10111", which is "01111", which is sorted.

Total cost: 3 + 3 = 6, but the sample output is 5.

So, perhaps there's a better sequence of shifts.

Alternatively, maybe one shift of length 5: [1,5]: "11010" -> "01101", and then shift [3,6]: "1011" -> "1101", which doesn't sort it.

This is getting too complicated.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by a factor that represents the minimal shift needed to move the '1' past the '0'.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by the minimal shift length, which is the distance between the '1' and the '0' plus one.

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, multiplied by the minimal shift length that can cover the '1' and the '0'.

In other words, for each '0' at position j, and each '1' before it at position i, the minimal shift length is j - i + 1.

So, the total cost would be the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, each multiplied by (j - i + 1).

But this is still O(n^2).

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix sums of '1's and then compute the total cost using some formula.

Let me define prefix_ones[i] as the number of '1's in the first i characters.

Then,
