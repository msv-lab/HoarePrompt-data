Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n sticks, each with a length of 2 raised to the power of a certain number, specifically 2^{a_i} for each stick i. I need to choose exactly 3 sticks and form a non-degenerate triangle with them. A non-degenerate triangle means that the area is greater than 0, which in terms of stick lengths translates to the triangle inequality holding: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

First, I need to understand the properties of the lengths given. Since the lengths are of the form 2^{a_i}, and exponents are integers between 0 and n, the lengths are all positive powers of 2, which are distinct except if a_i are equal.

Given that, I need to find the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they satisfy the triangle inequality.

Let me think about the properties of powers of 2. Powers of 2 are strictly increasing: 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, and so on. An important property is that for any three distinct powers of 2, say 2^a, 2^b, and 2^c where a < b < c, the sum of the two smaller ones is 2^a + 2^b. Since a < c and b < c, 2^a + 2^b < 2^c because 2^b < 2^c and 2^a < 2^c, but I need to see if 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Wait, no. Actually, for powers of 2, 2^{k} + 2^{k} = 2^{k+1}, but for distinct exponents, say 2^a + 2^b where a < b, that's equal to 2^a (1 + 2^{b-a}), which is less than 2^{b+1}, but I need to compare it with 2^c.

Let me try with some examples.

Take a_i = 0,1,2:

Lengths: 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4

Check if 1 + 2 > 4? 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 4. So, these do not form a triangle.

Another example: a_i = 1,1,1

Lengths: 2^1 = 2, 2^1 = 2, 2^1 = 2

2 + 2 > 2, yes, so they form a triangle.

Another one: a_i = 2,2,3

Lengths: 4,4,8

4 + 4 = 8, which is not greater than 8, so no triangle.

Wait, but the problem says strictly greater than 0 area, so the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side.

So, in the case where sum of two sides equals the third, it's degenerate and area is 0.

Hence, in the case where a_i are all equal, say a_i = k, then lengths are all 2^k, so 2^k + 2^k = 2^{k+1}, which is greater than 2^k, so it forms a triangle.

If two a_i are equal and the third is different, say a,b,c with a = b < c, then 2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}, which may or may not be greater than 2^c depending on c.

Wait, 2^{a+1} > 2^c if and only if a+1 > c.

So, for a = b < c, it forms a triangle if a+1 > c.

But since a < c, a+1 >= c, so if a+1 > c, which is equivalent to a >= c, but a < c, so it's impossible.

Wait, no: a < c, so a+1 > c only if c <= a, which contradicts a < c.

Hence, when a = b < c, it never forms a triangle because 2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1} <= 2^c since a+1 <= c.

Wait, actually, since a < c, a+1 <= c, so 2^{a+1} <= 2^c, hence 2^a + 2^a <= 2^c, which means it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality strictly.

Therefore, in this case, it doesn't form a triangle.

Wait, but in the example where a_i =1,1,2:

Lengths: 2,2,4

2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4, so no triangle.

Another example: a_i =2,2,3:

Lengths:4,4,8

4 + 4 =8, which is not greater than 8, so no triangle.

But if a_i =2,2,2:

Lengths:4,4,4

4 +4 >4, so yes.

Hence, for a_i where all three are equal, it forms a triangle.

If two are equal and the third is larger, it doesn't form a triangle.

If all three are different, it doesn't form a triangle, as the sum of the two smaller ones is less than or equal to the largest one.

Wait, in the first test case, where all a_i are 1, so all lengths are 2, and it says any three sticks can form a triangle, which makes sense because 2 + 2 > 2.

Another test case: a_i =3,2,1,3

Lengths:8,4,2,8

Possible triangles:

Choose 8,4,2: 4 + 2 =6 <8, no.

Choose 8,4,8: 4 +8 >8, and 8 +8 >4, and 4 +8 >8, so yes.

Choose 8,2,8: same as above.

Choose 4,2,8: 2 +4 =6 <8, no.

Hence, only two valid triangles.

Third test case:1,2,3

Lengths:2,4,8

As before, 2 +4 <=8, so no triangle.

Fourth test case:1

Only one stick, can't form any triangle, so 0.

Hence, the problem reduces to counting the number of triplets (a,b,c) where a <= b <= c, and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that a_i can be up to n, and n can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, we need an efficient solution.

First, note that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

If a < c and b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c, which is not greater than 2^c.

Hence, for the sum to be greater than 2^c, at least one of a or b must be equal to c.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a < c and b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c, which is not greater than 2^c.

Hence, to have 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, at least one of a or b must be >= c.

But since a <= b <= c, having b >= c would imply b = c.

Hence, b = c.

Similarly, if a = c, but a <= b <= c, so a = b = c.

Hence, the only possibilities are:

1. a = b = c

2. a < b = c

So, in the first case, a = b = c, which corresponds to choosing three sticks of the same length.

In the second case, a < b = c, which corresponds to choosing two sticks of the same length and one stick of a smaller length.

Hence, the total number of valid triangles is the sum of:

- The number of ways to choose three sticks with the same a_i.

- The number of ways to choose two sticks with the same a_i and one stick with a smaller a_j.

Given that, I can group the sticks by their a_i values.

Letâ€™s sort the a_i in non-decreasing order.

Then, for each a_i, count the frequency of each a_i.

Let freq[a_i] be the number of sticks with a_i.

Then, for the first case, the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same a_i is C(freq[a_i], 3) for each a_i, summed over all a_i.

For the second case, for each a_i, choose two sticks with a_i and one stick with a_j where a_j < a_i.

So, for each a_i, the number of ways is C(freq[a_i], 2) * (sum of freq[a_j] for a_j < a_i).

Hence, overall, the total number of valid triangles is:

Sum over a_i of C(freq[a_i], 3) + C(freq[a_i], 2) * (sum of freq[a_j] for a_j < a_i)

To compute this efficiently, we can sort the a_i and compute prefix sums of freq[a_j].

Given that a_i can be up to n, which is up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, we need an O(n log n) solution.

Hence, for each test case, sort the a_i and compute prefix sums of freq[a_j].

Then, for each a_i, compute C(freq[a_i], 2) * prefix[a_i - 1] + C(freq[a_i], 3)

Where prefix[a_i -1] is the sum of freq[a_j] for a_j < a_i.

To handle a_i =0, which is possible, we need to handle a_i from 0 to n.

Hence, we can initialize a frequency array freq[0..n], where freq[k] is the number of sticks with a_i =k.

Then, compute prefix sums prefix[k] = sum of freq[j] for j from 0 to k-1.

Then, for each k from 0 to n:

ans += C(freq[k], 3)

ans += C(freq[k], 2) * prefix[k-1] if k >=1 else 0

Where C(n, k) is the combination number, C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! )

We can compute C(freq[k], 2) = freq[k] * (freq[k] -1) / 2

C(freq[k], 3) = freq[k] * (freq[k] -1) * (freq[k] -2) / 6

Hence, the algorithm is:

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read a1, a2, ..., an

- Initialize freq[0..n] to 0

- For each a_i, increment freq[a_i]

- Compute prefix[k] = sum of freq[j] for j from 0 to k-1

- Initialize ans =0

- For k from 0 to n:

if freq[k] >=3:

ans += freq[k] * (freq[k]-1) * (freq[k]-2) /6

if freq[k] >=2 and k >=1:

ans += freq[k] * (freq[k]-1)/2 * prefix[k-1]

- Output ans

This should work efficiently, as for each test case, it's O(n).

But considering t up to 10^4 and sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, it's acceptable.

Looking back at the code provided:

It seems to implement this logic.

Let's see:

- Read all input at once

- Parse data into variables

- For each test case:

- Read n

- Read n a_i's

- Initialize v[0..n] to 0

- For each a_i, increment v[a_i]

- Initialize cnt =0

- Initialize ans =0

- For i from 0 to n:

if v[i] >=2:

ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i]-1)//2

if v[i] >=3:

ans += v[i] * (v[i]-1) * (v[i]-2)//6

cnt += v[i]

- Append ans to results

- Print all results

This seems to match the logic I described, where cnt is the prefix sum up to k-1.

Wait, cnt is accumulated as cnt += v[i], which means cnt after processing i is sum of v[j] for j from 0 to i.

But in the loop, for each i, it first adds cnt * C(v[i],2) and then adds C(v[i],3).

Wait, but in my earlier logic, for each k, ans += C(freq[k],3) + C(freq[k],2) * prefix[k-1]

In the code, it's ans += cnt * C(v[i],2) + C(v[i],3)

But cnt is sum of v[j] for j from 0 to i.

Wait, but we need prefix[k-1], which is sum of freq[j] for j from 0 to k-1.

In the code, for each i, it's using cnt as prefix[i], and then adding cnt * C(v[i],2), but it should be prefix[i-1] * C(v[i],2)

Hence, it seems off by one.

Wait, perhaps it's because cnt is incremented after using it.

Wait, in the loop:

for i in range(n + 1):

if v[i] >= 2:

ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2

if v[i] >= 3:

ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6

cnt += v[i]

So, for i=0:

cnt =0

if v[0] >=2:

ans += 0 * v[0]*(v[0]-1)//2

if v[0] >=3:

ans += v[0]*(v[0]-1)*(v[0]-2)//6

cnt += v[0]

For i=1:

if v[1] >=2:

ans += v[0] * v[1]*(v[1]-1)//2

if v[1] >=3:

ans += v[1]*(v[1]-1)*(v[1]-2)//6

cnt += v[1]

...

So, cnt at iteration i is sum of v[j] for j from 0 to i-1.

Hence, ans += cnt * C(v[i],2) is equivalent to ans += prefix[i-1] * C(v[i],2)

Which matches the logic I described earlier.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Let me verify with the first test case:

n=7, a_i=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

So, v[1]=7, v[0]=0, v[2..7]=0

cnt starts at 0

For i=0: v[0]=0, skip

For i=1: v[1]=7 >=2, ans += 0 * 7*6//2 =0; v[1]>=3, ans +=7*6*5//6=35; cnt +=7

For i=2 to 7: v[i]=0, skip

Hence, ans=35, which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

n=4, a_i=[3,2,1,3]

v[1]=1, v[2]=1, v[3]=2

cnt=0

i=0: v[0]=0, skip

i=1: v[1]=1 >=2? no

i=2: v[2]=1 >=2? no

i=3: v[3]=2 >=2, ans += (1+v2) * 2*1//2 = (1+1)*1=2; v[3]>=3? no

Wait, in the code, cnt is sum of v[j] for j from 0 to i-1.

At i=3, cnt = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] =0+1+1=2

Hence, ans += 2 * 2*1//2 =2*1=2

Then, v[3]>=3? no

Hence, ans=2, which matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=3, a_i=[1,2,3]

v[1]=1, v[2]=1, v[3]=1

cnt=0

i=0: v[0]=0, skip

i=1: v[1]=1 >=2? no

i=2: v[2]=1 >=2? no

i=3: v[3]=1 >=2? no

Hence, ans=0, matches the third test case.

Fourth test case:

n=1, a_i=[1]

v[1]=1

cnt=0

i=0: v[0]=0, skip

i=1: v[1]=1 >=2? no

Hence, ans=0, matches the fourth test case.

Hence, the code seems correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given set such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. The lengths of the sticks are given by \(2^{a_i}\), where \(a_i\) are integers.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Triangle Inequality**:
    - For three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
    - Given the lengths are powers of 2, we need to check when \(2^{a} + 2^{b} > 2^{c}\) for \(a \leq b \leq c\).

2. **Key Observations**:
    - If all three exponents are equal, i.e., \(a = b = c\), then \(2^{a} + 2^{b} = 2^{a+1} > 2^{c}\) since \(a = b = c\).
    - If two exponents are equal and larger than the third, i.e., \(a < b = c\), then \(2^{a} + 2^{b} = 2^{a} + 2^{b} \leq 2^{b+1}\), which may or may not be greater than \(2^{c}\). Given \(b = c\), this simplifies to checking if \(2^{a} + 2^{b} > 2^{b}\), which holds only if \(a \geq b\), but since \(a < b\), it doesn't hold.

3. **Counting Valid Triangles**:
    - Group sticks by their exponent values.
    - For each group with exponent \(k\), count combinations where:
        - All three sticks have the same exponent.
        - Two sticks have exponent \(k\) and one stick has a smaller exponent.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
    - Use frequency counting for exponents.
    - Maintain a prefix sum to quickly get the total number of sticks with exponents less than \(k\).

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        cnt = 0
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
    - Parse the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - Read \( n \), the number of sticks.
    - Read the list of exponents \( a_i \).
    - Initialize a frequency array \( v \) where \( v[k] \) counts the number of sticks with exponent \( k \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles**:
    - Use a prefix sum \( cnt \) to keep track of the total number of sticks with exponents less than the current exponent \( i \).
    - For each exponent \( i \):
        - If there are at least two sticks with exponent \( i \), add the product of combinations of two sticks from \( i \) and the prefix sum of sticks with smaller exponents.
        - If there are at least three sticks with exponent \( i \), add the combinations of three sticks from \( i \).
        - Update the prefix sum \( cnt \) with the count of sticks with exponent \( i \).

4. **Output the Results**:
    - Collect the results for all test cases and print them.

This approach ensures efficient counting of valid triangles by leveraging combinatorial mathematics and prefix sums, achieving the required time complexity for large input sizes.
