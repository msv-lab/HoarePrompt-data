Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a certain number of each type of card, given by a_i for each i from 1 to n. Then, I can buy up to k new cards, and each new card can be any number from 1 to n. After buying these cards, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. Essentially, these subarrays should contain each number from 1 to n exactly once.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n]. It's any arrangement of these numbers where each appears exactly once. So, in the context of the array, any sequence of n consecutive elements that contains each number from 1 to n exactly once is a valid permutation.

My goal is to maximize the number of such subarrays after buying up to k additional cards and arranging all cards in a line.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to maximize the number of such subarrays is to create as many non-overlapping permutations as possible in the array. Since each permutation is of length n, the maximum number of such permutations in an array of length L is floor(L / n). However, I need to consider that buying k cards allows me to extend the array up to its current length plus k.

But wait, I need to think differently. The number of subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] depends on how the cards are arranged. If I can arrange the cards such that there are as many sequences of n cards as possible, each being a permutation, then that's what I need.

I recall that in array arrangement problems, especially those involving permutations, it's often useful to think in terms of the frequency of each element and how they can be distributed to form the required patterns.

Given that I can buy up to k additional cards, each of which can be any number from 1 to n, I can increase the frequency of any number to help form more permutations.

Let me consider the frequencies of each number. Initially, I have a_i cards of number i. I can increase a_i by buying more cards of that number, up to k in total.

But simply increasing frequencies might not be enough; I need to arrange the cards in such a way that there are as many n-length windows that are permutations.

I think it would be helpful to think about the problem in terms of sliding a window of size n across the array and counting how many times that window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

To maximize this count, I need to maximize the number of positions where this condition holds.

I need a strategy to determine how many such windows can exist given the frequencies of the numbers and the ability to buy up to k additional cards.

Let me consider the minimum frequency among all numbers. If I have a bottleneck where one number has a very low frequency, it might limit the number of permutations I can form.

Suppose the minimum frequency among a_1 to a_n is m. Then, the maximum number of permutations I can form is m, because each permutation needs one of each number.

But wait, I can buy additional cards to increase the frequencies. So, I can potentially increase the minimum frequency by buying cards for the numbers that have lower frequencies.

Let me formalize this.

Let me find the minimum frequency among all a_i's, say min_a. If I can increase this min_a by buying cards for the numbers that have frequencies below min_a, then I can potentially increase the number of permutations.

Wait, actually, to maximize the number of permutations, I need to make sure that all a_i's are at least as frequent as the number of permutations I want to form.

Let me denote the number of permutations I can form as p. Then, for each i from 1 to n, a_i must be at least p, because each permutation requires one card of each number.

So, p cannot be greater than the minimum of a_i's.

But I can buy k additional cards to increase the frequencies.

So, I can increase the frequencies of the numbers that have a_i < p, by buying cards for them.

The total number of cards I need to buy to make all a_i >= p is sum(max(p - a_i, 0) for all i).

I need this sum to be <= k, the number of coins I have.

So, for a given p, I can check if sum(max(p - a_i, 0) for all i) <= k.

If it is, then p is achievable; otherwise, it's not.

My goal is to find the maximum p such that this sum is <= k.

This sounds like a classic binary search problem on p.

I can perform a binary search on p, from 0 to some upper limit.

What should be the upper limit for p?

Well, the maximum possible p is the minimum of a_i plus floor(k / n), because each additional permutation requires n more cards (one of each number).

Wait, but I can buy up to k cards, and each new card can be any number from 1 to n.

So, the maximum p is limited by the smallest a_i plus floor((k - sum(ceiling(p - a_i))) / n).

Wait, this seems a bit complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to form p permutations, each requiring n cards, one of each number.

So, for each number i, I need at least p cards.

If a_i < p, I need to buy p - a_i cards of number i.

So, the total number of cards I need to buy is sum(max(p - a_i, 0) for all i).

This sum must be <= k.

I need to find the maximum p such that this sum is <= k.

This can be computed using binary search on p.

Once I find this p, then the number of permutations I can form is p, and the number of subarrays of length n that are permutations is p.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that there might be overlapping permutations, or something like that.

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1]. So, I can buy 10 more cards, all of which can be 1, so the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The number of subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1] is 11, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]. So, I have 8 cards of 1 and 4 cards of 2. I can buy 4 more cards, all of which can be 2, so a becomes [8,8]. Then, I can arrange the array in a way that there are as many permutations of [1,2] as possible.

From the explanation, it's [1,2,1,2,...], totaling 15 subarrays that are permutations.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, p would be the minimum of a_i after buying cards.

In this case, a=[8,8], so p=8.

But 8*2=16, which is more than the total number of cards, which is 8+8=16.

So, the number of subarrays of length 2 that are permutations should be 8, but the output is 15.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Apparently, by arranging the cards in an alternating fashion, I can get more permutations.

Wait, in the second test case, they bought 4 cards of type 2, making a=[8,8], and arranged them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which has 8 subarrays of [1,2] and 7 subarrays of [2,1], totaling 15.

But according to my earlier logic, p=8, but the number of subarrays is 15, which is higher.

So, my initial approach is missing something.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps, instead of just considering non-overlapping permutations, I need to consider that overlapping permutations can be counted multiple times.

In the second test case, by arranging [1,2,1,2,...], each pair [1,2] and [2,1] is a permutation, and they overlap.

So, the total number is not just p, but more.

So, I need a better way to calculate the number of such subarrays.

Let me think about a general arrangement.

Suppose I have an array of length L.

The number of subarrays of length n is L - n + 1.

Each of these subarrays needs to be a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

So, to maximize the number of such subarrays, I need to maximize the number of positions where a window of size n is a permutation.

This is similar to maximizing the number of times a sliding window of size n contains each number exactly once.

I need to arrange the cards in such a way that as many n-length windows as possible are permutations.

I recall that in string problems, there are techniques to slide windows and count certain patterns.

But in this case, I have frequencies of numbers and the ability to buy additional cards.

I need to find a way to arrange the cards to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears and ensure that in every window of size n, each number appears exactly once.

But this seems tricky.

Let me consider the frequencies.

Suppose I have frequencies a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and I can buy up to k additional cards, each of any number from 1 to n.

I need to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

I need a better plan.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in some problems involving permutations in sliding windows, the number of such windows can be calculated based on the frequencies of elements.

But in this problem, since I can choose to buy cards and arrange them, I have more control over the arrangement.

I think the key is to maximize the number of positions where a window of size n is a permutation.

To do this, I need to arrange the cards such that as many n-length segments as possible contain each number exactly once.

One way to achieve this is to create a sequence where the numbers are arranged in a repeating permutation pattern.

For example, for n=2, arranging [1,2,1,2,1,2,...] would ensure that every window of size 2 is a permutation.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...] would ensure that every window of size 3 is a permutation.

But I need to consider the frequencies of each number.

In this arrangement, each number appears with a period of n.

So, in a sequence of length L, each number appears floor(L / n) times, plus possibly some extras depending on the remainder.

Given that, if I arrange the sequence in this repeating permutation pattern, and ensure that I have enough cards of each number to fill their required positions, then I can maximize the number of permutation windows.

So, in this arrangement, the number of permutation windows would be floor((L - n) / n) + 1, but I need to verify this.

Wait, more carefully, in a sequence arranged as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...], every consecutive n elements form a permutation.

So, in a sequence of length L, the number of n-length windows is L - n + 1.

In this arrangement, each window is a permutation, provided that I have enough cards of each number.

So, in this ideal case, the number of permutation windows is L - n + 1.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards of each number to maintain this pattern.

In this pattern, each number appears floor(L / n) times, plus an extra time if its position is among the first L mod n.

To maximize the number of permutation windows, I need to make sure that I can extend this pattern as much as possible, given the initial cards and the k additional cards I can buy.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the maximum L such that I can arrange the first L elements in this repeating permutation pattern, given the constraints on a_i and k.

Given that, I need to find the maximum L such that:

For each i from 1 to n, the number of times i appears in the first L elements is less than or equal to a_i plus the number of new cards of type i that I buy.

In the repeating pattern, the number of times each number appears in the first L elements is floor(L / n) plus 1 if i <= L mod n.

So, for each i, floor(L / n) + (1 if i <= L mod n else 0) <= a_i + b_i, where b_i is the number of new cards of type i bought.

The total number of new cards bought is sum(b_i for all i) <= k.

I need to maximize L such that this condition holds.

Given that, the number of permutation windows would be L - n + 1.

Wait, but in the ideal arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation, so the number of permutation windows is floor((L - n) / n) + 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the ideal arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation, so the number of such windows is L - n + 1, provided that L >= n.

But in practice, it might not be possible to arrange the entire sequence in this ideal way due to frequency constraints.

So, perhaps I need to find the maximum L such that the first L elements can be arranged in the repeating permutation pattern, and then the number of permutation windows would be floor((L - n) / n) + 1.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- L: total number of cards after buying.

- For each i, the number of times i appears in the first L elements should be floor(L / n) + (1 if i <= L mod n else 0).

- I need to ensure that for each i, floor(L / n) + (1 if i <= L mod n else 0) <= a_i + b_i, where sum(b_i) <= k.

I need to maximize L under these constraints.

Once I have L, the number of permutation windows would be floor((L - n) / n) + 1.

Wait, but in the ideal arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation, so the number of such windows should be L - n + 1.

But I need to verify this.

Wait, no. In the ideal arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation only if the sequence is perfectly periodic with period n, which may not be achievable due to frequency constraints.

I need a better way to calculate the number of permutation windows.

Let me consider that in the ideal arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation, so the number of such windows is floor((L - n) / n) + 1.

But I need to confirm this formula.

Wait, no. The number of subarrays of length n in a sequence of length L is L - n + 1, regardless of n.

So, in the ideal arrangement, all of them would be permutations, so the number of permutation windows is L - n + 1.

But in reality, it's limited by the frequencies.

So, perhaps I need to find the maximum L such that I can arrange the first L elements in the repeating permutation pattern, and then the number of permutation windows is L - n + 1.

But I need to make sure that L <= sum(a_i) + k, the total number of cards I have after buying.

Wait, but it's not just the total number of cards; I need to ensure that each individual a_i + b_i is at least the number of times i appears in the first L elements.

This seems a bit too involved.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found a similar problem where the goal is to maximize the number of sliding windows that are permutations.

In one approach, it's suggested to sort the frequencies and then iteratively increase the minimum frequency by buying cards.

But I need to see how that applies here.

Let me sort the a_i's in ascending order.

Let's say a_sorted = sorted(a).

Then, for a given p (number of permutations), the total number of cards needed is p * n + r, where r is the number of remaining positions filled with any numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of full blocks of n cards and the remainder.

I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the provided code and try to understand its logic.

The code sorts a in ascending order.

Then it initializes ans = a[0], which is the smallest a_i.

Then it initializes res = n - 1.

Then it loops from 0 to n-2 (i from 0 to n-2):

- Computes dif = a[i+1] - a[i]

- If dif == 0:

- res -= 1

- If dif != 0:

- If k >= dif * (i + 1):

- ans += dif

- k -= dif * (i + 1)

- res -= 1

- Else:

- ans += k // (i + 1)

- If i != 0:

- res += k % (i + 1)

- k = 0

- Break

If k != 0:

- ans += k // n

- res += k % n

Then, ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)

ans += res

And this is the final answer.

I need to understand what this code is doing.

It seems to be calculating the maximum number of permutations p, and then computing the number of permutation windows based on p and res.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me try to apply this logic to the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

sorted a=[1]

ans=1

res=0

No loop since n=1

Then, ans=1 + (1-1)*0 + 0 =1

But the output should be 11.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the final ans is ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res

For n=1, ans=1 + (1-1)*0 + 0=1, which doesn't match the output of 11.

So, perhaps there's something wrong with the code.

Wait, maybe I need to see the ans_list and how it's appended.

Wait, in the code, ans_list.append(ans), and then for each a in ans_list, print(a).

In the first test case, ans=1, but the output is 11.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to see the entire code again.

Looking back, perhaps I misread the problem or the code.

Wait, in the problem, the output for the first test case is 11, but according to the code, ans=1, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says "the first test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1<=t<=100)."

Wait, no, in the input, it's given as 8, and then 8 test cases follow.

But in the code, it's reading t=int(input()), then for _ in range(t):

read n,k

read a

then perform the operations.

So, perhaps the code is correct, and I misread the first test case.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1]

Then, sorted a=[1]

ans=1

res=0

No loop

Then, ans=1 + (1-1)*0 + 0=1

But the output is 11, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the number of contiguous subarrays of length n which are a permutation of [1,2,…,n]".

In the first test case, n=1, so subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1], which is just [1].

Given that a=[1], and k=10, so I can buy 10 more cards, all of which can be 1, so total cards are [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is 11 cards.

The number of subarrays of length 1 is 11, which matches the output of 11.

So, in this case, ans=1 + (1-1)*0 + 0=1, which doesn't match 11.

So, the code seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's something missing in my understanding.

Looking back at the code, it seems to calculate something different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res

For n=1, this would be ans += (1-1)*0 + 0=0, so ans remains 1, which doesn't match the output of 11.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, and I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, in the code, it appends ans to ans_list, and then for each ans in ans_list, it prints ans.

So, in the first test case, ans=1, but the output is 11, which doesn't match.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
