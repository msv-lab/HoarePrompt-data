Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper that starts at the top-left cell (1,1) and wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when compared character by character. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in trying to find the smallest string, I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Given that the grid is only 2 rows high, the paths are relatively straightforward to trace. From (1,1), the grasshopper can go right to (1,2) or down to (2,1), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

I need to think about how to efficiently find the smallest path and count the number of such paths.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs might help.

In the first sample:

n=2

s1 = 00

s2 = 00

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string = 000

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string = 000

Both paths give the same string '000', which is the smallest possible, and there are 2 such paths.

In the second sample:

n=4

s1 = 1101

s2 = 1100

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): string = 11010

2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 11000

3. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 11000

4. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 11000

The smallest string is '11000', and there's only one path that gives this string.

In the third sample:

n=8

s1 = 00100111

s2 = 11101101

Possible paths need to be considered to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that give that string.

From these examples, it seems that to get the smallest string, we need to choose paths that pick '0's as early as possible in the string.

Given that the grid is only 2 rows, I can model the paths and track the current position and the accumulated string.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, with the sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(N) per test case.

I need to think of a way to traverse the grid from (1,1) to (2,N), collecting the cells' values in order, and find the smallest possible string.

One way to approach this is to simulate the path choices, keeping track of the current path string and choosing the path that leads to the smallest string.

But since N is large, simulating each path isn't feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that at each step, the grasshopper can choose to go right or down, but it can't go up.

So, from (1,j), it can go to (1,j+1) or (2,j).

From (2,j), it can only go to (2,j+1).

Except for (2,N), which is the destination.

Wait, no. From (2,j), it can go to (2,j+1), but since it's already in the bottom row, it can't go down anymore.

Wait, actually, from (1,j), it can go to (1,j+1) or (2,j).

From (2,j), it can go to (2,j+1).

So, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves: right (R) and down (D), with the constraint that D can only be chosen when moving from row 1 to row 2.

Wait, more precisely, from (1,j), choose to go to (1,j+1) or (2,j).

From (2,j), choose to go to (2,j+1).

So, the only down move is from (1,j) to (2,j).

Once in row 2, you can only move right.

So, the path can be seen as a sequence of right moves and at most one down move.

Wait, no. You can have multiple down moves if N is large, but in this grid, since it's only 2 rows, you can have at most one down move per column.

Wait, actually, no. From (1,j), you can choose to go down to (2,j), and then only move right in row 2.

Or, you can choose to go right in row 1 to (1,j+1), and then decide again.

So, the path can have at most one down move, because once you go down to row 2, you can't go back to row 1.

Therefore, each path consists of moving right in row 1 for some columns, then optionally moving down to row 2 at some column, and then moving right in row 2 to the end.

So, the path is defined by the column where you decide to go down to row 2, if at all.

Wait, actually, you can choose to go down multiple times, but in this grid, since you can't go back up, and once you're in row 2, you have to stay in row 2.

But in this grid, since there are only two rows, you can only go down once, from row 1 to row 2.

So, effectively, the path is defined by the last column where you decide to go down from row 1 to row 2.

Wait, no. You can only go down once, from any column in row 1 to the corresponding column in row 2, and then continue only right in row 2.

So, the paths are:

- Stay in row 1 until column N, then go down to (2,N).

- Go down to row 2 at any column j, and then continue right to (2,N).

So, the possible paths are:

- Path 1: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... -> (1,N) -> (2,N)

- Path 2: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... -> (1,j) -> (2,j) -> (2,j+1) -> ... -> (2,N), for any j from 1 to N.

So, in total, there are N+1 possible paths.

Now, for each path, we can construct the string by collecting the cells in order.

For path 1: s1[1] s1[2] ... s1[N] s2[N]

For path 2 with down at j: s1[1] s1[2] ... s1[j] s2[j] s2[j+1] ... s2[N]

So, to find the lexicographically smallest string, I need to compare these N+1 strings and find the smallest one.

Then, count how many paths lead to that smallest string.

Given that N can be up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, with sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to find the smallest string and count the occurrences.

One way is to iterate through all possible down columns (j from 1 to N) and compare the strings s1[1..j] + s2[j..N], and also consider the path that stays in row 1 until the end.

But constructing each string and comparing them would be too slow for large N and T.

I need a smarter way to find the minimal string without generating all of them.

Let me think about how to compare these strings efficiently.

Given that the strings are of length N+1, comparing them directly would be O(N), which is too slow for the constraints.

I need a way to find the minimal string in O(N) time for all test cases combined.

Maybe I can find the minimal path by choosing, at each step, the smallest possible character.

Starting from the first character, which is always s1[1], since the grasshopper starts at (1,1).

Then, for the second character, I can choose to stay in row 1 or go down to row 2.

So, the second character in the string would be either s1[2] (if staying in row 1) or s2[1] (if going down at column 1).

I need to choose the smallest possible character at each step.

Wait, but the string is constructed by collecting the cells in order of the path.

So, if I choose to stay in row 1 until column j, and then go down to row 2, the string would be s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

So, to find the minimal string, I need to choose the j that results in the smallest s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

I need to find the j that minimizes s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string.

But directly comparing strings at each j would be too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation of prefix of s1 and suffix of s2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching from s1 to s2 gives the smallest possible string.

Let me consider that the string is s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

I need to find the j that minimizes this string.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string seen so far.

But again, comparing strings at each step is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal string in linear time.

Maybe I can precompute the minimal possible character at each position, considering all possible j's.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach or some kind of merging technique.

Let me think differently.

Imagine that I have two strings: s1 and s2.

I need to choose a split point j, such that s1[1..j] + s2[j..N] is minimized.

I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time, which is not acceptable.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where s1 differs from s2, and choose the path that picks the smallest character at that position.

But I need to consider the entire string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing whether to switch to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define dp[j] as the minimal string from column 1 to column j.

Wait, but strings are of length j+1 up to N.

This might not be the best approach.

Let me consider that the string is built by choosing to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at some point.

So, the minimal string would be the minimum among all s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

I need to find the j that gives the smallest such string.

To optimize this, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string.

But I need to do this efficiently.

Perhaps I can find the point where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that picks the smallest character at that position.

Wait, maybe I can find the earliest position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that picks the smallest character at that position.

But I need to consider that the strings are concatenated, so I need to consider the characters in order.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and at each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smallest character at that position.

But since once I switch to row 2, I can't go back to row 1, I need to make sure that I choose the switch point optimally.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the switch point j, where I go down from row 1 to row 2 at column j.

Then, the string is s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

I need to choose j such that this string is minimized.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string seen so far.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time.

I need a way to optimize this.

Perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for s2 and prefix strings for s1, and then compare them efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can consider the strings s1[1..j] + s2[j..N] and find a way to compare them in constant time after some preprocessing.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me consider that the string is s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and for each j, compare s1[1..j] + s2[j..N] with the current minimal string.

But comparing strings at each step is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the longest common prefix of all possible concatenations and then decide based on the differing character.

But that might not directly give me the minimal string.

Let me think about the properties of the minimal string.

The minimal string will be the one where the first character is as small as possible, then the second character is as small as possible, given the first character, and so on.

Given that, I need to choose the path that gives the smallest character at each position in the string.

Given the grid structure, I can model this as a path where I choose to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at some point.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the minimal possible character at each position, considering the possible choices.

Wait, maybe I can use a priority queue to keep track of the possible paths, ordered by the current string built so far.

But that might not be efficient enough for large N.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the path is defined by the column j where I switch from row 1 to row 2.

So, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and for each j, compute s1[1..j] + s2[j..N], and find the minimal such string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation in linear time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point j where s1[j] is smaller than s2[j], or vice versa, and choose accordingly.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just individual characters.

Wait, perhaps I can find the earliest position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that picks the smaller character at that position.

Then, for the remaining positions, I can choose accordingly.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that I iterate through the columns from left to right, and at each column, I decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I need to choose the switch point j that minimizes the concatenation s1[1..j] + s2[j..N].

To do this efficiently, I can find the first position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that picks the smaller character at that position.

Then, for the remaining positions, I can choose the path that gives the smallest possible characters.

This way, I can find the minimal string in linear time.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, find the first column j where s1[j] != s2[j].

If s1[j] < s2[j], then choosing to stay in row 1 up to j and then switch to row 2 would give a smaller string.

Otherwise, choosing to switch to row 2 at an earlier column would give a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Let me consider that if s1[j] < s2[j], then choosing to stay in row 1 up to j and then switch to row 2 would be better.

If s1[j] > s2[j], then choosing to switch to row 2 at an earlier column would be better.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just individual characters.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch to row 2 at the earliest possible column where it gives an advantage.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm.

Initialize the minimal string as s1[1..N] + s2[N].

Then, iterate through j from 1 to N:

- For each j, compare s1[1..j] + s2[j..N] with the current minimal string.

- If it's smaller, update the minimal string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation in linear time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point j where s1[1..j] + s2[j..N] is minimal by finding the point where s1 and s2 differ, and choosing the path that picks the smaller character at that position.

Then, for the remaining positions, follow the path that gives the smallest characters.

Let me try an example.

Take the first sample:

n=2

s1 = 00

s2 = 00

So, possible paths:

- j=2: s1[1..2] + s2[2..2] = 00 + 0 = 000

- j=1: s1[1..1] + s2[1..2] = 0 + 00 = 000

Both give the same string '000'.

So, minimal string is '000', and count is 2.

Another sample:

n=4

s1 = 1101

s2 = 1100

Possible paths:

- j=4: s1[1..4] + s2[4..4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

- j=3: s1[1..3] + s2[3..4] = 110 + 00 = 11000

- j=2: s1[1..2] + s2[2..4] = 11 + 000 = 11000

- j=1: s1[1..1] + s2[1..4] = 1 + 1000 = 11000

The minimal string is '11000', achieved by j=2 and j=3.

Wait, but in the sample output, it says only one path gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the second sample, the output says only one path gives '11000'.

But according to my calculation, j=2 and j=3 both give '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact paths.

Wait, in the second sample:

s1 = 1101

s2 = 1100

Paths:

- j=4: 1101 + 0 = 11010

- j=3: 110 + 00 = 11000

- j=2: 11 + 000 = 11000

- j=1: 1 + 1000 = 11000

But in the sample output, it says only one path gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the path construction.

Wait, no, in the second sample, the output says only one path gives '11000', but according to my calculation, multiple paths give '11000'.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in the second sample, the explanation says there's only one path that gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Wait, in the second sample, the explanation says:

"There is only one path that yields this string:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 11000"

But according to my earlier understanding, j=2 and j=3 both give '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider how the strings are constructed.

Wait, for j=3: path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s1[1] s1[2] s1[3] s2[3] s2[4] = 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

For j=2: path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s1[1] s1[2] s2[2] s2[3] s2[4] = 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

For j=1: path is (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

String: s1[1] s2[1] s2[2] s2[3] s2[4] = 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

So, all j=1, j=2, j=3 give '11000', but the sample output says only one path gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the path construction.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says there is only one path that gives '11000', but according to my calculation, there are three paths that give '11000'.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the path where j=4 gives '11010', which is larger, so only paths with j=1,2,3 give '11000', and among them, '11000' is smaller than '11010'.

But the sample output says only one path gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, in the second sample, the output is:

11000

1

But according to my calculation, three paths give '11000'.

Wait, maybe I need to check the problem statement again.

Wait, in the problem statement, for the second test case, it says:

"There is only one path that yields this string:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 11000"

But according to my understanding, j=1, j=2, j=3 all give '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that j=1 path is (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

j=2 path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

j=3 path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1 1 0 0 0 = '11000'

j=4 path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): 1 1 0 1 0 = '11010'

So, indeed, three paths give '11000', and one path gives '11010'.

But the sample output says only one path gives '11000'.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, maybe the problem considers only the minimal string and counts only the paths that give that minimal string.

But in this case
