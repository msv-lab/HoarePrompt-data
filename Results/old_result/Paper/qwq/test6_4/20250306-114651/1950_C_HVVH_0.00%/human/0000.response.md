Alright, I've got this problem to solve. The task is to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It seems straightforward, but I need to make sure I handle all the cases correctly.

First, let's understand the input and output formats. The input is a string in the format "hh:mm", where hh is the hour from 00 to 23, and mm is the minute from 00 to 59. The output should be in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", depending on the time.

I need to consider how the hour transitions between AM and PM. In the 12-hour format:

- 00:00 to 11:59 is AM.

- 12:00 to 23:59 is PM.

But there's a catch: in 12-hour format, 00:00 in 24-hour format is actually 12:00 AM, and 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM.

So, here are the steps I need to follow for each time conversion:

1. If the hour is 00, it should be converted to 12:mm AM.

2. If the hour is from 01 to 11, it should be hh:mm AM.

3. If the hour is 12, it should be 12:mm PM.

4. If the hour is from 13 to 23, it should be (h-12):mm PM.

Wait, but according to the example, 00:59 should be 12:59 AM, and 12:00 should be 12:00 AM. Hmm, in standard 12-hour format, 12:00 AM is midnight, and 12:00 PM is noon. But sometimes, people consider 12:00 AM as noon and 12:00 PM as midnight, which can be confusing.

Looking back at the example provided:

- 00:59 -> 12:59 AM

- 12:00 -> 12:00 AM

- 21:37 -> 09:37 PM

So, in this problem, 12:00 is considered as AM, which is a bit unusual because traditionally, 12:00 AM is midnight, and 12:00 PM is noon. But according to the example, 12:00 is AM, and probably 12:00 PM is something else.

Wait, in the example:

- 12:14 -> 12:14 PM

- 12:00 -> 12:00 PM

- 21:37 -> 09:37 PM

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me check the example again.

Looking back at the example input and output:

Input:

11

09:41

18:06

12:14

00:59

00:00

14:34

01:01

19:07

11:59

12:00

21:37

Output:

09:41 AM

06:06 PM

12:14 PM

12:59 AM

12:00 AM

02:34 PM

01:01 AM

07:07 PM

11:59 AM

12:00 PM

09:37 PM

So, from this:

- 09:41 -> 09:41 AM (correct, since 00 to 11 is AM)

- 18:06 -> 06:06 PM (18 - 12 = 6, PM)

- 12:14 -> 12:14 PM (12 remains 12, PM)

- 00:59 -> 12:59 AM (00 becomes 12, AM)

- 00:00 -> 12:00 AM (00 becomes 12, AM)

- 14:34 -> 02:34 PM (14 - 12 = 2, PM)

- 01:01 -> 01:01 AM (01 remains, AM)

- 19:07 -> 07:07 PM (19 - 12 = 7, PM)

- 11:59 -> 11:59 AM (11 remains, AM)

- 12:00 -> 12:00 PM (12 remains, PM)

- 21:37 -> 09:37 PM (21 - 12 = 9, PM)

So, the rule seems to be:

- If hour is 00, convert to 12:mm AM

- If hour is from 01 to 11, keep hh:mm AM

- If hour is 12, keep 12:mm PM

- If hour is from 13 to 23, convert to (h-12):mm PM

Wait, but in the output, 12:14 is 12:14 PM and 12:00 is 12:00 PM, which is standard. However, 00:00 is 12:00 AM, which is also standard.

So, perhaps I misremembered. In 12-hour format:

- 00:00 to 11:59 is AM

- 12:00 to 23:59 is PM

And 12:00 AM is midnight, and 12:00 PM is noon.

So, in the code, I need to handle:

- If hour is 00, convert to 12:mm AM

- If hour is from 1 to 11, keep hh:mm AM

- If hour is 12, keep 12:mm PM

- If hour is from 13 to 23, convert to (h-12):mm PM

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

day = 'AM'

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

(h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))

if h == 0:

h = 12

day = 'AM'

elif h > 12:

h = h - 12

day = 'PM'

else:

day = 'PM'

if h == 12:

day = 'AM'

print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

Wait, this seems to have a mistake.

Let's walk through the code with an example.

Take h = 00:

if h == 0:

h = 12

day = 'AM'

So, h becomes 12, day is AM.

Output: 12:mm AM Correct.

Take h = 11:

elif h > 12: No.

else:

day = 'PM'

if h == 12:

day = 'AM' But h is 11, so day remains PM.

Output: 11:mm PM Wait, but in the example, 11:59 is 11:59 AM.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, according to the code, for h = 11:

- h is not 0

- h is not greater than 12

- so, day = 'PM'

- h is not 12, so day remains PM

- Output: 11:mm PM

But in the example, it's 11:59 AM. So, there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

def func():

day = 'AM'

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

(h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))

if h == 0:

h = 12

day = 'AM'

elif h > 12:

h = h - 12

day = 'PM'

else:

day = 'PM'

if h == 12:

day = 'AM'

print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

The problem is in the else clause:

elif h > 12:

h = h - 12

day = 'PM'

else:

day = 'PM'

if h == 12:

day = 'AM'

So, for h = 11:

- h is not 0

- h is not greater than 12

- so, day = 'PM'

- h is 11, which is not 12, so day remains 'PM'

- Output: 11:mm PM

But according to the example, it should be 11:59 AM.

Similarly, for h = 12:

- h is not 0

- h is not greater than 12

- so, day = 'PM'

- h is 12, so day = 'AM'

- Output: 12:mm AM

But in the example, 12:14 is 12:14 PM and 12:00 is 12:00 PM.

This is inconsistent.

Wait, in the code, for h = 12:

- day is set to 'PM' in the else clause

- then, since h == 12, day is set to 'AM'

- so, output is 12:mm AM

But in the example, it's 12:14 PM and 12:00 PM.

So, the code is incorrect here.

Similarly, for h = 13:

- h > 12, so h = 13 - 12 = 1, day = 'PM'

- Output: 01:mm PM

But in the example, 14:34 is 02:34 PM, which matches.

Wait, for h = 14:

- h > 12, so h = 14 - 12 = 2, day = 'PM'

- Output: 02:34 PM Correct.

For h = 01:

- h is not 0

- h is not > 12

- so, day = 'PM'

- h is not 12, so day remains 'PM'

- Output: 01:01 PM But in the example, it's 01:01 AM.

So, clearly, the code is wrong.

The mistake is in the else clause:

else:

day = 'PM'

if h == 12:

day = 'AM'

This should be:

else:

if h == 12:

day = 'PM'

else:

day = 'AM'

Because, from 00:00 to 11:59 should be AM, and 12:00 to 23:59 should be PM.

But in the code, it's set to PM for h from 1 to 11, which is incorrect.

So, the correct logic should be:

- if h == 0:

h = 12

day = 'AM'

- elif h > 12:

h = h - 12

day = 'PM'

- else:

if h == 12:

day = 'PM'

else:

day = 'AM'

Wait, in the else clause (h <= 12 and h != 0):

- if h == 12:

day = 'PM'

- else:

day = 'AM'

This seems correct.

Wait, but according to the example, 12:00 is PM and 00:00 is AM, which matches this.

But earlier, I thought it was incorrect, but maybe I miscalculated.

Let's test with h = 11:

- h <= 12 and h != 0

- h == 11 != 12, so day = 'AM'

- Output: 11:mm AM Correct, as per example.

For h = 12:

- h <= 12 and h != 0

- h == 12, so day = 'PM'

- Output: 12:mm PM Correct.

For h = 00:

- h == 0:

h = 12

day = 'AM'

- Output: 12:mm AM Correct.

For h = 13:

- h > 12:

h = 13 - 12 = 1

day = 'PM'

- Output: 01:mm PM Correct.

For h = 1:

- h <= 12 and h != 0

- h != 12, so day = 'AM'

- Output: 01:mm AM Correct.

So, perhaps the code is correct after all.

I must have misread it earlier.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The program is correct.}} \]
