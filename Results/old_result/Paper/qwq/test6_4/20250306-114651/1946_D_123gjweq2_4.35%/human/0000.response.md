Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have an array `a` of length `n`, and a number `x`. I need to find the maximum number `k` such that I can split the array into `k` continuous subarrays where:

1. The first subarray starts at index 1 (or 0 in 0-based indexing).

2. The last subarray ends at index `n`.

3. Each subarray's XOR of elements is computed, and then all these XOR values are OR'ed together.

4. The result of this OR operation should be less than or equal to `x`.

If no such `k` exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an array, and we need to split it into segments. For each segment, compute the XOR of its elements, then take the OR of all these XOR values, and ensure that this OR is <= `x`. Among all possible ways to split the array into segments, find the maximum number of segments `k` that satisfy this condition.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR.

XOR has the property that it's associative and commutative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter. OR is also associative and commutative.

But in this problem, the segments are continuous, so the XOR of each segment is determined by the elements within that segment.

The OR operation combines the bits of its operands: a bit in the result is set if at least one operand has that bit set.

So, the overall result is the OR of the XORs of the segments.

I need to maximize `k`, the number of segments, while ensuring that this OR is <= `x`.

If I were to take `k=1`, meaning the whole array as one segment, the XOR would be the XOR of the entire array, and the OR would just be that single XOR value. If I increase `k`, I'm splitting the array into more segments, each with their own XOR, and then OR-ing them together.

I need to find the maximum `k` such that the OR of these XORs is <= `x`.

Let me consider some examples to understand better.

Take the first example from the input:

3 1

1 2 3

Possible splits:

- k=1: [1,2,3], XOR=1^2^3=0, OR=0 <=1, so k=1 is valid.

- k=2: [1],[2,3], XOR1=1, XOR2=2^3=1, OR=1|1=1 <=1, valid.

- k=3: [1],[2],[3], XOR1=1, XOR2=2, XOR3=3, OR=1|2|3=3 >1, invalid.

So, the maximum k is 2.

Another example:

2 2

1 1

Possible splits:

- k=1: [1,1], XOR=1^1=0, OR=0 <=2, valid.

- k=2: [1],[1], XOR1=1, XOR2=1, OR=1|1=1 <=2, valid.

- k=3: Not possible since n=2.

So, maximum k=2.

But according to the sample output, it's 2, which matches.

Another example:

2 2

1 3

Possible splits:

- k=1: [1,3], XOR=1^3=2, OR=2 <=2, valid.

- k=2: [1],[3], XOR1=1, XOR2=3, OR=1|3=3 >2, invalid.

So, maximum k=1.

Looking at these examples, it seems that splitting the array into more segments can increase the OR value because more XOR values are being OR'ed together, which can set more bits.

Therefore, to maximize k while keeping the OR <=x, I need to ensure that the OR of the XORs of the segments is <=x.

This seems like I need to find the finest (maximum k) splitting where the OR is still <=x.

I need an efficient way to compute this, considering that n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total n across all test cases is up to 1e5.

So, per test case, it should be O(n) or O(n log n).

Looking at the reference solution:

It defines `func_1` which calls `find_max(arr, 31)`. So, it starts with bit 31, which is the 31st bit for 30-bit numbers.

Wait, the constraints say 0 <= a_i < 2^30, so 30 bits are sufficient. But it starts from bit 31, which might be a mistake or perhaps it's 0-based.

Wait, in Python, bitwise operations handle integers as if they were infinite bits, but in practice, we only need to consider up to the highest set bit.

The `find_max` function seems to be a recursive function that tries to split the array based on the current bit being considered.

Let me try to understand the approach.

It seems to be a bit-wise approach, starting from the highest bit and deciding whether to split the array to minimize the OR value.

Wait, perhaps it's a greedy approach where it tries to maximize k by splitting the array into segments where the XOR of each segment doesn't set certain bits, depending on x.

Looking at the code:

In `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`, it checks for the current bit position, starting from bit 31 downto 0.

If bit is -1, it means all bits have been processed, and it returns the number of segments (len(cur_arr)).

Otherwise, it processes the array to create new segments where the XOR of the segment doesn't set the current bit.

It accumulates these segments in new_arr.

Then, it checks if the XOR of the remaining part sets the current bit.

Based on that, it computes thing1, which is either -1 or the result of recursive call to find_max on new_arr with bit-1.

Then, if x has the current bit set, it takes the maximum of find_max(cur_arr, bit-1) and len(new_arr).

Else, it returns thing1.

This seems like a divide-and-conquer approach based on bit significance.

I need to verify if this approach correctly maximizes k while keeping the OR <=x.

Let me consider the first sample input again.

n=3, x=1

arr=[1,2,3]

Binary:

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

XORs:

[1]: 001

[2]: 010

[3]: 011

OR of [1,2,3]: 001 | 010 | 011 = 011 (3) which is >1, so k=1 is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I saw that k=2 is valid because OR=1|1=1 <=1.

Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation is wrong.

Wait, no, in the first sample, k=2 is valid with OR=1|1=1 <=1.

Wait, but according to this code, starting from bit=31, which is higher than needed, it would proceed downwards.

I need to trace the execution for the first sample.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Alternatively, I can consider the properties of XOR and OR.

I need to find a way to split the array into k segments such that the OR of the XORs of the segments is <=x.

I need to maximize k.

I recall that OR is a monotonic operation in the sense that adding more terms can only keep the bits the same or set more bits.

Therefore, increasing k can only make the OR larger or keep it the same.

Hence, to maximize k, I need to split the array as much as possible while keeping the OR <=x.

This sounds like I need to find the finest possible splitting where the OR is still <=x.

But checking all possible splittings is not feasible due to the size of n.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can compute the XORs of all possible prefixes, and then try to find the maximum number of splits where the OR of the XORs is <=x.

Let me define prefix_XOR[i] as the XOR of a[0] to a[i-1].

Then, the XOR of a[l] to a[r] is prefix_XOR[r+1] ^ prefix_XOR[l].

So, if I have k segments [l1,r1], [l2,r2], ..., [lk,rk], with l1=0, rk=n-1, and li <= ri, and ri+1 = li+1 for i from 1 to k-1.

Then, the XORs are prefix_XOR[r1+1] ^ prefix_XOR[l1], prefix_XOR[r2+1] ^ prefix_XOR[l2], ..., prefix_XOR[rk+1] ^ prefix_XOR[lk].

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

I recall that in problems involving maximizing the number of segments with certain conditions, binary search can be used.

Perhaps I can perform a binary search on k, and for each k, check if it's possible to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <=x.

But for k segments, finding if such a splitting exists might be time-consuming, especially since n can be up to 1e5.

I need a better approach.

Looking back at the reference solution, it seems to be using a bit-wise approach, processing bits from higher to lower.

I need to understand if this approach is correct.

Let me consider that the OR of the XORs must be <=x.

Which means that for each bit position, if that bit is not set in x, then in none of the segment's XOR should that bit be set.

Because if any segment's XOR has that bit set, it will be set in the OR, which would make the OR >x.

Therefore, for each bit that is not set in x, all segment XORs must have that bit unset.

For bits that are set in x, the segments can have that bit set or unset.

So, to maximize k, I need to ensure that for bits not set in x, no segment's XOR has that bit set.

For bits set in x, I can have segments with that bit set or not.

Hence, for bits not set in x, I need to group elements in such a way that no segment's XOR sets those bits.

For bits set in x, I have more flexibility.

This seems like I can process bits from higher to lower, making decisions based on whether the bit is set in x or not.

This aligns with the approach in the reference solution, which seems to be processing bits from higher to lower.

In the `find_max` function, it starts from bit=31 and goes down to bit=0.

For each bit, it checks if that bit is set in x.

If it is set in x, it tries to maximize k by considering splitting the array into segments where the XOR of each segment doesn't set that bit, or it can set that bit.

If the bit is not set in x, it must ensure that no segment's XOR sets that bit.

This seems logically sound.

However, I need to verify if the implementation correctly achieves this.

Looking at the code:

def find_max(cur_arr, bit):

if bit == -1:

return len(cur_arr)

new_arr = []

xor = 0

thing1 = 0

for i in cur_arr:

xor ^= i

if not xor >> bit & 1:

new_arr.append(xor)

xor = 0

if xor >> bit & 1:

thing1 = -1

else:

thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)

if x >> bit & 1:

return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))

else:

return thing1

So, it processes the array by accumulating XORs, and when the current XOR doesn't set the current bit, it appends it to new_arr and resets xor.

At the end, if the remaining xor sets the current bit, thing1 is set to -1; else, it recurses on new_arr with bit-1.

Then, if x has the current bit set, it takes the maximum of find_max(cur_arr, bit-1) and len(new_arr); else, it returns thing1.

I need to understand what this is doing.

It seems that for each bit, it's trying to split the array into segments where the XOR of each segment doesn't set that bit.

If x has that bit set, it allows some segments to set that bit, hence taking the maximum between keeping the array as is (find_max(cur_arr, bit-1)) and splitting where XOR doesn't set the bit (len(new_arr)).

If x doesn't have the bit set, it must ensure that no segment sets that bit, hence thing1.

This seems logically consistent with the earlier reasoning.

Therefore, I believe this approach is correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
