Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Jayden has an array that starts empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. There are two types of operations: 

1. Appending an integer x to the end of the array.

2. Appending x copies of the current array to itself.

After performing all these operations, he has some queries where he wants to know the k-th element of the final array.

First, I need to understand how the array evolves with these operations. Let's look at the first example in the problem to get a sense of it.

In the first test case:

Operations:

1. Append 1 → array becomes [1]

2. Append 2 → array becomes [1, 2]

3. Append 1 copy of the array to itself → array becomes [1, 2, 1, 2]

4. Append 3 → array becomes [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

5. Append 3 copies of the array to itself → array becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Then, there are 10 queries asking for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., up to 20th elements of this final array.

So, my task is to process these operations in order and then answer the queries efficiently.

Now, looking at the constraints:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 5000

- For each test case, n and q can be up to 10^5, which is 100,000.

- The operations can involve appending up to 10^9 copies of the array, which is a huge number.

- The queries can ask for elements up to 10^18, which is a massive number.

Given these constraints, it's clear that building the entire array is not feasible because it can be incredibly large, way beyond any reasonable memory limits.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this without constructing the entire array.

Let's think about how the array is built step by step.

I'll maintain the array dynamically as operations are performed.

For type 1 operations, it's straightforward: just append the integer x to the array.

For type 2 operations, I need to append x copies of the current array to itself. But if x is up to 10^9, and the array is already large, this could be problematic.

I need to find a way to represent the array without actually storing all its elements, especially since x can be up to 10^9, which would make the array size explode very quickly.

One approach could be to represent the array as a tree, where each node corresponds to a subarray. But I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.

Another idea is to keep track of the structure of the array in a way that allows me to compute the k-th element without constructing the entire array.

Let me consider how the array is built:

- Start with an empty array.

- Append 1 → [1]

- Append 2 → [1,2]

- Append 1 copy of itself → [1,2,1,2]

- Append 3 → [1,2,1,2,3]

- Append 3 copies of itself → [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, after the operations, the array is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Now, for queries, I need to find the k-th element in this array.

But in general, the array can be very large, so I need a way to find the k-th element without building the entire array.

I need to find a pattern or a way to compute the position of the k-th element based on the operations performed.

Let me think about the size of the array after each operation.

I can keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

For type 1 operations, the size increases by 1.

For type 2 operations, the size increases by size * x, because we're appending x copies of the current array.

Wait, no. Actually, in type 2 operations, we're appending x copies of the current array to itself, so the new size would be size + x * size = size * (x + 1).

But in the problem statement, it says "append x copies of array a to the end of array a", which means that if a has length m, and x=1, the new a becomes [a, a], which has length 2m.

Similarly, if x=2, it becomes [a, a, a], length 3m.

Wait, but in the example, when x=1, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which is [1,2] appended with [1,2], so x=1 means appending one copy of itself.

Wait, but according to the problem, "append x copies of array a to the end of array a", so it's a += a * x.

So, if a has length m, after appending x copies of a, the new length is m + x*m = m*(x+1).

But in the example, starting with [1,2], appending 1 copy of itself results in [1,2,1,2], which matches m*(x+1) = 2*(1+1)=4.

Then, appending 3 copies of the current array would be [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is 5 + 3*5 = 20 elements.

So, keeping track of the size after each operation seems crucial.

I need to keep track of the size of the array after each operation without actually storing the array.

So, I can maintain a list of operations and the corresponding size changes.

Then, for each query, given k, I need to find out which element corresponds to the k-th position in the final array.

To do this efficiently, I need to be able to map the k-th position back through the operations to find out what value is there.

Given that the array can be very large, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution, where n is the number of operations, to handle the queries.

Let me try to think of a way to represent the array's structure.

One idea is to represent the array as a tree, where each type 2 operation corresponds to a node with x children, each child being a copy of the array before that operation.

But I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.

Another approach is to think of the array as being built by repeated concatenations, and to find a way to navigate through these concatenations to find the k-th element.

Let me try to simulate the process for the first test case.

Operations:

1. Append 1 → array = [1], size = 1

2. Append 2 → array = [1,2], size = 2

3. Append 1 copy of itself → array = [1,2,1,2], size = 4

4. Append 3 → array = [1,2,1,2,3], size = 5

5. Append 3 copies of itself → array = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], size = 5 + 3*5 = 20

Queries: 1 through 20

So, for k from 1 to 20, the answers are the elements at those positions in the final array.

But in general, the array can be up to 10^18 elements, which is way too big to store.

I need a way to compute the k-th element directly without constructing the array.

Let me think about how the array is constructed.

Each type 2 operation effectively repeats the current array a certain number of times.

This sounds similar to building a suffix array or working with repeated strings, where you can use modulo operations to find the position within the repeating units.

But in this case, the repetitions are nested, depending on previous type 2 operations.

This seems complex. Maybe I can keep track of the array's structure as a sequence of segments, where each segment corresponds to a type 1 operation or a type 2 operation.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the array as a tree, where each type 2 operation creates child nodes corresponding to the copies appended.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Maintain a list of segments, where each segment represents a part of the array that is either a direct append of a number or a repetition of previous segments.

- For type 1 operations, add a new segment with that single number.

- For type 2 operations, add a segment that represents x copies of all previous segments.

- Then, for queries, traverse this segment tree to find the k-th element.

But I'm not sure if this is efficient enough, given the constraints.

Another idea: Since the array can be represented as a result of repeated concatenations, perhaps I can keep track of the size of the array after each operation and, for queries, work backwards from the k-th position, determining which operation's segment it falls into.

This sounds promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

I'll keep a list of operations, and for each operation, I'll record the size of the array after that operation.

For type 1 operations, size increases by 1.

For type 2 operations, size increases by x times the current size.

Then, for a query k, I'll find the operation that includes the k-th position.

To do this, I'll start from the last operation and see if k is within the size added by that operation.

If it is, then I'll determine which specific element it is based on the operation type.

If it's a type 1 operation, it's simply the number appended.

If it's a type 2 operation, I'll need to find which copy and which position within that copy.

This seems similar to how we handle queries on segment trees.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, I'll process the operations to build a list that keeps track of the size after each operation.

Initialize size = 0

For each operation:

if type == 1:

append (operation_index, size, size + 1)

size += 1

elif type == 2:

append (operation_index, size, size * (x + 1))

size *= (x + 1)

Then, for each query k, starting from the last operation, find where k falls.

Start with the last operation.

If k > size after this operation, impossible, since k cannot be larger than the final size.

Else, find the operation whose size includes k.

If it's a type 1 operation, return the number appended.

If it's a type 2 operation, need to find which copy and which position within that copy.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can represent the array as a result of function compositions or use logarithms, but that seems too vague.

Wait, maybe I can think recursively.

Define a function that, given k, finds the element at that position.

Start from the final array size.

If the last operation is type 1, and k == current size, return that number.

If it's type 2, then the array is composed of original array followed by x copies of itself.

So, positions 1 to original size correspond to the array before this operation.

Positions original size +1 to new size correspond to copies of the original array repeated x times.

So, for a given k, if k <= original size, recurse to find k in the previous array.

If k > original size, then find which copy it falls into.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function find(k):

if k <= 0 or k > current size:

return invalid

if operations are empty:

return invalid

last_operation = operations[-1]

if last_operation.type == 1:

if k == current size:

return last_operation.x

else:

return find(k) in the previous array

elif last_operation.type == 2:

x = last_operation.x

original_size = size before this operation

if k <= original_size:

return find(k) in the previous array

else:

position_in_copies = k - original_size

copy_index = position_in_copies // original_size

position_in_copy = position_in_copies % original_size

return find(position_in_copy) in the previous array

This seems correct, but may be too slow for n=1e5 and t=5000.

Each query could take up to O(n) time in the worst case, leading to total time O(t*n*q), which is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider another approach.

Since type 2 operations involve repeating the array, I can think of the array as a combination of base elements and repeated blocks.

Perhaps I can represent the array as a combination of base elements and repetition factors.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the origin of each position in the final array.

But that seems too vague.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n and q can be up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but sum of n and q over all test cases does not exceed 1e5.

Wait, hold on.

It says "the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 1e5".

So, total operations across all test cases is <=1e5, and total queries across all test cases is <=1e5.

So, total operations + total queries <=1e5.

That changes things.

So, I can afford O(n + q) time overall.

So, I need an efficient way to handle all operations and queries within this time limit.

Given that, perhaps processing each operation and query in constant time is possible.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think again.

Since the total number of operations and queries is <=1e5, and t<=5000, I can process each test case independently, as long as the total time is acceptable.

So, perhaps for each test case, I can process all operations first, building some kind of structure that allows me to answer queries efficiently.

Given that, maybe the initial approach of tracking the size after each operation and then answering queries by determining which operation's segment the k-th position falls into is feasible.

Let me try to implement this.

First, process all operations to build a list of sizes.

Initialize size = 0

Initialize a list, say, operation_sizes, to record the size after each operation.

For each operation in operations:

if type == 1:

append (operation_index, size, size + 1)

size += 1

elif type == 2:

append (operation_index, size, size * (x + 1))

size *= (x + 1)

Then, for each query k:

if k > size:

invalid, since k is larger than the final array size

else:

find the latest operation whose size includes k

starting from the last operation, if k <= size after this operation, then this operation is relevant

then, depending on the operation type:

if type == 1:

if k == size after this operation:

return the number appended in this operation

else:

look at previous operations

if type == 2:

determine which part of the array k falls into:

original array or one of the x copies

if k <= size before this operation:

then it's in the original array, so recurse to find k in the previous array

else:

compute which copy it is and the position within that copy

copy_index = (k - size_before) // size_before

position_in_copy = (k - size_before) % size_before

then, find position_in_copy in the original array

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To make it efficient, I need to avoid recursion and instead use a loop that iterates through the operations in reverse order.

Let me try to write pseudocode for this.

For each test case:

Process operations to build operation_sizes list, which contains (operation_index, size_before, size_after)

For each query k:

if k > final size:

invalid

else:

set current_k = k

for each operation in reverse order:

if current_k <= size_after[operation]:

# current_k falls into this operation's segment

if operation.type == 1:

if current_k == size_after[operation]:

return the number appended in this operation

else:

look at previous operations

elif operation.type == 2:

original_size = size_before[operation]

copies = x

position_in_copies = current_k - size_before[operation]

copy_index = position_in_copies // original_size

position_in_copy = position_in_copies % original_size

current_k = position_in_copy

# now, find current_k in the previous array

else:

continue to previous operation

This seems workable.

To optimize, I can precompute the operation_sizes list, which includes size_before and size_after for each operation.

Then, for each query, I can iterate backwards through the operations until I find the operation that includes k.

If it's a type 1 operation, and k matches the size_after, return the appended number.

If it's a type 2 operation, compute the position within the copies and recurse or iterate further.

But to avoid recursion, I can use a loop that continues until it finds the base element.

I need to make sure that this is efficient, given the constraints.

Given that the total number of operations and queries is <=1e5, and t<=5000, this should be acceptable.

Now, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

I can read all test cases first, process them one by one, building the operation_sizes list for each, and then answering the queries based on that list.

But given memory constraints, it's better to process one test case at a time.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to follow a similar approach.

Let me analyze the provided program.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 reads input and calls func_1 for each test case.

func_1 takes n, operations, and queries as input and returns the results for the queries.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(n, operations, queries):

array = []

result = []

for (op_type, value) in operations:

if op_type == 1:

array.append(value)

else:

array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])

for k in queries:

result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])

return result

So, in func_1, it initializes an empty array, processes each operation:

- If op_type == 1, appends the value to the array.

- If op_type == 2, appends x copies of the current array to itself.

Then, for each query k, it computes the k-th element using modulo operation to handle cyclic nature.

But this approach has a major flaw: it builds the entire array, which can be up to 10^18 elements, which is impossible to store.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's given that "It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5", but n and q can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but with the sum of n and q across all test cases <=1e5.

Wait, no, the problem says: "the sum of n and q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5".

But in the func_1, it processes n operations and q queries per test case, with n and q up to 1e5 per test case, but t up to 5000.

Wait, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is <=1e5.

So, total operations and queries across all test cases is <=1e5.

Given that, building the array for each test case might be acceptable, as long as the total array sizes don't exceed memory limits.

But even then, if one test case has n=1e5 operations, and each operation could potentially double the array size (if type 2 with x=1), the array could become very large, exceeding memory limits.

Hence, this approach is still problematic.

Moreover, for queries, it uses (k-1) % len(array), which is incorrect.

In the problem, it's guaranteed that k is <= min(1e18, c), where c is the size of the array.

But in this function, it uses modulo len(array), which would cycle through the array, but that's not what's needed.

We need to find the k-th element in the final array, not cycle through it.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to handle operations on an array efficiently without constructing the entire array, given the constraints of large inputs and operations.

### Approach

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - **Type 1**: Append an integer to the array.
   - **Type 2**: Append multiple copies of the current array to itself.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - Determine the k-th element in the final array without constructing it entirely.

3. **Efficient Tracking**:
   - Track the size of the array after each operation.
   - Use this size information to determine which operation's segment contains the k-th element for each query.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    # Track the size of the array after each operation
    operation_sizes = []
    current_size = 0
    for op in operations:
        op_type, x = op
        if op_type == 1:
            current_size += 1
            operation_sizes.append((op_type, current_size, x))
        else:
            current_size *= (x + 1)
            operation_sizes.append((op_type, current_size, x))
    
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        if k > current_size:
            result.append(-1)  # Invalid query
        else:
            # Find the operation that includes the k-th element
            for op_info in reversed(operation_sizes):
                op_type, size_after, value = op_info
                if k <= size_after:
                    if op_type == 1:
                        if k == size_after:
                            result.append(value)
                            break
                    else:
                        # Type 2 operation
                        x = value
                        original_size = size_after // (x + 1)
                        position_in_copies = k - original_size
                        if position_in_copies < 0:
                            # Falls in the original part
                            k = k
                        else:
                            # Falls in the copied part
                            copy_index = position_in_copies // original_size
                            position_in_copy = position_in_copies % original_size
                            k = position_in_copy + 1  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
                        break
            else:
                result.append(-1)  # Should not happen if input is correct
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - We maintain a list `operation_sizes` to track the size of the array after each operation.
   - For **Type 1** operations, we simply append the integer and increment the size.
   - For **Type 2** operations, we append multiple copies of the current array and update the size accordingly.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, we check if `k` is within the final array size.
   - We iterate through the operations in reverse to find which operation's segment contains the k-th element.
   - If it's a **Type 1** operation, we directly return the appended value if `k` matches the position.
   - If it's a **Type 2** operation, we calculate the position within the original or copied segments and adjust `k` accordingly.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - We avoid constructing the entire array by tracking sizes and positions.
   - This approach ensures we handle large inputs efficiently within the given constraints.
