Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", along with the number of stalls and their respective prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand how Alice's buying behavior works. She goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her current coins. So, at each stall, she divides her remaining coins by the price per jewel at that stall, buys the integer number of jewels, and keeps the remainder as change.

I need to ensure that the total number of jewels she buys from all stalls is exactly k.

Given that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a price between 1 and 10^18, I need to find a combination of stall prices that leads Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the simplest case. If Bob sets up only one stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels. So, if there's a p such that floor(n / p) = k, then that would satisfy the condition.

But wait, the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so perhaps using multiple stalls can give more flexibility in achieving exactly k jewels.

Let me consider the general case with s stalls, each with price p1, p2, ..., ps. Alice buys jewels from each stall in order, reducing her coins after each purchase.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n / p1), floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2), ..., floor((remaining coins after s-1 stalls) / ps) equals exactly k.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required to achieve exactly k jewels.

If I set up one stall with p = floor(n / k), would that work?

Wait, no. If p = floor(n / k), then floor(n / p) could be greater than k, because p could be less than n/k.

For example, if n=7 and k=3, floor(7/3)=2, which is less than k. So that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, if I set p = ceil(n / k), then floor(n / p) might be equal to k or less.

But I need to ensure that the total jewels bought are exactly k.

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to use multiple stalls to fine-tune the number of jewels bought.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=7, k=3

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

So, with 10 stalls priced from 2 to 11, Alice buys:

- Stall 1: floor(7/2)=3 jewels, remaining coins=7-3*2=1

- Stall 2 to 10: floor(1/pi)=0 for all pi >=2

Total jewels:3, which matches k=3.

Another test case:

n=255, k=8

Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Alice buys:

- Stall 1: floor(255/128)=1, remaining=255-128=127

- Stall 2: floor(127/64)=1, remaining=127-64=63

- Stall 3: floor(63/32)=1, remaining=63-32=31

- Stall 4: floor(31/16)=1, remaining=31-16=15

- Stall 5: floor(15/8)=1, remaining=15-8=7

- Stall 6: floor(7/4)=1, remaining=7-4=3

- Stall 7: floor(3/2)=1, remaining=3-2=1

- Stall 8: floor(1/1)=1, remaining=1-1=0

Total jewels:8, which matches k=8.

So, in this approach, each stall is set to halve the remaining coins (approximately), ensuring that Alice buys one jewel per stall.

This seems like a binary representation approach, where each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of n.

Wait, in the first test case, n=7 (binary 111), k=3 (binary 11). The stalls are set from 2 to 11, which doesn't directly correspond to binary powers.

Wait, in the second test case, n=255 (binary 11111111), k=8 (binary 1000), and the stalls are set to 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which are the binary powers from 2^7 to 2^0.

So, in that case, Alice buys one jewel per stall, as each stall price matches the highest possible price that Alice can afford with her remaining coins.

This seems like a general approach: set up stalls with prices that are the binary representation of n, starting from the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n down to 1.

In that case, the number of stalls would be equal to the number of bits in n, which for n up to 10^18 is up to 60 bits, which fits the constraint of at most 60 stalls.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7 (binary 111), which has 3 bits, but they used 10 stalls, which is more than necessary.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, in the first test case, using stalls priced at 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, in that case, they used a large number of stalls, but only the first stall is actually used for buying jewels.

This seems like a way to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels by having the first stall priced such that she buys k jewels, and the remaining stalls are priced high enough that she can't buy any more jewels.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=7 and k=3, if Bob sets the first stall at p=2, then Alice buys floor(7/2)=3 jewels, and has 1 coin left. Since the remaining stalls are priced at least 3, she can't buy any more jewels.

So, in this case, Bob only needs one stall priced at 2 to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels.

But in the example, they used 10 stalls, which is still correct, but it's not minimal.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

Another way is to set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n / pi) equals k.

But ensuring that the sum equals exactly k might be tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n / p1)*p1) / p2) from the second, and so on.

To make this sum to exactly k, Bob needs to choose p1, p2, ..., ps appropriately.

One simple way is to set up one stall with p = floor(n / k), but as I saw earlier, that might not work in all cases.

Let me think about the constraints.

Constraints:

- 1 <= t <= 1000 (number of test cases)

- 1 <= n, k <= 10^18

- At most 60 stalls

- Each stall has price 1 <= pi <= 10^18

I need an efficient way to determine if it's possible and provide the stall prices if it is.

Let me consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

n=7, k=3

One possible solution: s=1, p1=2

Alice buys floor(7/2)=3 jewels

Another solution: s=2, p1=3, p2=1

- Stall 1: floor(7/3)=2 jewels, remaining=7-6=1

- Stall 2: floor(1/1)=1 jewel

- Total: 3 jewels

Another solution: s=3, p1=4, p2=2, p3=1

- Stall 1: floor(7/4)=1 jewel, remaining=7-4=3

- Stall 2: floor(3/2)=1 jewel, remaining=3-2=1

- Stall 3: floor(1/1)=1 jewel

- Total: 3 jewels

So, there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=255, k=8

Solution provided: s=8, p1=128, p2=64, ..., p8=1

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This seems like a general approach: to make Alice buy one jewel from each stall by setting stall prices that correspond to the binary representation of n.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7 is 111 in binary, which has three 1's, but k=3. So, setting stalls with prices 4,2,1 would make Alice buy one jewel from each, totaling 3 jewels.

But in the first solution, they used 10 stalls, which is more than necessary.

So, perhaps the minimal number of stalls is the number of set bits in n's binary representation, but in the first test case, it's 3, but they used 10 stalls.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the first test case, using one stall with p=2 makes Alice buy 3 jewels, which is exactly k=3.

So, in that case, s=1 is sufficient.

Similarly, for n=6, k=4

Let's see:

n=6, k=4

Is it possible?

If s=1, p1= floor(6 / 4)=1, which is less than k.

p1=1, floor(6/1)=6, which is more than k.

p1=2, floor(6/2)=3, which is less than k.

p1=1.5, but prices must be integers.

Wait, prices must be integers.

So, with s=1, it's not possible to get exactly k=4.

With s=2:

p1=2, p2=1

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=1, p2=2

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=3, p2=1

- Stall 1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:2 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=1, p2=1

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=2, p2=2

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Still not enough.

Wait, maybe s=3:

p1=2, p2=2, p3=1

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, still less than k=4.

Another option: p1=1, p2=2, p3=3

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/3)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, more than k=4.

Not enough.

Wait, maybe p1=1, p2=1, p3=1

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, more than k=4.

Still not enough.

Wait, maybe p1=1, p2=2, p3=3, p4=4

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/3)=0 jewels

- Stall 4: floor(0/4)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, still more than k=4.

Not good.

Wait, maybe p1=1.5, but prices must be integers.

Wait, only integer prices are allowed.

It seems like for n=6 and k=4, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, the output should be "NO", which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

Now, I need a general way to determine if it's possible for any n and k.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

So, for n=7, k=3, it's possible.

For n=6, k=4, it's impossible.

For n=255, k=8, it's possible.

I need to find a way to determine when it's possible and provide a solution, and when it's impossible, just say "NO".

Let me think about the constraints again.

Constraints:

- At most 60 stalls

- Each stall has price between 1 and 10^18

- 1 <= n, k <= 10^18

I need an efficient solution since t can be up to 1000.

Time constraints are not too strict since operations are simple.

Now, I need to find a way to make the sum of floor(n / p1), floor(m / p2), ..., floor(r / ps) = k, where m and r are the remaining coins after each stall.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal: if all stalls have p=1, then she buys n jewels from the first stall and nothing from others.

Maximal: if stalls are set with p > n, then she buys 0 jewels from all stalls except possibly the first one.

Wait, no. If p > n, she buys 0 jewels from that stall.

So, to maximize the number of jewels, set p=1 in one stall, and she buys n jewels.

To minimize, set p > n in all stalls, she buys 0 jewels.

But I need exactly k jewels.

I need a way to make the total jewels equal to k.

Let me consider the case when n >= k.

If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the coins she has.

Wait, no. If p is very small, she can buy more jewels, but in this problem, p must be at least 1, and with n coins, she can buy at most n jewels.

Wait, no, if p=1, she buys floor(n / 1)=n jewels.

If p=2, she buys floor(n / 2) jewels.

So, the maximum number of jewels she can buy is n (when p=1).

So, if k > n, it's impossible.

Similarly, the minimal number of jewels she can buy is 0, by setting p > n in all stalls.

But I need exactly k jewels.

So, the condition k <= n is necessary.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7, k=3, which satisfies k <= n.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, which also satisfies k <= n, but it's "NO".

So, k <= n is necessary but not sufficient.

I need a better condition.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set s=1, then I need floor(n / p1)=k, which implies that p1 = floor(n / k).

But floor(n / p1)=k implies that k <= n / p1 < k+1, which means n / (k+1) < p1 <= n / k.

So, p1 should be in (n / (k+1), n / k].

But p1 must be an integer, so p1 should be ceil(n / (k+1)) to floor(n / k).

Wait, but floor division in integers can be tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible p1 and see what remains.

But with s up to 60, it's too slow for individual test cases.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the case when n == k.

In this case, set s=1, p1=1.

Alice buys floor(n / 1)=n=k jewels.

So, "YES" with s=1 and p1=1.

Similarly, if n < k, it's impossible, since Alice can't buy more jewels than n.

But in the first test case, n=7, k=3, which is n > k.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, which is n > k, but it's "NO".

So, n > k doesn't guarantee that it's possible.

I need to find a general condition.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

Suppose I set s=1.

Then, as I thought earlier, p1 should satisfy floor(n / p1)=k.

Which means that p1 should be in the range ceil(n / (k+1)) to floor(n / k).

But p1 must be an integer, so if there exists an integer p1 in that range, then s=1 is sufficient.

Otherwise, I need to consider s=2.

For s=2, I need to choose p1 and p2 such that floor(n / p1) + floor(m / p2)=k, where m = n - floor(n / p1)*p1.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the total number of jewels bought.

I need to make the sum equal to k.

I need to find a way to decompose k into sum of floor(n / p1), floor(m / p2), etc.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set p1=1.

Then, Alice buys floor(n / 1)=n jewels from the first stall, and nothing from the others.

If n == k, it's fine.

If n > k, it's more than needed.

So, p1=1 is only useful when n == k.

Otherwise, I need to set p1 >1.

Wait, in the first test case, p1=2, which is greater than 1.

Alice buys 3 jewels from p1=2, and nothing from the other stalls.

So, in that case, s=1 with p1=2 is sufficient.

But in the sample output, they used s=10 with p1=2 to p10=11.

Both are valid, but s=1 is more efficient.

So, perhaps using s=1 when possible is a good approach.

But in the second test case, n=6, k=4.

If I set p1=2, Alice buys floor(6/2)=3 jewels, which is less than k=4.

If I set p1=1, Alice buys 6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

So, with s=1, it's not possible to get exactly k=4.

Then, I need to consider s=2.

Let's try p1=3, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:2 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=2, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Still not enough.

Another option: p1=1, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Not good.

Another option: p1=1, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Still not good.

Another option: p1=2, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, which is less than k=4.

Not enough.

Wait, maybe s=3.

p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/1)=0 jewels

- Total:3 jewels, still less than k=4.

Not enough.

Another option: p1=1, p2=2, p3=3.

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0

- Stall 2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels

- Stall 3: floor(0/3)=0 jewels

- Total:6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Not good.

Wait, it seems like no combination of stalls can make Alice buy exactly k=4 jewels with n=6.

Hence, "NO" is the correct output.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

Now, I need a general way to determine if it's possible or not.

Looking back at the sample input and output, it seems that for n=7 and k=3, it's possible, and for n=6 and k=4, it's impossible.

I need to find a condition that distinguishes these two cases.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

In the first test case, s=1 is sufficient.

In the third test case, s=8 is used, but perhaps fewer stalls could be used.

Wait, in the third test case, n=255 and k=8.

Using s=8 with p1=128 to p8=1, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Alternatively, could I use fewer stalls?

For example, s=3 with p1=32, p2=8, p3=1.

- Stall 1: floor(255/32)=7 jewels, remaining=255-224=31

- Stall 2: floor(31/8)=3 jewels, remaining=31-24=7

- Stall 3: floor(7/1)=7 jewels, remaining=7-7=0

- Total:7+3+7=17 jewels, which is more than k=8.

Not good.

Another option: s=2 with p1=32, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(255/32)=7 jewels, remaining=255-224=31

- Stall 2: floor(31/1)=31 jewels

- Total:7+31=38, which is more than k=8.

Not good.

Another option: s=2 with p1=32, p2=4.

- Stall 1: floor(255/32)=7 jewels, remaining=255-224=31

- Stall 2: floor(31/4)=7 jewels, remaining=31-28=3

- Total:7+7=14, which is more than k=8.

Still not good.

Another option: s=2 with p1=32, p2=100.

- Stall 1: floor(255/32)=7 jewels, remaining=255-224=31

- Stall 2: floor(31/100)=0 jewels

- Total:7 jewels, which is less than k=8.

Not enough.

Another option: s=3 with p1=32, p2=8, p3=100.

- Stall 1: floor(255/32)=7 jewels, remaining=255-224=31

- Stall 2: floor(31/8)=3 jewels, remaining=31-24=7

- Stall 3: floor(7/100)=0 jewels

- Total:7+3=10 jewels, which is more than k=8.

Still not good.

It seems challenging to get exactly k=8 with fewer than 8 stalls.

Hence, using s=8 with p1=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 seems necessary.

So, perhaps in general, if k <= number of bits in n, then it's possible by setting stalls with prices corresponding to the binary representation of n.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7 (3 bits), k=3, and they used s=10 stalls, which is more than the number of bits.

So, perhaps that's not the general rule.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the sum of a series or something similar.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) from the first stall, then floor(m / p2) from the second, and so on, where m is the remaining coins after each purchase.

I need the sum of these floor divisions to equal k.

This seems similar to the greedy algorithm for making change, but in reverse.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system of inequalities.

Let me denote:

j1 = floor(n / p1)

m1 = n - j1 * p1

j2 = floor(m1 / p2)

m2 = m1 - j2 * p2

...

js = floor(ms-1 / ps)

Total jewels: j1 + j2 + ... + js = k

This is a bit too vague.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy with s stalls.

Minimal: if p1 > n, then j1=0; p2 > n, j2=0; ... js=0. Total:0.

Maximal: p1=1, j1=n; p2=1, j2=0; ... js=0. Total:n.

So, the range is from 0 to n.

But I need exactly k.

I need to see if there's a way to partition n into k parts using at most 60 stalls, with each part being floor(n / p).

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I set p1, p2, ..., ps such that:

j1 + j2 + ... + js = k

where j1 = floor(n / p1)

j2 = floor((n - j1*p1) / p2)

...

js = floor((m_{s-1}) / ps)

I need to find p1, p2, ..., ps that satisfy this.

This seems too general to solve directly.

Let me consider the case when s=1.

Then, floor(n / p1) = k

Which implies that:

k <= n / p1 < k+1

Therefore:

n / (k+1) < p1 <= n / k

p1 should be in (n / (k+1), n / k]

If n / (k+1) < p1 <= n / k, and p1 is integer, then p1 exists if there's an integer in that interval.

So, check if ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k)

If yes, then p1 exists in that range.

Wait, but floor(n / k) <= floor(n / (k+1)) only when k=1.

In general, floor(n / k) >= floor(n / (k+1))

So, ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k)

Wait, ceil(a) <= floor(b) doesn't directly imply there's an integer in (a, b]

I need to check if ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k)

If ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k), then there exists an integer p1 in that range.

But in programming terms, it's better to check if ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k)

But in practice, it's easier to compute ceil(n / (k+1)) and floor(n / k), and see if ceil(n / (k+1)) <= floor(n / k)

But in programming, ceil(n / (k+1)) can be computed as (n + k) // (k + 1)

And floor(n / k) is n // k

So, if (n + k) // (k + 1) <= n // k, then p1 exists.

Wait, let's test this with n=7, k=3.

(n + k) // (k + 1) = (7 + 3) // 4 = 10 // 4 = 2

n // k = 7 // 3 = 2

So, 2 <= 2, which is true, so p1 exists in [2,2], so p1=2.

Similarly, for n=6, k=4.

(n + k) // (k + 1) = (6 + 4) // 5 = 10 // 5 = 2

n // k = 6 // 4 = 1

2 <= 1 is false, so no p1 exists for s=1.

Hence, for s=1, it's possible for n=7, k=3, but not for n=6, k=4.

But in the sample output, n=7, k=3 is "YES", and n=6, k=4 is "NO".

So, perhaps for s=1, the condition (n + k) // (k + 1) <= n // k should be checked.

If true, then p1 exists in the range, and we can set s=1 with p1=(n + k) // (k + 1)

Wait, but in n=7, k=3, (7 + 3) // 4 = 2, and n // k =2, so p1=2 is valid.

In n=6, k=4, (6 + 4) // 5 =2, n // 4=1, 2 <=1 is false, so no p1 exists.

Hence, for s=1, it's possible only if (n + k) // (k + 1) <= n // k

Otherwise, consider s=2.

For s=2, it's more complicated.

But perhaps I can generalize.

Suppose I set s=1 if possible, else try s=2, and so on up to s=60.

But checking up to s=60 is too time-consuming.
