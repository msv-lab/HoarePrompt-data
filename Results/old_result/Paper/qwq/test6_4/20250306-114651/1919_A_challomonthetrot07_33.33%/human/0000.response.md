Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have coins in their wallets and they take turns performing certain actions. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the game ends when a player has zero coins in their wallet and can't remove a coin. The player who reaches this state loses.

I need to think about how the game progresses based on the number of coins each player has.

Let me consider some simple cases to get a feel for the problem.

**Case 1: a = 1, b = 1**

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. If she doesn't swap, she removes 1 coin, so a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He can't swap because if he does, he'd have a=0 and b=0, and he has to remove 1 coin, leaving a=0 and b=-1, which doesn't make sense. So he doesn't swap, removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: Both have 0 coins. Alice can't remove a coin, so Bob wins.

So in this case, Bob wins.

**Case 2: a = 1, b = 4**

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. If she swaps, a=4, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. If he swaps, a=1, b=4.

- Alice's turn: She has 4 coins. She can swap or not. If she doesn't swap, a=3, b=4.

- Bob's turn: He has 4 coins. He can swap or not. If he doesn't swap, a=3, b=3.

- Alice's turn: She has 3 coins. She can swap or not. If she swaps, a=3, b=2.

- Bob's turn: He has 2 coins. He can swap or not. If he doesn't swap, a=2, b=1.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can swap or not. If she swaps, a=1, b=0.

- Bob's turn: He has 0 coins. He can't remove a coin, so Alice wins.

So in this case, Alice wins.

From these examples, it seems that the outcome depends on the parity of the number of coins and the difference between them.

Let me think about the general strategy.

Since both players play optimally, they will choose the action that leads to a winning position.

I need to find a pattern or a formula that can determine the winner based on the values of a and b.

Looking at the reference solution:

def func():

T = int(input())

for i in range(T):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:

print('Bob')

elif a == 1:

print('Alice')

elif b == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

print('Alice')

elif a > b:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

I need to verify if this solution is correct.

Let's test it with the examples given.

**Test Case 1: a=1, b=1**

According to the solution:

a == b, so print 'Bob'. Matches the first example.

**Test Case 2: a=1, b=4**

a == 1, so print 'Alice'. Matches the second example.

**Test Case 3: a=5, b=3**

a % 2 == 1, so print 'Bob'.

**Test Case 4: a=4, b=5**

a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, so print 'Alice'.

**Test Case 5: a=11, b=9**

a % 2 == 1, so print 'Bob'.

**Test Case 6: a=83, b=91**

a % 2 == 1, so print 'Bob'.

**Test Case 7: a=1032, b=9307**

a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, so print 'Alice'.

**Test Case 8: a=839204, b=7281**

a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, so print 'Alice'.

**Test Case 9: a=1000000000, b=1000000000**

a == b, so print 'Bob'.

**Test Case 10: a=53110, b=2024**

a > b and a % 2 == 0, so print 'Bob'.

Comparing with the provided output:

Bob

Alice

Bob

Alice

Bob

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Bob

Seems to match.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the Sprague-Grundy theorem might apply.

However, this game allows players to choose between two options: swap or not swap, and then remove one coin.

It's a bit tricky because the game state depends on the number of coins each player has, and the ability to swap adds complexity.

Let me consider the game as a position in an impartial game, where the mex (minimum excludant) of the possible next moves gives the Grundy number for that position.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the parity of the number of coins.

In the solution, if a == b, Bob wins.

If a == 1, Alice wins.

If b == 1, Bob wins.

If a is odd, Bob wins.

If a is even and b is odd, Alice wins.

If a > b, Bob wins.

Else, Alice wins.

Wait, but in the test cases, when a > b and a is even, it's not necessarily Bob wins.

Wait, in test case 7: a=1032, b=9307

According to the solution:

a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, so print 'Alice'.

But according to the given output, it's 'Alice', which matches.

Test case 8: a=839204, b=7281

a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, so print 'Alice', which matches the given output.

Test case 6: a=83, b=91

a % 2 == 1, so print 'Bob', which matches the given output.

But I need to see if this logic holds in general.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a=2, b=2.

According to the solution: a == b, so Bob wins.

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=2.

- Option 1: swap, a=2, b=2. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

- Option 2: don't swap, a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=2.

- Option 1: swap, a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

- Option 2: don't swap, a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn:

- If a=1, b=1: swap, a=1, b=0. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

- Or don't swap, a=0, b=1.

- In both cases, Bob can force a win.

So, Bob wins, which matches the solution.

Another example: a=2, b=1.

According to the solution: b ==1, so Bob wins.

Wait, b ==1, so according to the solution, print 'Bob'.

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1.

- Option 1: swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

- Option 2: don't swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

- In both cases, a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2.

- He can't swap because a=0, so he must not swap. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She can only not swap. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the solution, b ==1, so print 'Bob', but in this simulation, Alice wins.

This contradicts the solution.

Wait, perhaps I misread the conditions.

Let me check the conditions again:

if a == b:

print('Bob')

elif a == 1:

print('Alice')

elif b == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 1:

print('Bob')

elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

print('Alice')

elif a > b:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

In the case a=2, b=1:

a != b, a !=1, b ==1, so print 'Bob'.

But in the simulation, Alice wins.

So, the solution is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the simulation.

Let me simulate again:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1.

- Option 1: swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

- Option 2: don't swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

- In both cases, a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2.

- He can't swap because a=0, so he must not swap. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1.

- She can only not swap. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

But according to the solution, it should be 'Bob', which is incorrect.

So, the solution is wrong in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
