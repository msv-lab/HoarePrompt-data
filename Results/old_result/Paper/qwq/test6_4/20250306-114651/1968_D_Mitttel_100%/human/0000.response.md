Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game that Bodya and Sasha are playing with a permutation and an array. The game lasts for k turns, and in each turn, both players can choose to stay at their current position or move to a new position based on the permutation. Their scores increase by the value of the array at their current positions. After k turns, the one with the higher score wins. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

First, I need to understand the input and what's being asked. There are multiple test cases, each with parameters n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a. n is the length of the permutation and the array, k is the number of turns in the game, P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.

The permutation p is a list of integers from 1 to n, and the array a has n integers representing the scores at each position.

The players make moves simultaneously in each turn. In each turn, both players can choose to stay or move to p[x], where x is their current position. Their scores increase by a[x] at their current positions.

The goal is to determine who wins the game if both players play optimally.

Looking at the sample input and output, it seems that the players are trying to maximize their own scores, and we need to compare these scores after k turns.

Now, I need to think about how to model this game. Since both players make moves simultaneously and independently, their choices don't affect each other directly. So, I can consider each player's strategy separately.

For each player, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible score they can achieve in k turns, starting from their initial position, by choosing at each turn whether to stay or move to p[x].

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each player, I need to compute the maximum score achievable at each step.

But considering the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach would be too slow. So, I need a smarter way to compute the maximum score for each player.

Let's think about the structure of the permutation. Permutations can have cycles. If I can identify the cycles in the permutation, that might help in determining the optimal path for each player.

Each player can choose to stay or move to p[x] at each turn. To maximize the score, the player should choose the option that gives the highest a[x] at each step.

But since they can choose to stay, they might want to stay at a position with a high a[x], or move to p[x] if a[p[x]] is higher.

Wait, but they can choose to stay or move independently each turn, so they can mix staying and moving in any order.

This seems tricky. Let's consider what happens if a player keeps moving according to p.

If a player keeps moving according to p, they follow the permutation path. But since p is a permutation, it will eventually form cycles, and the player will loop in a cycle.

Alternatively, if they choose to stay at some position, they accumulate a[x] for multiple turns.

I need to find the optimal strategy for each player, which maximizes their total score after k turns.

One approach is to consider that the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle for any number of turns.

But identifying cycles might be time-consuming for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has exactly one outgoing edge (since p is a permutation), and possibly multiple cycles and trees leading into cycles.

In such a graph, every node is part of exactly one cycle, and the paths lead to these cycles.

So, for each player, starting from their initial position, they will eventually reach a cycle and then loop in it.

The optimal strategy would be to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle for as many turns as possible.

But they can also choose to move through the path to reach the cycle, and decide how many turns to spend moving and how many to stay.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the reference solution, it defines a function func_1(a, p, s, k) that computes the maximum score for a player starting at position s for k turns.

In this function, it initializes mx (maximum score) and cur (current score). It also keeps track of visited positions using vis.

It has a while loop that continues until a position is revisited or k turns are completed.

In each iteration, it marks the position as visited, updates the maximum score, adds a[s] to the current score, decreases k by 1, and moves to p[s].

This seems to simulate the player moving through the permutation, accumulating a[s] at each step, and keeping track of the maximum score achievable.

But I'm not sure if this correctly captures the optimal strategy where the player can choose to stay or move each turn.

Wait, in the problem, the player can choose to stay or move each turn. So, in each turn, the player has a choice: stay and get a[s], or move to p[s] and get a[p[s]].

But in the reference solution, it seems to always move to p[s] in each step, which might not be optimal.

For example, in the first test case:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3] which is 1-indexed, so p[1]=4, p[2]=1, p[3]=2, p[4]=3

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, positions:

1: p=4, a=7

2: p=1, a=2

3: p=2, a=5

4: p=3, a=6

Let's see what happens in the reference solution for Bodya starting at 3:

- s=3-1=2 (0-based index)

- vis = [0,0,0,0]

- Iteration 1: vis[2]=1, mx=max(0,0+2*5)=10, cur=0+5=5, k=1, s=p[2]=1

- Iteration 2: vis[1]=1, mx=max(10,5+1*2)=7, cur=5+2=7, k=0

- Stop since k=0

- So, A=10

For Sasha starting at 2:

- s=2-1=1

- vis = [0,0,0,0]

- Iteration 1: vis[1]=1, mx=max(0,0+2*2)=4, cur=0+2=2, k=1, s=p[1]=0

- Iteration 2: vis[0]=1, mx=max(4,2+1*7)=9, cur=2+7=9, k=0

- Stop since k=0

- So, B=9

Compare A=10 and B=9, so Bodya wins.

This matches the first output in the sample.

But is this the correct approach?

Let me think about what this code is doing.

In func_1, it's tracking the path the player takes, accumulating a[s] each turn, and keeping track of the maximum score achievable along the path.

But the player can choose to stay at any position; this code seems to force the player to move to p[s] in each turn, which might not be optimal.

In the first test case, Bodya starts at 3 with a=5. If he stays at 3 for both turns, his score is 5 + 5 = 10.

Sasha starts at 2 with a=2. If he moves to p[2]=1 on the first turn, gets a[1]=7, and then stays at 1 on the second turn, gets another a[1]=7, total score 2 + 7 + 7 = 16.

But according to the reference solution, B=9, which is different from this calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Let me read the problem again.

"on each turn, two things happen to each player:

1. If the current position is x, his score increases by a_x.

2. Then the player either stays at x or moves to p_x."

So, the choice is whether to stay or move after adding a_x to the score.

In other words, the movement happens after adding a_x, and the choice is between staying at x or moving to p_x for the next turn.

So, in each turn:

- Add a_x to the score.

- Choose to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

Given this, the reference solution seems to always move to p_x in each turn, which is suboptimal.

In the first test case, for Bodya starting at 3:

- Turn 1: add a[3]=5, choose to stay at 3.

- Turn 2: add a[3]=5, choose to stay at 3.

- Total score: 10.

But according to the reference solution, A=10, which matches this.

For Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: add a[2]=2, choose to move to p[2]=1.

- Turn 2: add a[1]=7, choose to stay at 1.

- Total score: 2 + 7 = 9.

But if Sasha chooses to stay at 2 in the first turn:

- Turn 1: add a[2]=2, choose to stay at 2.

- Turn 2: add a[2]=2, choose to stay at 2.

- Total score: 2 + 2 = 4.

Which is worse than moving to 1.

So, the reference solution seems to be simulating the path by always moving to p_x, but in the process, it's keeping track of the maximum score achievable along the path.

Wait, but in the code, it's updating mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s]).

So, it's considering that after reaching a position, the player can choose to stay there for the remaining k turns, accumulating a[s] each turn.

So, in the first test case, for Bodya:

- Turn 1: s=3, cur=0 + 5, k=1, mx=max(0, 0 + 2*5)=10.

- Turn 2: s=2, cur=5 + 2, k=0, mx=max(10, 5 + 1*2)=7. But since k=0, it stops.

Wait, but in the code, it's mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s]).

So, in the first iteration:

mx = max(0, 0 + 2*5) = 10

cur = 0 + 5 = 5

k = 1

s = p[2] = 1

Second iteration:

mx = max(10, 5 + 1*2) = max(10,7) = 10

cur = 5 + 2 = 7

k = 0

Stop.

So, A=10.

For Sasha:

First iteration:

mx = max(0,0 + 2*2)=4

cur = 0 + 2 = 2

k=1

s = p[1]=0

Second iteration:

mx = max(4,2 + 1*7)=9

cur = 2 + 7 =9

k=0

Stop.

B=9

Then, A=10 > B=9, so Bodya wins.

But according to my earlier manual calculation, if Sasha moves to 1 and stays there, his total score is 2 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 9, which matches the reference solution.

Alternatively, if Sasha stays at 2 for both turns, his score is 2 + 2 =4, which is worse.

So, the reference solution seems to be correctly calculating the maximum possible score for each player.

Wait, but in the code, a[s] is being subtracted by 1 in the line "a[i] -=1". Why is that?

Wait, in the code provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):

p[i] -= 1

a[i] -= 1

A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)

B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)

if A == B:

print('Draw')

elif A > B:

print('Bodya')

else:

print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):

n = len(p)

mx = 0

cur = 0

vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]

while not vis[s] and k > 0:

vis[s] = 1

mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])

cur += a[s]

k -= 1

s = p[s]

return mx

So, it's converting p and a to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each element.

Then, it calls func_1 for both players and compares the results.

In func_1, it's iterating through the path defined by p, accumulating cur += a[s], and keeping track of the maximum mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s]).

Wait, but in the first test case, a[s] is being subtracted by 1 in the main loop, so a[0]=6, a[1]=1, a[2]=4, a[3]=5.

But in the manual calculation earlier, I used a[s] as given in the input, which was a=[7,2,5,6].

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution.

Wait, no, in the code, it's a[i] -=1, which means each a[i] is decreased by 1.

But in the sample input, a is given as [7,2,5,6], so after subtracting 1, it becomes [6,1,4,5].

Is this a mistake in the reference solution?

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the problem statement or the reference solution.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "the array a has n integers representing the scores at each position."

There's no mention of needing to subtract 1 from a[i]. So, likely, this is an error in the reference solution.

I need to correct this in my analysis.

So, in the reference solution, it's incorrectly subtracting 1 from each a[i].

Therefore, the reference solution is flawed due to this mistake.

Hence, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
