Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of size n, and I need to split this array into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array a must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called "penalty". The penalty for a subsequence b is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, for example, if b is [1, 3, 2], then p(b) would be 1 because 3 > 2.

My goal is to split the array into s and t in such a way that the sum of their penalties is minimized. I need to find the minimum possible penalty.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if a = [1, 2, 3], then some subsequences are [1, 3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1], [2], [3], and the empty sequence.

Now, the problem is to split the array into two such subsequences and minimize the sum of their penalties.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One possible split is s = [2, 4, 5] and t = [1, 3]

p(s) = 2 (since 2 < 4 and 4 < 5)

p(t) = 1 (since 1 < 3)

Total penalty = 3

But is this the minimal penalty? Maybe there's a better split.

What if s = [1, 2, 3, 4] and t = [5]

p(s) = 3 (1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4)

p(t) = 0 (only one element)

Total penalty = 3

Same as before.

Another split: s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4]

p(s) = 2 (1 < 3, 3 < 5)

p(t) = 1 (2 < 4)

Total penalty = 3

Still the same.

What if s = [1, 2, 4] and t = [3, 5]

p(s) = 2 (1 < 2, 2 < 4)

p(t) = 1 (3 < 5)

Total penalty = 3

Again, same penalty.

Is there a way to get a lower penalty?

Let's try s = [1, 3] and t = [2, 4, 5]

p(s) = 1 (1 < 3)

p(t) = 2 (2 < 4, 4 < 5)

Total penalty = 3

Still the same.

What about s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and t = []

p(s) = 4 (1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5)

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 4

Worse than before.

Another split: s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4]

As before, penalty = 3

Seems like 3 is the minimal penalty for this case.

Second test case:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

The example split is s = [8, 3, 1] and t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 0 (8 > 3 > 1)

p(t) = 1 (2 < 1 is not true, wait, 2 > 1, then 1 < 7, 7 > 4, 4 > 3)

Wait, let's check p(t):

t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

Check 2 < 1? No, so no increment.

1 < 7? Yes, increment by 1.

7 < 4? No.

4 < 3? No.

So p(t) = 1

And s = [8, 3, 1]

Check 8 < 3? No

3 < 1? No

So p(s) = 0

Total penalty = 1

Is there a better split?

Let's try s = [8, 2, 1] and t = [3, 1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 0 (8 > 2 > 1)

p(t) = 1 (3 > 1, 1 < 7, 7 > 4, 4 > 3) so 1 increment

Total penalty = 1

Same as before.

Another split: s = [8, 3, 7, 4, 3] and t = [2, 1, 1]

p(s) = 1 (8 > 3 < 7 > 4 > 3), so only one increase: 3 < 7

p(t) = 0 (2 > 1, 1 == 1)

Total penalty = 1

Same as before.

Seems like 1 is the minimal penalty.

Third test case:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Split s = [] and t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

p(s) = 0

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 0

Indeed, since all elements are equal, there are no increases in any subsequence.

Fourth test case:

n = 1

a = [1]

Split s = [1] and t = []

p(s) = 0

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 0

Fifth test case:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Split s = [2] and t = [1]

p(s) = 0

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 0

Alternatively, s = [2, 1] and t = []

p(s) = 0 (2 > 1)

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 0

So, in all examples, the output seems correct.

Now, I need to find a general way to solve this problem.

First, I need to understand what the minimal penalty is.

The penalty is the number of times an element is less than the next one in each subsequence.

So, in subsequence s, p(s) counts the number of increases.

Similarly, in t, p(t) counts the number of increases.

I need to minimize p(s) + p(t).

I need to distribute the elements of a into s and t in such a way that the total number of increases in both s and t is minimized.

I need to think about how to arrange the elements in s and t to minimize these increases.

One idea is to make s and t as non-increasing as possible, because increases contribute to the penalty.

So, if I can arrange s and t such that each is non-increasing, then p(s) and p(t) would both be zero.

But is that always possible?

In the first test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], if I try to put all elements into one non-increasing subsequence, it's not possible because the array is strictly increasing. So, I need to split it into two subsequences, each as non-increasing as possible.

Wait, but in the first test case, the minimal penalty is 3, which is higher than zero, meaning that some increases are inevitable.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is related to the number of increasing pairs in the array minus the maximum number of increasing sequences I can form.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of increasing runs in the array.

An increasing run is a sequence of elements where each is smaller than the next.

In the first test case, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is one big increasing run, so the minimal penalty should be the length of the run minus one, which is 4. But in the example, it's 3. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of runs I need to split the array into, such that each run is non-increasing.

But in the first test case, to split [1,2,3,4,5] into non-increasing subsequences, I would need at least 5 subsequences, each containing one element, because the entire array is increasing. So, if I split each element into its own subsequence, then p(s) + p(t) would be zero, since each subsequence has only one element. But according to the problem, the minimal penalty is 3, not zero.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, in the first test case, the minimal penalty is 3, achieved by splits like s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3], with p(s)=2 and p(t)=1.

Wait, but if I split into s=[1,2,3,4,5] and t=[], then p(s)=4 and p(t)=0, total penalty=4, which is worse than 3.

Another split s=[1,3,5] and t=[2,4], p(s)=2 and p(t)=1, total penalty=3.

Another split s=[1,2,4] and t=[3,5], p(s)=2 and p(t)=1, total penalty=3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal.

But why can't I get a lower penalty?

Let's see, if I split s=[1,3] and t=[2,4,5], p(s)=1 and p(t)=2, total penalty=3 again.

Alternatively, s=[1,2,3] and t=[4,5], p(s)=2 and p(t)=1, total penalty=3.

Seems like no matter how I split, I can't get below 3.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is related to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

In the first test case, the longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,4,5], of length 5.

Is there a relation between the minimal penalty and the length of the longest increasing subsequence?

Let me recall that in the first test case, minimal penalty is 3, which is 5 - 2 = 3.

Wait, 5 elements, split into 2 subsequences, each as non-increasing as possible.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is the length of the array minus the size of the largest non-increasing subsequence.

In the first test case, the largest non-increasing subsequence is of size 1 (since all elements are increasing), so minimal penalty is 5 - 1 = 4, but in the example, it's 3.

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the length of the array minus twice the size of the largest non-increasing subsequence.

If the largest non-increasing subsequence is of size 1, then 5 - 2*1 = 3, which matches the example.

Is this a general rule?

Let me check the second test case.

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

What's the largest non-increasing subsequence here?

Looking at the array: 8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3

Possible non-increasing subsequences:

8,2,1,1,4,3 with length 6

Alternatively, 8,3,1,7,4,3 with length 6

So, the largest non-increasing subsequence has length 6.

Then, according to the formula, minimal penalty = 8 - 2*6 = -4, which is less than zero, but in the example, it's 1.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe it's the length of the array minus the size of the largest non-increasing subsequence minus the size of the second largest non-increasing subsequence.

In the first test case, largest non-increasing subsequence is of size 1, and the second is also 1, so 5 -1 -1=3, which matches.

In the second test case, largest non-increasing subsequence is of size 6, and the second is of size... let's see.

From the remaining elements after taking the first non-increasing subsequence, what's left?

If I take [8,2,1,1,4,3], then the remaining elements are [3,7], which can be arranged as [3,7] or [7,3]. If I choose [7,3], which is non-increasing, of size 2.

So, 6 + 2 = 8, which is the total length.

Then, minimal penalty = 8 - 6 -2 = 0, but in the example, it's 1.

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the length of the array minus the size of the largest decreasing subsequence.

Wait, but in the first test case, the largest decreasing subsequence is of size 1, since the array is increasing.

Wait, no, in an increasing array, the largest decreasing subsequence is of size 1.

So, 5 -1 =4, but the minimal penalty is 3.

Still not matching.

I need to find another approach.

Let me think differently.

Each increase in a subsequence contributes to the penalty.

I need to minimize the total number of increases in both s and t.

So, perhaps I should try to maximize the number of decreases or equalities in both s and t.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning each element to s or t in a way that minimizes the number of increases in both s and t.

This sounds like a graph problem, where I have to find two chains that cover all elements, minimizing the number of increases.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me consider dp[i][j], where i is the current index in the array, and j indicates which subsequence the last element was assigned to (s or t).

Wait, but this might be too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that I can assign each element to s or t, and I need to maintain the orders in s and t.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two separate sequences, s and t, and for each element, decide which one to append to, or to insert into some position to maintain the non-increasing order.

But maintaining this for two sequences simultaneously seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of patience sorting or LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) to solve this.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to partition the array.

In other words, find the minimal number of increasing subsequences such that each element is in exactly one subsequence.

Then, the penalty would be the total number of increases in all these subsequences.

Wait, but in our problem, we have two subsequences, s and t.

So, perhaps I can find the minimal penalty when splitting into two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

I recall that the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to partition the array is equal to the size of the longest decreasing subsequence.

Wait, is that correct?

Yes, according to Dilworth's theorem, the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to partition the array is equal to the size of the longest decreasing subsequence.

So, in our problem, if we split the array into two subsequences, s and t, then the minimal penalty would be the total number of increases in both s and t.

But according to Dilworth's theorem, if we split the array into k increasing subsequences, then k is equal to the size of the longest decreasing subsequence.

But in our problem, we have to split into exactly two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to split the array into two subsequences such that the total number of increases is minimized.

Let me consider that in each subsequence, the number of increases is equal to the length of the subsequence minus the number of decreasing runs in it.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as assigning elements to s or t in a way that minimizes the number of times a_j > a_{j+1} in each subsequence.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of choosing for each element whether to assign it to s or t, with the constraint that the order in s and t must follow the original array's order.

Then, for each assignment, calculate the penalties.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i][j], where i is the current index in the array, and j indicates which subsequence the i-th element is assigned to (s or t).

Then, dp[i][j] would be the minimal penalty up to the i-th element, given that the i-th element is assigned to subsequence j.

Wait, but I need to consider the ordering in s and t.

So, for each assignment, I need to ensure that the assigned element maintains the subsequence property in s or t.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the last element in s and in t.

Then, for each new element, I can decide to assign it to s or t, depending on whether it is less than or equal to the last element in that subsequence.

If I assign it to s, it must be less than or equal to the last element in s.

Similarly for t.

Wait, but actually, since s and t are subsequences, they don't have to be sorted in any particular order, except that they maintain the original order of elements.

Wait, no, in the problem, s and t are subsequences of a, meaning that they preserve the order of elements in a.

But they don't have to be sorted in any particular way, except that in calculating p(s) and p(t), we count the number of increases in each.

So, perhaps I can model this as follows:

Maintain the last elements of s and t.

For each new element, assign it to the subsequence where it would cause the least increase in penalty.

If I assign it to s, and it is greater than the last element in s, then p(s) increases by 1.

Similarly for t.

So, I need to choose the subsequence where assigning the new element causes the smallest increase in penalty.

In other words, if the new element is less than or equal to the last element in s, assign it to s without increasing p(s); otherwise, assign it to s and increase p(s) by 1.

Similarly for t.

Then, choose the subsequence where the penalty increase is minimal.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the last elements of s and t, and for each new element, assign it to the subsequence where it can be assigned without increasing the penalty, or to the one where the penalty increases by 1.

But I need to minimize the total penalty.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize s and t as empty lists.

Initialize penalty s and penalty t as 0.

For each element in the array:

- If the element is less than or equal to the last element in s, assign it to s without increasing p(s).

- Else if the element is less than or equal to the last element in t, assign it to t without increasing p(t).

- Else, assign it to the subsequence where the penalty increase is minimal.

Wait, but if it's greater than both last elements of s and t, then assigning it to either would increase the penalty by 1.

So, in that case, I can choose to assign it to either s or t, but to minimize the total penalty, I should choose the subsequence that currently has the lower penalty.

Wait, no, that might not be optimal.

Perhaps I should choose to assign it to the subsequence that has the smaller last element, to allow for more flexibility in future assignments.

Wait, I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that I have two "queues" or "sequences" s and t, and I'm processing the array from left to right.

For each element, I can choose to append it to s or t, but only if it's greater than the last element in that subsequence, in which case the penalty for that subsequence increases by 1.

If it's less than or equal to the last element, I can append it without increasing the penalty.

So, to minimize the total penalty, I should try to assign elements to subsequences where they can be assigned without increasing the penalty, and only assign to a subsequence that increases the penalty if necessary.

In other words, prefer to assign to a subsequence where the new element is less than or equal to the last element.

Only if both s and t have last elements less than the new element, then I have to choose one of them and increase the penalty.

In that case, I can choose either s or t, it doesn't matter which one I choose, since the penalty increases by 1 either way.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can maintain s and t as two separate non-increasing subsequences as much as possible.

So, I try to assign each new element to the subsequence where it can be assigned without breaking the non-increasing order.

If it can't be assigned to either without breaking the order, then I have to choose one subsequence to assign it to, thereby increasing the penalty for that subsequence.

But in this problem, since I have only two subsequences, I can keep track of the last elements of s and t, and assign the new element to the subsequence with the larger last element, if possible.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach similar to patience sorting with two piles.

In patience sorting, to find the length of the LIS, we use a greedy approach with binary search.

But here, I need to minimize the penalty, which is related to the number of increases in the subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can look at it differently.

Suppose I
