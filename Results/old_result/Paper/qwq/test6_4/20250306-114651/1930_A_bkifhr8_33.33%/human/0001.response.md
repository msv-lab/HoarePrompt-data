Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. The goal is to maximize my final score after all moves are done.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized. Since I have to do this for multiple test cases, efficiency is key, especially since n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 5000.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I have a list of numbers, say [2,3] for n=1, the only pair is (2,3), and the min is 2, so the score is 2. For n=2, with [1,1,2,1], possible pairs could be (1,1) and (2,1), giving min(1,1)=1 and min(2,1)=1, total score 2. Another way could be (1,2) and (1,1), which gives min(1,2)=1 and min(1,1)=1, still total score 2. So, it seems that no matter how I pair them, I get the same score in this case.

Wait, but the problem says to maximize the final score. In this example, it's saying that 2 is the maximum achievable. So, maybe I need to find a way to pair them optimally to get the highest possible sum of mins.

Let me consider another example: [1,2,3,4]. Possible pairings:

- (1,2) and (3,4): min(1,2)=1 + min(3,4)=3 → total 4

- (1,3) and (2,4): min(1,3)=1 + min(2,4)=2 → total 3

- (1,4) and (2,3): min(1,4)=1 + min(2,3)=2 → total 3

So, the best is to pair (1,2) and (3,4), giving a total of 4.

Wait, but is there a better way? Maybe not, since pairing (1,2) seems to maximize the min values.

Another example: [1,1,1,1,1,1] for n=3. Pairings would be (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), each min is 1, total score 3.

Seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that my approach works for all cases.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

ans_f = []

for i in range(t):

ans = 0

n = int(input())

l = input()

lst = l.split(' ')

for i in range(n * 2):

if len(lst) != 2:

ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])

lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])

else:

ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

break

ans_f.append(ans)

for i in ans_f:

print(i)

Let's analyze this code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- It initializes ans to 0.

- Reads n, which is half the number of integers.

- Reads a line of input, splits it into a list called lst.

- Enters a loop that runs n*2 times.

- Inside the loop, it checks if the list has more than 2 elements.

- If so, it adds the min of the first two elements to ans, then removes those two elements.

- If the list has exactly 2 elements, it adds the min of those two and breaks the loop.

- After processing all test cases, it prints the answers one by one.

Wait a minute, this seems suboptimal. In the loop, it always takes the first two elements and takes their min, then removes them. But this doesn't ensure that we're pairing the smallest elements optimally.

In the earlier example [1,2,3,4], this approach would pair (1,2) and (3,4), which gives a total of 4, which was the best in that case. But let's see another example.

Consider [1,3,2,4]. According to this code:

- First, take (1,3), min is 1, remove 1 and 3.

- Then, take (2,4), min is 2, remove 2 and 4.

- Total score: 3.

But is there a better pairing? What if we pair (1,2) and (3,4)?

- min(1,2)=1 + min(3,4)=3 → total 4.

Wait, that's the same as above.

Another pairing: (1,4) and (2,3).

- min(1,4)=1 + min(2,3)=2 → total 3.

So, in this case, the code's approach still gives the optimal score.

But let's try [1,2,3,4,5,6]. For n=3, so 6 elements.

Possible pairings:

- (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) → 2 + 3 + 5 = 10

- (1,3), (2,4), (5,6) → 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

- (1,5), (2,6), (3,4) → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

- (1,4), (2,5), (3,6) → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

So, the first pairing gives the highest score of 10.

But according to the code's approach:

- Take first two: (1,2), min=1, remove them.

- Take next two: (3,4), min=3, remove them.

- Take next two: (5,6), min=5, remove them.

- Total score: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

But the optimal is 10, so it's not achieving that.

Wait, but in this case, the code's approach gives 9, but optimal is 10. So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, how to achieve 10? By pairing (2,5) and (3,6), but that gives min=2 and 3, total 5, which is less than 9.

Wait, no, pairing (2,5) gives min=2, (3,6) gives min=3, and (1,4) gives min=1, total 6, which is less than 9.

Wait, perhaps 9 is the optimal? Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, pairing (1,2): min=1, (3,4): min=3, (5,6): min=5, total 9.

Alternatively, pairing (1,4): min=1, (2,5): min=2, (3,6): min=3, total 6.

Or pairing (1,5): min=1, (2,6): min=2, (3,4): min=3, total 6.

So, indeed, 9 seems better. Is there a way to get 10? Maybe not.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly thought pairing (2,5) and (3,6) gives 2 + 3 + something else, but actually, with n=3, we have three pairs.

So, perhaps 9 is the optimal.

Wait, but in this case, the code gives 9, which seems optimal.

But earlier, I thought someone claimed 10, but maybe I miscalculated.

So, perhaps the code is correct in this case.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, pairing (2,5), (3,6), and (1,4) gives 2 + 3 + 1 = 6, which is worse than pairing (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) giving 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

So, 9 seems better.

Is there a better pairing?

What if I pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6): min=1 + 2 + 5 = 8, which is worse.

Or (1,2), (4,5), (3,6): min=1 + 4 + 3 = 8.

So, 9 seems the best.

Hence, in this case, the code's approach gives the optimal.

Wait, but in the earlier smaller example, it gave the optimal as well.

Maybe my initial thought about [1,2,3,4] was incorrect.

Wait, in [1,2,3,4], pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives min=1 and 3, total 4.

Alternatively, (1,3) and (2,4) gives min=1 and 2, total 3.

Or (1,4) and (2,3) gives min=1 and 2, total 3.

So, indeed, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives the highest total of 4.

The code's approach would do the same: take first two (1,2), min=1; then (3,4), min=3; total 4.

So, in this case, it's optimal.

Another test case: [1,1,2,1]. According to the problem, the optimal is 2.

According to the code:

- Take (1,1), min=1, remove them.

- Take (2,1), min=1, remove them.

- Total score: 2.

Which matches the optimal.

Another test case: [1,1,1,1,1,1]. According to the problem, the optimal is 3.

According to the code:

- Take (1,1), min=1, remove them.

- Take (1,1), min=1, remove them.

- Take (1,1), min=1, remove them.

- Total score: 3.

Which is optimal.

So, perhaps the code is correct after all.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was incorrect because I thought pairing could give a higher score, but maybe I miscalculated.

Given that in all the examples I tried, the code gives the optimal score, maybe the approach is correct.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the list in non-decreasing order.

Then, pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on.

So, for [1,2,3,4], sorted: [1,2,3,4], pair (1,2) and (3,4), min=1 and 3, total=4.

Is there a better pairing? No.

For [1,1,2,1], sorted: [1,1,1,2], pair (1,1) and (1,2), min=1 and 1, total=2.

Is there a better pairing? No.

For [1,1,1,1,1,1], sorted: [1,1,1,1,1,1], pair (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), min=1 each time, total=3.

Optimal.

So, sorting and pairing the smallest with the next smallest seems to give the optimal.

But is this always true?

Wait, in the code provided, it doesn't sort the list. It just takes the first two elements as they are input.

So, if the list is not sorted, it might not pair the smallest elements together.

Wait, but in the examples I tried, it still gave the optimal.

Is there a case where sorting would give a better score than the code's approach?

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider [1,3,2,4].

According to the code:

- Take (1,3), min=1, remove them.

- Take (2,4), min=2, remove them.

- Total score: 3.

Is there a better pairing?

- Pair (1,2), min=1; pair (3,4), min=3; total=4.

- Pair (1,4), min=1; pair (2,3), min=2; total=3.

- Pair (1,3), min=1; pair (2,4), min=2; total=3.

So, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives a higher total of 4.

But the code's approach gives 3, which is less than optimal.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was giving 4, but actually, in this case, it gives 3.

Wait, no, in [1,2,3,4], the code would take (1,2), min=1, then (3,4), min=3, total=4.

Wait, but in [1,3,2,4], it takes (1,3), min=1, then (2,4), min=2, total=3.

But if I sort it to [1,2,3,4], pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives 1+3=4, which is better.

So, in this case, the code's approach gives 3, but the optimal is 4.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input is a list of 2n integers, but it doesn't specify any order.

So, perhaps the code assumes that the list is already sorted, but in reality, it's not.

Wait, but looking back at the code, it doesn't sort the list.

It just takes the first two elements as they are given.

Hence, in the case where the list is not sorted, it may not pair the smallest elements optimally.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But in the earlier test cases, the inputs were already sorted or the pairing happened to give the optimal.

But in this [1,3,2,4] case, it doesn't.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the Correctness is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values of pairs selected from a list of 2n integers, where we perform n such pairings.

### Approach

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - We need to pair the numbers in such a way that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.
   - A naive approach might involve always picking the smallest available numbers, but this doesn't guarantee the optimal solution.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the sum of the minimum values, we should aim to pair smaller numbers with the next smallest possible numbers. This way, the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.
   - Sorting the list in non-decreasing order allows us to pair the smallest numbers together, ensuring that their minimum values are higher than they would be in mixed pairs.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case:
     - Read the integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` integers.
     - Read the list of `2n` integers.
     - Sort the list in non-decreasing order.
     - Pair the first two elements, then the next two, and so on, up to `2n` elements.
     - Sum the minimum of each pair (which is the first element in each pair due to sorting).

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use Python's built-in sorting function to sort the list.
   - Iterate through the sorted list in steps of 2 to sum the minimum values of each pair.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    ans_f = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        lst = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        lst.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0, 2*n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read all input data at once and split it into lines.
  - The first line gives the number of test cases `t`.
  
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, read `n` and then the list of `2n` integers.
  - Sort the list in non-decreasing order.
  - Sum the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) since the list is sorted, these are the minimums of each pair.
  
- **Output**:
  - Store the answers in a list and print each one after processing all test cases.

This approach ensures that we are pairing the smallest numbers together, thereby maximizing the sum of their minimum values.
