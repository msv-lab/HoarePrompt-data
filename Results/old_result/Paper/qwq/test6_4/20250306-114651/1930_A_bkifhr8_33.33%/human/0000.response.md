Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard. I need to play a game where I perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers x and y, add the minimum of them to my score, and then erase both from the whiteboard. I have to do this n times, and at the end, there should be no integers left on the whiteboard. The goal is to maximize my final score.

First, I need to understand the problem properly. I have 2n integers, and I need to pair them up in n pairs. For each pair, I add the smaller number to my score. I need to choose the pairs in such a way that the total score is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 1

Numbers: 2, 3

I have to choose one pair, which is (2, 3), and add the minimum, which is 2, to my score. So, the score is 2.

Second test case:

n = 2

Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 1

I need to form two pairs from these four numbers.

Option 1: Pair (1,1) and (2,1). For the first pair, min(1,1) = 1, and for the second pair, min(2,1) = 1. Total score = 1 + 1 = 2.

Option 2: Pair (1,2) and (1,1). For the first pair, min(1,2) = 1, and for the second pair, min(1,1) = 1. Total score = 1 + 1 = 2.

Option 3: Pair (1,1) and (1,2). Same as above, total score = 1 + 1 = 2.

Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get a score of 2.

Third test case:

n = 3

Numbers: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

All numbers are 1, so no matter how I pair them, each pair will contribute 1 to the score. Total score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

From these examples, it seems that to maximize the score, I need to pair the numbers in a way that the smaller numbers are paired together as much as possible, so that the minimum in each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, in the second test case, all pairings give the same score. But maybe in other cases, different pairings lead to different scores.

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=2, and numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.

Option 1: Pair (1,2) and (3,4). Scores: min(1,2)=1 and min(3,4)=3. Total = 4.

Option 2: Pair (1,3) and (2,4). Scores: min(1,3)=1 and min(2,4)=2. Total = 3.

Option 3: Pair (1,4) and (2,3). Scores: min(1,4)=1 and min(2,3)=2. Total = 3.

So, in this case, pairing the two smallest together gives a higher total score than other pairings.

Wait, but in this case, pairing the two smallest together gives a higher total score than pairing them differently.

Wait no, in the first option, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives a total of 4, which is higher than the other options.

Wait, but in the second and third options, the total is 3.

So, pairing the two smallest together gives a higher total.

Wait, but in the second test case, all pairings gave the same score.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me think about sorting the numbers.

Suppose I sort the numbers in non-decreasing order.

Then, to maximize the sum of the minimums, perhaps I should pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on.

In the first example with n=2 and numbers 1,2,3,4:

Sorted: 1,2,3,4

Pair (1,2) and (3,4):

min(1,2)=1

min(3,4)=3

Total=4

Alternatively, pair (1,3) and (2,4):

min(1,3)=1

min(2,4)=2

Total=3

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a better total.

Similarly, in the second test case with n=2 and numbers 1,1,2,1:

Sorted: 1,1,1,2

Pair (1,1) and (1,2):

min(1,1)=1

min(1,2)=1

Total=2

Alternatively, pair (1,1) and (1,2):

Same as above.

So, in this case, all pairings give the same total.

But in the first example, pairing the smallest together gives a better total.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to sort the numbers and pair them in order.

Wait, but in the second test case, all pairings give the same total, which is 2.

Wait, but in the first example, pairing the smallest together gives a better total.

Wait, maybe I need to pair the smallest with the largest.

Wait, in the first example, pairing (1,4) and (2,3):

min(1,4)=1

min(2,3)=2

Total=3

Which is less than pairing (1,2) and (3,4), which gives total=4.

So, pairing the smallest with the largest gives a lower total than pairing the smallest with the next smallest.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to sort the numbers and pair them in order.

Wait, in the first example, sorting gives 1,2,3,4.

Pair (1,2) and (3,4):

min(1,2)=1

min(3,4)=3

Total=4

Alternatively, pair (1,3) and (2,4):

min(1,3)=1

min(2,4)=2

Total=3

So, pairing in order gives a better total.

Another way: sort the numbers and pair the smallest with the next smallest.

So, in sorted order, pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on.

This seems to give the maximum total.

Let me see another example.

Suppose n=3, numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6

Sorted: 1,2,3,4,5,6

Pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6):

min(1,2)=1

min(3,4)=3

min(5,6)=5

Total=9

Alternatively, pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6):

min(1,3)=1

min(2,4)=2

min(5,6)=5

Total=8

Another pairing: (1,5), (2,6), (3,4):

min(1,5)=1

min(2,6)=2

min(3,4)=3

Total=6

So, pairing in order gives the highest total.

Therefore, the optimal strategy seems to be:

- Sort the numbers in non-decreasing order.

- Pair the first with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on.

- For each pair, add the first number (which is the smaller one) to the total score.

Wait, but in the second test case, all pairings give the same total.

Wait, in that case, numbers are 1,1,2,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2

Pair (1,1) and (1,2):

min(1,1)=1

min(1,2)=1

Total=2

Alternatively, pair (1,1) and (1,2):

Same as above.

So, in this case, all pairings give the same total.

Hence, sorting and pairing in order seems to work.

So, in general, to maximize the sum of the minimums, sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the numbers in consecutive pairs.

Then, for each pair, add the first number (which is the smaller one) to the total score.

This should give the maximum possible score.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

ans_f = []

for i in range(t):

ans = 0

n = int(input())

l = input()

lst = l.split(' ')

for i in range(n * 2):

if len(lst) != 2:

ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])

lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])

else:

ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

break

ans_f.append(ans)

for i in ans_f:

print(i)

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- It initializes ans to 0.

- Reads n, which is half the number of integers.

- Reads a line of input, splits it into a list called lst.

Then, it enters a loop that runs n*2 times.

In each iteration:

- If the list has more than 2 elements, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to ans, and removes those two elements.

- If the list has exactly 2 elements, it adds the minimum of those two to ans and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, it appends the total ans to ans_f for each test case and prints them.

Wait, but this seems inefficient and might not be correct.

First, it doesn't sort the list, which, based on my earlier reasoning, is necessary to maximize the sum.

Second, it repeatedly removes elements from the list, which can be inefficient, especially since lists in Python have O(n) removal time for arbitrary indices.

Third, the logic inside the loop seems flawed.

Let's see with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=1

Numbers: 2,3

It reads lst = ['2','3']

Enters the loop once (since n*2=2):

First iteration:

len(lst) = 2, which is not !=2, so it goes to the else clause:

ans += min(2,3) = 2

Then breaks out of the loop.

So, ans=2, which matches the expected output.

Second test case:

n=2

Numbers:1,1,2,1

lst = ['1','1','2','1']

Enters the loop 4 times:

First iteration:

len(lst) !=2, so ans += min(1,1) =1, removes lst[0] and lst[1], so lst becomes ['2','1']

Second iteration:

len(lst) =2, so ans += min(2,1)=1, breaks out of the loop.

Total ans=2, which matches the expected output.

Third test case:

n=3

Numbers:1,1,1,1,1,1

lst = ['1','1','1','1','1','1']

First iteration:

len(lst)!=2, ans += min(1,1)=1, removes lst[0] and lst[1], lst becomes ['1','1','1','1']

Second iteration:

len(lst)!=2, ans += min(1,1)=1, removes lst[0] and lst[1], lst becomes ['1','1']

Third iteration:

len(lst)=2, ans += min(1,1)=1, breaks out of the loop.

Total ans=3, which matches the expected output.

So, in these cases, it seems to work.

But is this the optimal way?

Let's consider the earlier example where n=2 and numbers are 1,2,3,4.

According to the program:

lst = ['1','2','3','4']

First iteration:

ans += min(1,2)=1, removes lst[0] and lst[1], lst becomes ['3','4']

Second iteration:

len(lst)=2, ans += min(3,4)=3, breaks.

Total ans=4, which is correct.

But according to my earlier reasoning, sorting and pairing in order gives the maximum sum.

In this case, the program happens to get the correct pairing, but only because the input list was already sorted in this case.

But what if the input list is not sorted?

Take n=2, numbers:4,2,1,3

lst = ['4','2','1','3']

First iteration:

ans += min(4,2)=2, removes lst[0] and lst[1], lst becomes ['1','3']

Second iteration:

len(lst)=2, ans += min(1,3)=1, breaks.

Total ans=3

But according to the optimal pairing, sorting gives 1,2,3,4, pairing (1,2) and (3,4), which gives 1+3=4.

So, in this case, the program gives 3, but the optimal is 4.

Hence, the program is not correct.

Wait, but in this case, the program gave 3, whereas the optimal is 4.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not implement the optimal strategy.

The optimal strategy is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and pair them in consecutive pairs, adding the first number of each pair to the total score.

But in the program, it doesn't sort the list; it just takes the first two elements as they are in the input list.

Hence, the program may give suboptimal results when the input list is not sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix it, I need to sort the list in non-decreasing order before pairing.

So, the correct approach should be:

- Read the list of 2n numbers.

- Sort the list in non-decreasing order.

- Pair the numbers in order: (a1,a2), (a3,a4), ..., (a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}).

- For each pair, add the first number (which is the smaller one) to the total score.

This should give the maximum possible score.

Hence, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't sort the list before pairing the numbers.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the final score by optimally pairing numbers from a list of 2n integers and summing the minimum of each pair. The optimal strategy is to sort the list in non-decreasing order and pair the numbers in consecutive pairs, adding the smaller number of each pair to the total score.

### Approach

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases, and for each test case, read the value of n and the list of 2n integers.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: Pair the numbers in order (first with second, third with fourth, etc.) and add the smaller number of each pair to the total score.
4. **Output the Results**: Print the final score for each test case.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        lst = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        lst.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0, 2*n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**: Read all input data at once and split it into lines. The first line gives the number of test cases, t. For each test case, the first line is n, and the second line is the list of 2n integers.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the list of integers to ensure that pairing is done optimally.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: Iterate through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller number of each pair (which is the first number in the pair due to sorting) to the total score.
4. **Output the Results**: Collect all final scores in a list and print each one.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum possible final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together, thereby maximizing the minimum values in each pair.
