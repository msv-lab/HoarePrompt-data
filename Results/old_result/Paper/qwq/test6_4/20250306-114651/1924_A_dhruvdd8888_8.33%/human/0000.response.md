Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can remove 'e' and 'd' to get "abc".

So, the task is to check if every possible combination of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet is present as a subsequence in s. If not, I need to output one such missing combination.

Let's think about the constraints:

- t is up to 10^5, which is 100,000 test cases.

- n is from 1 to 26.

- k is from 1 to 26.

- m is from 1 to 1000, and the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution because 100,000 test cases with up to 1000 characters each would be time-consuming if not optimized.

First, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet. Since there are k options for each position, there are k^n total possible strings. For k=26 and n=26, that's 26^26, which is way too big to handle directly. So, I need a smarter approach that doesn't require generating all possible strings.

Instead of generating all possible strings, I need a way to check if s contains every possible subsequence of length n from the first k letters.

This seems tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe I can find a way to check which sequences are missing without generating all possible sequences.

One approach could be to find the minimal sequence that is not a subsequence of s. If I can find such a sequence, then I can output it as the required string. If no such sequence exists, then all possible sequences are present.

To find the minimal missing sequence, I can try to find the lexicographically smallest sequence that is not a subsequence of s.

But how do I efficiently find this?

Let's consider building the sequence step by step. Start with the smallest possible character and try to extend the sequence.

Wait, but n can be up to 26, and k up to 26, so brute-forcing by trying all possibilities is not feasible.

Another idea: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the states of the sequences.

But DP might be too slow for t=1e5.

Let me look at the provided program and see what approach it's taking.

In the given program:

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n, k, m, and the string s.

- It creates a set us containing the first k lowercase letters.

- It initializes an empty set win and an empty list ans.

- It iterates through the string s, and for each character i:

- If i is in us, it adds it to win.

- If win has all k characters, it appends i to ans, increments ps, and clears win.

- If ps >= n, it prints 'YES'.

- Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and outputs a string that's not a subsequence.

Wait, this seems flawed.

Let me try to understand this logic.

It seems like it's trying to find subsequences that contain all k characters, and if there are at least n such subsequences, it prints 'YES'. But that doesn't align with the problem requirement, which is to check if all possible strings of length n using the first k letters are present as subsequences in s.

This seems incorrect.

Moreover, in the example provided:

Test case 1:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

All possible strings of length 2 with k=2 letters (a,b): aa, ab, ba, bb.

All of these are subsequences of "abba", so it should print 'YES'.

Test case 2:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Here, "aa" is not a subsequence, so it should print 'NO' and "aa".

Test case 3:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

All possible strings of length 3 with a,b,c: aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, ..., ccc.

Need to check if all these are subsequences of "aabbccabab". If not, print 'NO' and one missing string.

In the given program, it seems to be checking something different.

Let me see what it does in the first test case.

us = {'a', 'b'}

win starts empty.

s = "abba"

Iterate through s:

- 'a': in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'a','b'}

- Since win has both 'a' and 'b', append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win.

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'b'}

ps=1 >= n=2? No.

So prints 'NO' and outputs a string that's not a subsequence.

But according to the example, it should print 'YES'.

So, this program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking again:

It appends i to ans and increments ps when win has all k characters.

In the first test case, when win has both 'a' and 'b', it appends 'b' to ans, ps=1, clears win.

Then continues to the next character 'b', which is in us, adds to win, win={'b'}.

ps=1 >= n=2? No, so prints 'NO'.

But according to the problem, it should print 'YES'.

So, this program is incorrect.

Moreover, in the output, it prints 'NO' and then a string 'aa', which is correct for the second test case, but for the first test case, it should print 'YES'.

But in the first test case, ps=1 < n=2, so it prints 'NO', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
