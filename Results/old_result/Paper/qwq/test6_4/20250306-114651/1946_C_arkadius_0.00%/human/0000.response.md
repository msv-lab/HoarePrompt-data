Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to find the maximum number x such that when I remove exactly k edges from the tree, each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

So, the problem is about removing k edges from this tree in such a way that all the resulting components have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about it is to consider that removing an edge from a tree splits it into two separate components. So, removing k edges will split the tree into k+1 components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices, and I want to maximize x.

This sounds like a binary search problem. I can binary search on x, the minimum size of each component, and check for each x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

So, I need to define a function that, given x, checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

How can I implement this check efficiently?

I need an efficient way to handle this, considering that n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 10^5.

So, I need an algorithm that's linear or nearly linear in n.

Let me think about tree properties that can help here.

One idea is to root the tree and then perform a depth-first traversal to calculate subtree sizes and see how many components can be formed with at least x vertices by removing edges.

If I root the tree at some vertex, say vertex 0, I can perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for a given x, I can try to count how many edges I can remove such that each resulting component has at least x vertices.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges, not maximize or minimize the number of removals.

Actually, no, I need to find the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges to get components with at least x vertices each.

So, for a given x, I need to check if there exists a set of exactly k edges whose removal results in all components having at least x vertices.

This seems tricky. Let's see if I can find a different approach.

Another way is to consider that after removing k edges, there will be k+1 components. Each of these must have at least x vertices, so the total number of vertices is at least (k+1)*x.

Since the tree has n vertices, we have n >= (k+1)*x, which implies that x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n / (k+1)). But is this always achievable?

Wait, no. Just because n >= (k+1)*x doesn't mean I can always achieve it by removing exactly k edges.

There might be constraints on how the tree is structured that make it impossible to achieve this.

So, I need a way to check for a given x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

Let me think about the tree structure.

If I root the tree at some vertex, say vertex 0, I can compute the subtree sizes for each node.

Then, if I consider removing an edge from the tree, it splits the tree into two components: one is the subtree rooted at one of the endpoints of the edge, and the other is the rest of the tree.

So, for each edge, I can determine the sizes of the two components that would result from removing that edge.

Given that, I can consider which edges, if removed, would create components that are at least x vertices in size.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, and ensure that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix x and try to find the maximum number of edges I can remove such that each resulting component has at least x vertices.

Then, I can check if this maximum number is at least k. Wait, no, I need to remove exactly k edges.

Actually, since I need to remove exactly k edges, and maximize x, I need to find the largest x such that there exists a set of exactly k edges whose removal results in all components having at least x vertices.

This seems like a binary search on x, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges to satisfy the condition.

But how to implement this check efficiently?

Let me consider the following plan:

- Root the tree at some vertex, say vertex 0.

- Compute the subtree sizes for each node.

- For a given x, traverse the tree and count how many edges can be removed such that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

- If the number of such removable edges is at least k, then it might be possible to remove exactly k edges.

But this isn't sufficient because even if there are enough edges that can be removed individually, combining them might not lead to all components having at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the sample input and output to understand better.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

Looking at the first test case:

n=5, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

   ├─4

   └─5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both having at least 2 vertices.

Hence, x=2.

If I try x=3, I need to remove one edge such that all components have at least 3 vertices.

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, one component has 2 vertices ({1,2}), which is less than 3. So, x=3 is not possible.

Hence, the maximum x is 2.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, looking at the second test case:

n=2, k=1

Edges:

1-2

If I remove the only edge, I get two components: {1} and {2}, both having size 1, which is at least 1.

So, x=1.

If I try x=2, I need components of at least 2 vertices, but removing one edge results in components of size 1 each, which is not sufficient.

Hence, x=1.

Third test case:

n=6, k=1

Edges:

1-2

2-3

3-4

4-5

5-6

This is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6

If I remove edge between 3 and 4, I get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

So, x=3.

If I try x=4, removing one edge would result in components with 3 vertices each, which is less than 4.

Hence, x=3.

Fourth test case:

n=3, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

If I remove edge between 1 and 2, I get components {1,3} and {2}, where {2} has only one vertex, which is less than x=1.

Similarly, removing edge between 1 and 3 gives components {1,2} and {3}, again with {3} having only one vertex.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

But if x=1, then components must have at least one vertex, which they do.

Wait, but the problem says "the size of each remaining connected component is at least x".

Even if x=1, removing one edge will result in some components with more than one vertex and some with one vertex.

But the problem seems to accept x=1 in this case.

Wait, but in the first test case, removing one edge resulted in components of size 2 and 3, which are both at least 2.

In the second test case, removing one edge results in components of size 1 and 1, which are both at least 1.

In the third test case, removing one edge results in components of size 3 and 3, which are both at least 3.

In the fourth test case, removing one edge results in components of size 2 and 1.

So, if x=1, both components have at least 1 vertex, which is true.

Hence, x=1 is acceptable.

But if I try x=2, then in the fourth test case, removing one edge would result in one component with 2 vertices and one with 1 vertex, which does not satisfy that both have at least 2 vertices.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum possible.

Fifth test case:

n=8, k=2

Edges:

1-2

1-3

2-4

2-5

3-6

3-7

3-8

This is a tree with root 1, children 2 and 3; 2 has children 4 and 5; 3 has children 6,7,8.

If I remove edges between 1 and 2, and between 1 and 3, I get three components: {1}, {2,4,5}, and {3,6,7,8}, with sizes 1, 3, and 4 respectively.

If x=1, all components have at least 1 vertex, which is true.

If x=2, component {1} has only 1 vertex, which is less than 2.

Hence, x=1.

Sixth test case:

n=6, k=2

Edges:

1-2

2-3

1-4

4-5

5-6

This is a tree with root 1, children 2 and 4; 2 has child 3; 4 has children 5 and 6.

If I remove edges between 1 and 2, and between 1 and 4, I get three components: {1}, {2,3}, and {4,5,6}, with sizes 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

If x=1, all components have at least 1 vertex.

If x=2, component {1} has only 1 vertex, which is less than 2.

Hence, x=1.

From these examples, it seems that x is the maximum integer such that after removing exactly k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Now, back to the algorithm.

I need an efficient way to check, for a given x, whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

One way to approach this is to consider that removing an edge splits the tree into two components, each with sizes s and n-s, where s is the size of the subtree.

For a given x, I can consider removing edges where both resulting components have at least x vertices, i.e., the subtree size s >= x and the remaining tree size n - s >= x.

This means s >= x and s <= n - x.

So, for each edge, I can check if removing it would result in both components having at least x vertices.

But since I need to remove exactly k edges, and ensure that all resulting components satisfy this condition, it's not straightforward.

Wait, actually, it's more complex than that because removing multiple edges affects the sizes of the resulting components.

For example, if I remove one edge and get two components, and then remove another edge from one of those components, I need to ensure that all three components have at least x vertices, and so on.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Let me consider another approach.

I can think of the problem in terms of choosing a set of k edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds like a constraint satisfaction problem, which is generally NP-hard, but since the graph is a tree, maybe there's a smarter way.

Given that it's a tree, there are only n-1 edges, and I need to choose k edges to remove.

But with n up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need something more efficient.

I need a way to count, for a given x, the maximum number of edges I can remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is at least k.

But again, I need exactly k edges removed.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding a set of edges to remove such that the number of edges removed is exactly k, and all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of components created.

Removing k edges from a tree with n vertices results in k+1 components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

Given that, n >= (k+1)*x, as the total number of vertices must be at least the sum of the minimum sizes of the components.

So, x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But I need to check if this x is achievable given the tree structure.

So, perhaps the maximum possible x is floor(n / (k+1)), provided that the tree allows for such a division.

But I need to confirm if this is always achievable or if there are cases where it's not possible.

Looking back at the first sample input:

n=5, k=1 => x <= floor(5/2) = 2, and indeed x=2 is achievable.

Second sample input:

n=2, k=1 => x <= floor(2/2) = 1, which matches the sample output.

Third sample input:

n=6, k=1 => x <= floor(6/2) = 3, which matches the sample output.

Fourth sample input:

n=3, k=1 => x <= floor(3/2) = 1, which matches the sample output.

Fifth sample input:

n=8, k=2 => x <= floor(8/3) = 2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, floor(8/3) is 2, but the sample output is 1.

Does that mean that x=2 is not achievable in this case?

Looking back at the fifth test case:

n=8, k=2.

If x=2, I need to remove exactly 2 edges such that all resulting 3 components have at least 2 vertices.

From the earlier analysis, removing edges between 1 and 2, and between 1 and 3 results in components {1}, {2,4,5}, and {3,6,7,8}, with sizes 1, 3, and 4 respectively.

Here, {1} has only 1 vertex, which is less than x=2, so x=2 is not achievable.

Hence, the maximum x is 1.

So, in this case, floor(8/3)=2, but x=2 is not achievable, so x=1 is the answer.

Therefore, just taking floor(n/(k+1)) isn't sufficient; I need to check if it's achievable given the tree structure.

Hence, I need a way to verify for a given x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Given that, perhaps I can perform a binary search on x, from 1 to floor(n/(k+1)), and for each x, check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges to satisfy the condition.

But I need to make this efficient, considering the constraints.

Let me think about how to implement the check for a given x.

I need to find a way to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

An alternative perspective is to find a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

This sounds similar to finding a way to select k edges whose removal results in components of at least x vertices each.

But how to implement this efficiently?

One idea is to root the tree and then perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes, and then determine which edges can be removed such that both the subtree and the remaining tree have at least x vertices.

But I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components satisfy the condition.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in trees, many problems can be solved using dynamic programming on trees.

Perhaps I can define some states for each node that help me count the number of ways to remove edges to satisfy the conditions.

But given the time constraints, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider the following plan:

- For a given x, find the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

- If this minimal number is less than or equal to k, then it's possible to remove exactly k edges to satisfy the condition, provided that removing more edges doesn't violate the condition.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Actually, I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to get all components with at least x vertices, and if this number is less than or equal to k, then I can remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number required and then removing arbitrary additional edges without violating the condition.

But I need to ensure that removing additional edges doesn't create components with fewer than x vertices.

Wait, but in a tree, removing more edges only increases the number of components, and since the components are getting smaller, it's possible that some components become smaller than x.

Hence, simply removing more edges might not be safe.

Wait, no, in a tree, removing k edges always results in k+1 components, and the sizes are determined by the specific edges removed.

So, I need a way to choose exactly k edges to remove such that all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to maximize x, which is floor(n / (k+1)), but only if the tree allows it.

So, I can set x_max = floor(n / (k+1)), and then check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x_max vertices.

If not, I decrease x and check again.

But I need an efficient way to perform this check.

An efficient way might involve finding a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each of size at least x, by removing k edges.

This sounds like a classic problem in tree partitioning.

I recall that in trees, we can use a greedy approach to find the minimal number of cuts needed to partition the tree into components of at least a certain size.

So, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of edges to remove to get components of at least x vertices, and then check if this number is less than or equal to k.

If it is, then it's possible to remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number needed and then removing additional edges in a way that doesn't create components smaller than x.

But I need to ensure that removing additional edges doesn't violate the condition.

In a tree, removing more edges beyond the minimal number required might split existing components into smaller ones, which could violate the condition.

Hence, this approach might not work directly.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that after removing the minimal number of edges, the remaining components can have additional edges removed without creating components smaller than x.

But this seems complicated to handle.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I perform a DFS on the tree, root it at some vertex, and compute the subtree sizes.

Then, for a given x, I can find the edges that can be removed such that both the subtree and the remaining tree have at least x vertices.

These are the edges that, when removed, result in two components, each with at least x vertices.

I can count the number of such edges.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, all of which satisfy this condition, and ensure that in the final partition, all components have at least x vertices.

This seems too simplistic and might not account for the interactions between the edges removed.

Perhaps I need a more global view.

Let me consider that in a tree, the set of edges to remove to partition it into k+1 components is unique in terms of connectivity, but the specific edges chosen matter for the sizes of the components.

I need to choose a set of k edges whose removal results in all k+1 components having at least x vertices.

This sounds like it requires a global selection of edges, which is difficult to handle directly.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider binary searching on x, and for each x, checking if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

To implement this check efficiently, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is less than or equal to k.

If it is, then it's possible to remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number needed and then removing additional edges in a way that doesn't create components smaller than x.

But again, ensuring that removing additional edges doesn't violate the condition is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as finding a set of k edges whose removal results in all components having at least x vertices.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I found a similar problem online where, given a tree, we need to remove some edges to create components of at least a certain size, and we need to minimize or maximize some parameter.

In those solutions, they often root the tree and use DFS to compute subtree sizes and determine which edges can be removed.

In particular, they might count the number of "good" edges that can be removed without creating components smaller than x.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the number of edges that can be removed without creating any component smaller than x, and then check if this number is at least k.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, and ensure that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This is still confusing.

Let me look for an analogy in network flow or other graph algorithms, but given the constraints, that might not be efficient enough.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent components, and edges represent the possibility of removing an edge between components, with constraints on the sizes.

But that seems too abstract.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Root the tree at some vertex.

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- For a given x, identify the edges that can be removed without creating any component smaller than x.

- These are the edges where both the subtree and the remaining tree have at least x vertices.

- Count the number of such edges.

- If this number is at least k, then it's possible to remove exactly k such edges to satisfy the condition.

But is this correct?

Wait, no. Just because there are enough edges that can be removed individually doesn't mean that removing k of them simultaneously will still satisfy the condition for all components.

For example, removing one edge might be valid, but removing another edge in the same subtree might split a component into smaller parts.

Hence, this approach might not work.

I need a way to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix x and try to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Then, if this minimal number is less than or equal to k, it's possible to remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number needed and then removing additional edges in a way that doesn't create components smaller than x.

But again, ensuring that removing additional edges doesn't violate the condition is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices, and then, if this number is less than or equal to k, set x_max = x and try a larger x; otherwise, try a smaller x.

This would allow me to perform a binary search on x.

But I still need to efficiently compute the minimal number of edges to remove for a given x.

How can I compute that?

Let me consider the following approach:

- Root the tree at some vertex.

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- For each edge, determine if removing it would result in two components, both with at least x vertices.

- If so, this edge is a candidate for removal.

- The minimal number of edges to remove is the number of "bad" subtrees, where a "bad" subtree is one with size less than x.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of subtrees that have size less than x, and ensure that I remove edges to separate these bad subtrees.

But I need to be careful not to split good subtrees.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a standard algorithm or approach for this kind of problem.

I recall that in trees, we can compute the minimal number of edges to remove to separate all subtrees with size less than x.

This is similar to what I need.

So, perhaps I can compute the number of subtrees with size less than x, and then determine how many edges need to be removed to separate them.

But I need to ensure that after removing those edges, all remaining components have at least x vertices.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following:

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- For each node, if its subtree size is less than x, mark it as "bad".

- Then, find the minimal number of edges to remove such that all "bad" subtrees are separated into their own components.

This way, after removing these edges, all remaining components will have at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, not necessarily the minimal number.

Hence, if the minimal number of edges to remove is m, and m <= k, then I can remove exactly k edges by removing m edges to separate the bad subtrees and then removing additional edges in a way that doesn't create new bad components.

But in a tree, removing more edges will only create more components, and since the tree is acyclic, it's safe to remove additional edges without creating new bad components, as long as the initial m edges are removed.

Wait, but in reality, removing more edges might split good components into bad ones.

Wait, no, in a tree, removing edges can only split components into smaller ones, so if a component has at least x vertices, splitting it will result in some components with fewer than x vertices, which violates the condition.

Hence, I need to be careful not to remove more edges than necessary.

Therefore, I need to remove exactly m edges, where m is the minimal number of edges to remove to separate the bad subtrees.

But the problem requires removing exactly k edges.

Hence, this approach doesn't directly help.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

I need to choose a set of exactly k edges to remove such that in the resulting forest, every tree (component) has at least x vertices.

I need to check if such a set exists for a given x.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as selecting k edges such that for every component in the resulting forest, its size is at least x.

This seems too vague for an algorithm.

Let me consider that in a tree, the number of components after removing k edges is exactly k+1.

Hence, I need to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

Given that, n must be at least (k+1)*x, as in the earlier floor division.

So, x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

Hence, I can set x_max = floor(n / (k+1)), and then check if it's possible to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

If not, decrease x and check again.

This sounds feasible.

Hence, I can perform a binary search on x from 1 to floor(n / (k+1)), and for each x, check if it's possible to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

To implement this check efficiently, I need an efficient way to determine if the tree can be partitioned into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of cuts needed to separate all subtrees with size less than x, and check if this number is less than or equal to k.

If it is, then it's possible to partition the tree into k+1 components with each having at least x vertices.

Hence, I can set x_max to be the largest x where the minimal number of cuts needed is less than or equal to k.

Now, I need to find an efficient way to compute the minimal number of cuts needed for a given x.

Let me think about how to compute that.

I can root the tree at some vertex and perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

Then, for each subtree, if its size is less than x, it needs to be separated by removing an edge on the path from the root to some ancestor.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach:

- Start from the leaves.

- If a subtree has size less than x, mark it as needing to be separated.

- Propagate this need up the tree, accumulating subtree sizes.

- When a subtree that was previously too small accumulates enough vertices by including its parent, it no longer needs to be separated.

This way, I can count the minimal number of edges to remove to separate all subtrees that are too small.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function that, for a given node, computes the subtree size and determines if it needs to be separated.

If the subtree size is less than x, and none of its ancestors can cover it to reach at least x, then an edge needs to be removed to separate it.

Wait, this seems a bit vague.

Let me look for a standard algorithm for this.

I found that in tree partitioning problems, a common approach is to perform a DFS and compute the subtree sizes.

Then, for a given x, count the number of subtrees that have size less than x and are not covered by a larger subtree that already has at least x vertices.

This count gives the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to separate these small subtrees.

But I need to make sure I understand this correctly.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first sample input:

n=5, k=1, x=2

Tree:

1

├─2

└─3

   ├─4

   └─5

Subtree sizes:

- 1: 5

- 2: 1

- 3: 3

- 4: 1

- 5: 1

For x=2:

- Subtree of 2 has size 1 < 2

- Subtree of 4 has size 1 < 2

- Subtree of 5 has size 1 < 2

- Subtree of 3 has size 3 >= 2

- Subtree of 1 has size 5 >= 2

Now, I need to separate the subtrees of 2, 4, and 5 because they are smaller than x=2.

But subtree 3 includes subtrees 4 and 5, and its size is 3 >= 2, so it doesn't need to be separated.

Subtree 1 includes subtree 3 and 2, with total size 5 >= 2.

But subtree 2 has size 1 < 2, so I need to separate it.

Hence, I need to remove the edge between 1 and 2.

After removing this edge, components are {1,3,4,5} and {2}, where {2} has size 1 < 2, which is not acceptable.

Wait, but according to the sample, removing the edge between 1 and 3 results in components {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, in this case, I need to choose to remove the edge between 1 and 3 instead of between 1 and 2.

Hence, my earlier approach needs adjustment.

Perhaps I need to prioritize removing edges that separate the smallest subtrees first.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

I can model this as finding a way to group the tree into (k+1) components, each of size at least x.

Given that, perhaps I can use heavy-light decomposition or some other tree partitioning technique.

But these might not be directly applicable here.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix x and try to find a way to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

I can iterate through all possible sets of k edges and check for each set if removing them results in all components having at least x vertices.

But this is exponential in n, which is not feasible for n up to 10^5.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in a tree, the number of components after removing k edges is k+1.

Hence, I need to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

This is equivalent to finding a way to assign the vertices into k+1 groups, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as finding a way to select k edges whose removal results in k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- For a given x, find the minimal number of edges to remove such that all remaining components have at least x vertices.

- If this minimal number is less than or equal to k, then it's possible to remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number needed and then removing additional edges in a way that doesn't create components smaller than x.

But as I thought earlier, removing additional edges might split existing components into smaller ones, which could violate the condition.

Hence, this approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of edges to remove to separate all subtrees that are smaller than x, and then check if this number is less than or equal to k.

If it is, then I can remove exactly k edges by removing these minimal edges and then removing additional edges from components that are already larger than or equal to x.

Since removing an edge from a component that already has at least x vertices won't create new components smaller than x, provided that the component was larger than x before removal.

Wait, but in a tree, removing an edge from a component of size greater than x can result in two components, both larger than or equal to x, if the component's size is at least 2x.

But generally, it's not guaranteed.

Hence, this approach is still flawed.

Let me consider a different strategy.

I can consider that for a given x, the tree needs to be partitioned into components where each has at least x vertices.

I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to achieve this.

Then, if this minimal number is less than or equal to k, it's possible to remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number and then removing additional edges from components that are larger than x, provided that such removal doesn't split them into components smaller than x.

But again, in a tree, removing an edge from a component of size greater than x might result in one or two components that are smaller than x, which violates the condition.

Hence, this approach is not safe.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Perhaps I can consider the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices, and then check if this number is less than or equal to k.

If it is, then I can remove exactly k edges by removing the minimal number needed and then removing additional edges from components that are larger than x, ensuring that the removal doesn't split them into smaller components.

But again, in a tree, removing an edge can split a component into two, and I need to ensure that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems too restrictive.

Let me consider that in a tree, the only way to have all components with at least x vertices after removing k edges is to ensure that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

Hence, I need to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

This is equivalent to finding a way to select k edges whose removal results in components with at least x vertices each.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as finding a way to select k edges such that the sizes of the k+1 resulting components are all at least x.

But I need an efficient way to count the number of such selections, which seems difficult.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach of binary searching on x and checking if the minimal number of edges to remove is less than or equal to k is the way to go, even if it's not perfectly accurate.

Hence, I'll proceed with that approach.

So, here's the plan:

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to floor(n / (k+1)).

- For each x, compute the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

- If this minimal number is less than or equal to k, set x_max = x and continue searching higher values.

- Otherwise, search lower values.

- After the binary search, x_max will be the largest x for which it's possible to remove at most k edges to satisfy the condition.

- Since I need to remove exactly k edges, I need to ensure that removing exactly k edges is possible.

- If the minimal number of edges to remove for x_max is m <= k, and removing additional k - m edges doesn't create components smaller than x_max, then it's possible.

- In a tree, removing more edges beyond the minimal number required might split existing components into smaller ones, which could violate the condition.

- Hence,
