Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this operation any number of times to make all elements in the array the same. The operation involves choosing two indices l and r, finding the median of the subarray from a_l to a_r, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that median.

The goal is to find out what the maximum possible value can be when all elements in the array are the same.

First, I need to understand what a median is in this context. The problem says that the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2) after sorting the subarray in non-decreasing order. So, for a subarray of length m, sort it, and pick the element at position floor((m+1)/2). For example, in a subarray of length 3, the median would be the second smallest element.

Mocha can perform this operation any number of times, choosing any subarray each time, and set that subarray to its median. She keeps doing this until all elements in the array are the same, and we need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved.

Let me think about how this operation affects the array. Each operation sets a subarray to its median. So, if I choose a subarray and set it to its median, the new subarray will have all elements equal to that median.

I need to find a sequence of such operations that results in all array elements being equal, and I want this common value to be as large as possible.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Possible operations:

- Choose l=1, r=2. The subarray is [1,2], sorted is [1,2], median is a[ floor((2+1)/2) ] = a[1] = 1.

- Set both elements to 1. So, the array becomes [1,1].

- No more operations can be performed since all elements are the same.

- So, the final value is 1.

Example 2:

n = 5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Possible operations:

- Choose l=4, r=5. Subarray [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4. Set to [4,4]. Array becomes [1,2,3,4,4].

- Choose l=3, r=5. Subarray [3,4,4], sorted [3,4,4], median is 4. Set to [4,4,4]. Array becomes [1,2,4,4,4].

- Choose l=1, r=5. Subarray [1,2,4,4,4], sorted [1,2,4,4,4], median is 4. Set to [4,4,4,4,4].

- All elements are now 4.

- So, the final value is 4.

Another possible sequence:

- Choose l=1, r=3. Subarray [1,2,3], sorted [1,2,3], median is 2. Set to [2,2,2]. Array becomes [2,2,2,4,5].

- Choose l=4, r=5. Subarray [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4. Set to [4,4]. Array becomes [2,2,2,4,4].

- Choose l=1, r=5. Subarray [2,2,2,4,4], sorted [2,2,2,4,4], median is 2. Set to [2,2,2,2,2].

- In this case, the final value is 2, which is less than the previous sequence's 4.

So, the order of operations matters in terms of what final value we get.

I need to find the maximum possible final value.

Let me think about what determines the maximum possible final value.

In the operation, we set a subarray to its median. The median of a subarray is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in the sorted subarray.

To maximize the final value, I need to try to set as large a value as possible across the array.

I need to see what constraints there are on how large this final value can be.

Let's consider that in order to set the entire array to a certain value, there must be a way to propagate that value across the array through the operations.

I need to see how the operations can be used to spread a value.

Let's consider that if I have a subarray where the median is x, then I can set that subarray to x.

If I have another subarray that overlaps with the first subarray, and I set it to its median, which might be different, then the common elements will be set to the median of the second subarray.

This seems a bit tricky to handle directly.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the possible values that can be achieved as the final value.

Given that I can perform operations any number of times, I need to find the maximum value that can be achieved when all elements are the same.

I need to find the minimal value that can be "spread" to the entire array through these operations.

Wait, actually, since I'm trying to maximize the final value, I need to find the largest value that can be "spread" to the entire array.

But how?

Let me consider that each operation sets a subarray to its median, which is effectively setting it to some value that is present in the subarray.

So, I need to see how higher values can be propagated to the entire array.

Let me consider that if I have a high value in the array, I need to find a way to set the entire array to that high value.

But to do that, I need to make sure that in some subarrays, this high value is the median, so that setting those subarrays to the median would set them to this high value.

However, the median is the middle value in the sorted subarray, so for the median to be as high as possible, the subarray should have as many high values as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal value in the array and see how it can be increased through operations.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want the entire array to be set to some value x. I need to check if it's possible to achieve that.

To achieve that, I need to be able to set the entire array to x through a series of operations.

Each operation sets a subarray to its median.

So, for the entire array to be set to x, I need to have a subarray that includes the entire array, and its median is x.

But that would require that x is the median of the entire array after some operations.

But it's not straightforward.

Maybe I need to consider the possible medians of subarrays and see how they can be used to influence the entire array.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that each operation sets a subarray to a value that is present in the subarray.

Since the median is one of the elements in the subarray, I'm essentially setting the subarray to one of its elements.

So, in each operation, I choose a subarray and set it to one of its elements.

I can think of this as propagating existing values in the array to other parts of the array.

Given that, I need to see which value can be propagated to the entire array.

But still, it's not clear how to find the maximum such value.

Let me consider the properties of the operations.

Operation:

1. Choose l and r (1 <= l < r <= n)

2. Compute the median x of the subarray a[l..r]

3. Set a[l..r] to x

I need to perform this operation multiple times until all elements are the same.

I need to maximize this final value.

Let me consider that the median of a subarray is at least the minimal element in that subarray.

So, setting a subarray to its median doesn't decrease any element below the median.

Wait, actually, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in the sorted subarray.

So, in a subarray of length m, after sorting, the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2).

For example:

- m=3: sorted subarray [a,b,c], median is b.

- m=4: sorted subarray [a,b,c,d], median is b.

Wait, according to the definition, median is at position floor((m+1)/2):

- For m=3: floor((3+1)/2) = floor(2) = 2, so the second smallest element.

- For m=4: floor((4+1)/2) = floor(2.5) = 2, so the second smallest element.

So, in both cases, the median is the second smallest element.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's check:

For m=3, sorted as [small, medium, large], median is medium, which is the second smallest.

For m=4, sorted as [a,b,c,d], median is b, which is the second smallest.

But according to the standard definition, the median is the middle value for odd lengths, and the lower of the two middle values for even lengths.

But here, it's defined as floor((m+1)/2), which for m=4 is 2.

So, yes, it's the second smallest.

Interesting.

So, in operation, I choose a subarray, sort it, pick the floor((m+1)/2)-th element as the median, and set the entire subarray to that value.

I need to find the maximum possible value that the entire array can be set to after performing this operation any number of times.

Let me consider that each operation sets a subarray to a value that is at least the minimal value in that subarray and at most the maximal value in that subarray.

Wait, no.

Since the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element, it is at least the minimal element and at most the maximal element in the subarray.

But more specifically, it's the second smallest in the sorted subarray when m >= 2.

Wait, for m=2, floor((2+1)/2)=1, so the first element.

Wait, no, wait, floor((2+1)/2)=1, but the problem says floor((m+1)/2), so for m=2, it's floor(1.5)=1, so the first element in the sorted subarray, which is the minimal element.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for m=2, it's the first element.

Wait, in the first example:

a=[1,2], choose (1,2), sorted [1,2], median is a[floor((2+1)/2)]=a[1]=1, so set both to 1.

In the second example:

a=[1,2,3,4,5], choose (4,5), sorted [4,5], median is 4, set to [4,4].

Then choose (3,5), sorted [3,4,4], median is 4, set to [4,4,4].

Then choose (1,5), sorted [1,2,4,4,4], median is 4, set to [4,4,4,4,4].

So, in this case, m=2, median is the first element; m=3, median is the second element; m=5, median is the third element.

Wait, but in the first test case, m=2, median is 1, which is the first element in the sorted subarray.

In the second test case, m=2, median is 4, which is the first element in the sorted subarray [4,5].

Wait, but [4,5] sorted is [4,5], floor((2+1)/2)=1, so a[1]=4.

Wait, but in a subarray of length 2, the median is the first element in the sorted subarray.

Wait, but in the first test case, subarray [1,2], sorted [1,2], floor((2+1)/2)=1, so a[1]=1.

So, in m=2, the median is the smallest element in the subarray.

In m=3, it's the second smallest.

In m=4, it's the second smallest.

In m=5, it's the third smallest.

So, in general, for any m, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in the sorted subarray.

So, in operation, I can choose any subarray, sort it, pick this median value, and set the entire subarray to that value.

I need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved when all elements are the same.

I need to maximize this final value.

Let me consider that in order to set the entire array to a certain value, I need to make sure that this value is achievable as the median of some subarray.

Moreover, since I can perform operations multiple times, I need to see how higher values can be propagated to the left.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the array as a whole and see what's the highest value that can be brought down to the entire array through a series of operations.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that each operation sets a subarray to a value that is present in that subarray.

Since the median is one of the elements in the subarray, after setting the subarray to its median, all elements in that subarray are set to that median value.

So, in a way, I'm propagating existing values in the array to other parts through these operations.

Given that, I need to see which value can be spread to the entire array.

But I need to maximize this value.

So, I need to see what is the highest value in the array that can be spread to the entire array through these operations.

But not all high values may be able to be spread to the entire array, depending on their positions and the values around them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal value in the array.

Wait, no, I need to maximize the final value, so I need to think about the highest possible value that can be propagated to the entire array.

But how?

Let me consider that if I have a high value in the array, I need to find a way to set its neighboring elements to that high value.

But in each operation, I can only set a subarray to its median.

So, if I have a subarray that includes the high value and some lower values, the median might not be the high value.

For example, if I have [1,2,10], the median is 2, not 10.

So, setting this subarray to 2 doesn't help me propagate the 10 to the left.

Wait, but if I choose a subarray that has more high values, then the median might be higher.

For example, in [1,2,10], median is 2.

But if I choose [2,10], median is 2.

Setting [2,10] to 2 makes it [2,2].

Then, choosing [1,2], median is 1, set to 1, so [1,1].

Then, choosing [1,1,2], median is 1, set to 1.

So, the array becomes [1,1,2].

Wait, but I already have a 10 in the array, so maybe choosing different subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I need to find connected components of high values or something like that.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix a value x and want to check if it's possible to set the entire array to x.

To do that, I need to see if I can propagate x to the entire array through the operations.

Given that each operation sets a subarray to its median, which is one of the elements in the subarray, I need to see if x can be made the median of some subarrays and then spread from there.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I can think in terms of the minimal position where x appears and try to spread from there.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in order to set the entire array to x, x must be present in every subarray that I choose in the operations leading to the final array.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the minimal value that can be spread to the entire array.

Wait, but I need the maximal value.

Maybe I need to consider the highest value that is present in a subarray where it is the median.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a pattern or a property that can help me find the maximum possible final value.

Looking back at the examples:

In the first example, n=2, a=[1,2], the final value is 1.

In the second example, n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5], the final value is 4.

In the first example, the minimal value is 1, and that's the final value.

In the second example, it's 4, which is higher than the minimal value.

Wait, in the second example, 4 is not the minimal value, but it's possible to set the entire array to 4.

So, it's not just about the minimal value.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal value in the array.

But in the second example, it's not the minimal value.

Wait, but in the first example, it's the minimal value.

Wait, no, in the second example, it's 4, which is not the minimal value.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal value in the array, but in the second example, it's possible to get a higher value.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal value in the array, but in some cases, higher values can be achieved.

But in the first example, only 1 can be achieved.

In the second example, 4 can be achieved.

So, what's the difference?

Looking at the second example:

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (4,5), set to 4, array becomes [1,2,3,4,4]

- Choose (3,5), set to 4, array becomes [1,2,4,4,4]

- Choose (1,5), set to 4, array becomes [4,4,4,4,4]

So, here, by choosing subarrays that include higher values, I can set them to higher medians.

In this case, I chose subarrays that allow me to set parts of the array to higher values.

So, perhaps the maximum final value is the highest median that can be achieved in some subarray.

But in the first example, the highest median is 1, since in any subarray, the median is 1.

Wait, in subarray [1,2], median is 1.

In subarray [1], median is 1.

So, yes, the highest median is 1.

In the second example, in subarray [4,5], median is 4.

In subarray [3,4,5], median is 4.

In subarray [2,3,4], median is 3.

So, the highest median in any subarray is 4.

And that's the final value achieved.

So, perhaps the maximum final value is the maximum median over all possible subarrays.

But wait, in the second example, the maximum median is 4, and that's the final value.

In the first example, the maximum median is 1, which is the final value.

Let me check another example.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,2,5]

Possible subarrays:

- [1], median=1

- [2], median=2

- [5], median=5

- [1,2], median=1

- [2,5], median=2

- [1,2,5], median=2

So, the maximum median is 5, from the subarray [5].

But can I set the entire array to 5?

Let's see:

- Choose (3,3), set to 5.

- Array is now [1,2,5]

- Choose (2,3), set to 5.

- Array is now [1,5,5]

- Choose (1,3), set to 5.

- Array is now [5,5,5]

So, yes, I can set the entire array to 5, which is the maximum median.

Another example:

n=4, a=[1,2,3,2]

Possible subarrays:

- [1], median=1

- [2], median=2

- [3], median=3

- [2], median=2

- [1,2], median=1

- [2,3], median=2

- [3,2], median=2

- [1,2,3], median=2

- [2,3,2], median=2

- [1,2,3,2], median=2

So, the maximum median is 3, from the subarray [3].

Can I set the entire array to 3?

- Choose (3,3), set to 3.

- Array is now [1,2,3,2]

- Choose (2,3), set to 3.

- Array is now [1,3,3,2]

- Choose (1,4), set to 3.

- Array is now [3,3,3,3]

Yes, I can set the entire array to 3.

So, in this case, the maximum median is 3, and I can set the array to 3.

Another example:

n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

Possible subarrays:

- [1], median=1

- [2], median=2

- [3], median=3

- [4], median=4

- [1,2], median=1

- [2,3], median=2

- [3,4], median=3

- [1,2,3], median=2

- [2,3,4], median=3

- [1,2,3,4], median=2

So, the maximum median is 4, from the subarray [4].

Can I set the entire array to 4?

- Choose (4,4), set to 4.

- Array is now [1,2,3,4]

- Choose (3,4), set to 4.

- Array is now [1,2,4,4]

- Choose (2,4), set to 4.

- Array is now [1,4,4,4]

- Choose (1,4), set to 4.

- Array is now [4,4,4,4]

Yes, I can set the entire array to 4.

So, in this case, the maximum median is 4, and I can set the array to 4.

Another example:

n=4, a=[1,2,2,1]

Possible subarrays:

- [1], median=1

- [2], median=2

- [2], median=2

- [1], median=1

- [1,2], median=1

- [2,2], median=2

- [2,1], median=1

- [1,2,2], median=2

- [2,2,1], median=2

- [1,2,2,1], median=2

So, the maximum median is 2.

Can I set the entire array to 2?

- Choose (2,3), set to 2.

- Array is now [1,2,2,1]

- Choose (1,3), set to 2.

- Array is now [2,2,2,1]

- Choose (1,4), set to 2.

- Array is now [2,2,2,2]

Yes, I can set the entire array to 2.

So, in this case, the maximum median is 2, and I can set the array to 2.

From these examples, it seems that the maximum final value is equal to the maximum median over all possible subarrays.

So, to solve the problem, I need to find the maximum median over all possible subarrays of the array a.

Given that, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Given that n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 500, with the total sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me think about how to compute the maximum median over all possible subarrays.

First, note that for any subarray of length m, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in the sorted subarray.

I need to find the maximum possible median over all possible subarrays.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

One way is to iterate over all possible subarrays, sort each one, find its median, and keep track of the maximum median.

But this would be O(n^3 log n), which is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for a given value x, I can check if x is achievable as the median of some subarray.

If I can find the maximum x that satisfies this condition, that would be my answer.

So, I can binary search on x, and check for each x if it's possible to have x as the median of some subarray.

But binary searching on x would require that the array is sorted, but I need to consider all possible subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and find the maximum a_i such that a_i is the median of some subarray.

But I need to consider the original positions of the elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider sorting the array and then finding the maximum a_i that can be a median in some subarray.

Wait, but the subarrays are taken from the original array, not from the sorted array.

So, I need to consider the original ordering.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a subarray length m, and find the median for each subarray of length m.

Then, I can find the maximum median among all these subarrays.

But doing this for each m separately wouldn't be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the maximum median over all possible m for each position.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for any subarray, its median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in that subarray.

So, for example, for m=1, median is a_i.

For m=2, median is the first element in the sorted subarray.

For m=3, median is the second element in the sorted subarray.

And so on.

I need to find, over all possible subarrays, what is the maximum median.

I need to maximize over all subarrays the median value.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that for any position i, I can consider subarrays that include position i, and find the maximum median among those subarrays.

Then, take the maximum over all i.

But I still need a better way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over all possible m and for each m, find the maximum median over all subarrays of length m.

Then, take the maximum over all m.

But this would still be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a fixed m, finding the maximum median over all subarrays of length m is equivalent to finding the maximum of the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest elements in each subarray of length m.

This sounds similar to finding the maximum of the k-th smallest elements in all subarrays of length m, where k = floor((m+1)/2).

This is a known problem in algorithms, and there are ways to compute this efficiently.

But I need to find this for all m, which seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the overall maximum median without iterating over all m.

Let me consider that the maximum median over all subarrays is equal to the maximum a_i, where a_i is the median of some subarray containing a_i.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Let's say the sorted array is b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n.

I need to find the maximum b_j such that b_j can be the median of some subarray in the original array.

But I need to consider the original positions of the elements.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any three consecutive elements, the median is the middle one.

So, for any subarray of length 3, the median is the middle element.

Similarly, for subarrays of length 2, the median is the smaller of the two.

So, perhaps I can focus on subarrays of length 3.

Wait, but I need to maximize the median, so I should look for higher values that can be medians in some subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the maximum a_i such that there exists a subarray containing a_i where a_i is the median.

Given that, for a subarray containing a_i, sorted, a_i needs to be at position floor((m+1)/2).

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for a subarray of length m, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element.

So, for m=3, it's the second smallest.

For m=4, it's the second smallest.

For m=5, it's the third smallest.

And so on.

I need to find, among all possible subarrays and their medians, the maximum median.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the maximum median over all subarrays is equal to the maximum a_i such that a_i can be the median of some subarray.

To maximize this, I need to find the highest possible a_i that can be a median in some subarray.

Given that, perhaps I can look for the maximum a_i such that there exists a subarray where a_i is the median.

To check if a_i can be the median of some subarray, I need to find a subarray where a_i is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element.

This seems complicated to check for each a_i.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a_i to be the median of some subarray, there must be at least floor((m+1)/2) - 1 elements in the subarray that are less than or equal to a_i, and the remaining elements are greater than or equal to a_i.

But this is still too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider that for a_i to be the median in some subarray, there must be a subarray where a_i is the middle element when sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the sorted list of subarrays.

This seems too broad.

Let me consider that in a subarray of length m, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element.

So, for m=3, it's the second smallest.

For m=4, it's the second smallest.

So, in both m=3 and m=4, it's the second smallest.

Wait, but for m=5, it's the third smallest.

So, it's not consistent across different m.

I need a way to find the maximum median over all possible m.

Let me consider that for any subarray, its median is at least the minimal element and at most the maximal element in that subarray.

But this doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum median over all subarrays is equal to the maximum a_i such that a_i appears in some subarray where it is the median.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for any subarray of length m, the median is the floor((m+1)/2)-th smallest element in that subarray.

So, for m=1, median is a_i.

For m=2, median is the first element in the sorted subarray.

For m=3, median is the second element in the sorted subarray.

And so on.

I need to find the maximum among all these medians.

This seems too broad.

Let me consider that for m=1, the median is a_i, for any single element.

So, the maximum median would be the maximum a_i.

But in the examples, the maximum final value is not always the maximum a_i.

Wait, in the second example, the maximum a_i is 5, but the final value is 4.

Wait, but in that case, I can set the entire array to 4, but not to 5.

So, perhaps the maximum final value is not necessarily the maximum a_i.

Wait, in the second example, I can set the entire array to 4, but I cannot set it to 5.

Let me check:

Suppose I try to set the entire array to 5.

- Choose (5,5), set to 5.

- Array is [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (4,5), set to 5.

- Array is [1,2,3,5,5]

- Choose (3,5), set to 5.

- Array is [1,2,5,5,5]

- Choose (2,5), set to 5.

- Array is [1,5,5,5,5]

- Choose (1,5), set to 5.

- Array is [5,5,5,5,5]

So, actually, I can set the entire array to 5.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says that in the second example, the final value is 4.

But according to this, I can set it to 5.

Is there a mistake in the problem description?

Wait, no, perhaps I misunderstood.

Wait, in the problem description, it says:

"In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

- Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] .

- Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] .

- Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] .

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that the maximum value of the number cannot be greater than 4 ."

Wait, but according to my previous steps, I can set it to 5.

So, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that the operations must be performed in such a way that the final value is the maximum possible that can be achieved through the operations.

But according to my previous steps, I can set it to 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to see if setting to 5 is possible.

Let me try again:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (5,5), set to 5: [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (4,5), set to 5: [1,2,3,5,5]

- Choose (3,5), set to 5: [1,2,5,5,5]

- Choose (2,5), set to 5: [1,5,5,5,5]

- Choose (1,5), set to 5: [5,5,5,5,5]

So, yes, I can set it to 5.

But the problem says that the maximum value cannot be greater than 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operations are constrained in some way that I can't choose subarrays in that order.

Wait, no, the operations can be performed in any order, and any subarrays can be chosen.

So, according to this, I can set the array to 5.

But the problem says that the maximum value cannot be greater than 4.

Is there a mistake in the problem description?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operation.

Wait, the operation is:

- Choose l and r (1 <= l < r <= n)

- Let x be the median of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]

- Set all values a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r to x

So, in each operation, I choose a subarray, compute its median, and set the entire subarray to that median.

In my previous steps, when I chose (5,5), the subarray is [5], median is 5, set to 5.

Then, choose (4,5), subarray [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4, set to 4.

Then, choose (3,5), subarray [3,4,5], sorted [3,4,5], median is 4, set to 4.

Then, choose (1,5), subarray [1,2,4,4,5], sorted [1,2,4,4,5], median is 4, set to 4.

So, the final array is [4,4,4,4,4].

So, in this sequence, I cannot set the array to 5 because in the step where I choose (4,5), I have to set it to 4, not 5.

If I try to choose different subarrays, perhaps I can achieve 5.

Let me try another sequence:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (3,5), subarray [3,4,5], sorted [3,4,5], median is 4, set to [4,4,4], array becomes [1,2,4,4,4]

- Choose (2,5), subarray [2,4,4,4], sorted [2,4,4,4], median is 4, set to [4,4,4,4], array becomes [1,4,4,4,4]

- Choose (1,5), subarray [1,4,4,4,4], sorted [1,4,4,4,4], median is 4, set to [4,4,4,4,4]

Again, I end up with 4.

Is it possible to get 5?

Let me try:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (5,5), set to 5: [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (4,5), set to 5: [1,2,3,5,5]

- Choose (3,5), set to 5: [1,2,5,5,5]

- Choose (2,5), set to 5: [1,5,5,5,5]

- Choose (1,5), set to 5: [5,5,5,5,5]

Wait, in this sequence, when I choose (4,5), the subarray [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4, so I set it to 4, not 5.

Wait, no, for m=2, the median is the first element in the sorted subarray, which is 4 in [4,5].

Wait, but according to the problem, for m=2, the median is floor((2+1)/2)=1, so the first element in the sorted subarray.

So, for [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4.

Therefore, when I set (4,5) to 4, it becomes [1,2,3,4,4].

Then, choosing (3,5), [3,4,4], sorted [3,4,4], median is 4, set to 4.

Then, choosing (1,5), [1,2,4,4,4], sorted [1,2,4,4,4], median is 4, set to 4.

So, I cannot get to 5 in this way.

Alternatively, if I choose different subarrays:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (3,4), subarray [3,4], sorted [3,4], median is 3, set to [3,3], array becomes [1,2,3,3,5]

- Choose (2,4), subarray [2,3,3], sorted [2,3,3], median is 3, set to [3,3,3], array becomes [1,3,3,3,5]

- Choose (1,5), subarray [1,3,3,3,5], sorted [1,3,3,3,5], median is 3, set to [3,3,3,3,3]

In this case, I end up with 3.

Still less than 5.

Another sequence:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (2,5), subarray [2,3,4,5], sorted [2,3,4,5], median is 3, set to [3,3,3,3], array becomes [1,3,3,3,3]

- Choose (1,5), subarray [1,3,3,3,3], sorted [1,3,3,3,3], median is 3, set to [3,3,3,3,3]

Again, ends up with 3.

Another sequence:

- Start with [1,2,3,4,5]

- Choose (1,2), subarray [1,2], sorted [1,2], median is 1, set to [1,1], array becomes [1,1,3,4,5]

- Choose (3,5), subarray [3,4,5], sorted [3,4,5], median is 4, set to [4,4,4], array becomes [1,1,4,4,4]

- Choose (1,5), subarray [1,1,4,4,4], sorted [1,1,4,4,4], median is 4, set to [4,4,4,4,4]

Again, ends up with 4.

So, in all these sequences, I cannot seem to set the array to 5.

Only to 4.

So, perhaps 5 cannot be achieved as the final value.

Wait, but in one of my earlier sequences, I thought I could set it to 5, but I must have made a mistake in understanding the median for m=2.

For m=2, the median is the first element in the sorted subarray, which is the smaller of the two.

So, when I choose (4,5), subarray [4,5], median is 4, not 5.

Therefore, I cannot set a subarray containing 4 and 5 to 5; I have to set it to 4.

Hence, I cannot propagate 5 to the left through these operations.

Therefore, the maximum final value is 4.

So, in this case, the maximum median over all possible subarrays is 4, from subarrays like [4,5] or [3,4,5].

Wait, but in subarray [5], the median is 5.

So, the maximum median is 5.

But I cannot propagate 5 to the entire array through the operations.

So, perhaps the maximum final value is not the maximum median over all subarrays.

There's something wrong with this approach.

Wait, in the subarray [5], the median is 5, but to set the entire array to 5, I need to have a subarray that includes the entire array and has a median of 5, which is not possible because the median of the entire array [
