Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations are allowed and how they can affect the array. The key point is that I can only perform this operation on elements that are at least 10. So, elements less than 10 cannot be broken down further.

I need to think about how breaking down these elements affects the order of the array. When I break down an element, I'm essentially replacing it with its digits, which are single-digit numbers. This can potentially make the array longer and change the relative order of elements.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted in non-decreasing order: 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3 ≤ 45 ≤ 67. So, the answer is YES.

In the second example:

Input:

3

12 28 5

If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Now, 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 28, but 28 is greater than 5, so it's not sorted. If I split 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. Now, 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 2 ≤ 8 ≤ 5 is not sorted because 8 > 5. If I split 5, it's already a single digit and can't be split. So, no matter what operations I perform, I can't get a sorted array. Hence, the answer is NO.

In the third example:

Input:

2

0 0

The array is already sorted, so no operations are needed. The answer is YES.

From these examples, it seems that the operations can be used to break down larger numbers into their constituent digits, which are single-digit numbers, and this can help in sorting the array in non-decreasing order.

Now, I need to find a general approach to determine whether it's possible to sort the array by performing these operations.

One way to approach this is to consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each element can be either a single-digit number or a multi-digit number that can be broken down into its digits.

I need to check if, by breaking down all the multi-digit numbers, the resulting sequence of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.

But wait, the operations allow me to choose which elements to break down, and in which order. So, I need to find a sequence of operations that leads to a sorted array.

This seems a bit tricky because the operations can be performed any number of times, and the order in which they are performed could affect the final sortedness of the array.

Let me think differently. Suppose I fully expand all elements that are greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. Then, I can check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

But is this always possible? In other words, if I break down all elements that are >=10 into their digits, will the resulting sequence be sorted if and only if the original array can be sorted by performing the operations on some elements?

Wait, no. Because the operations allow me to choose which elements to break down, and I might not need to break down all elements to achieve a sorted array.

For example, in the first test case:

Original array: [12, 3, 45, 67]

If I break down 12 into [1, 2], the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

I didn't need to break down 45 and 67 because 3 < 45 < 67, and 1 < 2 < 3.

So, in this case, breaking down only 12 was sufficient to achieve a sorted array.

In the second test case:

Original array: [12, 28, 5]

If I break down 12 into [1, 2], the array becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Now, 1 < 2 < 28, but 28 > 5, which is not sorted.

If I further break down 28 into [2, 8], the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. Now, 1 < 2 <= 2 < 8, but 8 > 5, which is still not sorted.

If I try to break down 5, it's already a single digit, so no change.

Alternatively, if I break down 28 first, the array becomes [12, 2, 8, 5]. Now, 12 > 2, which is not sorted.

If I break down 12 next, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. Again, 1 < 2 <= 2 < 8 > 5, which is not sorted.

So, no matter what operations I perform, I can't get a sorted array for this case.

In the third test case:

Original array: [0, 0]

It's already sorted, so no operations are needed.

From these observations, it seems that the key is to ensure that the sequence of digits, after performing the operations, is in non-decreasing order.

But how can I model this in code?

One approach could be to iterate through the array and ensure that for each element, if it's greater than or equal to 10, its digits, when inserted in place, don't disrupt the sorted order.

Wait, that sounds a bit vague. Let's try to formalize it.

Let's consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each element can be either a single digit or a number consisting of multiple digits.

I need to check if I can split the elements in such a way that the resulting sequence of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.

To do this, I can think of it as merging the digits from each element, considering the options of splitting or not splitting each element that is >=10.

This sounds similar to merging multiple sequences, where each element that is >=10 can be split into its digits, providing an alternative sequence.

But this seems complicated, especially since the operations can be performed in any order and any number of times.

Is there a simpler way to approach this?

Let me consider the array from left to right and ensure that each element or its split digits don't violate the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far. If I encounter an element that is smaller than the maximum seen so far, I need to check if splitting it into its digits can resolve the issue.

But I need to think carefully about how splitting affects the comparison.

Let me consider the array as a whole and think about what the final sequence would look like after all operations are performed.

The final sequence will consist only of single-digit numbers, since any number >=10 can be broken down into its digits, which are single-digit numbers.

So, the goal is to have a sequence of single-digit numbers that are sorted in non-decreasing order.

But the operations allow me to choose which elements to split, and in which order, so I need to find a way to decide which elements to split to achieve the sorted sequence.

This seems a bit too vague. Maybe I need to consider dynamic programming or some other optimization approach.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's consider that splitting an element into its digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than the original element.

But in reality, splitting can introduce smaller digits that might allow the array to be sorted where it wasn't possible before.

However, it's also possible that splitting an element could introduce digits that are larger than subsequent elements, which could disrupt the sorted order.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have the array, and I want to end up with a sequence of single-digit numbers that are sorted.

I can think of each element in the array as a potential source of one or more digits (if it's >=10), and I need to choose, for each such element, whether to keep it as is or split it into its digits, in a way that the entire sequence is sorted.

This sounds like a graph where each element has two possibilities: kept as is or split into digits, and I need to find a path through these choices that results in a sorted sequence.

But this seems too complex for the time constraints, especially since n can be up to 50, and each element can be up to 99, which might lead to exponential possibilities.

Wait, but n is up to 50, and t is up to 10^3, which means that a naive approach might be too slow.

I need a more efficient way to check if it's possible to sort the array by splitting elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start from the left and keep track of the minimum value allowed at each position.

- For each element, if it's greater than or equal to 10, consider both options: keeping it as is or splitting it into its digits.

- Choose the option that allows the sequence to remain sorted.

But how do I implement this efficiently?

Another idea: since splitting an element into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than the original element, I can consider the smallest possible value for each element, which would be the smallest digit in the element if it's split, or the element itself if it's less than 10.

Wait, but that might not be sufficient.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the array, and I want to end up with a sequence of single-digit numbers that are sorted.

I can iterate from left to right, and for each element, if it's >=10, I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into its digits.

If I keep it as is, it must be less than or equal to the next element (which could also be kept as is or split).

If I split it, I need to ensure that all its digits are less than or equal to the next element or its digits, and so on.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum digit in the element when splitting.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each element the smallest possible value it can contribute to the sequence.

For example, if an element is 12, its digits are 1 and 2. The smallest value it can contribute is 1.

Similarly, if it's 28, it's 2 and 8, with smallest value 2.

If it's 5, it's already a single digit.

Then, I can check if the sequence of these smallest values is sorted.

But this might not be sufficient because even if the smallest values are sorted, there might be constraints from the higher digits.

For example, in the second test case: [12, 28, 5]

Smallest values: 1, 2, 5 → which is sorted, but as we've seen, it's impossible to sort the array because after splitting 12 into [1,2], and 28 into [2,8], we get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted due to 8 > 5.

So, relying solely on the smallest digits isn't enough.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem in reverse.

Suppose I have the final sequence of single-digit numbers that are sorted.

I need to check if this sequence can be obtained from the original array by splitting some elements.

In other words, I need to merge consecutive single-digit numbers in the final sequence to form the original elements, and check if such a merging exists that matches the original array.

This seems like a promising approach.

Let's formalize it.

Assume that the final sequence is a sorted list of single-digit numbers.

I need to merge these single-digit numbers to form the original elements, in the same order.

For example, in the first test case:

Original array: [12, 3, 45, 67]

Final sequence: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

I need to merge these digits to form 12, then 3, then 45, then 67.

Is this possible?

Well, 1 and 2 can be merged to form 12, then 3 remains as is, then 4 and 5 form 45, and 6 and 7 form 67.

So, yes, it's possible.

In the second test case:

Original array: [12,28,5]

Final sequence: [1,2,2,8,5]

Trying to merge these to form 12, then 28, then 5.

1 and 2 form 12, then 2 and 8 form 28, then 5 remains as is.

But in the final sequence, after merging, I get [12,28,5], which matches the original array.

But in this case, the final sequence isn't sorted because 8 > 5.

So, even if I can merge the digits back to form the original array, the sequence itself isn't sorted.

Hence, it's impossible to sort the array by splitting elements.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm assuming that the final sequence is sorted, which it isn't in this case.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways to split the elements and check if any of them result in a sorted sequence.

But this seems too time-consuming, especially with n up to 50 and t up to 10^3.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that each element in the array can be represented as a list of its digits if it's >=10, or just itself if it's <10.

Then, the problem reduces to merging these lists in order and checking if the resulting sequence is sorted.

But again, this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end of the array to the beginning, keeping track of the minimum value allowed at each position.

Let me try to formalize this.

Start from the last element. If it's >=10, consider both possibilities: keeping it as is or splitting it into its digits.

Then, move to the previous element and do the same, ensuring that the maximum value in its digits is less than or equal to the minimum value in the next element's digits (considering the choices made for the next element).

This sounds like dynamic programming, where I keep track of the possible maximum values for each position, based on whether I split the element or not.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that for the array to be sorted after splitting, the following must hold:

- For each position i, the maximum digit in the elements up to i must be less than or equal to the minimum digit in the elements from i+1 to the end.

Wait, that might not be precise.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two consecutive elements, a and b.

If a is less than b, no problem.

If a is greater than or equal to b, I need to check if splitting a or b can resolve the issue.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and see how it approaches the problem.

The given program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

m = int(input())

arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

ans = True

for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

Then, it sets ans to True.

It iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, for i from m-1 to 1.

If arr[i] < arr[i-1], it constructs nums, which is the digits of arr[i-1] followed by arr[i].

It checks if nums is equal to its sorted version.

If not, it sets ans to False and breaks.

Otherwise, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit of arr[i-1].

Finally, it prints 'YES' if ans is True, else 'NO'.

Wait, this seems questionable.

Let me see what this code is trying to do.

It seems to be checking, for each position i from the end to the beginning, if arr[i] < arr[i-1].

If so, it considers the digits of arr[i-1] followed by arr[i], and checks if this sequence is sorted.

If it's not sorted, it sets ans to False and stops.

Otherwise, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit of arr[i-1] and continues.

This seems overly simplistic and likely incorrect.

In the first test case:

arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]

Iterate from i=3 to i=1:

i=3: arr[3]=67, arr[2]=45; 67 >=45, so skip.

i=2: arr[2]=45, arr[1]=3; 45 >3, so skip.

i=1: arr[1]=3, arr[0]=12; 3 <12, so construct nums=[1,2,3].

Check if [1,2,3] == sorted([1,2,3]), which is True.

Set arr[0]=1.

No changes needed, so ans remains True.

Hence, it would print 'YES', which is correct for this case.

In the second test case:

arr = [12,28,5]

Iterate from i=2 to i=1:

i=2: arr[2]=5, arr[1]=28; 5 <28, so construct nums=[2,8,5].

Check if [2,8,5] == sorted([2,8,5]), which is [2,5,8], so False.

Set ans=False and break.

Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

In the third test case:

arr = [0,0]

Iterate from i=1 to i=0:

i=1: arr[1]=0, arr[0]=0; 0 <0 is False, so skip.

i=0: no more elements.

Hence, ans remains True, print 'YES'.

This seems to work for these cases, but is it generally correct?

Let me think of a tricky case.

Consider arr = [13, 4, 5].

According to the code:

i=2: arr[2]=5, arr[1]=4; 5 >4, skip.

i=1: arr[1]=4, arr[0]=13; 4 <13, so nums=[1,3,4]; sorted([1,3,4])=[1,3,4], which matches.

Set arr[0]=1.

Hence, ans remains True, and it would print 'YES'.

But is this actually possible?

If we split 13 into [1,3], the array becomes [1,3,4,5], which is sorted.

So, yes, it's correct.

Another case: arr = [21, 19, 30].

According to the code:

i=2: arr[2]=30, arr[1]=19; 30 >19, skip.

i=1: arr[1]=19, arr[0]=21; 19 <21, so nums=[2,1,19]; sorted([2,1,19])=[1,2,19], which doesn't match [2,1,19], so ans=False.

Hence, it would print 'NO'.

But is this correct?

If we split 21 into [2,1], the array becomes [2,1,19,30].

Is this sorted? 2 <=1 ? No, 2 >1, so it's not sorted.

Alternatively, if we split 19 into [1,9], the array becomes [21,1,9,30].

21 >1, which is not sorted.

If we split both 21 and 19, we get [2,1,1,9,30], which is not sorted because 1 <=1 <=2 <=9 <=30.

Wait, 1 <=1 <=2 <=9 <=30 is sorted, but in the code, it would set ans=False because [2,1,19] != sorted([2,1,19]).

So, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, in this case, the code would say 'NO', but manually, if we split both elements, we can get a sorted array.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform operations any number of times, in any order.

So, in this case, splitting both 21 and 19 results in [2,1,1,9,30], which is sorted.

Hence, the answer should be 'YES', but the code would output 'NO'.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make a given array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows us to delete any element that is at least 10 and insert its digits in the same position.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Operation**: For any element >= 10, we can replace it with its individual digits. For example, 12 can be replaced with [1, 2].

2. **Check All Possible Combinations**: We need to check if there exists any combination of splitting (or not splitting) elements >=10 that results in a fully sorted array.

3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We need to keep track of the possible maximum values at each step to decide whether splitting is beneficial.

4. **Iterate from the End**: By iterating from the end of the array to the beginning, we can maintain the necessary conditions for sorting.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the previous minimum value to infinity
    prev_min = float('inf')
    # Iterate backwards
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] >= 10:
            # If the number is >=10, consider both splitting and not splitting
            # Case 1: Do not split
            if arr[i] <= prev_min:
                prev_min = arr[i]
            # Case 2: Split into digits
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
            if digits[-1] <= prev_min:
                prev_min = digits[0]
            else:
                return False
        else:
            # If the number is <10, it must be <= prev_min
            if arr[i] <= prev_min:
                prev_min = arr[i]
            else:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index+1].split()))
        index += 2
        print('YES' if can_be_sorted(arr) else 'NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Backward Iteration**: We start from the end of the array and maintain a `prev_min` which represents the smallest value allowed at each step.

2. **Handling Elements >=10**:
    - If we do not split the element, it must be less than or equal to `prev_min`.
    - If we split the element into its digits, the last digit must be less than or equal to `prev_min`, and we update `prev_min` to the first digit.

3. **Handling Elements <10**: These elements must be less than or equal to `prev_min`.

4. **Decision Making**: If at any point an element or its digits do not satisfy the condition, we return `False`. Otherwise, we continue updating `prev_min` accordingly.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to split elements to achieve a sorted array efficiently.
