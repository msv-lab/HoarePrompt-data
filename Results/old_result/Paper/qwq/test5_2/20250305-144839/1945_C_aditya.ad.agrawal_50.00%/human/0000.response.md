Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left side (0) or the right side (1). This preference is given in a sequence a1 to an, where 0 means left and 1 means right.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. When the road is built between two houses, say between house i and i+1, then houses 1 to i are on the left side, and houses i+1 to n are on the right side.

The goal is to choose the position for the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. That is, on the left side, at least ceil(x/2) residents want to be on the left, where x is the number of residents on the left side. Similarly, on the right side, at least ceil(y/2) residents want to be on the right, where y is the number of residents on the right side.

Moreover, among all possible positions that satisfy this condition, we need to choose the one where the road is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to the middle, we should choose the smaller position.

Input:

- The first line contains t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- The first line is n, the number of houses.

- The second line is a string of length n consisting of 0s and 1s, representing the preferences of the residents.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 2*10^4

- 3 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 3*10^5

Output:

- For each test case, output a single integer i, indicating the position after which the road should be laid. If the road should be laid before the first house, output 0.

First, I need to understand the problem fully.

We have a sequence of houses, each with a preference of 0 or 1, indicating whether the resident wants to be on the left or right side of the road.

We need to choose a position to build the road such that:

1. At least half of the residents on the left side want to be on the left side.

2. At least half of the residents on the right side want to be on the right side.

And among all such positions, choose the one closest to the middle of the village, i.e., minimize |n/2 - i|, where i is the position chosen.

If there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to n/2, choose the smallest i.

The problem states that a solution always exists, so I don't need to worry about cases where no position satisfies the conditions.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions for clarity.

Let's say the road is built after house k (0 ≤ k ≤ n), where:

- k = 0: road is before the first house. Left side is empty, right side is all houses.

- k = n: road is after the last house. Left side is all houses, right side is empty.

- 0 < k < n: road is between house k and k+1. Left side is houses 1 to k, right side is houses k+1 to n.

For each k, we need to check:

- Left side: among the k houses, at least ceil(k/2) of them have a_j = 0.

- Right side: among the n - k houses, at least ceil((n - k)/2) of them have a_j = 1.

We need to find the k that minimizes |n/2 - k|, and if there are ties, choose the smallest k.

First, I need to process t test cases, each with its own n and a sequence.

Given the constraints, t can be up to 2*10^4, and n up to 3*10^5, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5. So, the total time complexity should be O(N), where N is the sum of n over all test cases, to avoid timing out.

Let's think about how to approach this.

I need to find, for each k from 0 to n, whether the conditions are satisfied.

But checking for each k separately would be too slow, as it would be O(n) per test case, which could be acceptable, but probably not optimal.

Wait, 2*10^4 test cases, each with n up to 3*10^5, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, so in total, it's manageable.

But still, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about precomputing some prefix sums.

Let's define:

- prefix_zero[k]: number of 0s in the first k houses.

- prefix_one[k]: number of 1s in the first k houses.

Wait, actually, since the sequence is a string of 0s and 1s, I can treat it as a list of integers.

So, I can compute prefix sums of 0s and 1s.

Let me define:

- prefix_zero[k]: number of 0s in the first k houses.

- prefix_one[k]: number of 1s in the first k houses.

Similarly, for the right side, from house k+1 to n, the number of 0s and 1s can be derived from the total counts minus the prefix sums.

Let me denote:

- total_zeros = number of 0s in the entire sequence.

- total_ones = number of 1s in the entire sequence.

Then, for a given k:

- Left side: houses 1 to k.

- Number of 0s: prefix_zero[k]

- Number of 1s: k - prefix_zero[k]

- Right side: houses k+1 to n.

- Number of 0s: total_zeros - prefix_zero[k]

- Number of 1s: total_ones - (k - prefix_zero[k])

Wait, total ones is total Ones, and total zeros is total Zeros.

Wait, actually, total_zeros + total_ones = n.

But to make it clear:

Let me define:

- total_zeros = number of 0s in the entire sequence.

- total_ones = number of 1s in the entire sequence.

Then, for a given k:

- Left side: houses 1 to k.

- Number of 0s: prefix_zero[k]

- Number of 1s: k - prefix_zero[k]

- Right side: houses k+1 to n.

- Number of 0s: total_zeros - prefix_zero[k]

- Number of 1s: total_ones - (k - prefix_zero[k])

Wait, but total_ones is the total number of 1s in the entire sequence.

Wait, actually, total_ones = sum of a_j where a_j =1.

Wait, but in the sequence, a_j =0 or 1, so total_ones = sum(a_j for all j).

Similarly, total_zeros = n - total_ones.

So, it's better to compute prefix_sums where prefix_sum[k] = sum of a_j from j=1 to k.

Then:

- Left side: houses 1 to k.

- Number of 1s: prefix_sum[k]

- Number of 0s: k - prefix_sum[k]

- Right side: houses k+1 to n.

- Number of 1s: total_sum - prefix_sum[k]

- Number of 0s: (n - k) - (total_sum - prefix_sum[k])

Wait, let's define:

- prefix_sum[k] = sum of a_j from j=1 to k.

- total_sum = sum of a_j from j=1 to n.

Then:

- Left side (houses 1 to k):

- Number of 1s: prefix_sum[k]

- Number of 0s: k - prefix_sum[k]

- Right side (houses k+1 to n):

- Number of 1s: total_sum - prefix_sum[k]

- Number of 0s: (n - k) - (total_sum - prefix_sum[k])

Now, the conditions are:

- Left side: at least ceil(k / 2) residents want to be on the left side, i.e., at least ceil(k / 2) zeros.

- Right side: at least ceil((n - k) / 2) residents want to be on the right side, i.e., at least ceil((n - k) / 2) ones.

So, for a given k:

- Check if k - prefix_sum[k] >= ceil(k / 2)

- And total_sum - prefix_sum[k] >= ceil((n - k) / 2)

Wait, but in the left side, the number of zeros is k - prefix_sum[k], and we need at least ceil(k / 2) zeros.

Similarly, in the right side, the number of ones is total_sum - prefix_sum[k], and we need at least ceil((n - k)/2) ones.

So, the conditions are:

if k - prefix_sum[k] >= ceil(k / 2) and total_sum - prefix_sum[k] >= ceil((n - k)/2):

Then, k is a candidate.

Now, among all such k, choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - k|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.

Edge Cases:

- k = 0:

- Left side: empty.

- Right side: all houses.

- Need to check if the right side has at least ceil(n / 2) ones.

- k = n:

- Left side: all houses.

- Right side: empty.

- Need to check if the left side has at least ceil(n / 2) zeros.

- k from 0 to n.

Implementing ceil function:

In Python, we can use math.ceil or use integer arithmetic to compute ceil(x / 2) as (x + 1) // 2.

Similarly, ceil((n - k)/2) = (n - k + 1) // 2

So, we can compute:

left_zeros = k - prefix_sum[k]

right_ones = total_sum - prefix_sum[k]

required_left_zeros = (k + 1) // 2

required_right_ones = (n - k + 1) // 2

if left_zeros >= required_left_zeros and right_ones >= required_right_ones:

Then, k is a candidate.

Now, we need to find the k that minimizes |n/2 - k|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.

To make it efficient, since k ranges from 0 to n, and n can be up to 3e5, and t up to 2e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, it should be manageable.

But, per test case, n can be up to 3e5, so we need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

First, compute prefix_sum[k] for k from 0 to n.

prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[k] = sum of a_j from j=1 to k.

Then, total_sum = prefix_sum[n]

Then, for each k from 0 to n:

left_zeros = k - prefix_sum[k]

right_ones = total_sum - prefix_sum[k]

required_left_zeros = (k + 1) // 2

required_right_ones = (n - k + 1) // 2

if left_zeros >= required_left_zeros and right_ones >= required_right_ones:

Then, k is a candidate.

Among all such k, find the one with the smallest |n/2 - k|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.

To optimize, since we need to minimize |n/2 - k|, we can iterate k from 0 to n and keep track of the best k.

But, to make it faster, perhaps we can find the range of k that satisfies the conditions and then find the k within that range closest to n/2.

But, it's not straightforward to find the range where both conditions hold.

Alternatively, since n is up to 3e5, and t up to 2e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, an O(n) per test case solution should be acceptable.

So, I can proceed with iterating through all possible k from 0 to n for each test case, checking the conditions, and keeping track of the best k.

But, I need to make sure that the implementation is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary computations.

Let me think about how to compute |n/2 - k|.

Since n can be odd or even, n/2 may not be integer, so I need to use floor division or keep it as a float and take absolute difference.

But, to make it consistent, perhaps I can compute the absolute difference as |n/2 - k|.

But, in code, if n is even, n/2 is an integer, and if n is odd, n/2 is a float.

But, in Python, n/2 is a float, and k is integer, so |n/2 - k| would be a float.

To compare distances, it's fine, but when distances are equal, I need to choose the smallest k.

So, in code, I can keep track of the minimum distance and the corresponding k.

If a new k has a smaller distance, update the best_k to this k.

If the distance is equal, choose the smaller k, so I can keep the first one found.

Wait, but if k increases, and distance remains the same, I need to choose the smaller k, so perhaps iterating k from 0 to n and updating when the distance is smaller or equal (but keep the first equal one).

Wait, no. Since k increases from 0 to n, and I want the smallest k among those with minimum distance, I can iterate k from 0 to n, and keep track of the best_k so far.

Initialize best_k to -1 and best_distance to a large number.

For each k from 0 to n:

if conditions are satisfied:

current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k)

if current_distance < best_distance:

best_distance = current_distance

best_k = k

elif current_distance == best_distance:

if k < best_k:

best_k = k

But, since k increases from 0 to n, and we want the smallest k among those with the same distance, we can just update best_k only when current_distance < best_distance, and keep the first k with current_distance == best_distance.

So, in code, I can do:

for k in range(0, n+1):

if conditions_hold(k):

current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k)

if current_distance < best_distance:

best_distance = current_distance

best_k = k

elif current_distance == best_distance:

if k < best_k:

best_k = k

But, since k increases sequentially, the first k with current_distance == best_distance will be the smallest such k.

Wait, no. If there are multiple k with the same distance, I need to choose the smallest k.

So, I need to keep track of the best_k and best_distance, and update when a smaller distance is found, or when the same distance is found with a smaller k.

But, since k increases from 0 to n, and I want the smallest k, I can initialize best_k to -1 and best_distance to a large number.

Then, for each k from 0 to n:

if conditions_hold(k):

current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k)

if current_distance < best_distance:

best_distance = current_distance

best_k = k

elif current_distance == best_distance:

if k < best_k:

best_k = k

This way, I ensure that among multiple k with the same distance, the smallest k is chosen.

Now, implement this logic.

But, to make it efficient, I need to precompute prefix_sum.

In code, I can read the string, convert it to a list of integers, compute prefix_sum[0 to n], and total_sum.

Then, iterate k from 0 to n, compute left_zeros, right_ones, required_left_zeros, required_right_ones, and check the conditions.

Implementing this in code should be straightforward.

But, I need to handle k=0 and k=n correctly.

For k=0:

left_zeros = 0 - prefix_sum[0] = 0 - 0 = 0

right_ones = total_sum - prefix_sum[0] = total_sum - 0 = total_sum

required_left_zeros = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0

required_right_ones = (n - 0 + 1) // 2 = (n + 1) // 2

So, check if 0 >= 0 and total_sum >= (n + 1) // 2

Which simplifies to total_sum >= (n + 1) // 2

Similarly, for k=n:

left_zeros = n - prefix_sum[n] = n - total_sum

required_left_zeros = (n + 1) // 2

right_ones = total_sum - prefix_sum[n] = 0

required_right_ones = (n - n + 1) // 2 = 0

So, check if n - total_sum >= (n + 1) // 2 and 0 >= 0

Which simplifies to n - total_sum >= (n + 1) // 2

These seem correct.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

But, in code, I need to handle floating point comparisons for |n/2 - k|.

But, in Python, it's fine to use floating point for this purpose, as n is up to 3e5, and floating point precision should suffice.

Alternatively, since n is integer, n/2 is a float, but k is integer, so |n/2 - k| is a float.

I can keep track of best_distance as a float, and compare current_distance < best_distance.

In code, initialize best_distance to a large number, say float('inf'), and best_k to -1.

Then, iterate k from 0 to n, compute current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k), and update best_k and best_distance accordingly.

After processing all k, print best_k.

Now, let's think about optimizing the prefix_sum computation.

In Python, list comprehensions and built-in functions are efficient.

I can read the string, convert it to a list of integers, compute the prefix_sum using a loop.

But, for large n, building the prefix_sum list is O(n), which is acceptable.

Given that sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, and t up to 2e4, but n per test case up to 3e5, but sum over all test cases up to 3e5, it should be manageable.

Now, in code, I need to read t, then for each test case, read n and the string.

Convert the string to a list of integers.

Compute prefix_sum[0 to n], and total_sum.

Then, iterate k from 0 to n, compute left_zeros, right_ones, required_left_zeros, required_right_ones, and check if left_zeros >= required_left_zeros and right_ones >= required_right_ones.

If yes, compute current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k), and update best_k and best_distance accordingly.

Finally, print best_k.

Edge Cases to consider:

1. All residents want to be on the left side.

- In this case, total_sum = 0, so right_ones = 0.

- For k = n, left_zeros = n - 0 = n, required_left_zeros = (n + 1) // 2.

- So, if n - total_sum = n >= (n + 1) // 2, which is always true.

- So, k = n is a valid position.

2. All residents want to be on the right side.

- total_sum = n, so right_ones = n - prefix_sum[k].

- For k = 0, right_ones = n >= (n + 1) // 2, which is true.

- So, k = 0 is a valid position.

3. n is odd or even.

- For n even, n/2 is an integer.

- For n odd, n/2 is a float, and ceil(n/2) = (n + 1) // 2.

4. Minimal n = 3.

- Check the sample input and output to verify.

5. Multiple k with the same distance.

- Choose the smallest k.

Let me verify the first sample input:

n = 3

a = 101

So, a = [1,0,1]

total_sum = 2

prefix_sum = [0,1,1,2]

Check k from 0 to 3:

k=0:

left_zeros = 0 - 0 = 0 >= 0

right_ones = 2 - 0 = 2 >= (3 - 0 +1)//2 = 2

So, satisfies, distance = |3/2 - 0| = 1.5

k=1:

left_zeros =1 -1 =0 >=1? No.

k=2:

left_zeros=2-1=1 >=1

right_ones=2-1=1 >=1

So, satisfies, distance = |1.5 -2|=0.5

k=3:

left_zeros=3-2=1 >=2? No.

So, k=0 and k=2 satisfy, with distances 1.5 and 0.5 respectively.

So, the closest to n/2=1.5 is k=2 with distance 0.5.

Hence, output is 2.

Which matches the sample.

Another sample:

n=6

a=010111

a=[0,1,0,1,1,1]

total_sum=4

prefix_sum=[0,0,1,1,2,3,4]

Check k from 0 to 6:

k=0:

left_zeros=0-0=0 >=0

right_ones=4-0=4 >=(6-0+1)/2=3.5, i.e., 4 >=4? No, 4 >=3, but required is ceil((6-0)/2)=3, but actually ceil((n-k)/2)=ceil(6/2)=3.

Wait, (n - k +1)//2 = (6 -0 +1)//2=7//2=3.

So, 4 >=3, which is true.

k=1:

left_zeros=1-0=1 >=1

right_ones=4-0=4 >=(5+1)//2=3

So, 1 >=1 and 4 >=3, satisfies.

Distance=|3-1|=2

k=2:

left_zeros=2-1=1 >=1

right_ones=4-1=3 >=(4+1)//2=2

1 >=1 and 3 >=2, satisfies.

Distance=|3-2|=1

k=3:

left_zeros=3-2=1 >=2? No.

k=4:

left_zeros=4-3=1 >=2? No.

k=5:

left_zeros=5-3=2 >=3? No.

k=6:

left_zeros=6-4=2 >=3? No.

So, k=0,1,2 satisfy, with distances 1.5, |3-1|=2, |3-2|=1.

So, the smallest distance is 1, corresponding to k=2.

Hence, output is 3.

Wait, but in the sample, for n=6, a=010111, output is 3.

Wait, in my calculation above, k=2 has distance |3-2|=1, and k=0 has distance |3-0|=3, k=1 has |3-1|=2.

So, k=2 has the smallest distance of 1.

But sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, k=3:

left_zeros=3 -2=1 >=2? No.

Wait, prefix_sum[3]=2, so left_zeros=3-2=1 >=2? No.

Wait, but in the sample, output is 3, but according to my calculation, k=3 doesn't satisfy.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, a=[0,1,0,1,1,1]

prefix_sum=[0,0,1,1,2,3,4]

k=3:

left_sum=prefix_sum[3]=1

left_zeros=3-1=2 >=2? Yes.

right_ones=4-1=3 >=(6-3+1)//2=(4)//2=2

So, 3 >=2, satisfies.

Wait, left_zeros=3 - prefix_sum[3]=3-1=2 >=2? Yes.

So, k=3 satisfies, with distance |3-3|=0.

Wait, why in my earlier calculation I thought k=3 doesn't satisfy.

Wait, perhaps I misread the prefix_sum.

prefix_sum[3]=1 (since a[1:3]=0,1,0 -> sum=1)

left_zeros=3 -1=2 >=2? Yes.

right_ones=4 -1=3 >=(6-3+1)//2=2

So, satisfies.

Hence, k=0,1,2,3 satisfy.

Their distances are:

k=0: |3-0|=3

k=1: |3-1|=2

k=2: |3-2|=1

k=3: |3-3|=0

So, k=3 has the smallest distance of 0.

But sample output is 3, which matches.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought k=3 doesn't satisfy, but it does.

Hence, the output is 3.

So, my initial logic was incorrect; I need to fix that.

Hence, in code, I need to consider k from 0 to n, inclusive.

And compute left_zeros and right_ones correctly based on prefix_sum.

Hence, in code, I need to compute prefix_sum[k] correctly for k from 0 to n.

Now, in code, I need to handle k=0 and k=n properly.

Hence, proceed with the implementation.

Implementing this logic in code should solve the problem.

Now, to make it efficient, precompute prefix_sum.

In code, read the string, convert to list of integers, compute prefix_sum.

Then, compute total_sum = prefix_sum[n]

Then, iterate k from 0 to n:

left_zeros = k - prefix_sum[k]

required_left_zeros = (k +1)//2

right_ones = total_sum - prefix_sum[k]

required_right_ones = (n - k +1)//2

if left_zeros >= required_left_zeros and right_ones >= required_right_ones:

current_distance = abs(n / 2 - k)

if current_distance < best_distance:

best_distance = current_distance

best_k = k

elif current_distance == best_distance:

if k < best_k:

best_k = k

After processing all k, print best_k.

This should work.

Now, proceed to implement this in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal position to build a road that divides the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close as possible to the middle of the village.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - Each house has a preference (0 for left, 1 for right).
    - The road can be built between any two houses, including before the first or after the last house.
    - We need to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their assigned side.
    - We aim to minimize the distance from the middle of the village.

2. **Key Insights**:
    - Use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of 0s and 1s on the left and right sides for any given split position.
    - For each possible split position, check if the conditions for resident satisfaction are met.
    - Track the position that minimizes the distance to the middle of the village.

3. **Algorithm**:
    - Compute prefix sums for the number of 1s.
    - Calculate the total number of 1s.
    - For each possible position `k` (from 0 to n):
        - Calculate the number of 0s on the left and 1s on the right.
        - Check if these counts satisfy the conditions.
        - Compute the distance from the middle and track the best position.

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - We use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the number of 1s up to each position `k`.
    
- **Condition Checks**:
    - For each `k`, calculate the number of 0s on the left and 1s on the right.
    - Ensure these counts meet the required thresholds for resident satisfaction.
    
- **Distance Calculation**:
    - Compute the distance of each valid `k` from the middle of the village.
    - Track the `k` with the smallest distance, preferring the smallest `k` in case of ties.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the optimal road position while adhering to the problem constraints.
