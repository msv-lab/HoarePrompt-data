Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into parts in a way that minimizes some penalty. The penalty is defined based on the sum of the values in each part, where "+" is 1 and "-" is -1, and then taking the absolute value of that sum multiplied by the length of the part.

First, I need to understand what exactly I'm supposed to do. I have to split the string into substrings, and for each substring, calculate the sum of its values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-"), take the absolute value of that sum, and multiply it by the length of the substring. Then, sum up these penalties for all the substrings, and I need to minimize this total penalty.

So, the goal is to find the optimal way to split the string to minimize this total penalty.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way to minimize the total penalty is to group the characters in such a way that the sum of each group is as close to zero as possible, because the penalty is the absolute sum multiplied by the length. If a group has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero, which is ideal.

But it's not always possible to have all groups sum to zero, so I need a strategy to minimize the penalty.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty = 5

Is there a better way? If I group them, say, into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], the sum is -5, penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse.

Or, split into [ -1, -1 ], [ -1, -1 ], [ -1 ], each has penalty | -2 | * 2 = 4, and | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, which is still worse than 5.

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

Third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1], the sums are 0 and 0, so penalties are 0 and 0, total penalty is 0.

That's perfect.

Fourth example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

a = [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

If I split it into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ], the first part has sum 4, penalty |4| * 8 = 32, second part has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty = 33.

Is there a better way? Maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ], the sums are 0, 4, -1, penalties are 0, 4*4=16, 1, total penalty = 17.

Better than 33, but not the minimal.

Looking at the output, the minimal penalty is 4, so there must be a better splitting strategy.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ], the sums are 0, 0, 2, penalties are 0, 0, 2*5=10, total penalty = 10.

Still not 4.

I must be missing something.

Let me look at the fifth example:

n = 20

s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"

I don't need to analyze this fully, but the minimal penalty is 4.

So, I need to find a general approach that can achieve the minimal penalty for any given string.

Let me think about dynamic programming, as it's a minimization problem over substrings.

Define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i characters.

Then, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty of the substring from j+1 to i.

But this is O(n^2), and with n up to 5000, it might be too slow, but let's see if I can optimize it.

First, I need a way to calculate the penalty of any substring quickly.

Given that the penalty is |sum of the substring| * length of the substring.

I can precompute the prefix sums to get the sum of any substring in O(1) time.

Let me define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of the first i characters.

Then, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j].

So, penalty(j+1, i) = |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

Then, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

This seems correct, but I need to see if I can optimize it beyond O(n^2).

Looking at the way dp[i] depends on dp[j] and the difference in prefix sums, maybe I can group j's based on the value of prefix_sum[j].

Wait, perhaps I can consider the slope of the line formed by dp[j] and prefix_sum[j].

This seems like it could be approached using convex hull optimization.

I recall that in convex hull optimization for dynamic programming, we maintain a set of candidates for j that can potentially minimize dp[i], based on the slope between dp[j] and prefix_sum[j].

Let me try to formalize this.

Letâ€™s denote:

sum_j = prefix_sum[j]

sum_i = prefix_sum[i]

len = i - j

Then, penalty(j+1, i) = |sum_i - sum_j| * len

So, dp[i] = dp[j] + |sum_i - sum_j| * len

I need to minimize dp[i] over all j from 0 to i-1.

Given that |sum_i - sum_j| * len can be either (sum_i - sum_j) * len or (sum_j - sum_i) * len, depending on which is positive.

This suggests that I need to consider two cases:

1. sum_j <= sum_i: penalty = (sum_i - sum_j) * len

2. sum_j > sum_i: penalty = (sum_j - sum_i) * len

So, dp[i] = min over j of { dp[j] + max( (sum_i - sum_j), (sum_j - sum_i) ) * len }

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can split this into two separate terms.

Let me consider that len = i - j, which is positive.

So, for sum_j <= sum_i:

dp[i] = dp[j] + (sum_i - sum_j) * (i - j)

For sum_j > sum_i:

dp[i] = dp[j] + (sum_j - sum_i) * (i - j)

So, in both cases, it's dp[j] + |sum_j - sum_i| * (i - j)

This is similar to the previous expression.

I need a way to efficiently find the minimal dp[j] + |sum_j - sum_i| * (i - j) over j for each i.

This seems tricky.

I recall that for problems of the form dp[i] = min over j of { dp[j] + A * (i - j) + B }, where A and B are functions of j, we can sometimes use slope tricks.

In this case, A is |sum_j - sum_i|, which depends on sum_j and sum_i.

Wait, sum_i is fixed for a particular i, so for each i, A = |sum_i - sum_j|.

This is similar to the L1 distance multiplied by (i - j).

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum of the substring| * length of the substring.

I need to split the string into substrings such that the sum of these penalties is minimized.

Perhaps I can think in terms of grouping pluses and minuses to cancel each other out as much as possible, since the penalty is minimized when the sum is close to zero.

For example, in the third test case, "+-+-+-", grouping them in pairs cancels out, giving sum zero and penalty zero.

In the second test case, all minuses, there's no way to cancel them out, so splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

In the first test case, only one character, so no choice.

In the fourth test case, "--+++++++-", maybe grouping the minuses and pluses appropriately to minimize the penalty.

Wait, looking back at the fourth test case:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

a = [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Total sum is 7 - 2 = 5, but I need to split it into parts to minimize the penalty.

From the sample output, the minimal penalty is 4.

How can I achieve that?

Let me try splitting it into ["--", "++++++", "-"], so three parts.

First part: "--" sum = -2, length = 2, penalty = 2 * 2 = 4

Second part: "++++++" sum = 6, length = 6, penalty = 6 * 6 = 36

Third part: "-" sum = -1, length = 1, penalty = 1 * 1 = 1

Total penalty = 4 + 36 + 1 = 41, which is worse than the sample output of 4.

Wait, that's not good.

Let me try another splitting.

Split into ["-", "-+++++++", "-"], so three parts.

First part: "-" sum = -1, penalty = 1

Second part: "-+++++++" sum = -1 + 7 = 6, penalty = 6 * 8 = 48

Third part: "-" sum = -1, penalty =1

Total penalty = 1 + 48 +1 = 50, worse.

Wait, maybe splitting into more parts.

Split into ["-", "-", "+++++++", "-"], four parts.

Each "-" has penalty 1, and "+++++++" has penalty 0 (sum 7, length 7, penalty 7*7=49), total penalty = 1 +1 +49 +1 = 52, even worse.

Wait, I must be missing something.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

n=10

s=--+++++++-

output=4

How can I achieve a penalty of 4?

Let me try splitting into ["--+++++++", "-"], two parts.

First part: "--+++++++" sum = -2 + 7 = 5, penalty = |5| * 9 = 45

Second part: "-" sum = -1, penalty =1

Total penalty =45 +1=46, still not 4.

Wait, maybe splitting into ["-", "+++++++", "-"], three parts.

First part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Second part: "+++++++" sum=7, penalty=7*7=49

Third part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Total penalty=1+49+1=51

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps splitting into smaller parts.

Split into ["-", "-", "++++++", "+"], four parts.

First part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Second part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Third part: "++++++" sum=6, penalty=6*6=36

Fourth part: "+" sum=1, penalty=1

Total penalty=1+1+36+1=39

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, maybe ["--", "++++++", "-"], three parts.

First part: "--" sum=-2, penalty=2*2=4

Second part: "++++++" sum=6, penalty=0 (Wait, no. sum=6, length=6, penalty=6*6=36)

Third part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Total penalty=4+36+1=41

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe ["---", "++++++", "+"], three parts.

Wait, but s=--+++++++-, so "--" is two minuses, not three.

Wait, perhaps ["--", "+++++++", "-"], three parts.

First part: "--" sum=-2, penalty=2*2=4

Second part: "+++++++" sum=7, penalty=7*7=49

Third part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Total penalty=4+49+1=54

Worse.

Wait, perhaps ["-", "++++++", "+", "-"], four parts.

First part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Second part: "++++++" sum=6, penalty=0 (since sum=6, but length=6, |6|*6=36. Wait, no, sum is 6, so |6|*6=36)

Third part: "+" sum=1, penalty=1

Fourth part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Total penalty=1+36+1+1=39

Still not 4.

I must be missing a better way to split.

Wait, maybe ["--", "+++++", "++-","], three parts.

First part: "--" sum=-2, penalty=2*2=4

Second part: "+++++" sum=5, penalty=5*5=25

Third part: "++-" sum=1, penalty=1*3=3

Total penalty=4+25+3=32

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, maybe ["-", "-+++++", "++", "-"], four parts.

First part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Second part: "-+++++" sum=4, penalty=4*6=24

Third part: "++" sum=2, penalty=2*2=4

Fourth part: "-" sum=-1, penalty=1

Total penalty=1+24+4+1=29

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps ["--", "++++++", "-"], same as before.

Wait, maybe I need to find a different approach.

Looking back at the problem, maybe I can consider the minimal penalty as twice the number of inversions or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as minimizing the sum of |sum(b_i)| * len(b_i) over all partitions of a into b_1, b_2, ..., b_k.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

I recall that in some dynamic programming problems, we can keep track of the cumulative sum and make decisions based on that.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i characters.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j from 0 to i-1, and set dp[i] = min over j of { dp[j] + penalty(j+1 to i) }

Where penalty(j+1 to i) is |sum from j+1 to i| * (i - j)

To compute sum from j+1 to i, I can use prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of the first i elements.

So, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

Therefore, penalty(j+1 to i) = |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of { dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j) }

This seems correct.

Now, the issue is that this is O(n^2), and with n up to 5000, it might be too slow.

I need to see if I can optimize this.

Looking at the expression dp[i] = min over j of { dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j) }

I need to minimize over j.

Let me consider that for a fixed i, and varying j, the term |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j) changes based on j.

This seems similar to some problems where we can maintain a set of candidates for j and discard dominated ones.

Maybe I can use a slope trick here.

Let me consider that for j where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i], the penalty is (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) * (i - j)

Similarly, for j where prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i], the penalty is (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]) * (i - j)

So, I can split the j's into two groups based on whether prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i] or prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i]

Then, for each group, I can find the j that minimizes dp[j] + penalty.

Finally, dp[i] would be the minimum between the two groups.

Now, for j where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i], I need to minimize dp[j] + (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) * (i - j)

Similarly, for j where prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i], I need to minimize dp[j] + (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]) * (i - j)

Let me consider the first group: prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i]

I need to minimize dp[j] + (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) * (i - j)

Which is equivalent to dp[j] + prefix_sum[i] * (i - j) - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j)

Rearranging: dp[j] - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) + prefix_sum[i] * (i - j)

Now, since i is fixed, prefix_sum[i] * (i - j) is a linear function in j.

Similarly, dp[j] - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) is a function of j.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can fix i and consider j increasing.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two sets: one for j where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i], and one where prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i], and use some kind of convex hull optimization.

This seems too involved for my current understanding.

Maybe there's a smarter way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Let me consider that the penalty is minimized when the sum of each substring is as close to zero as possible.

So, ideally, I want to split the array into substrings where the sum is zero.

But in reality, that might not always be possible.

So, I should group pluses and minuses to cancel each other out as much as possible.

For example, in the third test case, "+-+-+-", I can group them in pairs to cancel out, achieving sum zero for each part.

In the second test case, all minuses, there's no way to cancel them out, so splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

In the fourth test case, "--+++++++-", I need to group the minuses and pluses in a way that minimizes the penalty.

Maybe I can count the number of pluses and minuses and find a way to pair them optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between the number of pluses and minuses.

Let me define the balance at position i as the cumulative sum up to i.

Then, I can look for positions where the balance is the same and split there.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the penalty is |sum| * length, and try to minimize that.

Let me consider that for a substring with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

I need to minimize the sum of |S_i| * L_i over all parts.

I recall that in some optimization problems, we can use the triangle inequality or other properties to find bounds.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of parts where each part has sum zero, but that's not always possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a shortest path problem, where each position is a node, and edges represent splitting the array at that point, with weights corresponding to the penalty.

But that would still be O(n^2), which might be too slow for n=5000.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Let me consider that for j where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i], I need to minimize dp[j] + (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) * (i - j)

Similarly, for j where prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i], minimize dp[j] + (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]) * (i - j)

Maybe I can maintain two data structures: one for j's where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i], and one for j's where prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i]

In each data structure, I need to efficiently find the j that minimizes the respective expression.

This sounds similar to the classic sliding window minimum problem, but it's more complex due to the involvement of prefix sums and the multiplicative factor.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms to make it easier.

For the first group (prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i]):

dp[j] + (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) * (i - j) = dp[j] + prefix_sum[i] * (i - j) - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j)

Similarly, for the second group (prefix_sum[j] > prefix_sum[i]):

dp[j] + (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]) * (i - j) = dp[j] + prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) - prefix_sum[i] * (i - j)

Now, since i is fixed, prefix_sum[i] * (i - j) is a linear function in j.

Similarly, for the first group, dp[j] - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) + prefix_sum[i] * (i - j)

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange it differently.

Let me consider that (i - j) is positive, since j < i.

For the first group, I can write it as dp[j] - prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) + prefix_sum[i] * (i - j)

Similarly, for the second group: dp[j] + prefix_sum[j] * (i - j) - prefix_sum[i] * (i - j)

This still seems messy.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * L, and I need to minimize the sum of such penalties.

Perhaps I can consider the sum of the array and try to split it in a way that balances the sum across parts.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to twice the number of inversions or something similar, but I don't have a clear idea.

Looking back at the sample input and output, perhaps there's a pattern.

First test case:

n=1, s="+", output=1

Second test case:

n=5, s="-----", output=5

Third test case:

n=6, s="+-+-+-", output=0

Fourth test case:

n=10, s="--+++++++-", output=4

Fifth test case:

n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", output=4

Looking at the third test case, output is 0, which makes sense if we can split into parts with sum zero.

In the fourth test case, output is 4, but I'm not sure how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the minimal penalty as twice the number of unpaired pluses or minuses.

Wait, maybe it's twice the number of minuses that don't have a corresponding plus to cancel out, or something like that.

Wait, in the second test case, all minuses, so number of minuses is 5, and the minimal penalty is 5, which matches.

In the third test case, number of pluses is 3, number of minuses is 3, they cancel out, so minimal penalty is 0.

In the fourth test case, number of minuses is 4, number of pluses is 6, so maybe |6 - 4| * 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is twice the absolute difference between the number of pluses and minuses.

In the first test case, 1 plus and 0 minuses, |1 - 0| * 2 = 2, but the sample output is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe it's the absolute difference without multiplying by 2.

In the first test case, |1 - 0| = 1, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, |0 - 5| = 5, matches.

In the third test case, |3 - 3| = 0, matches.

In the fourth test case, |6 - 4| = 2, but the sample output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the absolute difference.

Wait, maybe it's the absolute difference multiplied by some factor.

In the fourth test case, |6 - 4| = 2, but output is 4, which is 2 * 2.

Wait, 2 * |pluses - minuses|.

In the first test case, 2 * |1 - 0| = 2, but sample output is 1, which doesn't match.

In the second test case, 2 * |0 - 5| = 10, but sample output is 5, doesn't match.

In the third test case, 2 * |3 - 3| = 0, matches.

In the fourth test case, 2 * |6 - 4| = 4, matches.

In the fifth test case, suppose there are 13 pluses and 7 minuses (just guessing), |13 - 7| * 2 = 12, but sample output is 4, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of pluses and minuses correctly for the fifth test case.

Given s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"

Let's count:

+ - - - + + + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -

Pluses: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 (13 pluses)

Minuses: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 (7 minuses)

Wait, s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"

Let's count carefully:

Positions:

1: + (1)

2: - (1)

3: - (2)

4: - (3)

5: + (2)

6: + (3)

7: + (4)

8: + (5)

9: - (4)

10: + (5)

11: + (6)

12: + (7)

13: + (8)

14: + (9)

15: - (8)

16: - (9)

17: - (10)

18: + (9)

19: + (10)

20: - (9)

So, total pluses: 13, minuses: 7

According to the earlier hypothesis, 2 * |13 - 7| = 12, but sample output is 4, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not just twice the difference.

I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of steps needed to balance the pluses and minuses.

Wait, maybe it's the number of unpaired pluses or minuses.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of pluses and minuses that cannot be paired with each other.

In the first test case, one plus and no minuses, so one unpaired plus, penalty 1.

In the second test case, five minuses and no pluses, penalty 5.

In the third test case, three pluses and three minuses, all can be paired, penalty 0.

In the fourth test case, six pluses and four minuses, two unpaired pluses, penalty 2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's twice the number of unpaired pluses or minuses.

In the first test case, one unpaired plus, 2*1=2, but sample output is 1.

Doesn't match.

In the second test case, five unpaired minuses, 2*5=10, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

In the third test case, no unpaired, 2*0=0, matches.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired pluses, 2*2=4, matches.

In the fifth test case, suppose there are 13 pluses and 7 minuses, six unpaired pluses, 2*6=12, but sample output is 4.

Doesn't match.

So, perhaps my hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's not about the total number of unpaired pluses or minuses, but about the minimal penalty based on some other property.

Let me consider that in the fourth test case, splitting into ["--", "++++++", "-"], penalties are 4, 0, 1, total 5, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe splitting into ["---", "++++++", "-"], penalties are 3*3=9 for "---", 6*6=36 for "++++++", and 1*1=1 for "-", total 46, worse.

Wait, maybe ["--", "+++++", "++", "-"], penalties are 2*2=4, 5*5=25, 2*2=4, 1*1=1, total 34.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps ["-", "-+", "++++", "+", "-"], penalties are 1*1=1, 1*2=2, 4*4=16, 1*1=1, 1*1=1, total 21.

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe ["--", "++++++", "-"], same as before.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider overlapping parts or something.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the entire array as one part.

Then, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the fourth test case, sum(a)=5, n=10, penalty=5*10=50.

But the sample output is 4, so splitting is necessary.

If I split into two parts, for example, ["--", "+++++++-"], penalties are 2*2=4 and |7 - 2|=5 * 8=40, total 44.

Not good.

Alternatively, ["---", "++++++", "-"], penalties are 3*3=9, 6*6=36, 1*1=1, total 46.

Worse.

Still not 4.

I'm clearly missing a better way to split.

Wait, maybe I need to group pluses and minuses in a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between the number of pluses and minuses in each part, multiplied by the length of the part.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to split the array such that in each part, the number of pluses and minuses are as balanced as possible.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to twice the number of positions where the cumulative sum changes direction.

I'm getting stuck here.

Let me look at the code provided and see if it makes sense.

Looking at the code:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

length = int(input())

expression = input().strip()

parts = expression.split('-')

result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))

print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

balance = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

balance += 1

elif char == '-':

balance -= 1

if balance < 0:

count += 1

balance = 0

return count + (balance > 0)

Wait, this code is splitting the expression by '-', and then summing the lengths of the parts, and passing it to func_1.

But I don't see how this relates to the problem.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to split the string into parts that have no negative balance, similar to the minimum number of valid parentheses strings.

Wait, perhaps it's inspired by the greedy algorithm for making parentheses valid.

In that case, the function func_1 seems to count the number of times the balance goes negative and resets it, plus one if there's a positive balance at the end.

But I don't see how this relates to the penalty defined in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the balance goes negative plus the final positive balance.

In the first test case, expression = "+", balance starts at 0, then becomes 1, so balance > 0 is True, so count + (balance > 0) = 0 + 1 = 1, matches the sample output.

In the second test case, expression = "-----", balance goes -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, so balance < 0 five times, count = 5, balance at end is -5, which is not > 0, so total penalty = 5 + 0 = 5, matches the sample output.

In the third test case, expression = "+-+-+-", balance: 1,0,1,0,1,0,-1

At the last step, balance = -1 < 0, count +=1, balance =0

Then, balance > 0 is False, so total penalty =1 +0=1, but the sample output is 0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the third test case, the sample output is 0, but according to this code, it should output 1.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the balance.

Let's step through the third test case:

expression = "+-+-+-", length =6

Initialize count=0, balance=0

Iterate through each character:

1. '+': balance=1

2. '-': balance=0

3. '+': balance=1

4. '-': balance=0

5. '+': balance=1

6. '-': balance=0

Final balance=0, which is not >0, so count + (balance >0) =0 +0=0

Wait, in this case, count remains 0 throughout, since balance never goes negative.

So, func_1 would return 0, which matches the sample output.

But earlier, when I had balance going to -1, that was a mistake.

So, in this case, it works.

Wait, but in my earlier manual calculation, I had balance going to -1, but that's incorrect.

Let me recast:

Start with balance=0

'+': 1

'-': 0

'+':1

'-':0

'+':1

'-':0

So, never goes negative, count remains 0, plus balance >0 is False, so total penalty=0, matches sample.

In the fourth test case:

expression = "--+++++++-", length=10

balance steps:

1. '-': -1 <0, count=1, balance=0

2. '-': -1 <0, count=2, balance=0

3. '+':1

4. '+':2

5. '+':3

6. '+':4

7. '+':5

8. '+':6

9. '+':7

10. '-':6

Final balance=6 >0, so count + (balance>0) =2 +1=3

But the sample output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's step through:

Initialize count=0, balance=0

1. '-': balance=-1 <0, count=1, balance=0

2. '-': balance=-1 <0, count=2, balance=0

3. '+': balance=1

4. '+': balance=2

5. '+': balance=3

6. '+': balance=4

7. '+': balance=5

8. '+': balance=6

9. '+': balance=7

10. '-': balance=6 >=0, no change

Final balance=6 >0, so count +1 =2+1=3

But sample output is 4, which doesn't match.

So, the code seems to be incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps the function is different.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

balance = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

balance += 1

elif char == '-':

balance -= 1

if balance < 0:

count += 1

balance = 0

return count + (balance > 0)

In the fourth test case, count=2, balance=6 >0, so return 2 +1=3, but sample output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is different from what I thought.

Wait, in the code provided in the problem, it's:

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

balance = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

balance += 1

elif char == '-':

balance -= 1

if balance < 0:

count += 1

balance = 0

return count + (balance > 0)

But in the fourth test case, this would return 3, but the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is different.

Wait, perhaps the function is actually counting something else.

Wait, perhaps the function is counting the number of times the balance goes negative and adding the final positive balance.

But in the fourth test case, it's returning 3, but sample output is 4.

So, perhaps this function is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to twice the number of times the balance goes negative plus the final positive balance.

In the fourth test case, 2 times 2 (for balance going negative twice) plus 6 >0 is True, so 4 +1=5, which still doesn't match the sample output of 4.

I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the balance goes negative plus the final balance.

In the fourth test case, count=2, balance=6, total=8, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's count plus the absolute value of the final balance.

In this case, count=2, |6|=6, total=8, still not 4.

I'm clearly misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the function is incorrect, and the correct approach is different.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the array as a sequence of +1 and -1, and I need to split it into parts to minimize the sum of |sum(part)| * len(part).

Perhaps I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between the cumulative sums at certain points.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the maximum and minimum cumulative sums in each part.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a minimum cost flow problem, where each position is a node, and edges represent splitting the array, with
