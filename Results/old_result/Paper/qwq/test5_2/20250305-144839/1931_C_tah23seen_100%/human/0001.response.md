Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal with at most one operation. Since I can only perform the operation once, I need to choose which part of the array to set to a certain value wisely.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

I need to make all elements equal with at most one operation. Let's say I choose to set indices 2 to 4 to 1. So, i=2, j=4, x=1. The array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Now, all elements are 1 except the 5 at index 5. But wait, I can only perform one operation, so I need to make sure that after this operation, the entire array is equal.

Wait, but the problem says I can perform the operation at most once, meaning I might choose not to perform it at all. So, if the array is already equal, the cost is 0.

Looking at the second test case:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here, the array is already equal, so the output is 0, which makes sense.

Another test case:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Output is 2.

So, in this case, I need to set the substring from index 4 to 5 (1-based indexing) to 8. That's j - i + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 burles.

Wait, but in 1-based indexing, indices are from 1 to 8.

So, elements at positions 4 and 5 are 1 and 2, which need to be set to 8 to make the entire array equal to 8.

So, cost is 2.

Another example:

1

1

Here, the array has only one element, so it's already equal. Cost is 0.

2

1 2

Here, the array is [1,2]. To make them equal, I need to set one of them to the other's value. If I set the second element to 1, cost is 1. If I set the first element to 2, cost is 1. So, minimum cost is 1.

3

1 2 3

Array: [1,2,3]. To make all equal, I can set indices 1 to 2 to 3, making [3,3,3]. Cost is 2.

Alternatively, set indices 2 to 3 to 1, making [1,1,1]. Cost is 2.

So, minimum cost is 2.

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

To make all equal, maybe set indices 1 to 3 to 7, and indices 5 to 7 to 7, but since I can only perform one operation, I need to choose a substring where setting it to a particular value minimizes the cost.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation, so I need to choose one substring to set to one value.

What if I set indices 1 to 4 to 7, making [7,7,7,7,1,1,3]. Then, I still have to set indices 5 to 7 to 7, but I can't do that because I can only perform one operation. So, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, set indices 4 to 7 to 7, making [4,3,2,7,7,7,3]. Still, indices 1 to 3 are not 7, so I need another operation, which I can't do.

Wait, maybe set indices 2 to 6 to 1, making [4,1,1,1,1,1,3]. Then, set indices 1 and 7 to 1, but I can't do that because I can only perform one operation.

Hmm, maybe set indices 1 to 7 to 7, which costs 7, but that's not minimal.

Looking at the output, it's 6, which suggests setting a substring of length 6 to a certain value.

Wait, but I need to find a way to make all elements equal with at most one operation, and find the minimal cost.

I need to think differently.

Maybe find the longest substring that is already equal, and then set the remaining parts to that value.

For example, in the array [1,2,3,4,5,1], the longest substring with equal elements is of length 1 (since all are unique except the two 1's at positions 1 and 6).

Wait, but they are not contiguous.

In the array [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the substring from 1 to 3 is all 8's, and from 6 to 8 is all 8's. So, the longest such substring is of length 3.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is n - max_length, where max_length is the length of the longest substring with equal elements.

Wait, in the first example, n=6, max_length=3 (the two 8's substrings of length 3), so n - max_length = 3, but the output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, max_length=3, n - max_length=5, but output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't add up.

Maybe it's different.

Let me look at the function provided.

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

n = len(arr)

j = len(arr) - 1

while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:

i += 1

while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:

j -= 1

if arr[0] == arr[-1]:

return max(j - i - 1, 0)

return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)

So, this function first initializes i to 0 and j to n-1.

Then, it moves i forward as long as arr[i] == arr[i+1].

Similarly, it moves j backward as long as arr[j] == arr[j-1].

Then, if arr[0] == arr[-1], it returns max(j - i - 1, 0), else it returns max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0).

Let's see how this works with the first example:

Array: [1,2,3,4,5,1]

Initially, i=0, j=5

arr[0]=1, arr[1]=2, so the first while loop stops at i=0

arr[5]=1, arr[4]=5, so the second while loop stops at j=5

Since arr[0] == arr[-1], return max(5 - 0 - 1, 0) = 4

Which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

Array: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

i starts at 0, and since all elements are 1, it goes up to i=6

j starts at 6, and since all elements are 1, it goes down to j=-1 (but the loop condition is j > 0, so j=6

Since arr[0] == arr[-1], return max(6 - 6 -1, 0) = max(-1,0) = 0

Which matches the second test case.

Third test case:

Array: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

i starts at 0, arr[0]=8, arr[1]=8, arr[2]=8, arr[3]=1, so i=2

j starts at 7, arr[7]=8, arr[6]=8, arr[5]=8, arr[4]=2, so j=4

Since arr[0] != arr[-1], return max(min(8 - 3 -1, 4), 0) = max(min(4,4),0) = 4

Wait, but the output is 2, not 4. So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the third test case, the output is 2, but according to this function, it returns 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices.

Wait, in the while loop, for i, it goes while i < len(arr)-1 and arr[i] == arr[i+1]:

So, for [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], arr[0]=8, arr[1]=8, arr[2]=8, arr[3]=1.

So, i=0, arr[0]==arr[1], so i=1

arr[1]==arr[2], so i=2

arr[2]!=arr[3], so i stops at 2

j starts at 7, arr[7]==arr[6], so j=6

arr[6]==arr[5], so j=5

arr[5]!=arr[4], so j=4

arr[0]=8, arr[-1]=8, so arr[0]==arr[-1], return max(j - i -1, 0) = max(4 - 2 -1, 0) = max(1,0) =1

Wait, but the output is 2, not 1.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, j - i -1 =4 -2 -1=1, but the output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the function.

Wait, in the problem, the output for the third test case is 2, but according to this function, it returns 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

i=0, arr[0]==arr[1], arr[1]==arr[2], arr[2]!=arr[3], so i=2

j=7, arr[7]==arr[6], arr[6]==arr[5], arr[5]!=arr[4], so j=4

arr[0]==arr[-1], so return max(j - i -1, 0) = max(4 - 2 -1, 0)=1

But the output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the third test case, to make all elements equal, perhaps setting the middle part to 8 costs 2.

Wait, set indices 4 to 5 (1-based: 4 and 5) to 8, which costs 2, and the rest are already 8.

So, total cost is 2, which matches the output.

But according to the function, it returns 1, which is less than 2.

So, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the function calculates something else.

Wait, maybe it calculates the minimal cost differently.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the minimal cost as the length of the minimal substring that needs to be set to make the array equal.

Wait, but in the third test case, setting indices 4 to 5 (length 2) costs 2, which is the minimal cost.

But the function returns 1, which is less than 2, so it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a better approach.

Let me think about the problem again.

I need to make all elements equal with at most one operation, and find the minimal cost.

The operation is to set a substring from i to j to a value x, with cost (j - i +1).

I need to choose i, j, and x such that after this operation, all elements are equal.

Alternatively, I can choose not to perform any operation if the array is already equal.

First, if all elements are already equal, cost is 0.

Second, if not, I need to find a way to set a substring to a value such that the entire array becomes that value.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

So, to make all elements equal to a particular value, say x, I need to set all elements that are not x to x.

But I can only perform one operation, which means I can only set one substring to x.

So, I need to choose a substring such that, after setting it to x, the remaining elements are already x.

In other words, the elements outside this substring are already x.

So, I need to choose a substring such that all elements outside this substring are equal to x.

Therefore, to make all elements equal to x, I need to choose a substring that contains all elements that are not equal to x, and set them to x.

So, the minimal cost would be the length of the minimal substring that contains all the non-x elements.

To minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the substring containing all non-x elements is as small as possible.

So, the problem reduces to finding x such that all non-x elements are contained within a minimal substring.

Then, the cost is the length of that substring.

So, I need to find x that minimizes the length of the minimal substring containing all non-x elements.

Alternatively, since I can choose x, I need to choose x such that the non-x elements are minimal and contained in a small substring.

Wait, perhaps choosing the most frequent element as x would be a good strategy.

Because if x is the most frequent element, then the number of non-x elements is minimized, and I need to cover fewer elements with my operation.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal length of a substring that contains all the non-x elements, where x is the most frequent element.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5,1], the most frequent element is 1, appearing twice.

The non-1 elements are at positions 2,3,4,5, which form a substring from 2 to 5 of length 4, which matches the output of 4.

In the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the most frequent element is 8, appearing five times.

The non-8 elements are at positions 4 and 5, which form a substring of length 2, which matches the output of 2.

In the second test case, all elements are 1, so cost is 0.

In the fourth test case, array of size 1, already equal, cost 0.

Fifth test case, [1,2], most frequent are 1 and 2, both appearing once.

Choosing x=1, non-x elements are at position 2, so substring of length 1.

Choosing x=2, non-x elements are at position 1, substring of length 1.

So, minimal cost is 1, which matches the output.

Sixth test case, [1,2,3], choosing x=1, non-x elements at positions 2 and 3, substring of length 2.

Choosing x=2, non-x elements at positions 1 and 3, substring of positions 1 to 3, length 3.

Choosing x=3, non-x elements at positions 1 and 2, substring of length 2.

So, minimal cost is 2, which matches the output.

Seventh test case, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], choosing x=1, non-x elements at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

The minimal substring containing these is from position 1 to 7, length 7.

Choosing x=3, non-x elements at positions 1,2,3,4,5,7, which is positions 1 to 7, length 7.

Choosing x=2, non-x elements at positions 1,3,4,5,7, positions 1 to 7, length 7.

Choosing x=7, non-x elements at positions 1,2,3,5,7, positions 1 to 7, length 7.

So, minimal cost is 7, but the output is 6. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the seventh test case, n=7, arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3], output is 6.

According to my previous logic, it should be 7, but it's 6.

So, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x as one of the elements that appears more than once.

Wait, in this array, 1 appears twice, 3 appears twice, others appear once.

If I choose x=1, non-x elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

The minimal substring containing these is from position 1 to 4 and position 7.

But I need a single substring.

Wait, I can only perform one operation, which sets a single substring to x.

So, to cover positions 1,2,3,4,7, I need to set from position 1 to 7, which is length 7.

But the output is 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, perhaps there's a better choice of x.

Wait, if I choose x=3, non-x elements are at positions 1,2,4,5,7.

Again, to cover these, I need to set from position 1 to 7, length 7.

Wait, but output is 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, maybe I can choose a different x.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=2.

Non-x elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,7.

Again, to cover these, I need to set from position 1 to 7, length 7.

Still, output is 6.

Wait, maybe choosing x=7.

Non-x elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,7.

To cover these, set from position 1 to 7, length 7.

Still, output is 6.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x as a value that appears more than once, and the non-x elements are scattered.

Wait, in this case, perhaps choosing x=1 or x=3, and finding a way to cover the non-x elements with a substring of length 6.

Wait, if I choose x=1, non-x elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

If I set positions 2 to 7 to 1, that's length 6, and the array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Then, position 1 is 4, which is not 1, but I can't perform another operation.

Wait, so that doesn't make all elements equal to 1.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=1 and setting positions 1 to 6 to 1, making [1,1,1,1,1,1,3].

Then, position 7 is 3, which is not 1.

Still not all equal.

Alternatively, set positions 1 to 5 to 1, making [1,1,1,1,1,1,3].

Again, position 7 is 3.

Set positions 1 to 7 to 1, which is length 7, making all elements 1.

But according to the output, it's possible to do it with cost 6.

Wait, maybe there's a better choice.

Wait, if I choose x=3 and set positions 1 to 6 to 3, making [3,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Wait, position 7 is already 3, so the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which is all equal to 3.

Cost is 6, which matches the output.

So, in this case, choosing x=3 and setting positions 1 to 6 to 3 costs 6, and the array becomes all 3's.

That makes sense.

So, in this case, choosing x=3 and setting the substring from 1 to 6 to 3 covers all non-3 elements.

Similarly, choosing x=1 and setting positions 2 to 7 to 1 costs 6, making [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], but position 1 is 4, which is not 1, so that doesn't work.

Wait, no, if I choose x=3 and set positions 1 to 6 to 3, then position 7 is already 3, so the array is all 3's.

So, cost is 6, which matches the output.

So, my previous approach of choosing x as the most frequent element and finding the minimal substring containing all non-x elements is almost correct, but in this case, choosing x=3 and setting positions 1 to 6 covers all non-3 elements.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the minimal substring containing all non-x elements is minimized.

But in this case, choosing x=3 allows me to cover all non-3 elements within positions 1 to 6, which is length 6.

Whereas choosing x=1 would require setting positions 1 to 7 to 1, which is length 7.

So, the minimal cost is 6.

Hence, I need to choose x such that the minimal substring containing all non-x elements is as small as possible.

So, I need to find, for each possible x, the minimal substring that contains all positions where a[i] != x, and then choose the x that minimizes this substring length.

But in practice, this could be inefficient if done naively, especially since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently.

First, for each x, find all positions where a[i] != x.

Then, find the minimal substring that contains all these positions.

This is equivalent to finding the minimal window that includes all the non-x elements.

But doing this for each x would be too slow for the given constraints.

So, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal substring that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array equal to that value.

In other words, choose a substring such that all elements outside this substring are already equal to the value I choose.

So, I need to choose a substring that contains all elements that do not match the chosen value.

In other words, choose a value x that is already present in the array, and set a substring that contains all elements that are not x.

To minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the number of elements that are not x is minimized, and these non-x elements are as close together as possible.

So, perhaps choosing x as the most frequent element is a good starting point, but as seen in the seventh test case, it's not always optimal.

Wait, in the seventh test case, x=3 appears twice, and x=1 appears twice, but choosing x=3 allows covering all non-3 elements in a smaller substring.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the non-x elements are contained in the smallest possible substring.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to find, for each x, the minimal substring that contains all non-x elements.

One way to do this is:

- For each x, find all positions where a[i] != x.

- Then, find the minimal substring that contains all these positions.

- This can be done by finding the minimal window that includes all these positions.

But as mentioned earlier, this would be too slow for the given constraints.

Another way is to realize that the minimal substring that needs to be set to x is the substring between the first and last occurrence of non-x elements.

In other words, find the leftmost position where a[i] != x and the rightmost position where a[j] != x, and set the substring from i to j to x.

Then, the cost is (j - i + 1).

So, for each x, find the leftmost and rightmost positions where a[i] != x, and compute (j - i + 1).

Then, choose the x that minimizes this value.

This seems more efficient.

To implement this efficiently, I can:

- Find the leftmost and rightmost positions for each unique x.

- For each unique x, compute the minimal substring length that needs to be set to x.

- Choose the minimal among these values.

But even this might be too slow if there are many unique x's.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each unique x, the leftmost and rightmost positions where a[i] != x.

But this still seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find the overall leftmost position of any non-x element and the rightmost position of any non-x element for each x.

Wait, perhaps I can find the overall leftmost and rightmost positions of non-x elements.

Wait, to optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through the array once and keep track of the leftmost and rightmost positions of non-x elements for each x.

But this still seems time-consuming.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I choose x to be the most frequent element.

Then, the minimal substring to set to x would be the substring that contains all positions where a[i] != x.

So, if I can find the minimal substring that contains all the non-x elements, that would be the optimal choice.

To find this minimal substring, I can find the minimum window that includes all the non-x elements.

But again, this seems inefficient to do for each x.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal substring that contains all the positions where a[i] != mode, where mode is the most frequent element.

But in the seventh test case, choosing x=3 gives a smaller substring than choosing x=1, even though both appear the same number of times.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x such that the number of non-x elements is minimized, and their spread is minimized.

But I need a better way to compute this efficiently.

Looking back at the provided function, it seems to be attempting something different.

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

n = len(arr)

j = len(arr) - 1

while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:

i += 1

while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:

j -= 1

if arr[0] == arr[-1]:

return max(j - i - 1, 0)

return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)

So, this function seems to be finding the largest prefix and suffix that are equal.

In the first while loop, it moves i forward as long as arr[i] == arr[i+1].

Similarly, in the second while loop, it moves j backward as long as arr[j] == arr[j-1].

Then, if arr[0] == arr[-1], it returns max(j - i -1, 0), else it returns max(min(n - i -1, j), 0).

In the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5,1], i=0 (since arr[0]!=arr[1]), j=5 (since arr[5]!=arr[4]), arr[0]==arr[-1], so max(5 - 0 -1, 0)=4, which matches the output.

In the second test case, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], i=6 (since all are equal), j=0 (since all are equal), arr[0]==arr[-1], so max(0 - 6 -1, 0)=max(-7,0)=0, which matches.

In the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], i=2 (arr[2]==arr[3]? 8!=1, so stop at i=2), j=4 (arr[4]==arr[5]? 2!=8, so stop at j=4), arr[0]==arr[-1], so max(4 - 2 -1,0)=1, but the output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, but in the problem, the output for the third test case is 2, not 1.

So, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the function.

Looking back, perhaps the function is trying to find the minimal substring to set such that the remaining elements are all equal.

In the third test case, setting positions 4 to 5 to 8 makes the array [8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which is all equal, with cost 2, which matches the output.

But according to the function, it returns 1, which is less than 2.

So, the function seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the function is calculating something else.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the minimal substring to set such that the remaining elements are equal, but it's not doing it correctly.

In the third test case, it returns 1, but the correct cost is 2.

So, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the function is trying to calculate the overlap between the prefix and suffix that are equal.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the minimal substring to set by considering the mismatch between the prefix and suffix.

But in any case, it's not giving the correct output for the third test case.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
