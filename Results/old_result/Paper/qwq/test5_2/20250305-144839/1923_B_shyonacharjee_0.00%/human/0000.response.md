Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a game where I'm at point 0 on a straight line, and there are n monsters at different positions, each with some health. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 per bullet. After I shoot, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all living monsters move one step closer to me (so, if they're to the left, they increase their position by 1, and if to the right, they decrease by 1). If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

I need to figure out if I can kill all the monsters before any of them reaches me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, subtracting 1 health per bullet from the chosen monsters.

2. Any monster with health <= 0 dies.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

4. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

My goal is to ensure that all monsters are dead before any of them reaches point 0.

Given that, I need a strategy to allocate my bullets in such a way that I can take out all monsters in time.

Let's think about the constraints and what I have to work with.

I have t test cases, each with n monsters, each having health a_i and initial position x_i. The positions are unique, non-zero, and sorted in increasing order.

First, I need to process each test case individually.

For each test case, I have n monsters, and I can shoot up to k bullets per second.

I need to simulate the game in such a way that I can decide how to allocate my bullets each second to ensure that no monster reaches me before I've killed all of them.

But simulating each second explicitly would be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^4, with the sum of n across all t being up to 3*10^5.

So, I need a smarter way to determine if it's possible to kill all monsters in time without simulating each second.

Let me think about the key factors:

- Each monster has a certain distance from me, which determines how many seconds they have before they reach me.

- I need to reduce their health to 0 within that time frame.

- I can shoot up to k bullets per second, distributing them among the monsters as I see fit.

So, for each monster, I need to ensure that its health is reduced to 0 within the number of seconds equal to its initial distance from me.

Wait, but monsters move closer each second, so their distance decreases over time.

Wait, no. The problem says that monsters move one step closer each second after I shoot. So, their distance from me decreases by 1 each second.

Therefore, a monster at position x_i will take |x_i| seconds to reach me, moving one step closer each second.

So, a monster at x_i has |x_i| seconds before it reaches me.

Therefore, I need to kill it within |x_i| seconds.

During each of those |x_i| seconds, I can shoot up to k bullets at it.

Wait, but I can distribute my k bullets among all monsters each second.

So, I need to allocate bullets to monsters in such a way that each monster receives enough bullets to kill it within the time before it reaches me.

This sounds like a scheduling problem where I need to ensure that each monster gets a certain number of bullets before its time runs out.

One way to approach this is to consider the monsters in order of their distance from me, because the monsters that are closer to me have less time before they reach me.

Wait, but the positions are given in increasing order, and some are negative and some are positive.

Actually, since monsters move closer to me each second, the time a monster has before reaching me is initially |x_i| seconds.

So, for a monster at x_i, it will take |x_i| seconds to reach me.

Therefore, I need to kill it within |x_i| seconds.

Given that, I need to allocate its required bullets (equal to its health) within |x_i| seconds.

But in those |x_i| seconds, I can shoot up to k bullets per second, so up to k * |x_i| bullets in total for that monster.

Wait, no. Actually, I can distribute the k bullets each second among any of the monsters that are still alive.

So, it's more complex than that.

I need to ensure that, over the course of the game, each monster receives enough bullets to kill it before it reaches me.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved by considering the monsters in order of their distance, and ensuring that the total bullets allocated to monsters that are closer don't exceed the bullets I can allocate in the time available.

Wait, perhaps sorting the monsters by their distance from me and then processing them in that order would help.

Let's think about sorting the monsters by their distance from me, i.e., by |x_i| in increasing order.

So, the monster with the smallest |x_i| is the one that will reach me the soonest.

Therefore, I need to prioritize killing that monster first.

But, wait, if I prioritize killing the closest monster, I might not have enough bullets to kill the farther ones in time, because the closer monsters limit the time available.

Wait, actually, I need to ensure that, for each monster, the total bullets allocated to all monsters that are closer or equal distance is less than or equal to the total bullets I can allocate in the time available for that monster.

This sounds similar to the concept of greedy algorithms where we process items in order of their deadlines or constraints.

In this case, the constraint is the time before the monster reaches me.

So, if I sort the monsters by their distance (|x_i|) in ascending order, and then for each monster, calculate the time available (which is |x_i| seconds), and ensure that the total health of all monsters up to that point can be taken care of within the sum of k bullets per second up to that time.

Wait, perhaps more formally:

- Sort the monsters by their distance |x_i| in ascending order.

- For each monster i, from the closest to the farthest:

- The time available before monster i reaches me is |x_i| seconds.

- In those |x_i| seconds, I can fire k bullets per second, so up to k * |x_i| bullets in total.

- However, during those |x_i| seconds, I'm also firing bullets at all previous monsters (closer ones).

- So, the total bullets allocated to monsters up to and including monster i should not exceed k * |x_i|.

- Because in |x_i| seconds, I can fire up to k * |x_i| bullets, which should be enough to cover the health of all monsters up to i.

- For monsters beyond i, I have more time, so they can wait.

Therefore, if I sort the monsters by their distance in ascending order, and then iterate through them, keeping a running total of the bullets needed, and ensure that at each step, the total bullets needed for monsters up to that point is less than or equal to k times the time available for that monster, then I can determine if it's possible to kill all monsters before any reaches me.

Let me try to formalize this:

- Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable total_bullets_used = 0

- For each monster i in this order:

- bullets_needed_for_i = a_i (health of monster i)

- time_available_for_i = |x_i| seconds

- total_bullets_used += bullets_needed_for_i

- if total_bullets_used > k * time_available_for_i:

- Then it's impossible to kill all monsters in time.

- Else, continue to the next monster.

- If all monsters pass this check, then it's possible.

This seems like a reasonable approach.

Let me test this logic with the first example given:

Example 1:

Input:

5

3 2

1 2 3

-1 2 3

2 1

1 1

-1 1

4 10

3 4 2 5

-3 -2 1 3

5 3

2 1 3 2 5

-3 -2 3 4 5

2 1

1 2

1 2

Output:

YES

NO

YES

YES

NO

Let's take the first test case:

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

So, monsters are at positions -1, 2, and 3, with healths 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

First, sort monsters by |x_i| in ascending order:

|-1|=1, |2|=2, |3|=3

So, sorted order: monster 1 (-1), monster 2 (2), monster 3 (3)

Now, iterate through them:

Monster 1:

a=1, |x|=1

total_bullets_used = 1

Check: 1 <= 2*1 = 2 → OK

Monster 2:

a=2, |x|=2

total_bullets_used = 1 + 2 = 3

Check: 3 <= 2*2 = 4 → OK

Monster 3:

a=3, |x|=3

total_bullets_used = 3 + 3 = 6

Check: 6 <= 2*3 = 6 → OK

All checks pass, so output YES, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Let's check the second test case:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,1]

x=[-1,1]

Sort by |x_i|: both have |x_i|=1, so it's either order.

Let's take monster 1 and monster 2.

Monster 1:

a=1, |x|=1

total_bullets_used = 1

Check: 1 <= 1*1 = 1 → OK

Monster 2:

a=1, |x|=1

total_bullets_used = 1 + 1 = 2

Check: 2 <= 1*1 = 1 → 2 > 1 → NO

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Let's check the third test case:

n=4, k=10

a=[3,4,2,5]

x=[-3,-2,1,3]

Sort by |x_i|: |x| = [2,1,3,3]

Wait, x=[-3,-2,1,3], so |x|=[3,2,1,3]

Sorted order by |x_i| ascending: monster 3 (x=1, |x|=1), monster 2 (x=-2,|x|=2), monsters 1 and 4 (both |x|=3).

So, order: monster 3, monster 2, monster 1, monster 4.

Now, iterate:

Monster 3:

a=2, |x|=1

total_bullets_used = 2

Check: 2 <= 10*1 = 10 → OK

Monster 2:

a=4, |x|=2

total_bullets_used = 2 + 4 = 6

Check: 6 <= 10*2 = 20 → OK

Monster 1:

a=3, |x|=3

total_bullets_used = 6 + 3 = 9

Check: 9 <= 10*3 = 30 → OK

Monster 4:

a=5, |x|=3

total_bullets_used = 9 + 5 = 14

Check: 14 <= 10*3 = 30 → OK

All checks pass, so output YES, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Fourth test case:

n=5, k=3

a=[2,1,3,2,5]

x=[-3,-2,3,4,5]

|x|=[3,2,3,4,5]

Sort by |x_i| ascending: monster 2 (x=-2,|x|=2), monster 1 (x=-3,|x|=3), monster 3 (x=3,|x|=3), monster 4 (x=4,|x|=4), monster 5 (x=5,|x|=5)

Iterate:

Monster 2:

a=1, |x|=2

total_bullets_used = 1

Check: 1 <= 3*2 = 6 → OK

Monster 1:

a=2, |x|=3

total_bullets_used = 1 + 2 = 3

Check: 3 <= 3*3 = 9 → OK

Monster 3:

a=3, |x|=3

total_bullets_used = 3 + 3 = 6

Check: 6 <= 3*3 = 9 → OK

Monster 4:

a=2, |x|=4

total_bullets_used = 6 + 2 = 8

Check: 8 <= 3*4 = 12 → OK

Monster 5:

a=5, |x|=5

total_bullets_used = 8 + 5 = 13

Check: 13 <= 3*5 = 15 → OK

All checks pass, so output YES, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Fifth test case:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,2]

x=[1,2]

|x|=[1,2]

Sort by |x_i| ascending: monster 1 (x=1,|x|=1), monster 2 (x=2,|x|=2)

Iterate:

Monster 1:

a=1, |x|=1

total_bullets_used = 1

Check: 1 <= 1*1 = 1 → OK

Monster 2:

a=2, |x|=2

total_bullets_used = 1 + 2 = 3

Check: 3 <= 1*2 = 2 → 3 > 2 → NO

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

So, this logic seems to work for the sample inputs.

Now, let's think about implementing this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^4, but the sum of n over all t is up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution that processes each test case in O(n log n) time due to the sorting.

But since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^4, but sum of n over all t is up to 3*10^5, it's feasible.

In the code provided, it seems to implement this logic.

Let's look at the code:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_1()

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

healths = list(map(int, input().split()))

positions = list(map(int, input().split()))

monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))

total_bullets_used = 0

success = True

for i in range(n):

(position, health) = monsters[i]

distance = abs(position)

time_available = distance

bullets_needed = health

if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available * k:

success = False

break

total_bullets_used += bullets_needed

print('YES' if success else 'NO')

So, it reads t, then for each test case, reads n and k, then the healths and positions, zips them together and sorts by |position| in ascending order.

Then, iterates through the sorted monsters, keeping a running total of bullets used, and checks if the total bullets used exceeds k times the time available for that monster.

If at any point it does, sets success to False and breaks.

Otherwise, continues, and at the end prints YES or NO based on the success flag.

This seems to match the logic I've outlined.

I need to verify if this is correct.

Potential issues to consider:

1. Monsters with position x_i = 0: According to the problem, x_i != 0, so no issue.

2. Negative positions: The distance is |x_i|, so handled correctly.

3. Multiple monsters at the same distance: The sorted function should handle ties in distance correctly since it's sorted by |x_i|.

4. Very large n and t: Since sum of n over all t is up to 3*10^5, and sorting is n log n, it should be fine.

5. Very large health values: a_i up to 10^9, but since we're just summing them, it should be fine as long as total_bullets_used doesn't overflow, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

6. k can be up to 2*10^9, which is fine.

I think this implementation correctly applies the logic I've described.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
