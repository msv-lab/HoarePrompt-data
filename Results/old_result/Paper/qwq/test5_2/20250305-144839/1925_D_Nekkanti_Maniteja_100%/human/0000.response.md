Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a friendship value f_i. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she chooses a pair of children randomly and equiprobably. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that doesn't change.

I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship values can increase over time based on selections.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and m pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value f_i. The teacher chooses k pairs randomly, with replacement, meaning the same pair can be chosen multiple times.

Each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all future excursions. Non-friend pairs always have a friendship value of 0, and this doesn't change.

The goal is to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values at the time each pair is chosen.

Let me try to rephrase this to make sure I understand. For each excursion, when a pair is chosen, we look at their current friendship value and add that to a total sum. We need the expected value of this total sum over all k excursions.

Friendship values can increase over time, but only for pairs that are chosen and are friends.

First, I need to model how the friendship values change over time.

Let's consider that there are m friend pairs, each with an initial value f_i.

For each excursion, a pair is chosen uniformly at random from all possible pairs.

Total possible pairs: n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Probability of choosing any specific pair: 1 / (n*(n-1)/2).

Now, if a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

This means that the friendship value of a friend pair can increase over time, based on how many times they are chosen.

Non-friend pairs always have a value of 0 and don't change.

So, for each excursion, the sum is the current friendship values of the chosen pair at the time of choice.

I need the expected value of the sum of these over k excursions.

This seems a bit tricky because the friendship values can change based on previous choices.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to think about the contribution of each friend pair to the total expected sum.

Since the choices are independent and equiprobable, I can consider the expected contribution of each friend pair and sum them up appropriately.

Wait, but the choices are not independent in terms of affecting each other's friendship values.

Wait, no, actually, each excursion is independent, but the friendship values can increase based on previous selections.

Wait, but the problem says that the teacher chooses pairs independently, and if a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, the friendship values can increase over time, but only for the pairs that are chosen.

This seems like a dynamic process where the friendship values can change based on previous choices.

This sounds complicated to model directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of linearity of expectation.

Linearity of expectation allows me to sum the expected values of individual random variables, even if they are dependent.

So, perhaps I can define random variables for each excursion and compute their expected values individually, then sum them up.

Let's try that.

Let X_j be the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion, at the time of choice.

Then, the total sum S = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_k.

By linearity of expectation, E[S] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_k].

So, I need to compute E[X_j] for each j from 1 to k.

Now, X_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion, at the time of choice.

The friendship value of a pair depends on how many times that pair has been chosen in previous excursions, if they are friends.

If they are not friends, their friendship value is always 0.

So, for friend pairs, their friendship value at time j is their initial value plus the number of times they have been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Wait, re-reading: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, the increase happens after the choice, affecting future excursions.

Therefore, at the time of choice in excursion j, the friendship value of a friend pair is their initial value plus the number of times they have been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for a friend pair, their friendship value at time j is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

And for non-friend pairs, it's always 0.

So, E[X_j] is the expected friendship value of the chosen pair at time j.

Since the choice is uniform and independent each time, I need to find the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen pair at time j.

For non-friend pairs, this is always 0.

For friend pairs, it's their initial value plus the expected number of times they have been chosen in the previous j-1 excursions.

Wait, but the choices are independent, so the expected number of times a specific friend pair has been chosen in the first j-1 excursions is (j-1) times the probability of choosing that pair in one excursion.

Total pairs: p = n*(n-1)/2.

Probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion: 1/p.

So, expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in j-1 excursions: (j-1)/p.

Therefore, for a specific friend pair, their expected friendship value at time j is f_i + (j-1)/p.

But wait, this seems too simple. Is this correct?

Wait, no. Because the choices are independent, but we are dealing with expectations, and linearity should hold.

So, for a specific friend pair, the expected number of times they are chosen in j-1 excursions is (j-1)/p.

So, their expected friendship value at time j is f_i + (j-1)/p.

Then, the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen friend pair at time j is the average of f_i + (j-1)/p over all friend pairs.

But, since we choose a pair uniformly at random, and only friend pairs have non-zero values, the expected X_j is the probability of choosing a friend pair times the expected friendship value of a friend pair.

Wait, actually, since we choose a pair uniformly at random, and only friend pairs have non-zero values, E[X_j] is the average friendship value of all friend pairs at time j.

Wait, no. It's the probability of choosing each friend pair times their friendship value at that time.

Since all pairs are equally likely, E[X_j] = (1/p) * sum over friend pairs of (f_i + number of times chosen in previous j-1 excursions).

But the sum over friend pairs of the number of times chosen in previous j-1 excursions is equal to j-1, because each of the j-1 choices increments the count for one friend pair (if chosen).

Wait, but choices are independent, and friend pairs are m in number.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to compute E[X_j].

E[X_j] = sum over all possible pairs of (probability of choosing that pair) * (friendship value at time j).

For non-friend pairs, friendship value is always 0.

For friend pairs, friendship value at time j is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in the previous j-1 excursions.

So, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_i + number of times chosen in previous j-1 excursions)].

But the number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in j-1 excursions is a random variable, following a binomial distribution with mean (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_i + (j-1)/p)].

Since there are m friend pairs, this becomes:

E[X_j] = (1/p) * [sum of f_i over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, no. Wait, sum over friend pairs of (f_i + (j-1)/p) multiplied by (1/p).

So, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [sum of f_i over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, no. Wait, sum over friend pairs of (f_i + (j-1)/p) is sum of f_i over all friend pairs plus m*(j-1)/p.

Then, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [sum of f_i over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

Letâ€™s denote:

sum of f_i over all friend pairs as S.

Total possible pairs p = n*(n-1)/2.

So, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, but m is the number of friend pairs, and sum of f_i is S.

Wait, but each friend pair has its own f_i, so S is the sum of all f_i.

So, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, but this seems off because m*(j-1)/p would be the sum over all friend pairs of expected number of times chosen in j-1 excursions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen friend pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when I choose a pair, it's a friend pair with probability m/p, and in that case, its friendship value is f_i plus the expected number of times it has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each friend pair, the expected contribution to the total sum is their probability of being chosen in each excursion times their expected friendship value at the time of choice.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the total sum S is the sum of X_j from j=1 to k, where X_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion.

I need E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j].

Now, E[X_j] is the expected friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion.

Since the choices are independent, E[X_j] is the same for all j.

Wait, but the friendship values can increase over time, so E[X_j] might depend on j.

Wait, no, because the increases are based on previous choices, so actually, E[X_j] does depend on j.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, actually, because each excursion is independent, and the friendship values are only increased after the choice, the expected friendship value at the time of choice might be the same for each j.

Wait, but intuitively, as j increases, the friendship values could be higher because more pairs have been chosen and their friendship values have increased.

So, probably E[X_j] increases with j.

Wait, but I need to model this properly.

Maybe I can model the process step by step.

Let me consider that at each step j, when a pair is chosen:

- If it's a friend pair, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

- If it's not a friend pair, nothing happens.

I need to keep track of the friendship values over time.

Let me try to think in terms of the total sum S.

S = sum from j=1 to k of X_j, where X_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen at time j.

I need E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j].

Now, to compute E[X_j], I need to consider the expected friendship value of the pair chosen at time j.

This depends on the history of choices before j.

This seems complicated due to the dependency.

Perhaps I can use the law of total expectation and condition on the history up to j-1.

But that seems too involved.

Let me try to find a pattern or a recursive relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let me consider a specific friend pair, say pair u.

Pair u has an initial friendship value f_u.

Each time pair u is chosen in an excursion, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, their friendship value at time j is f_u plus the number of times they have been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

Wait, but this is getting complicated.

Maybe I can think about the expected sum over all k excursions by considering the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Wait, perhaps I can model the expected friendship value of a friend pair at time j.

Let me denote E[f_u(j)] as the expected friendship value of pair u at time j.

Then, E[f_u(j)] = f_u + expected number of times pair u has been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

Since each excursion chooses pair u with probability 1/p, and there are j-1 excursions before j, the expected number of times pair u is chosen in j-1 excursions is (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[f_u(j)] = f_u + (j-1)/p.

Now, at time j, when a pair is chosen, the expected friendship value is the probability of choosing each friend pair times their expected friendship value at that time.

So, E[X_j] = sum over all friend pairs of [probability of choosing pair u at time j * E[f_u(j)]]

Since the probability of choosing any specific friend pair at time j is 1/p, and there are m friend pairs, this becomes:

E[X_j] = sum from u=1 to m of [(1/p) * (f_u + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum from u=1 to m of f_u + m*(j-1)/p]

Let me denote S = sum from u=1 to m of f_u.

Then, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Now, p = n*(n-1)/2.

So, E[X_j] = (2 / (n*(n-1))) * [S + m*(j-1)/(n*(n-1)/2)]

= (2 / (n*(n-1))) * [S + (2*m*(j-1))/(n*(n-1))]

= (2*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (4*m*(j-1))/(n*(n-1)*n*(n-1))

Wait, this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the total expected sum S.

S = sum from j=1 to k of X_j

E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j] = sum from j=1 to k of [(1/p) * (S + m*(j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(k*(k-1)/2)/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*k*(k-1)/(2*p)]

= (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Now, p = n*(n-1)/2

So, E[S] = (k*S)/(n*(n-1)/2) + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*(n*(n-1)/2)^2)

= (2*k*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*(n*(n-1)/2)^2)

= (2*k*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*(n*(n-1)/2)^2)

= (2*k*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*(n^2*(n-1)^2)/4)

= (2*k*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*(n^2*(n-1)^2)/4)

= (2*k*S)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*m*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, their contribution to the total sum S is equal to their initial value f_i times the probability of being chosen in each excursion, plus the expected number of times they are chosen in previous excursions times the probability of being chosen in the current excursion.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I can consider the total sum S as the sum over all friend pairs of their initial value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected number of times they are chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, still not clear.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that in each excursion, the expected increase in the friendship value of a friend pair is equal to the probability of choosing that pair times 1.

But this seems to be part of the total sum.

Wait, maybe I can model the total sum S as the sum over all excursions of the expected friendship value at the time of choice.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

So, E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j]

And E[X_j] = (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, but this seems inconsistent because S is the total sum over k excursions, and I'm expressing E[X_j] in terms of S, which is circular.

I need to find a better way to express this.

Let me consider that the expected friendship value of a friend pair at time j is f_i + (number of times chosen in previous j-1 excursions).

And the expected number of times chosen in previous j-1 excursions is (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_i + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum of f_i over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

= (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Therefore, E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j] = sum from j=1 to k of [(1/p) * (S + m*(j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(k*(k-1)/2)/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*k*(k-1)/(2*p)]

= (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Now, solving for S:

E[S] = (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Let me denote E[S] as S for simplicity.

Then, S = (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Let me solve for S:

S - (k*S)/p = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

S*(1 - k/p) = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

S = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2 * (1 - k/p))

But this seems problematic because if k > p, then 1 - k/p is negative, which wouldn't make sense in this context.

Wait, but k can be larger than p, so this might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in modeling this.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that the expected sum S is equal to the sum over all friend pairs of their expected contribution to S.

Each friend pair contributes its initial value f_i times the probability of being chosen in each excursion, plus an additional term for each time it's chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, perhaps I can model the expected sum S as follows:

S = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j]

And E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [probability of choosing pair u at time j * (f_u + number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions)]

Since choices are independent, the expected number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions is (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_u + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum of f_u over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

= (1/p) * [S_initial + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, but S_initial is S = sum of f_u over all friend pairs.

Wait, no, S is the total sum over k excursions.

I think I'm getting tangled up here.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, their contribution to the total sum S is equal to their initial value f_i times the number of times they are chosen in the k excursions, plus the sum over all excursions after they are chosen of the increases in their friendship value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the linearity of expectation for each friend pair's contribution.

For each friend pair u, let's define:

- Their initial value f_u.

- Each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, their total contribution to S is f_u times the number of times they are chosen, plus the number of times they are chosen times the sum of the number of times they are chosen in future excursions.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the expected sum S as follows:

For each excursion j from 1 to k:

- Choose a pair uniformly at random.

- If the pair is a friend pair, their friendship value is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

- If not a friend pair, their friendship value is 0.

So, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [probability of choosing pair u at time j * (f_u + number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions)]

Given that the choices are independent, the expected number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions is (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_u + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum of f_u over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

Let me denote S = sum of f_u over all friend pairs.

Then, E[X_j] = (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Therefore, E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j] = sum from j=1 to k of [(1/p) * (S + m*(j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(k*(k-1)/2)/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*k*(k-1)/(2*p)]

= (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Now, solving for S:

S = (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Let me rearrange:

S - (k*S)/p = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

S*(1 - k/p) = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Therefore, S = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2 * (1 - k/p))

But this seems problematic because if k > p, the denominator becomes negative, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, but k can be larger than p, as per the constraints.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Let me check again.

From S = (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Let me rearrange:

S - (k*S)/p = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

S*(1 - k/p) = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

So, S = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2 * (1 - k/p))

Wait, but when k > p, 1 - k/p < 0, which would make S negative, which doesn't make sense.

This suggests that my model is flawed.

Perhaps I need to consider that the friendship values can only increase up to a certain point, or that multiple increases can stack, but I'm not accounting for it correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the problem in terms of the number of times each friend pair is chosen and how that affects the total sum.

Let me consider defining a random variable for the number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in the k excursions.

Let N_u be the number of times friend pair u is chosen in k excursions.

Then, N_u follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p_u = 1/p.

Then, E[N_u] = k / p.

Now, the friendship value of pair u at time j is f_u + number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions.

So, if we let C_u(j) be the number of times u has been chosen in the first j-1 excursions, then the friendship value at time j is f_u + C_u(j).

But C_u(j) is the sum of indicator variables for each excursion from 1 to j-1 whether u was chosen.

So, E[C_u(j)] = (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs of [probability of choosing u at time j * (f_u + C_u(j))]

= sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * (f_u + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum of f_u over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

= (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Therefore, E[S] = sum from j=1 to k of E[X_j] = sum from j=1 to k of [(1/p) * (S + m*(j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))/p]

= (1/p) * [k*S + m*(k*(k-1)/2)/p]

= (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Now, solving for S:

S = (k*S)/p + (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Let me rearrange:

S - (k*S)/p = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

S*(1 - k/p) = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2)

Therefore, S = (m*k*(k-1))/(2*p^2 * (1 - k/p))

This still seems problematic when k > p, but in reality, k can be larger than p, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that the total sum S is equal to the sum over all friend pairs of their initial value times the number of times they are chosen, plus the sum over all times they are chosen of the number of future excursions.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the total sum S as the sum over all excursions of the friendship value at the time of choice.

Each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value at that time is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

So, if a friend pair u is chosen t times in the k excursions, then their contribution to S is sum from s=1 to t of (f_u + (s-1)).

Because each time they are chosen, their friendship value is f_u plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

Wait, more precisely, the first time they are chosen, their friendship value is f_u, the second time it's f_u +1, third time f_u +2, and so on.

Wait, but according to the problem, their friendship value increases by 1 after being chosen, affecting subsequent excursions.

So, at the time of choice, their friendship value is f_u plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

So, if they are chosen t times, their contributions are:

f_u (first choice), f_u +1 (second choice), ..., f_u + (s-1) for the s-th choice.

So, total contribution is sum from s=0 to t-1 of (f_u + s) = t*f_u + sum from s=0 to t-1 of s = t*f_u + t*(t-1)/2.

Therefore, for each friend pair u, their total contribution to S is t_u * f_u + t_u*(t_u -1)/2, where t_u is the number of times u is chosen.

Therefore, E[S] = sum over friend pairs of E[t_u * f_u + t_u*(t_u -1)/2]

Now, t_u follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p_u = 1/p.

Similarly, E[t_u] = k / p.

E[t_u*(t_u -1)] = Var(t_u) + (E[t_u])^2 - E[t_u] = k*(k-1)/(p^2) + (k/p)^2 - k/p.

Wait, but for binomial distribution, Var(t_u) = k * p_u * (1 - p_u) = k*(1/p)*(1 - 1/p).

Therefore, E[t_u*(t_u -1)] = k*(k-1)*(1/p)^2 + (k/p)^2 - k/p.

Wait, but this seems off.

Actually, for binomial distribution, E[t_u*(t_u -1)] = k*(k-1)*p_u^2.

Because E[t_u*(t_u -1)] = sum over i != j of P(both i and j are chosen).

But actually, for binomial distribution, E[t_u*(t_u -1)] = k*(k-1)*p_u^2.

So, E[S] = sum over friend pairs of [E[t_u * f_u] + E[t_u*(t_u -1)/2]]

= sum over friend pairs of [f_u * E[t_u] + E[t_u*(t_u -1)] / 2]

= sum over friend pairs of [f_u * (k / p) + (k*(k-1)/(p^2)) / 2]

= sum over friend pairs of [f_u * (k / p) + k*(k-1)/(2*p^2)]

= sum over friend pairs of f_u * (k / p) + m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

= (k / p) * sum over friend pairs of f_u + m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

= (k / p) * S + m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

Wait, but S is sum over friend pairs of f_u.

Wait, no, earlier I denoted S as sum of f_u over all friend pairs.

Wait, perhaps I should denote S = sum of f_u over all friend pairs.

Then, E[S] = (k / p) * S + m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

Wait, but this is similar to what I had before.

Let me solve for E[S]:

E[S] - (k / p) * S = m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

S*(1 - k/p) = m * (k*(k-1)/(2*p^2))

Therefore, S = [m * k*(k-1)/(2*p^2)] / (1 - k/p)

This still has the issue when k > p.

Perhaps this indicates that my approach is flawed.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, their expected contribution to S is their initial value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected number of times they are chosen in previous excursions times the probability of being chosen.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this recursively.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the expected sum S is equal to k times the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen pair.

Since each excursion chooses a pair independently and uniformly at random.

Therefore, E[S] = k * E[X_j], where E[X_j] is the expected friendship value of the chosen pair at time j.

Now, E[X_j] is the probability of choosing a friend pair times the expected friendship value of a friend pair at time j.

Probability of choosing a friend pair is m / p.

And the expected friendship value of a friend pair at time j is f_u + (number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions).

But this still depends on which friend pair is chosen.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the expected friendship value of a randomly chosen friend pair at time j is the average of f_u + (number of times u has been chosen in previous j-1 excursions) over all friend pairs.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of indicator variables.

Let me define I_j as the indicator variable that denotes whether a friend pair is chosen in the j-th excursion.

Let me denote C_u(j) as the number of times friend pair u has been chosen in the first j-1 excursions.

Then, the friendship value at time j for friend pair u is f_u + C_u(j).

When pair u is chosen in excursion j, their friendship value is f_u + C_u(j), and C_u(j) increases by 1 for future excursions.

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that the expected sum S is equal to the sum over all friend pairs of their initial value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected number of times they are chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, perhaps I can model S as follows:

S = sum over all excursions j from 1 to k of X_j, where X_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen at time j.

Now, X_j = f_u + C_u(j-1), where u is the pair chosen at time j, and C_u(j-1) is the number of times u has been chosen in the first j-1 excursions.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over all friend pairs u of [probability of choosing u at time j * (f_u + C_u(j-1))]

Since choices are independent, E[C_u(j-1)] = (j-1)/p.

Therefore, E[X_j] = sum over friend pairs u of [(1/p) * (f_u + (j-1)/p)]

= (1/p) * [sum of f_u over all friend pairs + m*(j-1)/p]

= (1/p) * [S + m*(j-1)/p]

Wait, again, this leads me back to the same equation.

This suggests that my approach is consistent, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider small values of k to see a pattern.

Case 1: k=1

In this case, S = X_1, which is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the first excursion.

This is either f_u if it's a friend pair, or 0 otherwise.

Therefore, E[S] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * f_u] = (1/p) * S.

Wait, but S is sum of f_u over friend pairs.

Wait, but in this case, E[S] = (1/p) * S.

But S is known, so E[S] = (1/p) * S.

Wait, but this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently for k=1.

Wait, for k=1, E[S] = E[X_1] = sum over friend pairs of [(1/p) * f_u] = (1/p) * S.

So, E[S] = (1/p) * S.

But this seems only possible if S=0, which isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for k=1, E[S] = (1/p) * S.

But S is sum of f_u over friend pairs, which is a constant.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about p, the total number of possible pairs.

Wait, p = n*(n-1)/2.

So, for k=1, E[S] = (2 / (n*(n-1))) * S.

But this doesn't make sense because S is sum of f_u over friend pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for k=1, E[S] = (m / p) * average f_u.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input 1:

100 0 24

Here, n=100, m=0, k=24.

Since m=0, there are no friend pairs, so all pairs have friendship value 0, and the sum is 0.

Output: 0

Sample Input 2:

2 1 10

n=2, m=1, k=10

Only one friend pair: (1,2) with f=1.

Total possible pairs: p=1.

So, in each excursion, the same pair is chosen every time, and their friendship value increases by 1 each time.

So, friendship values over 10 excursions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Sum: 1+2+3+...+10 = 55.

Output: 55

Sample Input 3:

3 1 2

n=3, m=1, k=2

Friend pair: (2,1) with f=1.

Total possible pairs: p=3.

First excursion: choose any pair uniformly: probability 1/3 for friend pair.

If friend pair is chosen, their f increases by 1 for the second excursion.

Second excursion: again, choose any pair uniformly.

Need to calculate E[S] = E[X1 + X2]

E[X1] = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3

E[X2] = probability of choosing friend pair times their value at time 2.

At time 2, their value is 1 plus the number of times they were chosen in excursion 1.

If they were chosen in excursion 1, their value is 1 +1 =2; else, it's 1.

So, E[X2] = (1/3)*(2) + (2/3)*0 = 2/3

Total E[S] = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1

But according to the sample output, it's 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo 10^9+7.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, n=3, m=1, k=2

Friend pair: (2,1) with f=1

Total pairs: p=3

Probability of choosing friend pair in any excursion: 1/3

Probability of not choosing friend pair: 2/3

For E[X1]:

E[X1] = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3

For E[X2]:

If friend pair was chosen in excursion 1 (probability 1/3), then their f increases by 1 for excursion 2, so f=2.

If not, f=1.

Therefore, E[X2] = (1/3)*2 + (2/3)*1 = 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3

Therefore, E[S] = E[X1] + E[X2] = 1/3 + 4/3 = 5/3

But the sample output is 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo 10^9+7.

This suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the friendship value increases.

Wait, the problem says: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, in excursion 1, if friend pair is chosen, their f increases by 1 for excursion 2 and beyond.

So, in excursion 1, f=1; if chosen, then in excursion 2, f=1+1=2.

If not chosen in excursion 1, in excursion 2, f=1.

Therefore, E[X2] = probability of choosing friend pair in excursion 1 times 2 + probability of not choosing friend pair in excursion 1 times 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in excursion 2, the friendship value is f + number of times chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, more precisely, the friendship value at time j is f + number of times chosen in previous excursions.

So, at time 2, f + number of times chosen in excursion 1.

If chosen in excursion 1, f +1 =2; else, f +0 =1.

Therefore, E[X2] = P(chosen in excursion 1)*2 + P(not chosen in excursion 1)*1 = (1/3)*2 + (2/3)*1 = 4/3

Similarly, E[X1] = 1/3

So, E[S] = 1/3 + 4/3 = 5/3

But the sample output is 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo 10^9+7.

This suggests that my calculation is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that the choices are independent for each excursion, but the friendship values depend on the history.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a Markov chain, where the state is the current friendship values, but that seems too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the expected sum S is equal to sum over all friend pairs of their expected contribution, where the expected contribution is their initial value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected number of times they are chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, this seems similar to what I did before.

Let me try to compute E[S] for the sample input 3.

n=3, m=1, k=2

From above, E[S] = 5/3

But sample output is 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo 10^9+7.

This suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Perhaps I need to consider that the friendship value increases only after being chosen, so in the next excursion, not immediately.

Wait, the problem says: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, if a friend pair is chosen in excursion j, their friendship value increases by 1 for all excursions j+1, j+2, ..., k.

Therefore, at the time of choice in excursion j, their friendship value is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

So, in excursion j, their friendship value is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in excursions 1 through j-1.

Therefore, in the second excursion, their friendship value is f_i plus the indicator whether they were chosen in the first excursion.

So, in the earlier calculation, E[X2] = P(chosen in excursion 1)* (f +1) + P(not chosen in excursion 1)* f = (1/3)*(1+1) + (2/3)*1 = (1/3)*2 + (2/3)*1 = 4/3

Similarly, E[X1]
