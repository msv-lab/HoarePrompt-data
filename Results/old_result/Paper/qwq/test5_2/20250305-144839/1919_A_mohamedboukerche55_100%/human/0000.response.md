Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets and they take turns making moves according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice and Bob start with a certain number of coins in their wallets, let's say a and b respectively. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The catch is that the wallet cannot have zero coins before removing one. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the game ends when a player can't remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins and they can't swap to the other wallet, which might have coins.

I need to figure out, given the initial number of coins in their wallets, who will win the game if both play optimally.

Looking at the example provided:

In the first test case, a=1 and b=1.

- Alice decides not to swap, so a becomes 0 and b remains 1.

- Bob can't swap because his wallet has 1 coin, but if he swaps, he'd have 0 coins, which is allowed since he's about to remove one. Wait, no, the rule is that the wallet can't have 0 coins before removing one. So, if Bob swaps, he has a=0 and b=1, then he removes one from his wallet, which now has 0 coins, which is not allowed. So he can't swap. Therefore, he has to keep his wallet and remove one coin, making a=0 and b=0.

- Now, Alice can't remove a coin because her wallet has 0 coins, and if she swaps, she still has 0 coins. So she loses. Hence, Bob wins.

In the second test case, a=1 and b=4.

- Alice chooses to swap, so now a=4 and b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap, so a=1 and b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap, so a=0 and b=2.

- Bob has to keep his wallet, so a=0 and b=1.

- Alice swaps, so a=0 and b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

From these examples, it seems that the game depends on the parity of the total number of coins.

Wait, in the first test case, a=1 and b=1, total coins = 2, which is even, and Bob wins.

In the second test case, a=1 and b=4, total coins = 5, which is odd, and Alice wins.

Looking at the other examples:

Third test case: a=5 and b=3, total=8, even, Bob wins.

Fourth: a=4 and b=5, total=9, odd, Alice wins.

Fifth: a=11 and b=9, total=20, even, Bob wins.

Sixth: a=83 and b=91, total=174, even, Bob wins.

Seventh: a=1032 and b=9307, total=10339, odd, Alice wins.

Eighth: a=839204 and b=7281, total=846485, odd, Alice wins.

Ninth: a=1000000000 and b=1000000000, total=2000000000, even, Bob wins.

Tenth: a=53110 and b=2024, total=55134, even, Bob wins.

From these, it seems that when the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins.

But is this always true? Let's try to see if this pattern holds.

Suppose a=1 and b=1, total=2, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

a=1 and b=4, total=5, odd, Alice wins. Checks out.

a=5 and b=3, total=8, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

a=4 and b=5, total=9, odd, Alice wins. Checks out.

a=11 and b=9, total=20, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

a=83 and b=91, total=174, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

a=1032 and b=9307, total=10339, odd, Alice wins. Checks out.

a=839204 and b=7281, total=846485, odd, Alice wins. Checks out.

a=1000000000 and b=1000000000, total=2000000000, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

a=53110 and b=2024, total=55134, even, Bob wins. Checks out.

So, based on these examples, it seems that the total number of coins determines the winner: if the total is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

But is this a general rule? Let's try to think about it more deeply.

Let me consider the game as a impartial game, where the possible moves don't depend on which player is moving, only on the current state.

In this game, the state can be represented by the pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each move consists of two steps: choosing to swap wallets or not, and then removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when the current wallet has zero coins and the other wallet also has zero coins.

Wait, but the rules say that the wallet cannot have zero coins before removing one. So, if a player has zero coins in their current wallet, they cannot remove a coin and must swap if possible.

But if both wallets are zero, the player can't make a move and loses.

So, the game is about managing the coins in two wallets, with the option to swap them each turn.

This seems similar to a Nim game with two heaps, where players can choose which heap to remove a coin from, but with an additional twist of swapping heaps.

But in this game, the swapping adds a layer of strategy.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the Sprague-Grundy theorem might apply.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let's consider the total number of coins, as suggested by the pattern in the examples.

If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

Is there a way to see why this might be the case?

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of moves that can be made.

Each move removes one coin from one of the wallets.

The game ends when there are no more moves left, which is when both wallets are empty.

So, the total number of moves that can be made is equal to the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins is even, then since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move and win.

Wait, no. If the total number of moves is even, and Alice starts, then Alice makes move 1, Bob move 2, Alice move 3, and so on.

So, if the total number of moves is even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

If the total number of moves is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins.

But according to the examples, when the total is even, Bob wins, and when odd, Alice wins.

This seems to match.

But wait, in standard impartial games like Nim, the winner is determined based on the Nim-sum being zero or not.

But in this specific game, the swapping adds a complexity.

Let me try to see if the swapping affects this conclusion.

Suppose that swapping allows players to choose which wallet to remove a coin from, similar to choosing which heap to remove a coin from in Nim.

But in Nim, with two heaps, the game is won based on whether the binary XOR of the heap sizes is zero or not.

But in this game, the swapping allows players to choose which wallet to deplete, but with the constraint that they can't remove a coin from an empty wallet.

Given that, perhaps the game is equivalent to Nim with two heaps, where the XOR determines the winner.

But according to the examples, it's simply based on the total number of coins being even or odd.

That suggests that perhaps the game is equivalent to a single heap with the total number of coins.

In standard Nim, with one heap, the first player can take any number of coins up to the heap size, and the second player can take the rest.

But in this game, players can only take one coin at a time, and they have the option to swap wallets.

So, it's not exactly like standard Nim.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that the game can be modeled as a graph, where each node represents a state (a, b), and edges represent possible moves.

The game is impartial, so the set of moves available depends only on the current state.

The winning strategy is to reach a position where the opponent has no valid moves.

Given that, perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine the winner based on the initial state.

Looking back at the pattern in the examples, it seems that the total number of coins' parity determines the winner.

Given that, perhaps the program provided is correct.

The program simply reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads a and b, and if a + b is even, prints "Bob", else prints "Alice".

If this matches the pattern observed in the examples, then it might be correct.

But to be sure, let's try to find a counterexample.

Suppose a=2, b=2, total=4, even, so Bob wins.

Let's simulate:

- Alice can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=2, b=2, then removes one from a, so a=1, b=2.

- Bob can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=1, b=2, then removes one from a, so a=0, b=2.

- Alice can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=0, b=1, then removes one from b, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the program, since a+b=4 is even, it should be Bob wins, but in this simulation, Alice wins.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let's try again.

- Initial state: a=2, b=2.

- Alice's move:

- Option 1: Swap, so a=2, b=2, remove one from a, a=1, b=2.

- Option 2: Don't swap, so a=2, b=2, remove one from a, a=1, b=2.

- Either way, state becomes a=1, b=2.

- Bob's move:

- Option 1: Swap, so a=1, b=2, remove one from a, a=0, b=2.

- Option 2: Don't swap, so a=1, b=2, remove one from a, a=0, b=2.

- Either way, state becomes a=0, b=2.

- Alice's move:

- Must swap, because her current wallet has 0 coins.

- After swap, a=0, b=1.

- Remove one from b, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, since a+b=4 is even, it should be Bob wins.

But in this simulation, Alice wins.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but maybe I didn't consider all possibilities.

Let's see another path.

- Initial state: a=2, b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap, so a=1, b=2.

- Bob chooses to swap, so a=1, b=2, remove one from a, a=0, b=2.

- Alice must swap, so a=0, b=1, remove one from b, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively,

- Initial state: a=2, b=2.

- Alice chooses to swap, so a=2, b=2, remove one from a, a=1, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap, so a=1, b=2, remove one from a, a=0, b=2.

- Alice must swap, so a=0, b=1, remove one from b, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

In both paths, Alice wins, but according to the program, since a+b is even, it should be Bob wins.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Perhaps the correct rule is that if the total number of coins is even, Alice wins, and if odd, Bob wins, or something else.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of moves.

Each move removes one coin, and the game ends when there are no coins left.

The total number of moves is equal to the total number of coins.

Since Alice starts, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins; if even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

In the earlier simulation with a=2 and b=2, total coins = 4, which is even, so Bob should win, but in simulation, Alice wins.

This contradicts the earlier hypothesis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let's try again.

- Initial state: a=2, b=2.

- Alice's move: choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=2, b=2, remove one from a, so a=1, b=2.

- Bob's move: choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=1, b=2, remove one from a, so a=0, b=2.

- Alice's move: must swap, since her current wallet has 0 coins.

- After swap, a=0, b=1, remove one from b, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Wait, this is the same as before.

So, according to this, Alice wins, but according to the program, since a+b is even, Bob should win.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Perhaps the rule is different.

Let me consider another example.

Take a=1, b=1, total=2, even.

According to the program, Bob wins.

In the example provided, Bob wins, which matches.

But in the simulation with a=2, b=2, total=4, even, Alice wins, which contradicts the program.

So, the program is incorrect.

Perhaps the rule is more complex than just checking the parity of the total number of coins.

Let me think about the game in terms of positions.

A position is determined by the pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each player, on their turn, can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when the current wallet has zero coins and the other wallet also has zero coins.

This seems similar to a game where players can choose which pile to decrease, with an additional option to swap piles.

In standard Nim game theory, the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner.

But here, the swapping adds a twist.

Perhaps I need to consider the game as having two heaps, and the swapping allows the player to choose which heap to decrease.

But in standard Nim, with two heaps, the XOR of the heap sizes determines the winner.

If the XOR is zero, the position is losing for the current player; otherwise, it's winning.

But in this game, the swapping allows players to choose which heap to decrease, similar to choosing which heap to remove a coin from in Nim.

However, in standard Nim, removing one coin at a time is equivalent to the normal Nim game.

Given that, perhaps the game is equivalent to Nim with two heaps, where the XOR determines the winner.

If that's the case, then the program is incorrect because it's not considering the XOR of a and b, but just the parity of a + b.

In the earlier simulation with a=2 and b=2, XOR is 0, so it should be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob wins, but according to the simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing something.

In standard Nim, if the XOR of the heap sizes is 0, it's a losing position for the current player.

In this case, a=2 and b=2, XOR is 0, so it should be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob wins, which contradicts the simulation where Alice wins.

Wait, but in the simulation, Alice wins, which would suggest that it's a winning position for Alice, but according to Nim rules, it should be losing.

This suggests that the game is not equivalent to standard Nim.

Perhaps the swapping changes the game in a significant way.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me think recursively about the game.

Define a position (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

The current player can choose to swap or not swap, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, i.e., when both a and b are 0.

A position is a winning position if the current player can force a win from that position.

Otherwise, it's a losing position.

To determine whether a position is winning or losing, we can look at the possible moves from that position.

In this game, the possible moves are:

1. Swap wallets and remove one coin from the current wallet.

2. Do not swap wallets and remove one coin from the current wallet.

Given that, from position (a, b), the possible next positions are:

- If swapping: (a-1, b) if a > 0, or swap to (b, a) and then remove one from a, which would be (b-1, a).

- If not swapping: (a-1, b) if a > 0, or swap to (b, a) and then remove one from b, which would be (a, b-1).

Wait, I need to be careful here.

After swapping, the wallets are exchanged, and then the player removes one coin from their current wallet.

So, from (a, b):

- Option 1: Swap, then remove one from the new current wallet, which was b.

- Option 2: Do not swap, remove one from a.

So, the possible moves are:

- Swap: (b-1, a)

- Do not swap: (a-1, b), if a > 0.

Wait, but if a == 0, then the player must swap, because they can't remove a coin from an empty wallet.

So, more precisely:

- If a > 0:

- Swap: (b-1, a)

- Do not swap: (a-1, b)

- If a == 0:

- Must swap: (b-1, a)

So, in general, the possible moves from (a, b) are:

- (b-1, a) (swap and remove from new current wallet)

- If a > 0: (a-1, b) (do not swap and remove from current wallet)

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which is when a == 0 and b == 0.

Now, to determine who wins, we can use backward induction, starting from the terminal position (0, 0), which is a losing position.

Then, any position from which we can reach a losing position is a winning position.

And any position from which all possible moves lead to winning positions is a losing position.

But given the large possible values of a and b (up to 10^9), we need a more efficient way to determine the winner without simulating the game.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical formula that can determine the winner based on a and b.

Looking back at the examples, it seems that when a + b is even, Bob wins, and when a + b is odd, Alice wins.

But as seen in the simulation with a=2 and b=2, total is even, but Alice wins, which contradicts the program's assumption.

Wait, in that simulation, Alice wins, but according to the program, since a + b is even, Bob should win.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Perhaps the rule is different.

Let me consider another example.

Take a=3, b=1, total=4, even.

- Alice can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: (1-1, 3) = (0, 3)

- If she doesn't swap: (3-1, 1) = (2, 1)

- So, possible moves: (0, 3) and (2, 1)

- From (0, 3):

- Bob must swap: (3-1, 0) = (2, 0)

- From (2, 1):

- Bob can choose to swap: (1-1, 2) = (0, 2)

- Or not swap: (2-1, 1) = (1, 1)

- From (2, 0):

- Alice can choose to swap: (0-1, 2) = invalid, since can't remove from 0.

- Or not swap: (2-1, 0) = (1, 0)

- So, only valid move: (1, 0)

- From (1, 0):

- Bob must swap: (0-1, 1) = invalid

- Or not swap: (1-1, 0) = (0, 0)

- So, Bob can choose to make it (0, 0), and Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

- From (0, 2):

- Alice must swap: (2-1, 0) = (1, 0)

- From (1, 0):

- Bob can choose to swap: (0-1, 1) = invalid

- Or not swap: (1-1, 0) = (0, 0)

- So, Bob wins.

- From (1, 1):

- Alice can choose to swap: (1-1, 1) = (0, 1)

- Or not swap: (1-1, 1) = (0, 1)

- From (0, 1):

- Bob must swap: (1-1, 0) = (0, 0)

- Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, in all paths from (3,1), Bob wins, but a + b = 4, which is even, so according to the program, Bob wins, which matches.

But earlier with (2,2), according to the program, Bob wins, but in simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that simulation.

Let me try simulating (2,2) again.

- Initial state: (2,2)

- Alice chooses to swap: (2-1, 2) = (1,2)

- Or not swap: (2-1,2) = (1,2)

- So, next state: (1,2)

- Bob chooses to swap: (2-1,1) = (1,1)

- Or not swap: (1-1,2) = (0,2)

- If Bob chooses to swap: (1,1)

- From (1,1):

- Alice chooses to swap: (1-1,1) = (0,1)

- Or not swap: (1-1,1) = (0,1)

- From (0,1):

- Bob must swap: (1-1,0) = (0,0)

- Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

- If Bob chooses not to swap: (0,2)

- From (0,2):

- Alice must swap: (2-1,0) = (1,0)

- From (1,0):

- Bob can choose to swap: (0-1,1) = invalid

- Or not swap: (1-1,0) = (0,0)

- So, Bob wins.

So, in both paths, Bob wins, which matches the program's output.

Earlier, I thought Alice wins, but actually, Bob wins in both paths.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation with a=2 and b=2, total=4, even, Bob wins, which matches the program.

But in the initial confusion, I thought Alice wins, but actually, Bob wins.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Let me check another example.

Take a=1 and b=1, total=2, even, Bob wins. Matches the program.

a=1, b=4, total=5, odd, Alice wins. Matches the example output.

a=5, b=3, total=8, even, Bob wins. Matches the example.

a=4, b=5, total=9, odd, Alice wins. Matches the example.

a=11, b=9, total=20, even, Bob wins. Matches the example.

a=83, b=91, total=174, even, Bob wins. Matches the example.

a=1032, b=9307, total=10339, odd, Alice wins. Matches the example.

a=839204, b=7281, total=846485, odd, Alice wins. Matches the example.

a=1000000000, b=1000000000, total=2000000000, even, Bob wins. Matches the example.

a=53110, b=2024, total=55134, even, Bob wins. Matches the example.

So, all the examples provided in the problem statement support the program's logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on optimal play, given their initial coin counts in their wallets.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin from their chosen wallet.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a move, at which point they lose.

2. **Insight**:
   - The total number of coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.
   - If the sum of coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - Calculate the sum of coins in both wallets.
   - Check if this sum is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity, decide the winner.

### Solution Code

```python
def determine_winner():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

determine_winner()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
  - For each test case, read the coin counts `a` and `b`.

- **Winner Determination**:
  - Calculate the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - If the sum is even, print "Bob".
  - If the sum is odd, print "Alice".

This approach ensures that the winner is determined correctly based on the parity of the total coins, leveraging optimal play from both players.
