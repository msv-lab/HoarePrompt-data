Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to check if such a template exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to create a template t such that:

- For a and b, for each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must equal t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must not equal the lowercase version of t[i].

- For c, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Moreover, since t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, I need to decide for each position whether to make it lowercase or uppercase in the template.

Let me consider the possibilities for each position independently.

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- In this case, to make both a and b match the template, I have two choices:

- Set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), which forces both a[i] and b[i] to be equal to a[i].

- Set t[i] to a[i].upper(), which forces both a[i] and b[i] to be different from a[i].lower(). But since a[i] == b[i], this would require a[i] != a[i], which is impossible unless a[i] != a[i].lower(), but a, b, and c consist only of lowercase letters, so a[i].lower() == a[i]. Therefore, setting t[i] to uppercase a[i] would require a[i] != a[i], which is impossible.

- Hence, if a[i] == b[i], the only viable option is to set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase).

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- In this case, to make both a and b match the template, t[i] must be uppercase, because:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] must equal t[i] and b[i] must equal t[i], but a[i] != b[i], which is impossible.

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] must not equal t[i].lower() and b[i] must not equal t[i].lower(). So, t[i].lower() must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

- Therefore, t[i] should be uppercase of any letter that is not equal to a[i] or b[i] in lowercase.

Now, after setting up the template based on the above rules, I need to ensure that string c does not match this template. That is, there should be at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower().

So, my plan is:

1. For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i], set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- If a[i] != b[i], set t[i] to an uppercase letter that is not equal to a[i] or b[i] in lowercase.

2. Check if c does not match this template t.

But wait, in the case where a[i] != b[i], I need to choose an uppercase letter for t[i] such that t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i]. Since a[i] and b[i] are lowercase letters, I can choose any uppercase letter whose lowercase is different from both a[i] and b[i].

For example, if a[i] = 'x' and b[i] = 'y', I can choose t[i] = 'Z' (uppercase), because 'z' != 'x' and 'z' != 'y'.

However, I need to make sure that such a choice exists. Since there are 26 letters, and a[i] and b[i] are distinct, there are 24 possible choices for t[i].lower() that are not equal to a[i] or b[i].

So, constructing t is feasible.

Now, I need to ensure that c does not match this template t.

Given that t is constructed as above, I need to check if there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower().

Let me consider the two cases again:

1. If a[i] == b[i]:

- t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i].

- For c to not match, there must be at least one i where c[i] != a[i].

- In other words, c differs from a in at least one position.

2. If a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] is uppercase, and t[i].lower() is not equal to a[i] or b[i].

- For c to not match, there must be at least one i where c[i] == t[i].lower().

- But t[i].lower() is chosen to be different from a[i] and b[i], so c[i] must equal this chosen letter.

Wait, but c[i] is a lowercase letter, and t[i].lower() is also lowercase. So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i].lower() is something not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] must equal t[i].lower() for c to not match the template.

But c[i] is independent and can be any lowercase letter. So, if I choose t[i].lower() to be something that c[i] equals, then c does not match the template.

However, if c[i] is different from t[i].lower(), then c matches the template at that position.

So, to ensure that c does not match the template, I need to choose t[i].lower() to be equal to c[i] for at least one position where a[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase with t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i].

So, I can choose t[i].lower() to be c[i], but only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i].lower() to be c[i], provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot choose t[i].lower() to be c[i], because t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can set t[i].lower() = c[i], ensuring that c does not match the template at that position because c[i] == t[i].lower().

Alternatively, if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot set t[i].lower() to c[i], because t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Wait, no. If c[i] == a[i], and a[i] != b[i], then t[i].lower() cannot be a[i], because t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i]. Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], t[i].lower() must not be b[i].

So, in such cases, I cannot set t[i].lower() to c[i], because c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], which are forbidden for t[i].lower().

Hence, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], I cannot choose t[i].lower() to be c[i], meaning that c will match the template at those positions.

Therefore, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- Either:

- a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- Or:

- a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, let's think carefully.

In positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i].

- For c to not match, c[i] != a[i].

In positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] is uppercase with t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i].

- For c to not match, c[i] == t[i].lower().

- But t[i].lower() is chosen to be something other than a[i] and b[i].

- So, if c[i] == t[i].lower(), which is not a[i] or b[i], then c does not match the template.

- However, if c[i] != t[i].lower(), then c matches the template.

Therefore, to ensure that c does not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- Or, if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] == t[i].lower(), which is some letter not equal to a[i] or b[i].

But since t[i].lower() is chosen to be not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] is equal to t[i].lower(), it means c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, in the positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i] for c to not match the template.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i].

- For c to not match, c[i] != a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] is uppercase with t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i].

- For c to not match, c[i] == t[i].lower().

- But t[i].lower() is something other than a[i] and b[i].

Therefore, in positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower(), which is not a[i] or b[i].

So, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- Either:

- a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- Or:

- a[i] != b[i], and c[i] is equal to t[i].lower(), which is some letter not equal to a[i] or b[i].

But since t[i].lower() is chosen to be not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower(), it implies that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i].lower() to be any letter except a[i] or b[i], and set it to c[i], provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, in such positions, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c does not match the template.

Alternatively, in positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], then c does not match the template.

Therefore, to have c not match the template, I need at least one position where:

- Either a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

- Or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, the condition for "YES" is:

There exists at least one position i where:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- Or if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but I need to make sure that the template can be constructed accordingly.

Wait, actually, I think the above condition is sufficient and necessary.

Because:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], setting t[i] = a[i] (lowercase), c must have c[i] != a[i] for c to not match.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], setting t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i] or b[i], and choosing t[i].lower() = c[i] (provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]), ensures that c does not match the template.

Therefore, if there exists at least one position where either:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i],

then I can construct such a template t, and the answer is "YES".

Otherwise, the answer is "NO".

Let me verify this with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Sample Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's check the first test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

Check positions where a == b: none.

Check positions where a != b: position 0 (a[0] != b[0]).

For this position, c[0] = 'c' != 'a' and 'c' != 'b', so condition satisfied.

Hence, "YES".

Second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

For position 0: a[0] != b[0], and c[0] = 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'b' (wait, 'a' == 'a', so condition not satisfied).

For position 1: a[1] != b[1], and c[1] = 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'b' (again, 'a' == 'a'), so condition not satisfied.

Hence, "NO".

Third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

Positions where a == b: none, since all characters are different.

Positions where a != b: all positions.

For c to not match, need at least one position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Compare c with a and b:

Position 0: m != l, c[0] = 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' → satisfies.

Hence, "YES".

Fourth test case:

n=3

a="acc"

b="abd"

c="abc"

Positions:

0: a == a → a[0] == b[0], need c[0] != a[0]. But c[0] = 'a' == a[0], so doesn't satisfy.

1: c != b → a[1] != b[1], need c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1]. c[1] = 'b' != 'c' and 'b' != 'b' → 'b' == 'b', so condition not satisfied.

2: c == d → a[2] != b[2], need c[2] != a[2] and c[2] != b[2]. c[2] = 'c' != 'c' → 'c' == 'c', so condition not satisfied.

Hence, "NO".

Seems consistent.

Therefore, the condition for "YES" is:

There exists at least one position i where:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- Or if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, "NO".

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function func_1() seems to implement the following:

- For each test case:

- Read n, a, b, c.

- Construct a template t as follows:

- For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i], set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- Else, set t[i] = a[i].upper().

- Then, check if a and b match this template, and c does not match it.

Wait, but in the construction, when a[i] != b[i], it sets t[i] = a[i].upper().

But according to the problem, if a[i] != b[i], t[i] should be uppercase with t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i].

But in this code, it sets t[i] = a[i].upper(), which means t[i].lower() == a[i], but a[i] != b[i], which violates the condition that t[i].lower() != a[i].

This seems incorrect.

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I concluded that for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] should be uppercase with t[i].lower() != a[i] and t[i].lower() != b[i].

But in the code, it sets t[i] = a[i].upper(), which has t[i].lower() == a[i], but a[i] != b[i], which means t[i].lower() == a[i], which is invalid because t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i].

Hence, the code is incorrect in this aspect.

Moreover, the matching checks seem unnecessary because the template is being forced in a wrong way.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, but string `c` does not.

## Approach

1. **Template Construction and Matching Rules**:
    - For each position `i`:
        - If `a[i] == b[i]`, set `t[i]` to `a[i]` (lowercase). This forces `a[i]` and `b[i]` to match.
        - If `a[i] != b[i]`, set `t[i]` to an uppercase letter whose lowercase is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`. This ensures `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template by being different from `t[i].lower()`.
    
    - For string `c` to not match the template:
        - There must be at least one position where:
            - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `c[i] != t[i]`.
            - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `c[i]` equals `t[i].lower()`.

2. **Logic**:
    - For positions where `a[i] == b[i]`:
        - To make `a` and `b` match, set `t[i]` to `a[i]` (lowercase).
        - For `c` to not match, `c[i] != a[i]`.
    - For positions where `a[i] != b[i]`:
        - Set `t[i]` to an uppercase letter not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]` in lowercase.
        - For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must equal `t[i].lower()`.

3. **Final Check**:
    - We need to ensure that there is at least one position where `c` does not match the template based on the rules above.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

## Explanation

1. **Template Construction**:
    - For positions where `a[i] == b[i]`, set `t[i]` to `a[i]` (lowercase).
    - For positions where `a[i] != b[i]`, choose an uppercase letter whose lowercase is not `a[i]` or `b[i]`. In the code, we choose 'A' unless 'a' is `a[i]` or `b[i]`, in which case we choose 'B'.

2. **Matching Checks**:
    - Ensure `a` and `b` match the template.
    - Ensure `c` does not match the template by checking if there is at least one position where `c` violates the template rules.

3. **Output**:
    - Print "YES" if such a template exists; otherwise, print "NO".
