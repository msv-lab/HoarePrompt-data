Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The process is:

1. First, lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest.

3. Next, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

And I need to find out what the k-th card laid down is, for multiple test cases.

Okay, let's try to understand this with the example provided. For n=7 and k from 1 to 7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4. Let's see why:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice odd numbers: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

- Three times odd numbers: None, since 3*1=3 is already in the odd numbers, and 3*3=9 is greater than 7.

- Four times odd numbers: 4 (which is 4*1)

- And so on.

So, the sequence is first all odds, then all numbers that are twice an odd, then four times, and so forth, always skipping those that have already been placed.

Now, the challenge is to generalize this for any n and k, and especially since n can be up to 10^9 and t can be up to 5*10^4, it needs to be efficient.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the ordering pattern.

Let's consider the multiples of odd numbers.

Any number can be expressed as (2^p) * q, where q is odd.

For example:

- 1 = 1 (2^0 *1)

- 2 = 2 (2^1 *1)

- 3 = 3 (2^0 *3)

- 4 = 4 (2^2 *1)

- 5 = 5 (2^0 *5)

- 6 = 6 (2^1 *3)

- 7 = 7 (2^0 *7)

- 8 = 8 (2^3 *1)

- and so on.

From this, I can see that the process is grouping numbers by their odd part and ordering them by the power of 2.

In other words, numbers are being ordered first by their odd factor, and then by increasing powers of 2 multiplied to that odd factor.

So, for each odd number, we have a sequence of its multiples by powers of 2, and these sequences are interleaved.

Wait, but in the problem, it's first all odd numbers, then all twice odd numbers, then all three times odd numbers, etc.

Wait, but in the example, it's odd numbers first, then twice odd, then four times odd, etc.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's odd numbers, then twice odd, then four times odd, etc.

So, it's ordered by the multiplier of the odd number, in increasing order of the multiplier, and for each multiplier, in increasing order of the odd number.

So, for multiplier=1 (odd numbers): 1,3,5,7

multiplier=2: 2,6

multiplier=4:4

multiplier=8: none in this case.

And so on.

Wait, but in the sequence, it's 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, first all multiplier=1, then multiplier=2, then multiplier=4, etc.

So, the multiplier is increasing by powers of 2: 1,2,4,8,...

And for each multiplier, we take the numbers that are multiplier * odd_number, where odd_number is an odd number, and multiplier is a power of 2.

Wait, but in the sequence, it's multiplier=1 first, then multiplier=2, then multiplier=4, and so on.

And for each multiplier, the numbers are sorted in increasing order.

So, for multiplier=1: 1,3,5,7

multiplier=2:2,6

multiplier=4:4

multiplier=8: none

So, the sequence is all multiplier=1, then multiplier=2, then multiplier=4, etc.

Now, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through these groups in order, count the numbers in each group until I reach the k-th one.

But n can be up to 10^9 and t up to 5*10^4, so I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, observe that for a given multiplier m (which is a power of 2), the numbers in that group are m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., up to the largest odd number such that m*odd_number <= n.

So, for each m, the number of elements in that group is floor((n/m)+1)/2).

Wait, let's see.

For m=1, numbers are 1,3,5,7 for n=7, which is floor((7/1)+1)/2) = floor(8/2)=4, which matches.

For m=2, numbers are 2,6 for n=7, which is floor((7/2)+1)/2)=floor(4.5/2)=floor(2.25)=2, which matches.

For m=4, number is 4 for n=7, floor((7/4)+1)/2)=floor(2.25/2)=floor(1.125)=1, which matches.

For m=8, floor((7/8)+1)/2)=floor(0.875+1)/2)=floor(1.875/2)=floor(0.9375)=0, which matches.

So, the number of elements in group m is floor((n/m)+1)/2).

So, I can iterate through m=1,2,4,8,... and for each m, calculate the number of elements in that group, and keep a running sum until the running sum >=k.

Once I find the m where the cumulative sum crosses k, I can then find the exact position of k in that group.

So, the plan is:

1. Initialize m=1, sum=0

2. While sum <k:

a. Calculate x = number of elements in group m = floor((n/m)+1)/2)

b. If sum + x >=k, then the k-th card is in this group.

c. Else, sum +=x, m*=2

3. Once the group is found, find the position of k in this group.

4. The position in the group is (k - sum)

5. Since the group is m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., the i-th element is m*(2*i-1), where i starts from 1.

6. So, the k-th card is m*(2*(k - sum) -1)

Wait, but need to make sure that m*(2*i-1) <=n.

Wait, in the example, for m=1, i=1:1, i=2:3, i=3:5, i=4:7

for m=2, i=1:2, i=2:6

for m=4, i=1:4

So, yes, the i-th element in group m is m*(2*i-1), provided that m*(2*i-1)<=n.

So, in code, I need to iterate through m=1,2,4,8,... until the cumulative sum reaches or exceeds k.

Then, calculate the position in the group and compute the value.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it matches this logic.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 0

m = 1

while n:

x = (n + 1) // 2

n //= 2

if s < k and k <= s + x:

break

s += x

m *= 2

print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

So, it initializes s=0, m=1

Then, in a loop:

x = (n +1)//2

n //=2

if s <k <= s+x, break

else: s +=x, m*=2

Then, print((2*(k-s)-1)*m)

So, it seems to be implementing the logic I just described.

Let's map it to my earlier explanation.

- s is the cumulative sum of the previous groups.

- m is the current multiplier, starting at 1 and doubling each time.

- In each iteration:

- x = (n +1)//2, which is the number of odd multiples of m that are <=n.

- n //=2, which is equivalent to considering the next higher multiplier, since n is divided by 2.

- If s <k <=s+x, then k is in this group, so break.

- Else, add x to s and double m.

- Finally, compute the k-th element in this group as m*(2*(k-s)-1)

This seems correct.

Let's verify with the example.

Take n=7, k=5

Initialize s=0, m=1

First loop:

x=(7+1)//2=4

n//=2 =>n=3

s=0 <k=5 <=4? No, since 5>4

s +=4 =>s=4

m*=2 =>m=2

Second loop:

x=(3+1)//2=2

n//=2 =>n=1

s=4 <5 <=6? Yes, since 4<5<=6

Break

Compute (2*(5-4)-1)*2 = (2*1 -1)*2 =1*2=2

Which matches the example's 5th card is 2.

Another example: n=7, k=1

s=0, m=1

x=(7+1)//2=4

n//=2 =>n=3

s=0 <1 <=4, yes

Compute (2*(1-0)-1)*1 =1*1=1, correct.

Another one: n=7, k=7

s=0, m=1

x=4, s=0 <7 <=4? No

s+=4=4, m*=2=2

x=(3+1)//2=2, s=4 <7 <=6? No

s+=2=6, m*=2=4

x=(1+1)//2=1, s=6 <7 <=7? Yes

Compute (2*(7-6)-1)*4=(2*1 -1)*4=1*4=4, which matches.

Looks good.

Edge case: n=1, k=1

s=0, m=1

x=(1+1)//2=1

s=0 <1 <=1, yes

Compute (2*(1-0)-1)*1=1*1=1, correct.

Another edge case: n=2, k=1

s=0, m=1

x=(2+1)//2=1

n//=2=1

s=0 <1 <=1, yes

Compute (2*(1-0)-1)*1=1*1=1, which should be correct since the sequence would be 1,2 for n=2.

Wait, according to the problem's logic:

Odd numbers:1

Twice odd numbers:2

So, sequence is 1,2

Thus, k=1 is 1, k=2 is 2.

So, for n=2, k=2 should be 2.

Let's check the code:

s=0, m=1

x=(2+1)//2=1

n//=2=1

s=0 <2 <=1? No

s+=1=1, m*=2=2

x=(1+1)//2=1

s=1 <2 <=2? Yes

Compute (2*(2-1)-1)*2=(2*1 -1)*2=1*2=2, correct.

Another test: n=1000000000, k=1000000000

This should be the largest possible n and k.

According to the code:

s=0, m=1

x=(1000000000+1)//2=500000000

n//=2=500000000

s=0 <1000000000 <=500000000? No

s+=500000000=500000000, m*=2=2

x=(500000000+1)//2=250000000

s=500000000 <1000000000 <=750000000? No

x=(8+1)//2=4

s=999999999 <1000000000 <=1000000003? Yes

Compute (2*(1000000000 -999999999)-1)*134217728=(2*1 -1)*134217728=1*134217728=134217728

But according to the sample output, it's 536870912, which is 2^29, but 134217728 is 2^27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating m.

Let me recount m:

Start with m=1

Each time m*=2

So, m=1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384,32768,65536,131072,262144,524288,1048576,2097152,4194304,8388608,16777216,33554432,67108864,134217728,268435456,536870912,...

So, in the last step, s=999999999, m=134217728

x=(1+1)//2=1

s=999999999 <1000000000 <=1000000000? Yes

Compute (2*(1000000000 -999999999)-1)*134217728=(2*1 -1)*134217728=134217728

But according to the sample output, it's 536870912, which is 4*134217728.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the s.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep going.

Wait, n starts at 1000000000

Twenty-second: x=(477+1)//2=239, n//=2=239, s=999999529+239=999999768, m=4194304

Twenty-third: x=(239+1)//2=120, n//=2=120, s=999999768+120=999999888, m=8388608

Twenty-eighth: x=(8+1)//2=4, n//=2=4, s=999999999+4=1000000003, which is >1000000000

So, at this point, s=1000000003, m=268435456

But k=1000000000 is <= s, so in the previous step, s=999999999 < k <=1000000003, so m=134217728

Then, compute (2*(1000000000 -999999999)-1)*134217728=(2*1 -1)*134217728=134217728

But according to the sample output, it's 536870912, which is 4 times that.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what m should be.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the s.

Wait, in the twenty-seventh step:

s=999999993 +8=999999993+8=1000000001?

Wait, no, in the twenty-seventh step:

x=(15+1)//2=8, n//=2=7 (since 15//2=7)

So, s=999999993+8=1000000001, m=134217728

Then, k=1000000000 is <=1000000001, so it's in this group.

Compute (2*(1000000000 -999999993)-1)*134217728=(2*7 -1)*134217728=13*134217728=1744830464, which is not matching the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating s.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of s more carefully.

Let me try to simulate it step by step.
