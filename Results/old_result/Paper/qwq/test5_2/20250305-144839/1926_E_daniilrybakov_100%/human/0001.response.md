Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The order is based on this process:

1. First, lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest.

3. Next, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

And this process continues until all cards are laid down. I need to find out what the k-th card is in this sequence.

Okay, let's try to understand this with the example given. For n=7 and k from 1 to 7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4. Let's see why:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice an odd number: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

- Three times an odd number: none, since 3*1=3 is already in the odd numbers, and 3*3=9 is greater than 7

- Four times an odd number: 4 (which is 4*1)

- And so on.

So, the sequence is first all odds, then all numbers that are twice an odd, then four times, and so forth.

Now, the problem is to find the k-th card in this sequence for possibly multiple test cases, up to 50,000 of them, with n up to 10^9 and k up to n.

First, I need to find a way to determine the k-th card efficiently, given that n can be up to a billion, and there are up to 50,000 test cases. So, any solution that is O(n) per test case is not going to work; it needs to be much faster, probably O(log n) or better.

Let me think about the structure of this sequence.

The way the cards are being laid down is by levels, where each level corresponds to a multiplier of the odd numbers. The first level is 1 times odd numbers, the second level is 2 times odd numbers, the third is 3 times odd numbers, and so on.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's 1×odds, then 2×odds, then 4×odds, then 8×odds, etc. Wait, looking back at the example, after odds (1×odds), it's 2×odds, then 4×odds. So, the multipliers are powers of 2: 1,2,4,8,...

Yes, that makes sense because each time we're doubling the multiplier.

So, the levels are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., each time multiplying by 2.

At each level, we're taking the odd multiples of that level's multiplier.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Given a number x, we can express it as x = m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x, and m is a power of 2.

For example:

- 1 = 1 * 1

- 2 = 2 * 1

- 3 = 1 * 3

- 4 = 4 * 1

- 5 = 1 * 5

- 6 = 2 * 3

- 7 = 1 * 7

- 8 = 8 * 1

- 9 = 1 * 9

- 10 = 2 * 5

And so on.

In this sequence, the numbers are being ordered first by their o value, and then by their m value.

Wait, but in the example, for n=7, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Looking at their o and m:

- 1: m=1, o=1

- 3: m=1, o=3

- 5: m=1, o=5

- 7: m=1, o=7

- 2: m=2, o=1

- 6: m=2, o=3

- 4: m=4, o=1

So, it's ordered first by increasing o, and then by increasing m.

Yes, that seems to be the pattern.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through o from smallest to largest odd numbers, and for each o, iterate through m from smallest power of 2 such that m*o <= n.

But, since o are odd numbers, and m are powers of 2, and x = m * o, with m being the highest power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, but in this case, m is actually the power of 2 part, and o is the odd part.

So, another way to look at it is that for each o, we have a sequence of m*o, where m is a power of 2, and m*o <= n.

And the sequence is first all o, then all 2*o, then all 4*o, and so on.

But in the problem, it's first all o, then all 2*o, then all 4*o, etc., for each o.

But in the example, for o=1, we have 1,2,4

For o=3, we have 3,6

For o=5, we have 5

For o=7, we have 7

So, for each o, we have a sequence of m*o, where m is a power of 2, and m*o <= n.

And the sequence is ordered first by o, then by m.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through o from smallest to largest, and for each o, iterate through m from smallest to largest, accumulating the count, until I reach k.

But with n up to 1e9 and t up to 5e4, I need a faster way than iterating through each o and m.

Let me think about how to calculate this efficiently.

First, observe that the sequence is ordered by o first, then by m.

So, if I can find, for a given k, which o and m it corresponds to, I can find the k-th card.

One way to do this is to realize that the number of o's is roughly n/2 + 1 (since half of the numbers are odd, plus one if n is odd).

Wait, actually, the number of odd numbers up to n is (n+1)//2.

Then, for each o, the number of m's is the number of powers of 2 such that m*o <= n.

Which is floor(log2(n/o)) + 1.

But iterating over o and calculating the number of m's for each o is too slow for large n and t.

I need a better way.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the levels, where each level corresponds to a power of 2 for m.

So, level 0: m=1, which includes all odd numbers.

Level 1: m=2, which includes all numbers that are 2 times an odd number.

Level 2: m=4, which includes all numbers that are 4 times an odd number.

And so on, until m=2^k where 2^k * o <= n.

For each level, the number of cards is the number of odd o such that m*o <= n.

Which is floor(n / m) // 2 + floor(n / m) % 2.

Wait, more precisely, for a given m, the number of o such that m*o <= n is floor(n / m) // 2 + floor(n / m) % 2.

Because o are odd numbers up to floor(n / m).

So, the number of odd o up to some number x is (x + 1) // 2.

So, for each level m, the number of cards at that level is (floor(n / m) + 1) // 2.

So, the total number of cards up to level t is the sum over m=2^i for i=0 to t of (floor(n / m) + 1) // 2.

But summing this directly is still too slow for large t.

Wait, but t is up to 5e4, and for each test case, I need to compute this sum efficiently.

I need a way to compute this sum quickly.

Alternatively, maybe I can find which level the k-th card is in by finding the cumulative sum of the number of cards per level, and find the smallest level where the cumulative sum >= k.

But with levels potentially up to log2(n) which is up to 30 for n=1e9, and t=5e4, this might be manageable, but probably not efficient enough.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something similar.

Let me look at the given code.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 0

m = 1

while n:

x = (n + 1) // 2

n //= 2

if s < k and k <= s + x:

break

s += x

m *= 2

print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

So, it's initializing s=0 and m=1.

Then, in a loop, it computes x=(n+1)//2, which is the number of odd numbers up to n.

Then, n //= 2, which is equivalent to m *= 2, I think.

Wait, m is being multiplied by 2 each time, and n is being floor divided by 2.

So, it's iterating through levels where m is increasing by powers of 2.

x is the number of o's at that level, which is (n + 1) // 2.

Then, it checks if k is in the range s < k <= s + x.

If yes, it breaks, meaning that the k-th card is in this level.

Otherwise, it adds x to s and continues to the next level.

Finally, it computes the k-th card as (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m.

Let me try to understand this.

So, s keeps track of the cumulative number of cards up to the previous levels.

m is the current multiplier, which is a power of 2.

x is the number of cards at this level, which is (n + 1) // 2, where n is floor(n / 2^i), with i being the current level.

Wait, n is being floor divided by 2 each time, so n //= 2 reduces n to floor(n / 2).

So, x = (n + 1) // 2 is the number of odd numbers up to n.

So, at each level, x is the number of o's such that m * o <= original n.

Wait, but m is being multiplied by 2 each time, and n is being floor divided by 2 each time.

So, n //= 2 is equivalent to considering o up to floor(original_n / m).

And x = (n + 1) // 2 is the number of odd o's up to that.

So, yes, x is the number of cards at this level.

Then, s += x adds the number of cards at this level to the cumulative sum.

If k is in the range s < k <= s + x, then the k-th card is in this level.

Then, it computes the position within this level as k - s.

Then, the card is (2 * (position) - 1) * m.

Wait, let's see.

For position j (1-based index) within the level, the card is (2*j - 1)*m.

Because o = 2*j - 1, since o are odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,...

So, o = 2*j - 1, where j starts from 1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for example, in level m=1, o=1,3,5,7,...

So, cards are 1,3,5,7,...

Which is m*(2*j - 1).

Similarly, for m=2, o=1,3,5,7,...

So, cards are 2,6,10,14,...

Which is m*(2*j - 1).

And so on.

So, the formula seems correct.

Let me verify with the example.

Take n=7, k=1.

First iteration: m=1, n=7, x=(7+1)//2=4, s=0, k=1 is in 0 < 1 <=4, so break.

Then, j = k - s =1, so card = (2*1 -1)*1 =1.

Correct.

k=2: m=1, x=4, s=0, 0 < 2 <=4, break.

j=2, card=(4-1)*1=3.

Correct.

k=5: m=1, x=4, s=0, 0 <5 <=4 is false, so s=4, m=2, n=3, x=(3+1)//2=2.

0+4 <5 <=4+2, which is 4 <5 <=6, true, break.

j=5-4=1, card=(2*1 -1)*2=2.

Correct.

k=7: m=1, x=4, s=0, 0 <7 <=4 is false, s=4.

m=2, n=3, x=2, 4 <7 <=6 is false, s=6.

m=4, n=1, x=1, 6 <7 <=7, true, break.

j=7-6=1, card=(2*1 -1)*4=4.

Correct.

So, the formula seems to work for this example.

Let me see another example.

n=1, k=1.

m=1, x=1, s=0, 0 <1 <=1, true, break.

j=1, card=(2*1 -1)*1=1.

Correct.

n=34, k=14.

Let's compute step by step.

m=1, n=34, x=(34+1)//2=17, s=0, 0 <14 <=17, true, break.

j=14-0=14, card=(2*14 -1)*1=27.

Is 27 <=34? Yes.

Wait, but is 27 in the sequence?

Let's see the sequence for n=34.

Odds:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33

Twice odds:2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34

Four times odds:4,12,20,28,32

Eight times odds:8,24

Sixteen times odds:16

Thirty-two times odds:32 (but already included)

So, the sequence is:

1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,

2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,

4,12,20,28,32,

8,24,

16.

So, positions:

1 to 17: odds

18 to 26: twice odds

27 to 31: four times odds

32 and 33: eight times odds

34: sixteen times odds

So, k=14 is the 14th odd, which is 27.

Which matches the output.

Another test case: n=84, k=19.

m=1, x=(84+1)//2=42, s=0, 0 <19 <=42, true, break.

j=19, card=(2*19 -1)*1=37.

Is 37 <=84? Yes.

In the sequence, odds:1,3,5,...,83

Twice odds:2,6,10,...,82

Four times odds:4,12,20,...,84

Eight times odds:8,24,40,56,72,84

Sixteen times odds:16,48,80

Thirty-two times odds:32,96 (96>84)

Sixty-four times odds:64

So, sequence:

odds:1,3,5,...,83 (42 numbers)

twice odds:2,6,10,...,82 (21 numbers)

four times odds:4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,76,84 (11 numbers)

eight times odds:8,24,40,56,72,84 (6 numbers)

sixteen times odds:16,48,80 (3 numbers)

thirty-two times odds:32 (1 number)

sixty-four times odds:64 (1 number)

So, positions:

1-42: odds

43-63: twice odds (21 numbers)

64-74: four times odds (11 numbers)

75-80: eight times odds (6 numbers)

81-83: sixteen times odds (3 numbers)

84: thirty-two times odds:32

Wait, but 32 is already included in four times odds as 8*4=32, but it's also in twice odds as 16*2=32, but actually, 32 is 32*1, but 32 is even, so its o=32//2=16, which is even, so o=16//2=8, which is even, o=8//2=4, which is even, o=4//2=2, which is even, o=2//2=1, which is odd. So, o=1, m=32.

So, 32 is in the m=32 level.

Similarly, 64 is m=64, o=1.

So, the sequence should be:

odds:1,3,5,...,83

twice odds:2,6,10,...,82

four times odds:4,12,20,...,84

eight times odds:8,24,40,56,72,84

sixteen times odds:16,48,80

thirty-two times odds:32

sixty-four times odds:64

So, positions:

1-42: odds

43-63: twice odds (21 numbers)

64-74: four times odds (11 numbers)

75-80: eight times odds (6 numbers)

81: sixteen times odds:16

82: sixteen times odds:48

83: sixteen times odds:80

84: thirty-two times odds:32

Wait, but in the earlier count, positions 64-74 are four times odds (11 numbers), 75-80 are eight times odds (6 numbers), 81-83 are sixteen times odds (3 numbers), and 84 is thirty-two times odds (1 number).

So, for k=19, it's within the first 42, which are odds, so it should be the 19th odd, which is 1 + 2*(19-1) = 37.

Which matches the output.

Another test case: n=1000000000, k=1000000000.

This should be the last card, which is the largest m*o <=n, with m being the highest power of 2 possible.

Given that n=10^9, the highest m is 2^29=536870912, since 2^30=1073741824 >10^9.

So, o=1, m=536870912, which is 536870912.

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

So, the logic is:

- Initialize s=0 and m=1.

- While n:

- Compute x=(n+1)//2, which is the number of odd numbers up to n.

- If s < k <= s + x, then the k-th card is in this level.

- Set the card as (2*(k - s) -1)*m.

- Otherwise, add x to s, multiply m by 2, and set n //=2.

- Repeat until found.

This seems to be correctly identifying the level and the position within the level.

The key insight is that at each level m, the number of cards is the number of odd numbers up to floor(n/m), which is (floor(n/m) +1)//2.

And by iteratively reducing n by floor division by 2 and m by multiplication by 2, it simulates going through higher levels.

This seems efficient, as it reduces n by half each time, so the loop runs in O(log n) time per test case.

Given that t can be up to 5e4 and n up to 1e9, this should be efficient enough.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
