Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up (U) or facing down (D). Alice and Bob take turns playing the game, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player has to choose a coin that's facing up, remove it, and flip the two coins that are adjacent to it. There are some special cases when there are only one or two coins left, but generally, that's the operation.

The game continues until a player can't make a move, meaning there are no facing-up coins left, and that player loses. I need to determine, for given configurations of coins, whether Alice will win the game if both players play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. Let's consider a few small examples to get a feel for how the game progresses.

Take n=3 with coins arranged as U U D.

- Alice can choose either of the two U's. Let's say she chooses the first U.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coins: the second U flips to D, and the third D flips to U.

- So now the arrangement is D D U.

- Bob now chooses the U.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coins: both are D, so they flip to U.

- Now the arrangement is U U D.

- Alice chooses one of the U's, say the first one.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coins: the second U flips to D, and the third D flips to U.

- Now it's D U U.

- Bob chooses one of the U's, say the second one.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coins: the first D flips to U, and the third U flips to D.

- Now it's U D D.

- Alice chooses the U.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coins: both are D, so they flip to U.

- Now it's U U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Removing it and flipping the adjacent coin: the other U flips to D.

- Now it's D.

- Alice chooses the D, but it's facing down, so she can't choose it. She loses.

Wait, but according to the rules, a player has to choose a facing-up coin. If there are no facing-up coins, the player loses. In this case, after Bob's move, there's only one coin left, which is D. Alice can't choose it, so Bob wins.

But according to the program, it just checks if the number of 'U's is odd. In this case, initially, there are two 'U's, which is even, so the program would output 'no', meaning Alice loses. Which matches our conclusion.

Let's try another example.

n=4 with U U D D.

- Alice chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: the second U flips to D, and the fourth D flips to U.

- Now it's D D U.

- This is similar to the previous case.

- Bob chooses the U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: both are D, so they flip to U.

- Now it's U U.

- Alice chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent U to D.

- Now it's D.

- Bob chooses the D, can't, so Alice loses.

Again, initially, there were two 'U's, even number, program outputs 'no', Alice loses.

Another example:

n=3 with U U U.

- Alice chooses any U, say the first one.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second U to D, third U to D.

- Now it's D D.

- Bob chooses one D, can't, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the program, three 'U's is an odd number, so it should output 'yes', Alice wins. Which matches our conclusion.

Wait, but in the previous cases, even number of 'U's lead to Alice losing.

So maybe the rule is that if the number of 'U's is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

But is that always true? Let's try another case.

n=1 with U.

- Alice chooses the U.

- Remove it.

- No coins left.

- Bob can't choose anything, so Alice wins.

Which matches: one 'U', odd, Alice wins.

n=1 with D.

- Alice can't choose anything, so she loses.

Which isn't considered because according to the problem, coins are either U or D, but the game starts with at least one U, I think. Wait, the problem says "each coin is either facing up or facing down", so it's possible to have all D's, but in that case, Alice loses immediately because there are no U's to choose.

But the problem says "it can be proved that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win". So perhaps it's assumed that there is at least one U initially.

But looking back, in the program, it just counts the number of 'U's and checks if it's odd or even.

Is this always decisive?

Let me try n=4 with U D U D.

- Alice chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second D to U, fourth D to U.

- Now it's U U U.

- Bob chooses any U, say the first one.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second U to D, third U to D.

- Now it's D D.

- Alice chooses one D, can't, so Bob wins.

Wait, initially, there were two 'U's, which is even, program says 'no', Alice loses, which matches.

Another configuration: n=5 with U U D U D.

- Alice chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second U to D, fifth D to U.

- Now it's D D U U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: the third D flips to U, the fourth U flips to D.

- Now it's U D D.

- Alice chooses the U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: both are D, so they flip to U.

- Now it's U U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent U to D.

- Now it's D.

- Alice chooses D, can't, so Bob wins.

Initially, there were three 'U's, which is odd, but according to this play, Bob wins. But according to the program, it should be 'yes', Alice wins.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem:

Input:

3

5

UUDUD

5

UDDUD

2

UU

Output:

YES

NO

NO

In the first test case, 5 UUDUD, output is YES, meaning Alice wins.

In our simulation above, Alice wins in the end.

But in my previous simulation, I thought Alice would lose, but according to the problem note, Bob loses if they play optimally.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my simulation.

Let me try again.

Starting with U U D U D.

- Alice chooses first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second U becomes D, fifth D becomes U.

- Now it's D D U U.

- Bob chooses the third U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second D becomes U, fourth U becomes D.

- Now it's U D D.

- Alice chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: the second D becomes U, the third D becomes U.

- Now it's U U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent U to D.

- Now it's D.

- Alice chooses D, can't, so Bob loses.

So Alice wins, which matches the program's output of 'YES' for odd number of 'U's.

Another test case: n=5, U D D U D.

- Alice chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second D becomes U, fifth D becomes U.

- Now it's U U U D.

- Bob chooses the first U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: second U becomes D, fourth D becomes U.

- Now it's D U U.

- Alice chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent coins: the first D becomes U, the second U becomes D.

- Now it's U D.

- Bob chooses the U.

- Remove it and flip the adjacent D to U.

- Now it's U.

- Alice chooses the U.

- Remove it.

- No coins left.

- Bob can't choose, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the program, it should be 'NO' for this case, meaning Alice loses.

But in my simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me try again.

Starting with U D D U D.

- Alice chooses first U.

- Remove it, flip second D to U, fifth D to U.

- Now it's U U U D.

- Bob chooses first U.

- Remove it, flip second U to D, fourth D to U.

- Now it's D U U.

- Alice chooses second U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent coins: first D to U, third U to D.

- Now it's U D.

- Bob chooses U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent D to U.

- Now it's U.

- Alice chooses U.

- Remove it.

- No coins left.

- Bob can't choose, so Bob loses.

So Alice wins again, but according to the program, it's 'NO', meaning Alice loses.

Wait, maybe I misread the input.

Wait, in the sample input, the second test case is:

5

UDDUD

Output:

NO

But in my simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, maybe I simulated it incorrectly.

Let me try again.

Starting with U D D U D.

- Alice chooses first U.

- Remove it, flip second D to U, fifth D to U.

- Now it's U U U D.

- Bob chooses the first U.

- Remove it, flip second U to D, fourth D to U.

- Now it's D U U.

- Alice chooses second U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent coins: first D to U, third U to D.

- Now it's U D.

- Bob chooses U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent D to U.

- Now it's U.

- Alice chooses U.

- Remove it.

- No coins left.

- Bob can't choose, so Bob loses.

Again, Alice wins, but the program outputs 'NO', suggesting Alice loses.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "it can be proved that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win."

But in my simulation, Alice wins, but according to the program and the sample output, it's 'NO', meaning Alice loses.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider different moves.

Let me try different choices.

Starting with U D D U D.

- Alice chooses the fourth U.

- Remove it, flip the third D to U and the fifth D to U.

- Now it's U D U U.

- Bob chooses the second D.

- Remove it, flip the first U to D and the third U to D.

- Now it's D D U.

- Alice chooses the third U.

- Remove it, flip the second D to U and the first D to U.

- Now it's U U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Remove it, flip the adjacent U to D.

- Now it's D.

- Alice chooses D, can't, so Bob wins.

In this case, Bob wins.

So depending on the moves, different outcomes are possible.

But in the sample output, it's 'NO', meaning Alice loses.

So perhaps, in some plays, Alice can lose, but in others, she can win.

But the problem says "decide who will win the game if they both play optimally."

So, if both play optimally, will Alice win or lose?

In one simulation, Alice wins, in another, she loses.

So, perhaps with optimal play, Alice can force a win or a loss depending on the configuration.

But according to the program, it only checks if the number of 'U's is odd.

If it's odd, Alice wins; if even, Alice loses.

But in my simulations, even when the number of 'U's is odd, Alice can lose if she makes a wrong move.

Wait, but the problem says "if they both play optimally."

So, perhaps, with optimal play, if the number of 'U's is odd, Alice can always force a win, otherwise, she loses.

But in one of my simulations, even with an even number of 'U's, Alice seemed to win, but that was a mistake in simulation; in another simulation, with an odd number, she could lose if she makes a wrong move.

This makes me doubt the correctness of the program.

Alternatively, maybe the program is correct, and it's based on some mathematical insight that I'm missing.

Perhaps, the parity of the number of 'U's determines the winner when both play optimally.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory.

This seems like a impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them.

Perhaps it can be modeled as a Nim game or some variant.

In Nim, the xor of the heap sizes determines the winner.

But here, the game is more about the parity of the number of 'U's.

Wait, in the program, it simply checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even.

If odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

But in my simulations, even with an odd number of 'U's, Alice can lose if she doesn't play optimally.

However, the problem states "if they both play optimally."

So, perhaps, with optimal play, the parity decides the winner.

Let me consider the base cases.

If there are 0 'U's, Alice loses immediately, since she can't make a move.

If there is 1 'U', Alice removes it, and Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

If there are 2 'U's, Alice removes one, flipping the adjacent coins.

The adjacent coins could be various things depending on the circle.

But in general, it seems that with even number of 'U's, Bob can mirror Alice's moves in some way and force a win.

Similarly, with odd number of 'U's, Alice can make a move that leaves an even number for Bob, and so on.

But I need to think more carefully.

Maybe I should consider the game as a graph, where each node represents a game state, and edges represent moves.

But that might be too complicated for this context.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical pattern based on the parity of the number of 'U's.

Given that the program only checks the parity, it suggests that the parity is the deciding factor.

But in my simulations, even with an odd number of 'U's, Alice can lose if she doesn't play optimally.

However, if she plays optimally, perhaps she can always force a win.

Similarly, with an even number, Bob can force a win.

Alternatively, maybe the program is incorrect.

I need to find a configuration where the number of 'U's is odd, but Alice can't win no matter how she plays.

Or vice versa.

Let me try n=4 with U U U D.

Number of 'U's is three, which is odd.

- Alice chooses one U.

- Remove it and flip adjacent coins.

Suppose she chooses the first U.

- Remove it, flip second U to D and fourth D to U.

- Now it's D D U.

- Bob chooses the U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent coins: both are D, so they become U.

- Now it's U U.

- Alice chooses one U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent U to D.

- Now it's D.

- Bob chooses D, can't, so Alice wins.

Another way:

- Alice chooses the third U.

- Remove it, flip the second U to D and the fourth D to U.

- Now it's U D U.

- Bob chooses one U.

- Say the first U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent coins: second D to U, third U to D.

- Now it's U D.

- Alice chooses U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent D to U.

- Now it's U.

- Bob chooses U.

- Remove it.

- No coins left.

- Alice can't choose, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, depending on Alice's choice, she can either win or lose.

But with optimal play, she should choose the move that leads to her victory.

So, in this case, choosing the first U leads to her winning, while choosing the third U leads to her losing.

Therefore, with optimal play, she chooses the first U and wins.

Hence, in this configuration with an odd number of 'U's, Alice can win.

Another configuration: n=3 with U U D.

As I simulated earlier, with optimal play, Alice can win.

Wait, but in my first simulation, I thought Bob could win, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me try again.

Starting with U U D.

- Alice chooses first U.

- Remove it, flip second U to D and third D to U.

- Now it's D U.

- Bob chooses U.

- Remove it, flip adjacent coins: first D to U and second (which is none, I think since it's a circle).

Wait, n=3, so it's a circle.

Removing the first U, flipping second U to D and third D to U.

So it's D U.

Then Bob chooses U.

Removes it, flipping adjacent coins: the first D to U and the second U to D.

Wait, but in a circle, the adjacent coins of the last U are the first D and the second D.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the program is correct, and I'm missing something.

Perhaps the parity of the number of 'U's is indeed the deciding factor.

Let me look for a general pattern or proof.

Suppose that the game is equivalent to a Nim game with a single heap where the size is the number of 'U's modulo 2.

If the number of 'U's is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U's for Bob, and so on.

Similarly, if the number is even, Alice is forced to leave an odd number for Bob, and Bob can always make it even again.

But in my simulations, even with an even number of 'U's, Alice seemed to win in some cases, but that might have been due to suboptimal play.

Wait, in the second simulation with n=4 and U U U D, Alice can choose a move that leads to her winning or losing.

But with optimal play, she chooses the move that leads to her winning.

So, in configurations with an odd number of 'U's, Alice can always choose a move that leaves an even number of 'U's for Bob, putting Bob in a losing position.

Similarly, with an even number, Alice is forced to leave an odd number for Bob, who can then force a win.

Therefore, the parity of the number of 'U's determines the winner with optimal play.

Hence, the program is correct in just checking the parity of the number of 'U's.

Thus, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle, where each coin is either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D"). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins until no facing-up coins remain. The player who cannot make a move loses.

## Approach

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the number of coins, `n`.
     - Read the string representing the coins' initial states.

2. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even count) of facing-up coins ("U").
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob wins.

3. **Output Results:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if Alice wins, otherwise "NO".

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Parsing:** We read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of coins and their initial states as a string.
- **Game Analysis:** By counting the number of "U" in the string, we determine the parity.
  - If the count of "U" is odd, Alice wins.
  - If the count of "U" is even, Bob wins.
- **Output Results:** For each test case, we print "YES" if Alice wins (odd count of "U"), otherwise "NO".

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, where n is the number of coins, due to the string processing involved in counting "U". Given the constraints (n ≤ 100 and t ≤ 100), this is acceptable.
