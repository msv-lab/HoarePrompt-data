Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at position i, then the string must have exactly that letter at position i. If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, then the string must have a different lowercase letter at that position.

So, for example, if t has 'a' at position i, then s must have 'a' at position i. If t has 'A' at position i, then s must have any letter except 'a' at position i.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template t. That means, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Additionally, c should not match the template t. That means there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to find a template t that satisfies these conditions.

Let me consider the constraints:

- n can be from 1 to 20, which is manageable.

- Strings a, b, and c are all of length n and consist only of lowercase letters.

I need to find t of length n, where each character is either a lowercase or uppercase letter.

Let me think about how to construct such a template t.

For each position i from 1 to n, I have to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, say 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'X', then both a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

So, for each position i, I have two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

But these choices have constraints based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me try to formalize this.

For each position i:

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x'.

- Then, a[i] must be 'x'.

- b[i] must be 'x'.

- c[i] must not be 'x'.

So, for this choice to be valid:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X'.

- Then, a[i] must not be 'x'.

- b[i] must not be 'x'.

- c[i] must be 'x'.

So, for this choice to be valid:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Wait, but in the uppercase case, t[i] is 'X', so the lowercase version is 'x', so a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each position i, I have to choose either:

- t[i] is 'x' (lowercase), provided a[i] == 'x', b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'.

- t[i] is 'X' (uppercase), provided a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

But there's a problem here. The template t can have any lowercase or uppercase letters, not just the specific letters from a, b, or c.

Wait, actually, the template can have any lowercase or uppercase letters, but the matching rules depend on whether the template's character is lowercase or uppercase.

So, more precisely, for each position i:

- If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, say 'a', then a[i] and b[i] must both be 'a', and c[i] must not be 'a'.

- If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'A', then a[i] and b[i] must both not be 'a', and c[i] must be 'a'.

So, for each position, I need to choose a specific letter for t[i], either lowercase or uppercase, based on the conditions above.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think differently. I need a template t such that:

- a matches t

- b matches t

- c does not match t

This means that a and b both satisfy the template's rules, but c does not.

So, for a and b, for every position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must equal t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i]

And for c:

- There exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == the lowercase of t[i]

I need to find such a template t.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can independently choose whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Wait, but the choice for t[i] affects the overall template, and I need to ensure that the combined choices make a and b match, and c does not match.

This seems like I need to make sure that for all positions, a and b satisfy their respective conditions, and additionally, c fails at least one condition.

This sounds like I need to find a combination of choices for each position that satisfies these constraints.

This might be a bit tricky, but perhaps I can iterate through each position and determine the possible choices for t[i], given a[i], b[i], and c[i], and then see if there's a combination that works.

Let me consider position by position.

For each position i, I can look at a[i], b[i], and c[i], and determine what t[i] can be.

Let me define two possibilities for t[i]:

1. t[i] is lowercase 'x', where x is a lowercase letter.

- Then:

- a[i] must be x

- b[i] must be x

- c[i] must not be x

So, for this to be possible:

- a[i] == b[i], and a[i] != c[i]

Because a[i] and b[i] must both be x, and c[i] must be different from x.

2. t[i] is uppercase 'X', where X corresponds to lowercase x.

- Then:

- a[i] must not be x

- b[i] must not be x

- c[i] must be x

So, for this to be possible:

- a[i] != x

- b[i] != x

- c[i] == x

But here, x is the lowercase letter corresponding to the uppercase X in t[i].

Wait, but t[i] can be any uppercase letter, not necessarily related to a[i], b[i], or c[i].

Wait no, t[i] is an uppercase letter, and its lowercase version is what's compared to a[i], b[i], and c[i].

So, for t[i] = 'X', the lowercase version is 'x'.

So, for t[i] = 'X':

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Similarly, for t[i] = 'Y':

- a[i] != 'y'

- b[i] != 'y'

- c[i] == 'y'

And so on for each uppercase letter.

So, for each position i, I can choose t[i] to be either a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter, with the constraints above.

Wait, but in the problem, t can have any combination of lowercase and uppercase letters for each position, independently.

So, for each position i, I can choose t[i] to be any lowercase or uppercase letter, as long as the conditions for a, b, and c are satisfied.

But this seems a bit cumbersome, because I have to choose a specific letter for each position, and ensure that the choices collectively make a and b match, and c not match.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the differences between a, b, and c.

I need a and b to match the template, but c to not match.

So, for each position i, if a[i] and b[i] are the same, it might be easier to set t[i] to that value in lowercase, provided c[i] is different.

But if a[i] and b[i] are different, I need to choose t[i] in a way that both a[i] and b[i] satisfy the template's requirement.

This is getting a bit complicated.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

I need to find a template t of length 1 such that a and b match t, but c does not.

Possible choices for t[i]:

- t[i] = 'a' (lowercase):

- a matches: a == 'a'

- b matches: b == 'a' ? No, b = 'b' != 'a'

So, b does not match.

- c does not match: c != 'a'

So, since b does not match, this t[i] = 'a' is invalid.

- t[i] = 'b' (lowercase):

- a matches: a == 'b' ? No, a = 'a' != 'b'

So, a does not match.

- b matches: b == 'b'

- c does not match: c != 'b'

Since a does not match, this t[i] = 'b' is invalid.

- t[i] = 'c' (lowercase):

- a matches: a == 'c' ? No

- b matches: b == 'c' ? No

- c does not match: c != 'c' ? No

So, this is invalid.

- t[i] = 'A' (uppercase):

- a matches: a != 'a' ? No, a = 'a' == 'a'

- b matches: b != 'a' ? Yes, b = 'b' != 'a'

- c does not match: c == 'a' ? No, c = 'c' != 'a'

So, a does not match, b matches, c does not match.

But I need both a and b to match, so this is invalid.

- t[i] = 'B' (uppercase):

- a matches: a != 'b' ? Yes, a = 'a' != 'b'

- b matches: b != 'b' ? No, b = 'b' == 'b'

- c does not match: c == 'b' ? No, c = 'c' != 'b'

So, b does not match, invalid.

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase):

- a matches: a != 'c' ? Yes, a = 'a' != 'c'

- b matches: b != 'c' ? Yes, b = 'b' != 'c'

- c does not match: c == 'c' ? Yes, c = 'c' == 'c'

So, a and b match, c does not match.

This works.

So, in this case, t = "C" is a valid template.

That matches the explanation in the problem.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Is there a template t of length 2 such that a and b match t, but c does not.

Let's try to find such a template.

For position 1:

- a[1] = 'a'

- b[1] = 'b'

- c[1] = 'a'

Options for t[1]:

- t[1] = 'x' (lowercase):

- a[1] == 'x' and b[1] == 'x'

- But a[1] = 'a' and b[1] = 'b', so only possible if x = 'a' and x = 'b', which is impossible.

- So, no lowercase letter can be chosen for t[1].

- t[1] = 'X' (uppercase):

- a[1] != 'x'

- b[1] != 'x'

- c[1] == 'x'

So, for t[1] = 'A' (uppercase):

- a[1] != 'a' ? No, a[1] = 'a' == 'a'

- So, invalid.

- t[1] = 'B' (uppercase):

- a[1] != 'b' ? Yes, a[1] = 'a' != 'b'

- b[1] != 'b' ? No, b[1] = 'b' == 'b'

- c[1] == 'b' ? No, c[1] = 'a' != 'b'

So, b does not match, invalid.

- t[1] = 'C' (uppercase):

- a[1] != 'c' ? Yes

- b[1] != 'c' ? Yes

- c[1] == 'c' ? No

So, valid.

Similarly, for position 2:

- a[2] = 'a'

- b[2] = 'b'

- c[2] = 'a'

Same as position 1.

So, t[2] can be 'C' (uppercase), similar to t[1].

So, t = "CC" would make:

- a matches t: a[1] != 'c' (since t[1] = 'C'), which is 'a' != 'c' → matches

- a[2] != 'c', 'a' != 'c' → matches

- b matches t: b[1] != 'c', 'b' != 'c' → matches

- b[2] != 'c', 'b' != 'c' → matches

- c does not match t: c[1] == 'c' (since t[1] = 'C'), 'a' != 'c' → matches

Wait, c[1] == 'a', which is not equal to 'c', so c does not match t at position 1.

Wait, but according to the template t = "CC", for position 1:

- t[1] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[1] == 'a'

- The condition for c is: if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i], which is 'c'.

- But c[1] = 'a' != 'c', so c does not match t at position 1.

So, t = "CC" seems to satisfy the conditions.

But according to the problem's output, the answer is "NO" for this test case.

Wait, that's confusing. According to my reasoning, t = "CC" should work, but the problem's output is "NO". So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that c does not match the template in at least one position, but in my t = "CC", c does not match at position 1, which should be sufficient.

But according to the problem's output, it's "NO", so maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that c does not match the template in at least one position, but a and b match the template in all positions.

But in my t = "CC", a and b match in both positions, and c does not match in position 1.

So, why is the answer "NO"?

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that for c, there is at least one position where it does not match, but for a and b, they must match in all positions.

But in t = "CC", a and b match in both positions, and c does not match in position 1, which should be acceptable.

Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's requirements.

Wait, perhaps the template must be such that c does not match in at least one position, and a and b match in all positions.

But in my t = "CC", that seems to satisfy that.

Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in t = "CC", c does not match in position 1, but matches in position 2.

Wait, in t = "CC":

- For position 2:

- t[2] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[2] = 'a' == 'c'? No, 'a' != 'c', so c does not match at position 2 as well.

Wait, no. According to the template t = "CC":

- For position 2:

- t[2] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[2] = 'a'

- The condition for c is: if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i], which is 'c'.

- But c[2] = 'a' != 'c', so c does not match at position 2.

So, c does not match t in position 2.

But the problem's output is "NO", which contradicts my conclusion.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check again.

Given a = "aa", b = "bb", c = "aa"

Proposed t = "CC"

Check a matches t:

- t[1] = 'C' → a[1] != 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → matches

- t[2] = 'C' → a[2] != 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → matches

Check b matches t:

- t[1] = 'C' → b[1] != 'c' → 'b' != 'c' → matches

- t[2] = 'C' → b[2] != 'c' → 'b' != 'c' → matches

Check c does not match t:

- t[1] = 'C' → c[1] == 'c' ? 'a' == 'c' ? No → does not match at position 1

- t[2] = 'C' → c[2] == 'c' ? 'a' == 'c' ? No → does not match at position 2

So, c does not match t in both positions, which should be sufficient.

But according to the problem's output, it's "NO", meaning such a template does not exist.

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem requires that c does not match t in at least one position, but a and b match t in all positions.

But in my t = "CC", a and b match in all positions, and c does not match in at least one position.

So, why is the answer "NO"?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects that c does not match t in at least one position, but matches in others.

Wait, no, the problem says that c does not match the template, which means that there exists at least one position where the condition fails.

So, in my t = "CC", c fails to match in both positions, which should be acceptable.

But according to the problem's output, it's "NO".

So, maybe my understanding of the problem is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that t must be composed of specific letters related to a, b, and c.

But the problem states that t can consist of any lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters.

So, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me look at the third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

The answer is "YES", with the template "CODEforces".

So, in this case, t = "CODEforces"

Let's check:

- For positions where t has uppercase letters:

- t[1] = 'C' (uppercase)

- a[1] = 'm' != 'c'

- b[1] = 'l' != 'c'

- c[1] = 'a' == 'c'? No, 'a' != 'c' → c matches t at position 1

Wait, but according to the template, for uppercase t[i], c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i].

Here, t[1] = 'C', so c[1] should be 'c', but c[1] = 'a' != 'c', so c does not match t at position 1.

Similarly, for other positions with uppercase letters in t.

So, in this case, c does not match t in some positions, while a and b match t in all positions.

So, the answer is "YES".

But in the second test case, even though I can find a t where c does not match in some positions, the answer is "NO". So, perhaps there's a different requirement.

Wait, perhaps the template cannot have letters that are not present in a, b, or c.

But in the first test case, t = "C" works, and 'C' is not present in a, b, or c.

So, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, maybe the template must be such that for positions where t has uppercase letters, the corresponding letter in c must be equal to the lowercase of t[i], and for lowercase t[i], c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

But in the second test case, with t = "CC", for both positions:

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[i] == 'c' ?

- c[1] = 'a' != 'c'

- c[2] = 'a' != 'c'

So, c does not match t in both positions.

But the answer is "NO", which contradicts this.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the template cannot have uppercase letters for letters that are present in a or b.

Wait, in the first test case, t = "C", a = "a", b = "b", c = "c"

- t[1] = 'C' (uppercase)

- a[1] != 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → matches

- b[1] != 'c' → 'b' != 'c' → matches

- c[1] == 'c' → 'c' == 'c' → does not match t

So, this works.

In the second test case, t = "CC", a = "aa", b = "bb", c = "aa"

- t[1] = 'C' (uppercase)

- a[1] != 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → matches

- b[1] != 'c' → 'b' != 'c' → matches

- c[1] == 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → does not match t

Similarly, t[2] = 'C' (uppercase)

- a[2] != 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → matches

- b[2] != 'c' → 'b' != 'c' → matches

- c[2] == 'c' → 'a' != 'c' → does not match t

So, in both positions, c does not match t.

But according to the problem, the answer is "NO", meaning such a template does not exist.

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem requires that c does not match t in at least one position, but a and b match t in all positions.

But in my analysis, a and b match t in all positions, and c does not match t in both positions.

So, why is the answer "NO"?

Perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

"Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not."

So, a and b match t, and c does not match t.

In my analysis for the second test case, such a template exists (t = "CC"), but the problem's output is "NO".

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem expects that c does not match t in at least one position, but matches in others.

But in my t = "CC", c does not match t in all positions.

Maybe the problem requires that c does not match t in at least one position, but matches in some positions.

But that doesn't make sense, because if c matches t in some positions and does not match in others, it still does not match the template overall.

Wait, no. The condition is that c does not match the template, which means that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

So, in my t = "CC", c does not match t in both positions, which should be sufficient.

I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that for a and b to match t, and c to not match t, there must be no conflict in the choices made for t[i].

Perhaps in the second test case, it's impossible to have such a template because a and b have different letters in some positions.

Wait, in the second test case, a = "aa", b = "bb", c = "aa"

If I choose t[i] as uppercase 'C', then:

- a[i] != 'c'

- b[i] != 'c'

- c[i] == 'c'

But c[i] = 'a' != 'c', so c does not match t.

This seems correct.

Maybe the problem's output is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the template t must be such that a and b match t, and c does not match t, but also t must be composed of letters that are present in a, b, or c.

But in the first test case, t = "C" works, and 'C' is not in a, b, or c.

So, that doesn't seem to be the case.

I'm a bit confused.

Let me consider another approach.

For each position i, I need to choose t[i] in a way that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to the lowercase of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase of t[i].

I need to find such t[i] for all positions i.

So, for each position i, I can look at a[i], b[i], and c[i], and determine what t[i] can be.

Let's define possible choices for t[i] based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

For position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], provided c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x is any letter except a[i], provided c[i] == x.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- Cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because that would require a[i] == b[i] == t[i], which is impossible since a[i] != b[i].

- So, must choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x is such that a[i] != x, b[i] != x, and c[i] == x.

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], I have to choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x is not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] == x.

In the second test case:

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

For position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a'

Since a[1] != b[1], must choose t[1] as uppercase x, where x != 'a' and x != 'b', and c[1] == x, which is x == 'a'.

But x cannot be 'a' because x != 'a'. So, no valid choice for t[1].

Similarly, for position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'b', c[2] = 'a'

Again, a[2] != b[2], so must choose t[2] as uppercase x, where x != 'a' and x != 'b', and c[2] == x, which is x == 'a'.

But x cannot be 'a', so no valid choice.

Therefore, in this test case, there is no valid template t that satisfies the conditions.

Hence, the answer is "NO", which matches the problem's output.

So, my earlier confusion was due to a mistake in understanding the constraints for positions where a[i] != b[i].

In such positions, I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, and for uppercase, I have to choose x such that x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

In the second test case, c[i] == 'a', but x cannot be 'a' because x != 'a' (from x != a[i]), so no valid x exists.

Therefore, no valid template exists, hence "NO".

So, the correct approach is:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], if c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x != a[i], provided c[i] == x.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Must choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], it's more restrictive because x has to satisfy x != a[i] and x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

In the third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's see position by position.

For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], if c[i] != a[i].

- Or choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x != a[i], and c[i] == x.

For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

Looking at the example solution, t = "CODEforces"

Let's verify:

- For positions where t has uppercase letters:

- t[1] = 'C' → a[1] != 'c' ('m' != 'c'), b[1] != 'c' ('l' != 'c'), c[1] == 'c' ('a' != 'c') → c does not match.

- t[2] = 'O' → a[2] != 'o' ('a' != 'o'), b[2] != 'o' ('u' != 'o'), c[2] == 'o' ('d' != 'o') → c does not match.

- t[3] = 'D' → a[3] != 'd' ('t' != 'd'), b[3] != 'd' ('k' != 'd'), c[3] == 'd' ('h' != 'd') → c does not match.

- t[4] = 'E' → a[4] != 'e' ('h' != 'e'), b[4] != 'e' ('c' != 'e'), c[4] == 'e' ('o' != 'e') → c does not match.

- For positions where t has lowercase letters:

- t[5] = 'f' → a[5] == 'f', b[5] == 'f', c[5] != 'f' ('c' != 'f')

- t[6] = 'o' → a[6] == 'r', b[6] == 'r', c[6] != 'o' ('o' != 'o') → wait, c[6] = 'd' != 'o'? No, c[6] = 'd' != 'o', so matches.

- t[7] = 'r' → a[7] == 'c', b[7] == 'c', c[7] != 'r' ('d' != 'r')

- t[8] = 'c' → a[8] == 'e', b[8] == 'e', c[8] != 'c' ('e' != 'c')

- t[9] = 'e' → a[9] == 's', b[9] == 's', c[9] != 'e' ('r' != 'e')

- t[10] = 's' → a[10] == 's', b[10] == 's', c[10] != 's' ('r' != 's')

Wait, but in position 5:

t[5] = 'f' (lowercase)

- a[5] == 'f'

- b[5] == 'f'

- c[5] != 'f' → 'c' != 'f' → matches

Similarly for other positions.

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], provided c[i] != a[i], which is what's happening here.

In positions where a[i] != b[i], I choose t[i] as uppercase x, where x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

But in this case, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t has uppercase letters, and c[i] != x, but in the explanation, it seems to work.

Wait, but in the example solution, t = "CODEforces"

Looking back, in positions where a[i] != b[i], t has uppercase letters, but c[i] != x, which seems contradictory to the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the conditions for c not matching t.

For c not to match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase of t[i]

So, in the example, t = "CODEforces"

For c = "adhoccoder"

Looking at position 1:

t[1] = 'C' (uppercase)

c[1] = 'a'

lowercase of 'C' is 'c'

c[1] == 'c'? 'a' != 'c' → does not match t at position 1

Similarly, position 2:

t[2] = 'O' (uppercase)

c[2] = 'd'

' d' != 'o' → does not match t at position 2

And so on.

So, in all positions where t has uppercase letters, c does not match t because c[i] != lowercase of t[i].

Similarly, in positions where t has lowercase letters, c[i] != t[i].

Therefore, c does not match t in multiple positions.

Hence, c does not match t.

So, the template t = "CODEforces" works.

But in the second test case, as I previously concluded, there is no valid template, hence "NO".

So, to summarize:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: set t[i] to lowercase a[i], provided c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: set t[i] to uppercase x, where x != a[i], and c[i] == x

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Must set t[i] to uppercase x, where x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x

So, in the second test case, for positions where a[i] != b[i], there is no x that satisfies x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x, because c[i] = 'a', but x cannot be 'a' since x != a[i] ('a').

Hence, no valid template exists, "NO"

In the third test case, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can choose x such that x != a[i], x != b[i], and c[i] == x.

For example, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] is something not equal to a[i] or b[i], then x can be set to c[i].

But in the second test case, c[i] = 'a', which conflicts with x != a[i].

Hence, no solution.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

counter = 0

for x in c:

if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

counter += 1

if no:

print('NO')



Let's analyze this.

First, it reads the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, a, b, c

- Initialize no = True

- If c == a or c == b, set no = False and print 'NO'

- Else, iterate through each character in c:

- Check if c[i] not in a[i] and c[i] not in b[i]

- If so, set no = False and print 'YES'

- If no is still True after the loop, print 'NO'

Wait, this seems overly simplified and doesn't align with the requirements.

First, checking if c == a or c == b and printing 'NO' doesn't make sense because even if c is equal to a or b, it's possible to construct a template where c does not match.

For example, in the first test case:

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

c != a and c != b, so according to the program, it would proceed to the loop.

But in reality, c == a or c == b shouldn't directly lead to 'NO'.

Wait, in the first test case, c != a and c != b, so it would go into the loop.

But in the second test case:

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

c == a, so it would print 'NO', which matches the correct answer.

But in the first test case, c != a and c != b, so it would go into the loop.

In the loop:

for x in c:

if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

counter += 1

Wait, x is c[i], and a[counter] is a[i], b[counter] is b[i]

So, it's checking if c[i] is not in a[i] and not in b[i].

But a[i] and b[i] are single characters, so
