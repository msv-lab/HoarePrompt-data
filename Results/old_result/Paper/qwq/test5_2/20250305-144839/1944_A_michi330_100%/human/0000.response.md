Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. So, it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and wants to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

I need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally to prevent Everule from reaching as many islands as possible.

First, I need to understand the graph structure. Since it's a complete graph, every island is directly connected to every other island via a bridge.

Everule starts from island 1 and can traverse any path of bridges to reach other islands. Dominater can destroy up to k bridges to limit Everule's movement.

The goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so Dominater will try to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.

I need to think about how Dominater can optimally destroy k bridges to maximize the isolation of island 1.

In graph terms, this is about disconnecting as many nodes as possible from node 1 by removing at most k edges.

In a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes. So, even if some bridges are destroyed, there might still be alternative paths.

But Dominater can strategically destroy bridges to isolate certain islands.

Let me consider the number of bridges connected to island 1. Since it's a complete graph, island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands directly.

If Dominater destroys all bridges connected to island 1, Everule can't reach any other island directly. But Dominater can only destroy up to k bridges.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can only stay on island 1. So, the number of islands Everule can visit is 1.

But if k < n-1, Dominater can only destroy some of the bridges connected to island 1, leaving at least n-1 - k bridges still connected to island 1.

In this case, Everule can still reach those islands directly connected to island 1 via undestroyed bridges.

Moreover, since the graph is complete, even if some direct bridges are destroyed, there might be alternative paths through other islands.

Wait, but in a complete graph, if there is at least one path that connects island 1 to any other island, Everule can reach it, unless Dominater destroys all bridges in all possible paths.

But in a complete graph, to isolate island 1 from another island, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges that connect island 1 to that island directly and also destroy bridges that could be used in alternative paths.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.

Let me think in terms of the number of bridges Dominater can destroy.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, completely isolating it. So, Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater can destroy k bridges connected to island 1, but there will still be n-1 - k bridges left connected to island 1, meaning Everule can reach those islands directly.

Moreover, since the graph is complete, even if some bridges are destroyed, there might be other paths via other islands.

But in a complete graph, if there is at least one path that connects island 1 to any other island without using the destroyed bridges, Everule can reach it.

However, to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, Dominater should try to cut off as many islands as possible by destroying bridges.

But in a complete graph, it's tricky because there are multiple paths.

Wait, maybe I should think about the complement graph. The complement of the destroyed bridges would be the remaining graph.

Dominater destroys up to k bridges, so the remaining graph has at least total bridges minus k bridges.

But I need to find the size of the connected component containing island 1 in the remaining graph.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me look at some examples from the problem.

First test case:

n=2, k=0

So, two islands, no bridges destroyed. Everule can reach both islands.

Output: 2

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Dominater destroys the bridge between island 1 and 2. Everule can't reach island 2.

Output: 1

Third test case:

n=4, k=1

Dominater destroys one bridge.

The problem note says that even if Dominater destroys one bridge, Everule can still reach all islands via alternative paths.

Output: 4

Fourth test case:

n=5, k=10

Since k is equal to n(n-1)/2, which is 10 for n=5, Dominater destroys all bridges.

Everule can only stay on island 1.

Output: 1

Fifth test case:

n=5, k=3

Dominater destroys 3 bridges.

The problem says the output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Sixth test case:

n=4, k=4

For n=4, total bridges are 6.

If k=4, Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

Remaining bridges are 2.

The problem says output is 1, meaning Everule can only stay on island 1.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4, k=1, output is 4.

So, with k=1, Dominater can't isolate island 1, but with k=4, Dominater can isolate island 1.

I need to find a pattern here.

Let me think about the number of bridges connected to island 1.

In a complete graph, island 1 is connected to n-1 islands directly.

If Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, Everule is isolated.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Otherwise, k < n-1, and Dominater can destroy up to k bridges connected to island 1.

But even if some bridges connected to island 1 are destroyed, there might still be paths via other islands.

In the third test case, n=4, k=1.

Dominater destroys one bridge connected to island 1.

But since the graph is complete, there are still two other paths from island 1 to the isolated island via the other islands.

Hence, Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=5, k=3.

Dominater destroys 3 bridges.

But in a complete graph with 5 islands, there are 10 bridges.

Destroying 3 bridges isn't enough to isolate island 1 from all other islands.

Hence, Everule can still reach all islands.

Only when k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Otherwise, Everule can reach all islands.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, n=4, k=4.

Total bridges are 6.

Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

According to my earlier logic, since k < n-1 is not true (n-1=3), and k=4 >=3, so Everule is isolated.

Hence, output is 1.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is k = n(n-1)/2, which is 10.

Everule is isolated.

In the fifth test case, n=5, k=3, which is less than n-1=4.

Hence, Everule can reach all islands.

So, the condition seems to be:

If k >= n-1, output is 1.

Else, output is n.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, k=1.

k >= n-1 (1 >= 1), so output is 1.

First test case, n=2, k=0.

k < n-1 (0 < 1), so output is 2.

Third test case, n=4, k=1.

k < n-1 (1 < 3), so output is 4.

Fourth test case, n=5, k=10.

k >= n-1 (10 >= 4), so output is 1.

Fifth test case, n=5, k=3.

k < n-1 (3 < 4), so output is 5.

Sixth test case, n=4, k=4.

k >= n-1 (4 >= 3), so output is 1.

This matches all the test cases.

Hence, the condition is:

If k >= n-1, output 1.

Else, output n.

This seems to be the correct approach.

So, in the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

This matches exactly with my reasoning.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
