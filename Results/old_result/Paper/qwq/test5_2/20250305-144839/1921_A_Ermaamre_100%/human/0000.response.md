Alright, I've got this problem here. It says that I'm given the coordinates of the corners of a square, in random order, and I need to find the area of the square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the inputs form such a square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should have some patterns that I can exploit to find the side length and then the area.

Given four points, I need to determine the side length of the square. Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the side length should be the same along both axes. That means the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates should be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

Wait, but in the given program, it only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and squares that to get the area. It doesn't check the y-coordinates at all. Is that okay?

Let me think about this. If the sides are parallel to the axes, then the width and height of the square should be the same, since it's a square. So, the difference in x-coordinates (width) should equal the difference in y-coordinates (height). But the program only computes the difference in x-coordinates and squares it. Is that sufficient?

Let me look at the example inputs and outputs to see if this makes sense.

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Looking at these points, the x-coordinates are 1 and 4, so max x is 4, min x is 1, dx = 4 - 1 = 3. Then area is 3*3 = 9, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-coordinates: -1 and 1, dx = 1 - (-1) = 2, area = 2*2 = 4, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-coordinates: 45 and 17, dx = 45 - 17 = 28, area = 28*28 = 784, which matches the third output.

So, in all these cases, just taking the difference in x-coordinates and squaring it gives the correct area. But is this always going to work?

Wait a minute, in a square with sides parallel to the axes, the difference in x-coordinates should be equal to the difference in y-coordinates. Otherwise, it would be a rectangle, not a square. But the problem says it's guaranteed to be a square with positive area.

Given that, perhaps the difference in x-coordinates will always equal the difference in y-coordinates, so it's sufficient to just compute one and square it.

Let me check that. Take the first test case: x-coordinates 1 and 4, difference 3. y-coordinates 2 and 5, difference 3. Yes, equal.

Second test case: x from -1 to 1, difference 2. y from -1 to 1, difference 2.

Third test case: x from 17 to 45, difference 28. y from 11 to 39, difference 28.

So, in all these cases, the differences are equal.

But is this always true for such squares? Let's think of a square where the side length is not equal in x and y directions. Wait, but the problem states that the sides are parallel to the axes, and it's a square, so the side lengths must be equal.

Hence, the difference in x-coordinates should always equal the difference in y-coordinates, given that it's a square with sides parallel to the axes.

Therefore, computing just the difference in x-coordinates, squaring it, and outputting that as the area should be correct.

The program does exactly that: it reads t test cases, for each test case, it reads four lines each containing two integers (the coordinates), extracts the x-coordinates, finds the maximum and minimum x, computes their difference, squares it, and prints it.

Since this approach seems correct based on the problem's constraints, I would say the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
