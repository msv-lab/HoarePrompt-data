Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes and he wants to build a tower using these cubes. He can perform two types of moves: either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. He can do this for a total of n moves, and we need to figure out if it's possible that after these n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

First, I need to understand the initial state. The problem says that initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. So, starting from zero cubes, Nikita will perform n moves, each move either adding or removing one cube from the top.

I need to think about how the number of cubes changes with each move. If he adds a cube, the number of cubes increases by one. If he removes a cube, the number of cubes decreases by one, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

Wait, the problem mentions that he removes exactly one cube from the top, assuming that there is at least one cube to remove. So, I need to make sure that he doesn't try to remove a cube when there are none left.

My goal is to determine, after n such moves, whether it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 3, m = 3

So, Nikita makes 3 moves, and he wants to have 3 cubes in the end.

One possible sequence:

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Add a cube: 1 -> 2

- Add a cube: 2 -> 3

This results in 3 cubes, which matches m.

Another possible sequence:

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Remove a cube: 1 -> 0

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

This results in 1 cube, which is not m.

So, in this case, it's possible to have m = 3 cubes after 3 moves.

Example 2:

n = 2, m = 4

Nikita makes 2 moves and wants to have 4 cubes.

Possible sequences:

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Add a cube: 1 -> 2

This results in 2 cubes, not 4.

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Remove a cube: 1 -> 0

This results in 0 cubes.

- Remove a cube: 0 -> can't remove, stays 0

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

This results in 1 cube.

- Remove a cube: 0 -> can't remove, stays 0

- Remove a cube: 0 -> can't remove, stays 0

This results in 0 cubes.

In none of these sequences do we reach 4 cubes. So, it's impossible.

Wait, but starting from 0 cubes, in 2 moves, the maximum number of cubes I can have is 2 (by adding twice). So, m = 4 is impossible here.

Example 3:

n = 5, m = 3

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3

This results in 3 cubes.

- Add, Add, Remove, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Also results in 3 cubes.

- Add, Remove, Add, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Again, 3 cubes.

So, it's possible.

From these examples, it seems that if n >= m and (n - m) is even, then it's possible.

Wait, in the first example, n = 3, m = 3: n - m = 0, which is even.

In the second example, n = 2, m = 4: n - m = -2, which is even, but it's impossible because n < m.

Wait, but in the third example, n = 5, m = 3: n - m = 2, which is even, and it's possible.

So, maybe the condition is that n >= m and (n - m) is even.

But wait, in the second example, n = 2, m = 4: n - m = -2, which is even, but since n < m, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the general condition is that n >= m and (n - m) is even, but only if m <= n and m >= 0.

Wait, m is given to be at least 1, according to the problem (1 <= m <= 100).

But n can be less than m, but in that case, it's impossible to have m cubes if n < m, because the maximum number of cubes you can have is n, by adding a cube in each move.

Wait, but in the third example, n = 5, m = 3: n > m, and (n - m) is even, and it's possible.

In the first example, n = 3, m = 3: n = m, and (n - m) = 0, which is even, possible.

In the second example, n = 2, m = 4: n < m, impossible, even though (n - m) is even.

So, the condition seems to be: n >= m and (n - m) is even.

Let me think of another example to verify.

Suppose n = 4, m = 2.

Is it possible?

Possible sequence:

- Add, Add, Remove, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0

This results in 0 cubes.

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2

This gives m = 2.

So, yes, possible.

Another sequence:

- Add, Remove, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0

This gives 0 cubes.

- Add, Remove, Remove, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> -1 (can't remove from 0), so invalid, stays at 0.

Wait, but in the problem, removing from 0 is not allowed; it stays at 0.

So, in this case, it's possible to have m = 2 with n = 4 moves.

Another example:

n = 1, m = 1.

Sequence:

- Add: 0 -> 1

Possible.

n = 1, m = 0.

Sequence:

- Remove: can't remove from 0, so stays at 0.

So, possible to have m = 0 with n = 1.

Wait, but according to the problem, m is at least 1, so m = 0 is not considered.

Wait, the problem says 1 <= m <= 100, so m = 0 is not allowed.

But in this case, m = 0 is possible, but since m has to be at least 1, it's not relevant.

Another example:

n = 4, m = 3.

Possible sequence:

- Add, Add, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Then, have 4 cubes, but I want 3.

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2

This gives 2 cubes.

- Add, Add, Remove, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2

Gives 2 cubes.

- Add, Remove, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2

Gives 2 cubes.

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: same as above.

Seems like I can't reach m = 3 with n = 4 moves.

Wait, but according to my earlier condition, n >= m and (n - m) even.

Here, n = 4, m = 3: n >= m and (4 - 3) = 1, which is odd. So, according to my condition, it should be impossible, which matches what I just found.

Another example:

n = 5, m = 4.

Possible sequence:

- Add, Add, Add, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Then, have 5 cubes.

- Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3

Gives 3 cubes.

- Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3

Gives 3 cubes.

- Add, Add, Remove, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Again, 3 cubes.

- Add, Remove, Add, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Still 3 cubes.

It seems like with n = 5, m = 4, I can't reach m = 4.

Wait, but according to my condition, n >= m and (n - m) even: 5 >= 4 and (5 - 4) = 1, which is odd, so it should be impossible, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n = 5, m = 3, (5 - 3) = 2, which is even, and it's possible.

So, my condition seems consistent.

But let's think about another case.

n = 3, m = 1.

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1

- Add, Remove, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1

- Add, Remove, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> -1 (invalid, stays at 0)

- Remove, Add, Add: can't remove from 0, so 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2

- Remove, Add, Remove: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0

- Remove, Remove, Add: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1

So, in some sequences, I can end up with 1 cube.

Hence, possible.

Here, n = 3, m = 1: n >= m and (3 - 1) = 2, which is even.

Another case:

n = 4, m = 0.

But m has to be at least 1, so not allowed.

Wait, but in reality, m can be 0 if n is even, because you can add and remove in pairs.

But since m >=1, it's not relevant.

Another case:

n = 3, m = 2.

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

- Add, Add, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1

- Add, Remove, Add: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1

- Add, Remove, Remove: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> -1 (invalid, stays at 0)

- Remove, Add, Add: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2

- Remove, Add, Remove: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0

- Remove, Remove, Add: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1

So, in some sequences, I can reach m = 2 with n = 3 moves.

Here, n >= m and (n - m) = 1, which is odd.

Wait, but according to my earlier condition, it should be impossible if (n - m) is odd, but in this case, it's possible.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier assumption.

So, maybe my condition is wrong.

Wait, in this case, n = 3, m = 2: n >= m and (n - m) = 1, which is odd, but it's possible to reach m = 2.

Wait, but earlier with n = 5, m = 3: (5 - 3) = 2, even, possible.

n = 4, m = 2: (4 - 2) = 2, even, possible.

n = 3, m = 1: (3 - 1) = 2, even, possible.

But n = 3, m = 2: (3 - 2) =1, odd, but possible.

Wait, maybe my condition is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Let's think in terms of the number of add and remove operations.

Let a be the number of add operations, and r be the number of remove operations.

Then, a + r = n (total moves)

And the final number of cubes is a - r, because each add increases by 1, and each remove decreases by 1.

We want a - r = m.

So, we have two equations:

a + r = n

a - r = m

Adding these two equations: 2a = n + m => a = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2r = n - m => r = (n - m)/2

Since a and r have to be non-negative integers, we must have:

a >= 0 => (n + m)/2 >= 0, which is always true since n and m are positive.

r >= 0 => (n - m)/2 >= 0 => n >= m

Also, (n + m) must be even, because a must be an integer.

Similarly, (n - m) must be even, because r must be an integer.

Wait, but in the earlier example, n = 3, m = 2: (n + m) = 5, which is odd, and (n - m) =1, which is odd.

But in this case, it's possible to reach m = 2 with n = 3 moves, as shown in the sequence.

Wait, but according to this, a = (n + m)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5, which is not an integer.

But in reality, it's possible to reach m = 2 with n = 3 moves, as shown in the sequences above.

This contradicts the condition that (n + m) must be even.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me recast the problem.

Each add operation increases the number of cubes by 1.

Each remove operation decreases the number of cubes by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

So, the sequence matters here because you can't remove more cubes than are present.

In the earlier model, where a and r are the number of add and remove operations, respectively, with a + r = n and a - r = m, it assumes that all remove operations are valid, i.e., there are enough cubes to remove.

But in reality, the order of operations matters because you can't remove more cubes than are present.

So, perhaps the condition a >= r is necessary to ensure that you don't try to remove more cubes than are present.

But in the earlier model, a - r = m, and a + r = n.

Solving these, a = (n + m)/2 and r = (n - m)/2.

For a and r to be integers, (n + m) and (n - m) must be even, meaning that n and m must be both even or both odd.

But in the example where n = 3, m = 2: n + m =5 (odd), n - m =1 (odd), which would suggest a and r are not integers, but in reality, it's possible to reach m = 2 with n = 3 moves.

This suggests that the model a - r = m is incomplete because it doesn't account for the ordering constraints of the operations.

Alternative approach:

Let's think in terms of the maximum and minimum possible number of cubes after n moves.

The maximum number of cubes is n (if all moves are adds).

The minimum number of cubes is max(0, n - m), but wait, need to think carefully.

Wait, the minimum is 0, because you can't have negative cubes.

But more precisely, the number of cubes after n moves can be as low as 0, if you manage to remove as many as possible without going below 0.

But the number of removes is limited by the number of adds that came before them.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the possible values of m for a given n.

For n =1:

Possible m: 0 (remove), 1 (add)

But m >=1, so only m=1 is allowed.

Wait, but in reality, m=0 is possible if you try to remove from an empty tower, but according to the problem, m >=1.

But in the problem, m starts from 1, so m=0 is not considered.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with n=1, m=0 is possible if you try to remove a cube from an empty tower, but in the problem, m is at least 1, so m=0 is invalid.

So, for n=1, m=1 is possible (add), m=0 is possible (remove, but m=0 is invalid as per problem constraints), so only m=1 is allowed.

Wait, but in reality, if you try to remove a cube from an empty tower, you can't, so you stay at 0, but m=0 is invalid, so only m=1 is possible.

For n=2:

Possible m:

- Add, Add: m=2

- Add, Remove: m=1

- Remove, Add: m=1

- Remove, Remove: invalid, stays at 0, which is invalid as m >=1

So, m=1 and m=2 are possible.

For n=3:

- Add, Add, Add: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove: m=2

- Add, Remove, Add: m=2

- Add, Remove, Remove: m=1

- Remove, Add, Add: m=2

- Remove, Add, Remove: m=1

- Remove, Remove, Add: m=1

So, m=1 and m=2 and m=3 are possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought m=3 is possible with n=3.

But according to the problem, in the first test case, n=3, m=3 is possible.

But according to the sequences, m=1 and m=2 and m=3 are possible.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, n=3, m=3: Yes; n=2, m=4: No; n=5, m=3: Yes.

So, perhaps the general condition is that m <= n and (n - m) is even.

Wait, in the case where n=3, m=3: n - m =0, even; m <=n.

n=2, m=4: n - m =-2, even, but n < m, so No.

n=5, m=3: n - m=2, even, and n >=m, so Yes.

In the earlier example where n=3, m=2: n - m=1, odd, but in reality, it's possible.

Wait, but according to the sequences above, m=2 is possible with n=3.

But according to the condition, n - m =1, which is odd, so it should be No, but in reality, it's Yes.

This suggests that the condition is not sufficient.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.

Let me think about the parity.

In the sequences for n=3, m=2: a=2.5, which is not integer, but in reality, it's possible.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that n >= m and m <= n and (n + m) is even.

Wait, in n=3, m=2: n + m=5, odd; n - m=1, odd.

But it's possible.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that n >= m and m >= n - m.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's that n >= m and m >= n - m >=0.

Wait, n - m >=0 implies n >=m.

And m - (n - m) = 2m - n >=0.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternative approach:

Let me consider the number of add and remove operations.

Let a be the number of add operations, r be the number of remove operations.

Then, a + r = n

And a - r = m

So, a = (n + m)/2

r = (n - m)/2

For a and r to be integers, (n + m) and (n - m) must be even, meaning that n and m must be both even or both odd.

Additionally, a and r must be non-negative.

So, a >=0 and r >=0, which implies:

(n + m)/2 >=0 and (n - m)/2 >=0

Since n and m are positive integers, (n + m)/2 >=0 is always true.

So, the condition is that n >= m and (n + m) and (n - m) are even.

Wait, but in the earlier example, n=3, m=2: n + m=5 (odd), n - m=1 (odd), which would make a and r non-integers, but in reality, it's possible to reach m=2 with n=3 moves.

This suggests that the model is incomplete.

Perhaps the condition is only that n >= m and (n - m) is even.

Wait, in the earlier example, n=3, m=2: n - m=1, which is odd, but it's possible.

Wait, maybe the condition is only that n >= m.

In the examples:

n=3, m=3: possible

n=2, m=4: impossible

n=5, m=3: possible

n=3, m=2: possible

n=4, m=2: possible

n=1, m=1: possible

n=4, m=3: impossible

Wait, but n=4, m=2: n - m=2, even, n >=m, possible.

n=4, m=3: n - m=1, odd, n >=m, but in earlier sequences, it's impossible.

Wait, but in earlier thinking, with n=4, m=3: impossible.

But according to the condition n >= m and (n - m) even: n - m=1, odd, so impossible, which matches.

Wait, but in n=3, m=2: n - m=1, odd, but possible.

This is a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the condition is that n >= m and (n + m) is even.

Wait, in n=3, m=2: n + m=5, odd, but possible.

n=5, m=3: n + m=8, even, possible.

n=4, m=2: n + m=6, even, possible.

n=4, m=3: n + m=7, odd, impossible.

Wait, but in n=3, m=2: n + m=5, odd, possible.

This is confusing.

Alternative approach:

Let me think recursively.

Let f(n, m) be True if it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

Base cases:

f(0, 0) = True (starting with 0 cubes)

But in this problem, m starts from 1, so f(0, m) for m >0 is False.

But in this problem, n >=1.

Recursive step:

f(n, m) = f(n-1, m-1) or f(n-1, m+1), but m+1 may not be allowed if m+1 > some limit.

Wait, but this seems complicated.

Alternative idea:

The number of cubes after n moves can be any integer between max(0, n - m) and n, with step 2.

Wait, in the sequences, it seems that the parity of m alternates with each pair of moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a pattern in possible m for given n.

Looking back at the problem's example:

Test case 1: n=3, m=3 → Yes

Test case 2: n=2, m=4 → No

Test case 3: n=5, m=3 → Yes

From this, it seems that n >= m and (n - m) is even is the condition.

But in my earlier example with n=3, m=2: n - m=1, odd, but it's possible, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps the condition is only n >= m and (n - m) is even when n >= m.

But in the example, n=3, m=2: n - m=1, odd, but it's possible, which suggests that the condition is not holding.

Wait, perhaps there is a different pattern.

Let me consider the possible values of m for given n.

For n=1: m=1 (add), m=0 (remove, but m >=1, so only m=1 is allowed)

For n=2: m=2 (add, add), m=1 (add, remove or remove, add), m=0 (remove, remove, but m >=1, so only m=1 and m=2 are allowed)

Wait, but m=0 is invalid, so only m=1 and m=2.

For n=3: m=3 (add, add, add), m=2 (add, add, remove or add, remove, add or remove, add, add), m=1 (add, remove, remove or remove, add, remove or remove, remove, add)

So, m=1,2,3 are possible.

For n=4: m=4 (add, add, add, add), m=3 (add, add, add, remove), m=2 (add, add, remove, remove or similar), m=1 (add, remove, remove, remove, but need to ensure not removing from empty)

So, m=1,2,3,4 are possible.

Wait, but according to the earlier thinking, with n=4, m=3: n - m=1, odd, but seems possible.

Wait, but in earlier sequences, it seems impossible to reach m=3 with n=4.

Wait, let's try:

Sequence for n=4, m=3:

- Add, Add, Add, Add: m=4

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove, Add: m=3

- Add, Remove, Add, Add: m=3

- Remove, Add, Add, Add: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove, Remove: m=2

- Add, Remove, Add, Remove: m=1

- Add, Remove, Remove, Add: m=1

- Remove, Add, Remove, Add: m=1

- Remove, Remove, Add, Add: m=2

- Remove, Remove, Remove, Add: can't remove more than available, so m=1

So, in all sequences that reach m=3, it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, it is possible.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.

Therefore, the condition is n >= m and (n - m) is even.

Wait, but n=4, m=3: n - m=1, odd, which would make (n - m) odd, but in reality, it's possible.

Wait, but in the sequences above, it is possible to reach m=3 with n=4 moves.

Wait, but according to the condition, it should be impossible, but in reality, it's possible.

This suggests that the condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition is only n >= m.

In all the sequences above, for n=4, m=1,2,3,4 are possible.

So, perhaps the condition is simply n >= m.

But in the problem's second test case, n=2, m=4: n < m, so impossible.

So, perhaps the condition is n >= m and (n - m) is even.

Wait, but in n=3, m=2: n - m=1, odd, but possible.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that n >= m and m >= n - m.

Wait, m >= n - m => m >= n - m.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternative idea:

The number of add operations a must be at least the number of remove operations r, because you can't remove more than you add.

Given that a + r = n and a - r = m, then a = (n + m)/2 and r = (n - m)/2.

For a and r to be integers, (n + m) and (n - m) must be even, meaning n and m must be both even or both odd.

Additionally, r <= a, because you can't remove more than you add.

From r = (n - m)/2 and a = (n + m)/2, the condition r <= a translates to (n - m)/2 <= (n + m)/2, which simplifies to m >=0, which is always true.

So, the only conditions are that n >= m and (n + m) and (n - m) are even.

Wait, but in the example n=3, m=2: n + m=5 (odd), n - m=1 (odd), which would make a and r non-integers, but in reality, it's possible.

This suggests that the model is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps in reality, even if (n + m) is odd, it's possible to reach m, depending on the sequence.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the provided program and see what it does.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it checks if n >= m and (n - m) is even.

In the example where n=3, m=2: n - m=1, which is odd, so it would print 'NO', but in reality, it's possible to reach m=2 with n=3 moves, as shown in the sequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem's sample input and output, for n=3, m=3: Yes; n=2, m=4: No; n=5, m=3: Yes.

In the case where n=3, m=2: according to the program, it would be No, but in reality, it's possible, so the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after performing `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding one cube to the top of the tower or removing one cube from the top.

## Approach

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with zero cubes.
2. **Moves**:
   - Adding a cube increases the number of cubes by one.
   - Removing a cube decreases the number of cubes by one, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.
3. **Conditions for Possibility**:
   - The total number of cubes `m` must be less than or equal to the number of moves `n` because you cannot have more cubes than the moves made.
   - The difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because each add and remove operation affects the cube count by one, and the sequence of operations must balance appropriately.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# To use this function, you need to call it. For example:
# func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
   - For each test case, two integers `n` and `m` are read, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to add `m` cubes.
   - **Condition 2**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired cubes is even. This is crucial because each add and remove operation changes the cube count by one, and the sequence must be such that the net effect aligns with the desired count.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print "YES" if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise print "NO".

This approach efficiently determines the possibility of achieving the desired tower configuration based on the given constraints and operations.
