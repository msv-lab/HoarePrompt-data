Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid with rows and columns, and each cell is either white ('W') or black ('B'). The operation allowed is that I can pick any two squares of the same color, and then change all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners to that color.

The goal is to determine if, after performing any number of these operations, I can make the entire grid have squares of the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B'.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all the squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero.

I need to think about what this operation allows me to do in terms of changing the grid. It seems like it's a way to propagate a color across certain regions of the grid, specifically rectangular regions.

Let me consider some simple cases to build my intuition.

**Case 1: 1x1 grid**

If the grid is just a single cell, say 'W', then it's already uniform, so the answer is "YES". Similarly, if it's 'B', the answer is "YES". No operations needed.

**Case 2: 2x1 grid**

Let's say the grid has two cells in a single row: 'W' and 'B'.

If I try to select two squares of the same color, I can only select either both 'W' or both 'B', but since they are in different positions, the rectangle between them would include both cells. So, if I select both 'W', then both cells become 'W', solving the problem. Similarly, selecting both 'B' would make both cells 'B'.

Wait, but in this case, I can choose two cells of the same color only if there are at least two cells of that color. But in some grids, there might be only one 'W' and the rest 'B', or vice versa.

Wait, no, in a 2x1 grid, there are only two cells. So, if they are different, I can choose two cells of the same color only if there are at least two of that color. But in a 2x1 grid, if they are different, I can choose both 'W' or both 'B', depending on which has at least two cells. Wait, but in 2x1, if they are different, I can't select two cells of the same color unless there are at least two of that color.

Wait, no, in 2x1, if one is 'W' and the other is 'B', I cannot select two cells of the same color because there is only one 'W' and one 'B'. So, I cannot perform any operation, and the grid remains as is, which is not uniform. So, in this case, the answer should be "NO".

But according to the sample input, there is a 2x1 grid with 'W' and 'B', and the output is "NO", which matches this.

**Case 3: 1x2 grid**

Similar to the above, if I have two cells in a row, say 'W' and 'B', same logic applies. I cannot perform any operations to make them the same color, so "NO".

**Case 4: 2x2 grid with all 'B'**

If all cells are already 'B', then it's already uniform, so "YES".

**Case 5: 3x4 grid with alternating 'B' and 'W'**

Like 'BWBW' in each row, alternating patterns. I need to see if I can make all cells the same color.

In this case, it's possible to make all cells 'W' or all 'B' by selecting appropriate rectangles and performing operations.

Looking at the sample input, there is a 3x4 grid like this, and the output is "YES", so it's possible.

**Case 6: 4x2 grid with two rows of 'B' and two rows of 'W'**

Like:

BB

BB

WW

WW

Is it possible to make all cells the same color?

Well, if I select two 'B' cells from the first two rows, I can make a larger rectangle of 'B's, but the 'W's remain. Similarly, selecting 'W' cells from the last two rows can make them all 'W's, but the 'B's are still there.

Wait, but if I select a 'B' cell and a 'W' cell, they are different colors, so I can't perform an operation on them. I can only select two cells of the same color.

So, in this case, I can perform operations within the 'B' cells and within the 'W' cells, but I can't change the overall grid to be all 'B' or all 'W'. So, the answer should be "NO".

Looking at the sample input, there is a 4x2 grid like this, and the output is "NO", which matches.

**Case 7: 4x4 grid with mixed 'W' and 'B'**

Like:

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

In this case, it's possible to perform operations to make all cells 'B' or 'W'.

According to the sample input, the output is "YES".

**Case 8: 1x5 grid with 'WBBWB'**

In this case, it's not possible to make all cells the same color, so the output is "NO".

From these cases, I need to find a general approach to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Let me think about the properties of the operation.

When I select two cells of the same color and set the rectangle between them to that color, I'm essentially propagating that color across the rectangle.

This operation allows me to merge regions of the same color into larger rectangles.

I need to find a way to connect all the cells into a single region of the same color.

I need to consider the connectivity of cells of the same color.

If I can find a way to connect all 'W' cells or all 'B' cells through a series of operations, then I can make the entire grid that color.

But this seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the grid as a graph, where each cell is a node, and edges connect cells that can be part of the same operation.

But that might be too time-consuming for large grids.

Another approach: think about the minimal number of operations needed to make the grid uniform.

But perhaps that's not necessary. I just need to determine if it's possible or not.

Let me consider the entire grid as being divided into regions of the same color.

If there are regions of 'W' and 'B' that are separated in such a way that I can't connect them through operations, then it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

I need to find a condition under which it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

Looking at the sample inputs, it seems that if there are 'W' and 'B' regions that are completely separated, without any overlapping or connecting paths, then it's impossible to make them uniform.

But I need a more precise condition.

Let me consider the grid's rows and columns.

If I look at the first and last rows and columns, perhaps there are some properties there that can help determine the possibility.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to check something related to the first and last rows and columns.

In the code:

- It reads the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and m (number of rows and columns).

- It reads the grid into a list 'a'.

- It constructs 'first_row' by concatenating the first column of each row.

- It constructs 'last_row' by concatenating the last column of each row.

- Then it checks if the first row of the grid has all identical characters and the last row has all identical characters, and they are different, then output "NO".

- Similarly, if 'first_row' has all identical characters and 'last_row' has all identical characters and they are different, then output "NO".

- Otherwise, output "YES".

So, the program is checking these specific conditions related to the first and last rows and columns.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about why this might be the case.

If the first row is all 'W' and the last row is all 'B', and similarly, the first column is all 'W' and the last column is all 'B', then perhaps it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

But looking at the code, it's checking if the first row is uniform, the last row is uniform, and they are different, then "NO".

Similarly, if the first column is uniform, the last column is uniform, and they are different, then "NO".

Otherwise, "YES".

Wait, in the code:

- It checks if the first row is uniform and the last row is uniform and they are different, then "NO".

- Then, it checks if the first column is uniform and the last column is uniform and they are different, then "NO".

- Otherwise, "YES".

But in the code, it seems to check both conditions together.

Wait, looking at the code again:

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking:

1. If the first and last rows are uniform but different, then "NO".

2. Else, if the first and last columns are uniform but different, then "NO".

3. Otherwise, "YES".

I need to see if this logic correctly determines whether it's possible to make the grid uniform.

Let me consider some cases.

**Case 1: All cells are already the same color.**

- First row is uniform.

- Last row is uniform.

- But a[0] == a[-1], so the first condition is not met.

- Similarly, first_column and last_column are uniform and equal, so the second condition is not met.

- Therefore, it outputs "YES", which is correct.

**Case 2: First row is all 'W', last row is all 'B', and first and last columns are uniform but different.**

- First row uniform 'W', last row uniform 'B', so first condition is "NO".

- Similarly, if first column is all 'W' and last column is all 'B', then second condition is "NO".

- So, it outputs "NO", which is correct.

**Case 3: First row is all 'W', last row is mixed 'W' and 'B'.

- First row is uniform 'W', last row is not uniform.

- So, first condition is not met.

- Check first and last columns.

- If first column is uniform and last column is uniform and different, then "NO".

- Otherwise, "YES".

- Suppose first column is all 'W', last column is all 'B', then "NO".

- If first column is all 'W', last column has some 'B's and 'W's, then not uniform, so "YES".

- If first column is all 'W', last column is all 'W', then they are the same, so "YES".

- So, it outputs "NO" only if first and last columns are uniform and different.

- But in this case, first row is all 'W', last row is mixed, so probably it's possible to make the grid uniform.

- Wait, but according to the code, if first row is uniform 'W', last row is mixed, and first column is uniform 'W', last column is uniform 'B', then it outputs "NO".

- Is that correct?

- Maybe not, because if last row is mixed, perhaps I can perform operations to make the entire grid 'W'.

- So, in this case, maybe "YES".

- But according to the code, it would output "NO" if first and last columns are uniform and different.

- So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the sample inputs and see if the code produces the correct outputs.

Looking back at the sample input:

Let's see for each test case what the code does.

- a[0] = 'W', a[-1] = 'B'

- len(set(a[0])) = 1, len(set(a[-1])) = 1, and a[0] != a[-1], so output "NO". Correct.

- So, first condition not met.

- first_row = concatenation of first columns of each row: W B B B W B

- last_row = concatenation of last columns of each row: W W W B B W

- len(set(first_row)) = 3, not uniform.

- Grid:

- a[0] = 'W', a[-1] = 'W'

- len(set(a[0])) = 1, len(set(a[-1])) = 1, and a[0] == a[-1], so first condition not met.

- first_row = concatenation of first columns of each row: W

- last_row = concatenation of last columns of each row: W

- len(set(first_row)) = 1, len(set(last_row)) = 1, and first_row == last_row, so second condition not met.

- Therefore, output "YES". Correct.

**Test Case 4: 2x2 grid**

- a[0] = 'BB', a[-1] = 'BB'

- len(set(a[0])) = 1, len(set(a[-1])) = 1, and a[0] == a[-1], so first condition not met.

- n=3, m=4

- Grid:

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

- a[0] = 'BWBW', which is not uniform.

- a[-1] = 'BWBW', which is not uniform.

- So, first condition not met.

- first_row = concatenation of first columns of each row: B W B

- last_row = concatenation of last columns of each row: W B W

- len(set(first_row)) = 2, not uniform.

- len(set(last_row)) = 2, not uniform.

- So, second condition not met.

- Therefore, output "YES". Correct.

**Test Case 6: 4x2 grid**

- n=4, m=2

- Grid:

BB

BB

WW

WW

- a[0] = 'BB', a[-1] = 'WW'

- len(set(a[0])) = 1, len(set(a[-1])) = 1, and a[0] != a[-1], so output "NO". Correct.

**Test Case 7: 4x4 grid**

- n=4, m=4

- Grid:

WWBW

BBWB

- a[0] = 'WWBW', not uniform.

- a[-1] = 'BBBB', uniform.

- So, first condition not met.

- first_row = concatenation of first columns of each row: W B W B

- last_row = concatenation of last columns of each row: W B B B

- len(set(first_row)) = 2, not uniform.

- len(set(last_row)) = 2, not uniform.

- So, second condition not met.

- Therefore, output "YES". Correct.

**Test Case 8: 1x5 grid**

- n=1, m=5

- Grid:

WBBWB

- a[0] = 'WBBWB', not uniform.

- a[-1] = 'WBBWB', not uniform.

- So, first condition not met.

- first_row = concatenation of first columns of each row: W

- last_row = concatenation of last columns of each row: B

- len(set(first_row)) = 1, len(set(last_row)) = 1, and first_row != last_row, so output "NO". Correct.

So, in all the sample inputs, the code produces the correct output.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me try to think of a case where this logic fails.

Suppose we have a grid where the first row is all 'W', the last row is all 'B', and the first column is all 'W', and the last column is all 'B'.

According to the code, it would output "NO", which is correct because there's no way to make the entire grid uniform.

Another case: first row all 'W', last row all 'W', but first column all 'W' and last column all 'B'.

In this case, the first condition is not met (since a[0] == a[-1]), and the second condition is met because first_row is all 'W' and last_row is all 'B', so output "NO".

But is this correct?

If first row is all 'W', last row is all 'W', but last column is all 'B', then perhaps there are 'B's in the grid that can't be changed to 'W's.

Wait, but if the last column is all 'B's, and the first column is all 'W's, perhaps there are 'B's that can't be changed to 'W's.

Wait, but if the first row is all 'W's and the last row is all 'W's, but the last column is all 'B's, then there must be some 'B's in the grid that are not connected to the 'W's in a way that allows them to be changed.

So, in this case, "NO" is the correct output.

Another case: first row all 'W', last row all 'W', first column all 'W', last column mixed 'W' and 'B'.

In this case, the first condition is not met, and the second condition is not met because last_row is mixed, so output "YES".

Is this correct? Probably, because even though last column has 'B's, perhaps they can be changed through operations.

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, suppose we have a grid like this:

n=3, m=3

W W W

W B W

W W W

Here, first row is all 'W', last row is all 'W', first column is all 'W', last column is all 'W', but there's a 'B' in the center.

According to the code, first row uniform 'W', last row uniform 'W', and a[0] == a[-1], so first condition not met.

first_row = W W W, len(set(first_row))=1, last_row = W W W, len(set(last_row))=1, and first_row == last_row, so second condition not met.

Therefore, output "YES".

But is it possible to make all cells 'W' in this case?

Yes, because I can select two 'W' cells that surround the 'B' cell and perform an operation to set the entire rectangle to 'W', thus changing the 'B' to 'W'.

So, in this case, "YES" is correct.

Another case: n=3, m=3

W W W

W B B

W B B

Here, first row all 'W', last row all 'B'.

a[0] = 'W W W', a[-1] = 'W B B'

len(set(a[0]))=1, len(set(a[-1]))=2, a[0] != a[-1], but since a[-1] is not uniform, the first condition is not met.

first_row = W W W, len(set(first_row))=1, last_row = W B B, len(set(last_row))=2, so second condition not met.

Therefore, output "YES".

Is this correct? Yes, because I can select the large rectangle of 'W's and perform operations to change the 'B's to 'W's.

Another case: n=2, m=2

W B

B W

Here, first row 'W B', last row 'B W'

First condition not met.

first_row = W B, len(set(first_row))=2

last_row = B W, len(set(last_row))=2

Second condition not met.

Therefore, output "YES".

But in this case, is it possible to make all cells the same color?

Let's see:

If I select (1,1) and (2,2), both 'W', then set the rectangle (1,1)-(2,2) to 'W', so the grid becomes:

W W

W W

Now, all cells are 'W'. So, "YES" is correct.

Another case: n=3, m=3

W B B

B W B

B B W

Here, first row 'W B B', last row 'B B W'

First condition not met.

first_row = W B B, len(set(first_row))=2

last_row = B B W, len(set(last_row))=2

Second condition not met.

So, output "YES".

Is this correct? Let's see:

If I select (1,1) and (3,3), both 'W', then set the rectangle (1,1)-(3,3) to 'W', so the grid becomes:

W W W

W W W

W W W

All cells 'W'. So, "YES" is correct.

Another case: n=2, m=3

W B W

B W B

Here, first row 'W B W', last row 'B W B'

First condition not met.

first_row = W B, len(set(first_row))=2

last_row = B W, len(set(last_row))=2

Second condition not met.

So, output "YES".

Is this correct? Let's see:

If I select (1,1) and (2,3), both 'W', then set the rectangle (1,1)-(2,3) to 'W', so the grid becomes:

W W W

W W W

Now, all cells 'W'. So, "YES" is correct.

Seems like the code is working correctly for these cases.

But let's think about a case where the code might output "YES" but it should be "NO".

Suppose n=3, m=3

W W W

W B B

W B B

As above, the code outputs "YES", which is correct.

Another case: n=3, m=3

W W B

W B B

W B B

Here, first row 'W W B', last row 'W B B'

First condition not met.

first_row = W W W, len(set(first_row))=1

last_row = B B B, len(set(last_row))=1

And first_row != last_row, so second condition is met, output "NO".

Is this correct? Let's see:

If first column is all 'W's, last column is all 'B's, and the grid has 'B's in the middle, perhaps it's impossible to make all cells 'W's or all 'B's.

Wait, but in this case, first row is 'W W B', last row is 'W B B', first column is 'W W W', last column is 'B B B'.

So, first row and last row are not uniform, but first column is uniform 'W', last column is uniform 'B', and they are different, so output "NO".

Is this correct? Probably, because the 'W's and 'B's are separated in such a way that I can't connect them through operations.

So, seems like the code is correct.

I need to think more carefully.

Another way to look at it is that if there are 'W' and 'B' regions that are completely separated, without any overlapping or connecting paths, then it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

The code seems to capture this by checking if the first and last rows are uniform and different, or if the first and last columns are uniform and different.

If that's the case, then it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

Otherwise, it's possible.

Looking back at the operations allowed, since I can select any two squares of the same color and set the entire rectangle between them to that color, this allows me to propagate the color across rectangular regions.

If there are regions of 'W' and 'B' that are separated by other colors, I might not be able to connect them.

But the code seems to handle this correctly based on the sample inputs and my additional test cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
