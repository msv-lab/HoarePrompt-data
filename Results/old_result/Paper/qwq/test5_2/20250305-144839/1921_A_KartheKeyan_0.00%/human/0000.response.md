Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. I need to find the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it has a positive area, which means it's not degenerate or zero-sized. The input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have to read four pairs of coordinates and compute the area of the square formed by these points.

First, I need to understand the properties of such a square. Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, that means the sides are either horizontal or vertical. So, the coordinates should have some specific patterns that I can exploit to find the side lengths and, consequently, the area.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to sort the coordinates to identify the positions of the corners. If I sort the coordinates based on their x-values, for example, the leftmost and rightmost points can be identified. Similarly, sorting by y-values can help identify the bottommost and topmost points.

Wait, actually, since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the coordinates should form a pattern where two points share the same x-coordinate and different y-coordinates for the vertical sides, and two points share the same y-coordinate and different x-coordinates for the horizontal sides.

But sorting might be a good idea to arrange the points in a way that makes it easier to calculate the side lengths.

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

If I plot these points, I can see that they form a square where the side length is the distance between (1,2) and (4,2), which is 3 units. So, the area should be 3*3=9, which matches the first output.

In the second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

These points form a square where the side length is the distance between (-1,1) and (1,1), which is 2 units. So, the area is 2*2=4, which matches the second output.

In the third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Here, the side length is the distance between (45,11) and (17,11), which is 28 units. So, the area is 28*28=784, which matches the third output.

So, the approach seems to be calculating the side length and then squaring it to get the area.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The function func() is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases based on the input value n.

Inside the loop that runs n times, it reads four coordinates and stores them in a list called coord.

Then, it sorts the coord list. Since it's a list of tuples, sorting will arrange them based on the first element of the tuple (x-coordinate), and if x-coordinates are equal, then based on the y-coordinate.

After sorting, it calculates p1 and p2, which seem to be squared distances between certain pairs of points.

Specifically, p1 is the squared distance between coord[1] and coord[0], and p2 is the squared distance between coord[3] and coord[2].

Then, it computes the area as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of p1 and p2.

Wait, that seems a bit convoluted. Let's break it down.

First, sorting the coordinates should arrange them in order of increasing x-coordinates, and for points with the same x, in order of increasing y-coordinates.

So, for example, in the first test case:

Original coordinates:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

After sorting:

1 2

1 5

4 2

4 5

So, coord[0] = (1,2)

coord[1] = (1,5)

coord[2] = (4,2)

coord[3] = (4,5)

Then, p1 is the squared distance between coord[1] and coord[0], which is ((1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2) = (0 + 9) = 9

p2 is the squared distance between coord[3] and coord[2], which is ((4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2) = (0 + 9) = 9

Then, res = abs(math.sqrt(9) * math.sqrt(9)) = abs(3 * 3) = 9, which matches the expected output.

Similarly, for the second test case:

Original coordinates:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

After sorting:

-1 -1

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

coord[0] = (-1,-1)

coord[1] = (-1,1)

coord[2] = (1,-1)

coord[3] = (1,1)

p1 = ((-1-(-1))^2 + (1 - (-1))^2) = (0 + 4) = 4

p2 = ((1-1)^2 + (1 - (-1))^2) = (0 + 4) = 4

res = abs(sqrt(4) * sqrt(4)) = abs(2 * 2) = 4

Which matches the expected output.

For the third test case:

Original coordinates:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

After sorting:

17 11

17 39

45 11

45 39

coord[0] = (17,11)

coord[1] = (17,39)

coord[2] = (45,11)

coord[3] = (45,39)

p1 = ((17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2) = (0 + 784) = 784

p2 = ((45-45)^2 + (39-11)^2) = (0 + 784) = 784

res = abs(sqrt(784) * sqrt(784)) = abs(28 * 28) = 784

Which matches the expected output.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to be working correctly.

But is this approach general enough? Let's consider if there are any edge cases that might break this logic.

Suppose the square is degenerate, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed to be a valid square with positive area, so I don't need to handle degenerate cases.

What if the square is not axis-aligned? Well, the problem states that the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, so I don't need to worry about rotated squares.

What if the points are provided in a different order? The sorting should take care of that, as it arranges them in a consistent manner.

Let me think about the sorting step. By sorting the coordinates, the first two points should have the same x-coordinate (the leftmost points), and the last two points should have the same x-coordinate (the rightmost points). Similarly, within each pair, the y-coordinates should differ.

Then, p1 is the squared distance between the top-left and bottom-left points, which should be equal to the height of the square. Similarly, p2 is the squared distance between the top-right and bottom-right points.

Then, taking the square roots of p1 and p2 gives the side lengths in those directions, and multiplying them gives the area.

Wait, but in a square, both side lengths should be equal, so multiplying them should give the area only if it's a rectangle, but since it's a square, it's redundant.

Actually, in a square, both p1 and p2 should be equal, and the area should be p1 (or p2), since they are squared side lengths.

But in the program, it's taking the square roots and then multiplying them, which effectively gives the area.

However, it's an extra step, since p1 and p2 should be equal, and either one could be used directly as the area without taking square roots and multiplying.

But it still gives the correct answer, as seen in the examples.

Is there any case where this approach would fail?

Let me consider a square where the side lengths are not equal, but that shouldn't happen because the problem guarantees that the points form a valid square.

Wait, but if for some reason the points don't form a square, but the problem says it's guaranteed, so I don't need to handle that.

Also, the problem mentions that the square has positive area, so I don't need to worry about zero-area squares.

Another thing to consider is the range of the coordinates. They can be from -1000 to 1000, so the side lengths can be up to 2000 units, and the area up to 4,000,000, which is within the integer limits in Python.

Also, the number of test cases is up to 100, which is manageable.

So, overall, the program seems correct and should work for all the test cases as per the problem's guarantee.

Therefore, the correctness is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
