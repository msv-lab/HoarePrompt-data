Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the lightest edge in the cycle is as minimal as possible. There are multiple test cases, and I need to output the lightest edge weight in the cycle along with the cycle itself for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a simple cycle is. A simple cycle doesn't repeat any vertices or edges except for the starting and ending vertex. So, it's like a loop where you don't visit any node more than once except for the starting node.

Given that the graph can have multiple components and it's not necessarily connected, I need to handle each component separately. But since the problem guarantees that there's at least one simple cycle in the graph, I don't need to worry about trees or acyclic graphs.

The input constraints are quite large: up to 10^4 test cases, with n up to 2*10^5 vertices and m up to 2*10^5 edges per test case. So, efficiency is key here. I need an algorithm that can handle these constraints within reasonable time limits.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) and look for back edges. A back edge connects a node to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree, forming a cycle. By keeping track of the path from the root of the DFS tree to the current node, I can extract the cycle when a back edge is found.

But in this problem, I need to find a cycle where the lightest edge is minimized. So, I need to find a cycle with the smallest possible minimum edge weight.

An idea comes to mind: sort the edges by their weights and process them in increasing order. For each edge, if it connects two nodes that are already in the same component, then adding this edge would create a cycle. Moreover, since I'm processing edges in increasing order of weight, the lightest edge in this cycle would be the weight of the edge I'm adding now, or possibly a smaller weight that already exists in the component.

Wait, but I need to find a cycle where the lightest edge is minimized. So, I should look for cycles that include the smallest possible edge weights.

Another approach is to use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) to keep track of connected components and detect cycles. When I add an edge that connects two nodes already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

If I sort the edges in descending order of weight and add them one by one, using DSU, then when I find an edge that connects two nodes in the same component, I can extract the cycle. Since I'm adding edges from highest to lowest weight, the cycle I find will have the lightest edge as small as possible because all heavier edges have been considered first.

Wait, no. If I sort edges in descending order and add them, and find a cycle, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the smallest edge within the cycle, which might not necessarily be the smallest possible across all cycles.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that for each edge, I can check if it's part of a cycle where it's the lightest edge in that cycle. So, for each edge, I can look for cycles that include that edge and see if it's the lightest in those cycles.

But that seems inefficient for the given constraints.

Another idea: for each connected component, find the minimum spanning tree (MST), and then in the remaining edges (those not in the MST), each of them, when added to the MST, would form a cycle. Among these cycles, I can find the one where the lightest edge is minimized.

Wait, but in the MST, the lightest edge in any cycle formed by adding an edge to the MST is the weight of the added edge, since the MST ensures that the edges included are the lightest possible without forming a cycle.

Actually, in Kruska's algorithm, when we build the MST, we sort edges in ascending order and add them unless they form a cycle. So, the edges not in the MST are those that would form cycles with the MST.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps me find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I fix a threshold for the edge weights, say W, and I keep only edges with weight at least W. Then, in this subgraph, I can look for cycles. If I can find a cycle in this subgraph, then the lightest edge in that cycle is at least W.

So, I can binary search on W, find the largest W such that there exists a cycle where all edges have weight at least W.

But the problem is to find a cycle where the lightest edge is minimized, not to maximize W.

Wait, maybe I need to rephrase that.

I need to find a cycle where the minimum edge weight in the cycle is as small as possible.

So, among all cycles, find one where the smallest edge in the cycle is minimized.

This seems different from finding a cycle where all edges are at least some threshold W.

Maybe I need to iterate through the edges in ascending order of weight and, for each edge, find if it's part of a cycle where it's the lightest edge.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, sort the edges in ascending order of weight. For each edge, consider it as the lightest edge in some cycle and check if there's a cycle containing this edge where all other edges have weight at least as large as this edge.

To do this efficiently, I can use a modified DFS or BFS to find if there's a path between the two endpoints of the edge using only edges with weight at least as large as the edge's weight, excluding the edge itself. If such a path exists, then adding the edge would form a cycle where the lightest edge is the weight of this edge.

But this might still be too slow for the given constraints.

Let me consider another approach using Union-Find with union by rank and path compression.

If I sort the edges in ascending order of weight and add them one by one, using Union-Find to keep track of connected components, when I encounter an edge that connects two nodes already in the same component, it means adding this edge would form a cycle.

In this cycle, the lightest edge would be the minimum of the edge I'm adding and the lightest edge in the current component.

Wait, no. Actually, in the component, there might already be edges with smaller weights.

Wait, I need to think carefully.

When I add an edge that connects two nodes already in the same component, the cycle formed would include this edge and the path between the two nodes in the component.

To find the lightest edge in this cycle, I need to know the lightest edge in the path between the two nodes in the component and then take the minimum between that and the weight of the current edge.

But finding the lightest edge in the path between two nodes in the component sounds complicated.

Maybe I can keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component.

Wait, but components in Union-Find are trees, specifically MSTs if I add edges in ascending order.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand their approach.

In the reference solution, they sort the edges in descending order of weight and use Union-Find to detect cycles. When they find an edge that connects two nodes in the same component, they perform a DFS to find the cycle and output it.

But I'm not sure if this guarantees that the lightest edge in the cycle is minimized.

Wait, sorting edges in descending order means we're considering heavier edges first. So, when we find a cycle with these heavier edges, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimum among the edges in the cycle.

But since we're adding heavier edges first, it's possible that there are cycles with lighter edges that we're missing.

I think this approach might not necessarily find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose we have a graph with edges:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-1: weight 3

If we sort edges in descending order: 3-1, 2-3, 1-2.

We add 3-1, then 2-3, and then 1-2 forms a cycle.

In this cycle, the lightest edge is 1.

But if we consider the cycle formed by 1-2 and 2-3, the lightest edge is 1, which is the same.

So, in this case, it works.

But let's consider another graph:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-4: weight 3

4-1: weight 4

1-3: weight 5

If we sort edges in descending order: 4-1, 3-4, 2-3, 1-2, 1-3.

We add 4-1, then 3-4, then 2-3, then 1-2 forms a cycle.

The cycle is 1-2-3-4-1, with lightest edge 1.

But there is another cycle: 1-2-3-1, with lightest edge 1.

So, again, it seems to work.

But let's consider a different graph:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-1: weight 3

4-5: weight 1

5-6: weight 2

6-4: weight 3

In this graph, there are two components: one with nodes 1,2,3 and another with nodes 4,5,6.

In the first component, the minimal lightest edge in any cycle is 1.

In the second component, the minimal lightest edge in any cycle is 1.

So, the overall minimal lightest edge is 1.

Now, if we sort all edges in descending order: 3-1, 6-4, 2-3, 5-6, 1-2, 4-5.

We add 3-1, then 6-4, then 2-3 forms a cycle with 1-2-3-1, lightest edge 1.

Similarly, adding 5-6 forms a cycle with 4-5-6-4, lightest edge 1.

So, it seems to work.

But let's consider another example:

1-2: weight 2

2-3: weight 3

3-1: weight 1

Here, the minimal lightest edge in any cycle is 1.

If we sort edges in descending order: 3-2, 2-1, 1-3.

We add 3-2, then 2-1, then 1-3 forms a cycle.

In this cycle, the lightest edge is 1, which is correct.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Wait, but I need to understand why.

When we sort edges in descending order and add them, and find a cycle when we add an edge that connects two nodes already in the same component, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimum of the edge we're adding and the lightest edge already present in the component.

Wait, no. Actually, in the component, there might be edges with smaller weights.

Wait, in the Union-Find, when we union two sets, we merge them into one component.

But in this approach, they sort edges in descending order and add them, and when they find a cycle, they perform a DFS to find the cycle.

But I'm not entirely sure if this guarantees that the lightest edge in the cycle is minimized.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps since we're sorting edges in descending order and finding cycles with heavier edges first, and then among those cycles, the lightest edge is determined by the minimum in the cycle.

But I'm still not fully convinced.

Let me consider that in the Union-Find, when we add edges in descending order, the components formed are such that any cycle found would have its lightest edge being the minimum of the edge being added and the lightest edge in the component.

But I need to confirm if this indeed finds the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the minimal lightest edge across all cycles is equal to the minimal edge weight in the graph.

Wait, no. That's not necessarily true.

Consider a graph where all edges have different weights.

The minimal edge weight might not be part of any cycle.

Wait, but in a connected graph with all edges having unique weights, the minimal edge is part of all cycles.

Wait, no. In a tree, there are no cycles, so the minimal edge is not part of any cycle.

But in this problem, the graph has at least one cycle.

So, in a graph with cycles, the minimal edge might be part of a cycle, but not necessarily.

Wait, in any cycle, the lightest edge in the cycle could be greater than the global minimal edge if the global minimal edge is not part of that cycle.

So, I need to ensure that I find a cycle where the lightest edge is as small as possible.

I think the approach in the reference solution might not always find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Let me consider a counterexample.

Suppose we have a graph with edges:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-4: weight 3

4-2: weight 4

1-3: weight 5

In this graph, there are two cycles:

1-2-3-1 with lightest edge 1

2-3-4-2 with lightest edge 2

So, the minimal lightest edge among all cycles is 1.

Now, if we sort edges in descending order: 4-2, 3-4, 2-3, 1-3, 1-2.

We add 4-2, then 3-4, forming a component with nodes 2,3,4.

Then, we add 2-3, which connects nodes already in the same component, forming the cycle 2-3-4-2 with lightest edge 2.

Then, we add 1-3, connecting nodes 1 and 3, which are in different components.

Finally, we add 1-2, connecting nodes 1 and 2, which are now in the same component, forming the cycle 1-2-3-4-1 with lightest edge 1.

So, in this case, the reference solution would find the cycle with lightest edge 1, which is correct.

But let's consider another graph:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-1: weight 3

4-5: weight 1

5-6: weight 2

6-4: weight 3

In this graph, there are two components, each forming a cycle with lightest edge 1.

So, the minimal lightest edge is 1.

The reference solution would sort all edges in descending order: 3-1, 6-4, 2-3, 5-6, 1-2, 4-5.

Add 3-1, then 6-4, then 2-3 forms a cycle with lightest edge 1, which is correct.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Suppose we have a graph with edges:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-4: weight 3

4-1: weight 4

1-3: weight 5

In this graph, there are two cycles:

1-2-3-4-1 with lightest edge 1

1-2-3-1 with lightest edge 1

So, the minimal lightest edge is 1.

If we sort edges in descending order: 4-1, 3-4, 2-3, 1-2, 1-3.

Add 4-1, then 3-4, then 2-3 forms a cycle with lightest edge 1.

So, it works.

Another graph:

1-2: weight 2

2-3: weight 3

3-1: weight 1

Here, the cycles are:

1-2-3-1 with lightest edge 1

If we sort edges in descending order: 3-2, 2-1, 1-3.

Add 3-2, then 2-1, then 1-3 forms a cycle with lightest edge 1.

So, again, it works.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong, and this approach does work.

Perhaps, by sorting edges in descending order and finding cycles, we ensure that the lightest edge in those cycles is minimized because we're forcing heavier edges to be part of the cycles first, and then when we find a cycle with a lighter edge, it would update the minimal lightest edge found so far.

Wait, but I need to confirm this.

In the reference solution, they keep track of the minimal edge in each component using DSU.

Specifically, they maintain a min_edge array that stores the minimal edge weight in each component.

When they find an edge that connects two nodes in the same component, they perform a union and update the min_edge of the resulting component.

Then, they keep track of the minimal min_edge found across all such cycles.

Finally, they perform a DFS to find the cycle that corresponds to this minimal lightest edge.

I think this approach ensures that the lightest edge in the cycle is minimized because they are considering cycles formed by adding edges that connect nodes already in the same component, and they keep track of the minimal edge in those components.

So, when they find such a cycle, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimal edge in the component, which they have tracked.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

Additionally, the DFS is used to reconstruct the cycle once the minimal lightest edge and the corresponding nodes are identified.

Hence, the reference solution appears to be correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The reference solution is correct.}} \]
