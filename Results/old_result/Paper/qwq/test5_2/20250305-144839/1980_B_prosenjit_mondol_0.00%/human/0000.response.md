Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f (indexed from 1 to n). He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it might be either way, depending on how the cubes are arranged when sorted.

Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand what determines whether the favorite cube is removed or not. The favorite cube is removed if, after sorting in non-increasing order, it lies within the first k positions.

But since sorting is in non-increasing order, the first k cubes are the largest k cubes. So, if the favorite cube's value is among the top k largest values, it will be removed. However, there's a catch: if there are multiple cubes with the same value, their relative order is unspecified.

So, I need to consider the value of the favorite cube and see where it stands in the sorted list.

Let me consider the extreme cases:

1. If the favorite cube has a value higher than the k-th largest value, it will always be in the first k and thus always removed.

2. If the favorite cube has a value lower than the k-th largest value, it will never be in the first k and thus never removed.

3. If the favorite cube has the same value as the k-th largest value, then it depends on its position relative to other cubes with the same value.

In the third case, since cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube might be in the first k or might not, depending on how they are arranged.

So, I need to find out:

- What is the value of the favorite cube?

- What is the k-th largest value in the array?

- How do these compare?

Based on this comparison, I can decide whether the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it might be either way.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I need to read the input: the number of test cases t, then for each test case, read n, f, k, and the array a.

I need to note that f is 1-based index, so I should convert it to 0-based for programming convenience.

Then, I need to sort the array in non-increasing order. Since Python sorts in ascending order by default, I can sort the array in descending order.

After sorting, the first k elements are the largest k elements.

Now, I need to see where the favorite cube's value falls in this sorted list.

But wait, since the sorted order for equal elements is unspecified, I need to handle that carefully.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in non-increasing order. Then, the k-th position (0-based) is a[k].

If a[k] > x, where x is the favorite cube's value, then x is definitely not in the first k, so it's not removed.

If a[k] < x, then x is definitely in the first k, so it's removed.

If a[k] == x, then it depends on the relative positions of other cubes with value x.

If there are multiple cubes with value x, and k is such that some are in the first k and some are not, then it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not, depending on the arrangement.

Wait, but in Python, when sorting, if two elements are equal, their relative order is preserved unless specified otherwise.

But in this problem, it's stated that if two cubes have the same value, they can go in any order.

So, in the sorted array, the positions of equal elements are arbitrary.

Therefore, if the k-th largest value is equal to x, and there are multiple cubes with value x, then the favorite cube might be in the first k or might not, depending on how the equal elements are ordered.

Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

But wait, I need to be careful.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

After sorting in non-increasing order, it could be [4,3,3,3,2] or [4,3,3,2,3], etc.

If it's [4,3,3,3,2], then the first 2 cubes are 4 and 3. The favorite cube, which is at index 2 (1-based, so index 1 in 0-based), has value 3, which is in the first 2, so it's removed.

If it's [4,3,3,2,3], then the first 2 cubes are 4 and 3. The favorite cube is at position 3 in the sorted array (value 3), which is in the first 2, so it's removed.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "MAYBE".

Hmm, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a=[4,3,3,2,3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k=2 , the following could have happened:

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will be removed.

Wait, in both cases, it's removed.

But in the sample input, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the favorite cube could be in any position among the equal values.

Wait, maybe I need to count how many cubes have value greater than x, equal to x, etc.

Let me think differently.

Let me count how many cubes have value greater than x.

If the number of cubes with value greater than x is more than or equal to k, then the favorite cube is not in the first k, so not removed.

If the number of cubes with value greater than x is less than k, then the favorite cube might be in the first k, depending on how many have value x.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the minimal possible position of the favorite cube and the maximal possible position.

Given that cubes with value greater than x must be before those with value x, and cubes with value less than x must be after those with value x.

Among cubes with value x, their order is arbitrary.

So, to find the minimal position of the favorite cube, it would be the position right after the last cube with value greater than x.

Similarly, the maximal position would be before the first cube with value less than x.

Wait, more precisely:

Let me sort the array.

The number of cubes with value greater than x is, say, m.

Then, the positions of cubes with value x can range from m+1 to m+p, where p is the number of cubes with value x.

Then, the favorite cube can be in any of these positions.

Now, if k <= m, then the first k cubes are all with value greater than x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

If k > m, then some or all of the cubes with value x are in the first k.

Specifically, the number of cubes with value x in the first k is max(0, k - m).

Since the positions of cubes with value x are arbitrary, the favorite cube could be in any of these positions.

Therefore, if k > m + p - 1, then the favorite cube is always in the first k.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the rank of the favorite cube.

The rank of a cube is its position in the sorted list.

In non-increasing order, the cube with the highest value has rank 1, the next has rank 2, and so on.

If two cubes have the same value, their ranks can be in any order.

So, for the favorite cube, its possible ranks are the positions where its value is in the sorted list.

Let me sort the array in non-increasing order.

Then, find all positions where the value is x.

The favorite cube can be in any of these positions.

Then, if all these positions are <= k, then the favorite cube is always removed.

If none of these positions are <= k, then it's never removed.

If some of these positions are <= k and some are not, then it's "MAYBE".

So, to implement this:

- Sort the array in non-increasing order.

- Find all positions where the value is x.

- See if all these positions are <= k.

- If yes, print "YES".

- If none of them are <= k, print "NO".

- Else, print "MAYBE".

Wait, but positions are 1-based or 0-based?

In the sorted array, positions are from 1 to n.

So, positions <=k are removed.

Given that, I can sort the array in descending order, find all positions where the value is x, and see if all such positions are <=k, none are <=k, or some are and some are not.

But, since the sorted array is in descending order, position 1 is the largest, position 2 is next largest, and so on.

So, in the sorted array, positions 1 to k are removed.

I need to see if the favorite cube is in positions 1 to k in the sorted array.

Given that, and that among the sorted array, the positions of cubes with value x are arbitrary, I need to find the possible range of positions where the favorite cube can be.

Let me think in terms of the number of cubes with value greater than x.

Let m be the number of cubes with value > x.

Then, in the sorted array, these m cubes will be in positions 1 to m.

The cubes with value x can be in positions m+1 to m+p, where p is the number of cubes with value x.

Similarly, cubes with value < x are in positions m+p+1 to n.

Now, since the positions of cubes with value x are arbitrary, the favorite cube can be in any of the positions from m+1 to m+p.

So, if m+p <=k, then all positions from m+1 to m+p are <=k, so the favorite cube is always removed.

If m >=k, then positions 1 to k are all with value > x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

If m <k <m+p, then some positions with value x are in the first k, and some are not, so it's "MAYBE".

Therefore, this seems like a correct approach.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read n, f, k and the array a.

Convert f to 0-based: f -=1

Get x = a[f]

Count m = number of cubes with value > x

Count p = number of cubes with value == x

Then:

if m >=k:

print("NO")

elif m + p <=k:

print("YES")

else:

print("MAYBE")

This seems correct.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought of sorting the array and seeing a[k] compared to x.

But this seems simpler.

Let me see.

If m >=k, then the first k positions are all with value >x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

If m + p <=k, then the first k positions include all cubes with value >x and all with value ==x, so the favorite cube is always removed.

If m <k <m+p, then some cubes with value ==x are in the first k, and some are not, so it's "MAYBE".

Yes, this seems correct.

Let me test it with the first sample input.

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

x = a[1] =3

m = number of cubes with value >3: only 4, so m=1

p = number of cubes with value ==3: 3

Since m=1 < k=2 < m+p=4, it's "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

x = a[4] =5

m = number of cubes with value >5: none, m=0

p=1

k=3

m=0 < k=3 < m+p=1: wait, 0 <3 <1? No, 0 <1 is not true, so m +p <=k: 1 <=3, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

x=a[4]=3

m=number of cubes with value >3: 5 and 4, m=2

k=2

m=2 >=k=2, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample input:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

x=a[4]=3

m=number of cubes with value >3: 5 and 4, m=2

p=1 (only one 3)

k=5

m+p=3 <=k=5, so "YES"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

x=a[4]=5

m=number of cubes with value >5: none, m=0

p=1

k=4

m+p=1 <=k=4, so "YES"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

x=a[4]=5

m=number of cubes with value >5: none, m=0

p=1

k=5

m+p=1 <=k=5, "YES"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

x=a[4]=3

m=number of cubes with value >3: none, m=0

p=2 (two 3's)

k=3

m=0 <k=3 <m+p=2: wait, 0 <3 <2? No, 0 <2 is true, so "MAYBE"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

x=a[0]=1

m=number of cubes with value >1: none, m=0

p=10

k=1

m=0 <k=1 <m+p=10, so "MAYBE"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

x=a[0]=42

m=0 (no value >42)

p=1

k=1

m+p=1 <=k=1, "YES"

Matches sample output.

Another sample input:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

x=a[1]=2

m=number of cubes with value >2: none, m=0

p=4 (four 2's)

k=3

m=0 <k=3 <m+p=4, "MAYBE"

Wait, but sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in this case, m=0, p=4, k=3

m +p =4 >k=3, but m +p -1=3 <=k=3, wait, I need to think again.

Wait, in this case, m=0, p=4, k=3

So, positions of cubes with value ==x=2 are positions 1 to 4 in the sorted array.

Since k=3, positions 1 to 3 are removed.

So, the favorite cube, which can be in any of positions 1 to 4, might be in positions 1 to 3 or in position 4.

So, it might be removed or not, so "MAYBE"

But the sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, let's see.

n=5, f=2, k=3

a=[2,2,1,1,2]

x=a[1]=2

m=0 (no value >2)

p=4 (four 2's)

k=3

So, in the sorted array in descending order: [2,2,2,2,1]

The first k=3 positions are [2,2,2]

The favorite cube is one of the four 2's, so it's definitely in the first three, so "YES"

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, m=0 <k=3 <m+p=4, so "MAYBE"

But in this specific case, since m=0 and k=3, and p=4, m +p -1=3 >=k=3, so it should be "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my logic.

Let me think again.

If m +p -1 >=k, then the favorite cube could be in positions from m+1 to m+p, which is 1 to 4.

And k=3, so positions 1 to 3 are removed.

Since the favorite cube can be in position 4, which is not removed, but also in positions 1 to 3, which are removed, so it's "MAYBE"

But the sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal and maximal possible positions of the favorite cube.

The minimal position is m+1=1, maximal is m+p=4.

So, the favorite cube can be in positions 1 to 4.

If k >= m+1 and k < m+p, then it's "MAYBE"

Else if k >= m+p, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in this specific case, m=0, p=4, k=3

So, positions 1 to 4 are cubes with value 2, and k=3.

So, positions 1 to 3 are removed, and the favorite cube can be in any of positions 1 to 4.

So, it could be removed or not, hence "MAYBE"

But the sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Let me check the sample input and output again.

Looking back, the 12th test case is:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Output: NO

But the one before that is:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

Output: YES

Wait, perhaps I need to think again.

Let me consider the general case.

Let me count the number of cubes with value > x, which is m.

Then, the number of cubes with value ==x is p.

Then, in the sorted array, the positions of cubes with value ==x are from m+1 to m+p.

Now, if k <=m, then the first k positions are all with value >x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

If k > m +p -1, then the favorite cube is always in the first k.

Wait, in the earlier case, m=0, p=4, k=3

m +p -1=3

k=3 <= m +p -1=3, so it's "MAYBE"

But according to the sample output, it's "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps if k >= m+1, then the favorite cube could be in the first k.

If k >= m+1 and k < m+p, then "MAYBE"

If k >= m+p, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

In the above case, m=0, p=4, k=3

m+1=1, m+p=4

k=3 >= m+1=1 and k < m+p=4, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if k >= m+1, then at least one cube with value ==x is in the first k.

If k >= m+1, and m +p >k, then "MAYBE"

Else if k >= m+p, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal and maximal possible positions of the favorite cube.

The minimal position is m+1, maximal is m+p.

If m+p <=k, then "YES"

Else if m+1 >k, then "NO"

Else, "MAYBE"

In the above case, m=0, p=4, k=3

m+p=4 >k=3, and m+1=1 <=k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p -1 >=k, then "MAYBE"

Else if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

In the above case, m +p -1=3 >=k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p -1 >=k, then "MAYBE"

Else if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

But in this case, m +p -1=3 >=k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the condition.

Perhaps if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Else if m <k, then "MAYBE"

Else, "NO"

In this case, m=0 <k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m <k and m +p >k, then "MAYBE"

Else if m >=k, "NO"

Else, "YES"

In this case, m=0 <k=3 and m +p=4 >k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Hmm, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the actual positions.

In the array [2,2,1,1,2], sorted in descending order: [2,2,2,2,1]

The favorite cube is at index 1 (1-based), which is the second 2.

In the sorted array, positions are:

1: 2

2: 2

3: 2

4: 2

5:1

So, the favorite cube is at position 2 in the sorted array, which is <=k=3, so it's removed.

But in the explanation earlier, it was said that it's "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could be in position 4, which is >k=3, so not removed.

But in reality, in this specific sorted array, it's in position 2, which is removed.

Wait, but the problem says that for cubes with the same value, their order is arbitrary.

So, in the sorted array, the four 2's can be in any order among themselves.

So, the favorite cube could be in any of the four positions where value is 2.

So, if it's in positions 1 to 3, it's removed; if in position 4, it's not removed.

Hence, it's "MAYBE"

But the sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order."

"Then he removed the first k cubes."

"For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a=[4,3,3,2,3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k=2 , the following could have happened:

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,2,3], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will be removed."

Wait, in both cases, the favorite cube is removed.

Hence, the output should be "YES"

But according to my earlier logic, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that even if the favorite cube could be in a position >k, but in all possible arrangements, it's still removed, then it's "YES"

Wait, but in this example, in the first arrangement, it's in position 2, which is removed; in the second arrangement, it's in position 3, which is also removed.

Hence, in all possible arrangements where the favorite cube is among the positions with value ==x, it's always in the first k.

Hence, "YES"

So, in this case, m=1 (only one 4), p=3 (three 3's), k=2

m +p -1=3 >=k=2, but in this specific case, m +p =4 >k=2, but according to the earlier logic, it's "MAYBE"

But in reality, since m +p >k, but m <k, it's "MAYBE"

But in this specific case, it's "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p >k, and m <k, then it's "MAYBE"

But in this case, m=1 <k=2, and m +p=4 >k=2, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "MAYBE" in the first test case, but in the example provided in the problem, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, no, looking back, in the problem description, it says:

"For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a=[4,3,3,2,3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k=2 , the following could have happened:

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,2,3], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will be removed."

Wait, in both cases, it's removed, hence "YES"

But in the sample input, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the sample input or output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Perhaps there is a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p >k, and m <k, then it's "MAYBE"

But in the first test case, m=1, p=3, k=2

m +p=4 >k=2, and m=1 <k=2, so "MAYBE"

Else if m +p <=k, then "YES"

In this case, m +p -1=3 >=k=2, so "MAYBE"

But according to the problem's example, it's "YES"

Hence, my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p -1 >=k, and m <k, then "MAYBE"

Else if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

But in the problem's example, m +p -1=3 >=k=2, and m=1 <k=2, so "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's example or in the sample input/output.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m +p >k, then "MAYBE"

Else if m +p <=k, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

But in the problem's example, m +p=4 >k=2, so "MAYBE"

But according to the problem's example, it's "YES"

Hence, perhaps my logic is incorrect.
