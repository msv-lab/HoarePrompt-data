Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f (indexed from 1 to n). He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5 cubes, favorite is at position 2 (which is the second cube), and k=2 means he removes the first two cubes after sorting.

The values are [4, 3, 3, 2, 3].

After sorting in non-increasing order, it could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc., depending on how the same values are ordered.

In the first case, if it's [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], the favorite cube (original position 2, value 3) is in position 2 after sorting, so it gets removed.

In the second case, if it's [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], the favorite cube is in position 3, which is after the first two, so it's not removed.

Therefore, it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not, depending on the sorting order of the same values.

Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

Another example in the problem shows "YES" and "NO", which means in some cases, regardless of how the same values are ordered, the favorite cube is always removed or never removed.

So, I need to determine, based on the input, whether:

- The favorite cube is always removed ("YES")

- The favorite cube is never removed ("NO")

- It depends ("MAYBE")

First, I need to understand the positioning after sorting.

Given that sorting is in non-increasing order, cubes with higher values come first. Cubes with the same value can be in any order among themselves.

So, to find out if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see if it's among the first k cubes after sorting.

Given that, I need to find the position of the favorite cube after sorting.

But since cubes with the same value can be in any order, if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite one, their relative order is unspecified.

Therefore, the favorite cube could be anywhere among the cubes with the same value.

So, to determine if it's removed, I need to see where the group of cubes with the same value as the favorite one is located in the sorted list.

If the highest value in the list is greater than the favorite's value, those will be before the favorite's group.

Similarly, if there are cubes with lower values, they will be after the favorite's group.

So, the position of the favorite cube after sorting depends on:

- How many cubes have values greater than the favorite's value.

- How many cubes have the same value as the favorite's value.

Given that, I can calculate the possible range of positions where the favorite cube can be after sorting.

Let me think about this.

Suppose the favorite cube has value x.

Count how many cubes have value greater than x. Let's say that's cnt_gt.

Count how many cubes have value equal to x. Let's say that's cnt_eq.

Then, after sorting, the cubes with value greater than x will be before the cubes with value x.

The cubes with value x can be in any order among themselves.

So, the positions of the cubes with value x are from cnt_gt + 1 to cnt_gt + cnt_eq.

Now, if k is less than or equal to cnt_gt, then none of the cubes with value x are removed, because they start at position cnt_gt + 1.

If k is greater than cnt_gt and less than or equal to cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then some of the cubes with value x are removed.

Specifically, the first k - cnt_gt cubes with value x are removed.

Since the favorite cube could be anywhere in the cnt_eq cubes with value x, it could be among the first k - cnt_gt or not.

Therefore, in this case, it's "MAYBE".

If k is greater than or equal to cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then all cubes with value x are removed.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

If k <= cnt_gt:

- The first k cubes are those with value greater than x.

- None of the cubes with value x are removed.

- So, the favorite cube is not removed.

- Hence, "NO".

If k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq:

- The first cnt_gt cubes are those with value greater than x.

- The next k - cnt_gt cubes are those with value x.

- Since the cubes with value x can be in any order, the favorite cube could be among the first k - cnt_gt of them or not.

- Hence, "MAYBE".

If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq:

- The first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes are those with value greater than or equal to x.

- The remaining k - (cnt_gt + cnt_eq) cubes are those with value less than x.

- But since the favorite cube has value x, which is greater than or equal to x, it's among the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes, which are all removed.

- Hence, "YES".

Wait, no.

If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq:

- The first cnt_gt cubes have value greater than x.

- The next cnt_eq cubes have value equal to x.

- So, the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes have value >= x.

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then he removes the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes (those with value >= x) and some more with value less than x.

- But the favorite cube has value x, which is among the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes, so it's always removed.

- Hence, "YES".

In summary:

- If k <= cnt_gt: "NO"

- If k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Wait, no.

Wait, if k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, but cnt_gt + cnt_eq is the total number of cubes with value >= x.

So, the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes have value >= x, and the remaining cubes have value < x.

He removes the first k cubes.

If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then he removes all cubes with value >= x and some with value < x.

Therefore, the favorite cube, having value x, is always among the first cnt_gt + cnt_eq cubes, so it's always removed.

Hence, "YES".

Similarly, if k <= cnt_gt, he only removes cubes with value > x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

Hence, "NO".

If k is between cnt_gt + 1 and cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then it's "MAYBE", because the favorite cube could be in the first k or not, depending on its position among the cubes with value x.

Wait, but in the initial example, it was "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the problem statement, there are cases where it's "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE".

So, I think this logic holds.

Let me try to formalize it.

Given:

- n: number of cubes

- f: index of favorite cube (1-based)

- k: number of cubes to remove from the front after sorting in non-increasing order

- a: list of cube values

Steps:

1. Identify the value of the favorite cube: x = a[f-1] (since Python uses 0-based indexing)

2. Count the number of cubes with value > x: cnt_gt

3. Count the number of cubes with value == x: cnt_eq

4. Determine the range:

- If k <= cnt_gt: "NO" (favorite cube is not among the removed ones)

- If k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE" (depending on the order of cubes with value x)

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES" (favorite cube is always removed)

But wait, in the problem statement, there are cases where it's always "YES" or always "NO", and sometimes "MAYBE".

Looking back at the example:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

x = 3

cnt_gt = number of cubes with value > 3, which is 1 (the cube with value 4)

cnt_eq = number of cubes with value == 3, which is 3

So, cnt_gt = 1, cnt_eq = 3

k = 2

Since k > cnt_gt (2 > 1) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (2 <= 4), it's "MAYBE"

Another example:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

x = 5 (a[4] = 5)

cnt_gt = number of cubes with value > 5, which is 0

cnt_eq = number of cubes with value == 5, which is 1

k = 3

Since k > cnt_gt (3 > 0) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 <= 1): False

Wait, cnt_gt + cnt_eq = 0 + 1 = 1

k = 3 > 1, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output "YES"

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

x = 5

cnt_gt = 0

cnt_eq = 1

k = 2

Since k > cnt_gt (2 > 0) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (2 <= 1): False

So, k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq (2 > 1), hence "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "NO"

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me check the sample input again.

Wait, in this input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

So, n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

x = a[4] = 3

Wait, f=5 means a[4] = 3

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 3: 5 and 4, so cnt_gt = 2

cnt_eq: number of cubes with value == 3: 1

k = 2

So, k > cnt_gt is 2 > 2, which is False

So, k <= cnt_gt, which is 2 <= 2, which is True

Hence, "NO"

Which matches the sample output "NO"

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I had cnt_gt = number of cubes with value > x

But in this case, a[4] = 3, and values are [5,2,4,1,3]

Values > 3: 5 and 4, so cnt_gt = 2

cnt_eq = 1 (only one cube with value 3)

k = 2

Since k <= cnt_gt, "NO"

Okay, that makes sense.

Another sample input:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

x = 3

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 3: 5 and 4, cnt_gt = 2

cnt_eq = 1 (only one cube with value 3)

k = 5

Since k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq (5 > 3), "YES"

Which matches the sample output "YES"

Another sample input:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

x = 5

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 5: 0

cnt_eq: 1

k = 4

Since k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (4 > 0 and 4 <= 1): False

So, k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq (4 > 1), hence "YES"

Which matches the sample output "YES"

Another sample input:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

x = 5

cnt_gt: 0

cnt_eq: 1

k = 5 > 0 + 1, hence "YES"

Matches sample output "YES"

Another sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

x = 3

cnt_gt: 0 (no value > 3)

cnt_eq: 2 (two cubes with value 3)

k = 3

Since k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 > 0 and 3 <= 2): False

So, k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 > 2), hence "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, a = [1,2,3,1,2,3], x=3, cnt_gt=0, cnt_eq=2, k=3

Since k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 > 0 and 3 <= 2): that's 3 > 0 is True, and 3 <= 2 is False, so overall False

Then, since k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 > 2), "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the position of the favorite cube among the equal valued cubes.

Wait, but the problem says that cubes with the same value can be in any order.

So, if there are multiple cubes with value x, the favorite cube could be any of them.

So, in this case, with cnt_gt = 0, cnt_eq = 2, k = 3

Wait, but cnt_gt + cnt_eq = 2, and k = 3 > 2, so "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the favorite cube could be among the first k, but only if there are enough cubes with value > x.

Wait, but in this case, cnt_gt = 0, meaning no cubes have value > x, so the first cnt_eq cubes have value x, and the remaining have value < x.

So, the first 2 cubes have value x, and the remaining 4 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 cubes have value < x.

But k = 3, so he removes the first 3 cubes.

The first 2 have value x, and the third has value < x.

So, the favorite cube is among the first 2, which are removed.

Hence, "YES"

But the sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, n=6, f=5, k=3

a = [1,2,3,1,2,3]

So, favorite cube is at position 5, which is value 2.

Wait, a[4] = 2 (0-based indexing)

So, x = 2

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 2: 3 and 3, so cnt_gt = 2

cnt_eq: number of cubes with value == 2: 2

k = 3

So, k > cnt_gt (3 > 2) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 <= 4), which is True

Hence, "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output "MAYBE"

So, in this case, since k is within cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "MAYBE"

Okay, that makes sense.

Another sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

n=10, f=1, k=1

a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

x = 1 (a[0] = 1)

cnt_gt = 0

cnt_eq = 10

k = 1

Since k > cnt_gt (1 > 0) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (1 <= 10), "MAYBE"

Sample output is "MAYBE"

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

n=1, f=1, k=1

a = [42]

x = 42

cnt_gt = 0

cnt_eq = 1

k = 1

Since k > cnt_gt (1 > 0) and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (1 <= 1), "MAYBE"

Sample output is "YES"

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my logic.

Wait, in this case, cnt_gt = 0, cnt_eq = 1, k = 1

According to my earlier logic, since k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Hmm.

Wait, maybe because k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, since k = 1 and cnt_gt + cnt_eq = 1, so k >= 1, hence "YES"

Wait, but in my earlier logic, if k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then "YES"

But here, k = cnt_gt + cnt_eq, which is 1 = 1, so k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, so "YES"

Perhaps I need to adjust the conditions.

Let me think again.

If k <= cnt_gt: "NO"

If cnt_gt < k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

But in the case where k == cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it should be "YES"

Because all cubes with value >= x are removed.

Wait, but in my earlier logic, if k > cnt_gt and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

But if k == cnt_gt + cnt_eq, then all cubes with value > x and those with value == x are removed.

Hence, the favorite cube is always removed.

So, perhaps I need to split it into:

- If k <= cnt_gt: "NO"

- If cnt_gt < k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Yes, that makes sense.

In the previous example:

n=1, f=1, k=1

x=42

cnt_gt=0, cnt_eq=1

k == cnt_gt + cnt_eq (1 == 0 + 1), so "YES"

Another example:

n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=2

cnt_gt=2 (cubes with value 3)

cnt_eq=2 (cubes with value 2)

k=3

cnt_gt < k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 2 < 3 < 4, so "MAYBE"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=2 (5 and 4)

cnt_eq=1 (3)

k=2

cnt_gt < k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 2 < 2 <= 3, which is False

k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 2 >= 3, which is False

Wait, according to the adjusted logic:

- If k <= cnt_gt: "NO" (2 <= 2 is True, so "NO")

- If cnt_gt < k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 2 < 2 < 3, which is False

- If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 2 >= 3, which is False

Hence, "NO"

Which matches the sample output "NO"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[4,3,2,1,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=5

k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: 5 >= 1, which is True, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output "YES"

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=4 >= 1, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output "YES"

Another example:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[3,3,2,3,2]

x=2

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 2: 3,3,3, so cnt_gt=3

cnt_eq=1 (only one cube with value 2 at position 3)

k=1

Since k <= cnt_gt (1 <= 3), "NO"

Sample output is "NO"

Wait, but in the sample input, it's "YES"

Wait, no, in the sample input, it's:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

So, n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[3,3,2,3,2]

x=2

cnt_gt: number of cubes with value > 2: three cubes with value 3

cnt_eq: one cube with value 2

k=1

Since k <= cnt_gt (1 <= 3), "NO"

But sample output is "NO"

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "NO"

Wait, in the earlier case, it was "YES"

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, the last sample input is:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Sample output: "NO"

Which matches my logic.

Wait, but earlier I had a case where n=1, k=1, output is "YES", but according to my logic, it's "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my categories.

Let me try to formalize the conditions again.

If k <= cnt_gt: "NO"

If cnt_gt < k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

In the case where k == cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "YES"

Because all cubes with value >= x are removed.

In the case where k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, again "YES", because all cubes with value >= x are removed.

So, perhaps I can combine the last two conditions:

If k >= cnt_gt + 1: "YES"

Because cnt_gt + 1 is the first cube with value == x.

If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Wait, I need to be careful.

Wait, actually, cnt_gt is the number of cubes with value > x.

cnt_eq is the number of cubes with value == x.

So, the positions of the cubes with value == x are from cnt_gt + 1 to cnt_gt + cnt_eq.

If k < cnt_gt + 1: "NO"

Because the first cnt_gt cubes have value > x, and the favorite cube is among the next cnt_eq cubes.

So, if k < cnt_gt + 1, none of the cubes with value == x are removed.

If k >= cnt_gt + 1 and k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

Because some of the cubes with value == x are removed.

If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Because all cubes with value >= x are removed.

Hence, the conditions are:

- If k < cnt_gt + 1: "NO"

- If cnt_gt + 1 <= k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

This seems consistent with the sample inputs.

Hence, I'll proceed with this logic.

Now, to implement this in code.

Given that, I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the list a of n integers.

- Determine x = a[f-1]

- Count cnt_gt: number of a_i > x

- Count cnt_eq: number of a_i == x

- Determine the category based on k, cnt_gt, cnt_eq

- Output "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" accordingly

Edge cases to consider:

- All cubes have the same value.

- Only one cube.

- k = n

- k = 0 (but k >=1 as per constraints)

- f = 1 or f = n

- x is the maximum value or the minimum value.

Let me consider some test cases.

Test case 1:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=1 (only 4 > 3)

cnt_eq=3 (three 3's)

k=2

cnt_gt +1 =2 <= k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq =4, so "MAYBE"

Test case 2:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=3

k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 >=1), so "YES"

Test case 3:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=2 (5 and 4)

cnt_eq=1

k=2

k < cnt_gt +1 (2 < 3), so "NO"

Test case 4:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[1,2,5,4,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=2 (5 and 4)

cnt_eq=1

k=5 >= 3, so "YES"

Test case 5:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=4 >=1, so "YES"

Test case 6:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[4,3,2,1,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=5 >=1, so "YES"

Test case 7:

n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=2

cnt_gt=2 (two 3's)

cnt_eq=2

k=3

cnt_gt +1=3 <= k < cnt_gt + cnt_eq=4, so "MAYBE"

Test case 8:

n=10, f=1, k=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=10

k=1 >=1, so "YES"

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, k >= cnt_gt +1 (1 >=1), which is "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when k >= cnt_gt +1 and cnt_eq >1, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, no, in the case where cnt_eq =10, k=1 >=1, so "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if k >= cnt_gt +1 and k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "MAYBE"

And only if k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "YES"

Wait, but in the earlier logic, if k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "YES"

But in this case, k=1, cnt_gt + cnt_eq=0+10=10, 1 <=10, so "MAYBE"

Wait, but according to my previous adjustment, if k >= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, perhaps it's:

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- If cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

In the case where k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "MAYBE"

Only if k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "YES"

Wait, but in the earlier example:

n=5, f=5, k=5

x=3

cnt_gt=2

cnt_eq=1

k=5 > 3, so "YES"

But in the case where n=10, f=1, k=1

x=1

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=10

k=1 <=10, so "MAYBE"

Hence, the condition should be:

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- If cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Yes, that makes sense.

Hence, in the sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

x=1

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=10

k=1

1 <=1 and 1 <=10, so "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output "MAYBE"

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

x=42

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=1

1 <=1 and 1 <=1, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, perhaps because cnt_eq=1 and k >= cnt_gt +1, so "YES"

Wait, maybe need to adjust again.

Wait, in this case, when cnt_eq=1 and k >= cnt_gt +1, it's "YES"

Because the favorite cube is the only one with value x, so it's removed if k >= cnt_gt +1

But in the case where cnt_eq >1, it's "MAYBE" when cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=6, f=5, k=3, cnt_eq=2, it's "MAYBE"

And with n=1, f=1, k=1, cnt_eq=1, it's "YES"

Hence, perhaps:

- If cnt_eq =1 and k >= cnt_gt +1: "YES"

- Else, if cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

In the case where cnt_eq=1 and k >= cnt_gt +1: "YES"

In the case where cnt_eq >1 and cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

In the case where k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

And k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

Hence, in the sample input with n=1, f=1, k=1:

cnt_eq=1 and k >= cnt_gt +1 (1 >=1), so "YES"

In the sample input with n=10, f=1, k=1:

cnt_eq=10 >1, and 1 <=10, so "MAYBE"

Another sample input:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

x=3

cnt_gt=2 (5 and 4)

cnt_eq=1

k=5 >= cnt_gt +1 (3), so "YES"

Another sample input:

2 1 1

2 1

n=2, f=1, k=1

a=[2,1]

x=2

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=1 >=1, so "YES"

Which matches sample output "YES"

Another sample input:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

n=5, f=2, k=3

a=[2,2,1,1,2]

x=2

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=4

k=3

cnt_gt +1=1 <=3 <=4, so "MAYBE"

Sample output is "MAYBE"

Hence, this seems correct.

Hence, the conditions are:

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- Else if cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq and cnt_eq >1: "MAYBE"

- Else: "YES"

Wait, but in the case where cnt_eq=1 and k >= cnt_gt +1, it's "YES"

In the case where cnt_eq >1 and cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq, it's "MAYBE"

Else, "NO"

Wait, no.

Actually, for cnt_eq=1:

- If k >= cnt_gt +1: "YES"

- Else: "NO"

For cnt_eq >1:

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- If cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- If k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "YES"

Hence, in code, I can implement it this way.

Now, to implement this in code.

I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the list a

- x = a[f-1]

- cnt_gt = number of a_i > x

- cnt_eq = number of a_i == x

- if k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- elif cnt_eq ==1 and k >= cnt_gt +1: "YES"

- elif cnt_eq >1 and cnt_gt +1 <= k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

- else: "YES"

Wait, perhaps simplify it as:

- if k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- elif k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq:

- if cnt_eq ==1: "YES"

- else: "MAYBE"

- else: "YES"

This should cover all cases.

Let me verify with the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=1

cnt_eq=3

k=2

2 <=1 +3 and 2 >1, so "MAYBE"

Sample output: "MAYBE"

Sample input 2:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=3

3 >0 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Sample input 3:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=2

cnt_eq=1

k=2

2 <2 +1, so "NO"

Sample output: "NO"

Sample input 4:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[1,2,5,4,3]

x=3

cnt_gt=2

cnt_eq=1

k=5

5 >=2 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Sample input 5:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=4

4 >=0 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Sample input 6:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[4,3,2,1,5]

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=5

5 >=0 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Sample input 7:

n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=2

cnt_gt=2

cnt_eq=2

k=3

3 <=2 +2 and 3 >2, so "MAYBE"

Sample output: "MAYBE"

Sample input 8:

n=10, f=1, k=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=10

k=1

1 <=0 +10 and 1 >0, so "MAYBE"

Sample output: "MAYBE"

Sample input 9:

1 1 1

42

x=42

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=1

1 >=0 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Sample input 10:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

x=1

cnt_gt=3 (2's)

cnt_eq=2 (1's)

k=3

3 <3 +2, so "MAYBE"

Sample output: "MAYBE"

Wait, no, in this sample input:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

x=1 (a[1]=1)

cnt_gt=3 (three 2's)

cnt_eq=2 (two 1's)

k=3

3 <=3 +2 and 3 >3, so "MAYBE"

Wait, but according to the earlier condition, if cnt_eq >1 and cnt_gt +1 <=k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq: "MAYBE"

Here, cnt_eq=2 >1, cnt_gt +1=4 <=k=3? No, 4 <=3 is False, so not "MAYBE"

Then, since k < cnt_gt +1 (3 <4), and k > cnt_gt (3 >3 is False), so "NO"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the conditions again.

Wait, in this case:

cnt_gt=3

cnt_eq=2

k=3

So, k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 <=5) and k > cnt_gt (3 >3 is False), so "NO"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if k > cnt_gt, then it's "MAYBE" if cnt_eq >1

Wait, perhaps:

- If k < cnt_gt +1: "NO"

- Elif k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq and cnt_eq >1: "MAYBE"

- Elif k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq and cnt_eq ==1: "YES"

- Else: "YES"

In this case:

k=3

cnt_gt=3

cnt_eq=2

k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq (3 <=5) and cnt_eq >1, so "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output "MAYBE"

Another sample input:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

x=5

cnt_gt=0

cnt_eq=1

k=4

4 >0 +1, so "YES"

Sample output: "YES"

Another sample input:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

x=2

cnt_gt=3

cnt_eq=1

k=1

1 <4, so "NO"

Sample output: "NO"

Hence, the conditions seem correct now.

Hence, in code, I can implement:

if k < cnt_gt +1:

print("NO")

elif k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq:

if cnt_eq ==1:

print("YES")

else:

print("MAYBE")

else:

print("YES")

This should cover all cases.

Now, to implement this in code.

I need to read t test cases, for each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the list a

- x = a[f-1]

- cnt_gt = sum(a_i > x for a_i in a)

- cnt_eq = sum(a_i == x for a_i in a)

- Apply the conditions above

Edge cases to consider:

- n=1, k=1: "YES" if cnt_eq=1, "MAYBE" if cnt_eq>1

- n=1, k=0: invalid, since k >=1

- All a_i equal: "MAYBE" if cnt_eq>1, "YES" if cnt_eq=1

- k=0: invalid, since k >=1

- k=n: "YES" if cnt_gt + cnt_eq >=1, else "NO"

- f=1 or f=n

- x is the smallest or largest value

I think this covers the necessary logic.

Hence, the program is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed after sorting the cubes in non-increasing order and removing the first k cubes. The solution involves careful analysis of the positions of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube's value.

### Approach
1. **Identify the favorite cube's value and counts:**
   - Determine the value of the favorite cube.
   - Count how many cubes have values greater than this value (`cnt_gt`).
   - Count how many cubes have values equal to this value (`cnt_eq`).

2. **Determine the removal status:**
   - If `k <= cnt_gt`, the favorite cube is not removed ("NO").
   - If `cnt_gt < k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq`, the favorite cube may or may not be removed ("MAYBE").
   - If `k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq`, the favorite cube is always removed ("YES").

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        f = int(data[idx+1])
        k = int(data[idx+2])
        idx += 3
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        x = a[f-1]
        cnt_gt = sum(1 for val in a if val > x)
        cnt_eq = sum(1 for val in a if val == x)
        if k <= cnt_gt:
            print("NO")
        elif k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq:
            if cnt_eq == 1:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("MAYBE")
        else:
            print("YES")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - Read the list of cube values `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Determine the value of the favorite cube `x`.
   - Count the number of cubes with values greater than `x` (`cnt_gt`).
   - Count the number of cubes with values equal to `x` (`cnt_eq`).

3. **Decide the Outcome:**
   - If `k <= cnt_gt`, print "NO" because the favorite cube is not among the removed ones.
   - If `cnt_gt < k <= cnt_gt + cnt_eq`, print "MAYBE" because the favorite cube might be removed depending on its position among equal valued cubes.
   - If `k > cnt_gt + cnt_eq`, print "YES" because the favorite cube is always removed.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the removal status of the favorite cube in all scenarios, considering the sorting and removal process described in the problem.
