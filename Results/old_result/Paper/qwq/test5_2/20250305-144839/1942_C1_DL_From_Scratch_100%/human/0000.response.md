Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a birthday cake in the shape of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I need to choose no more than y additional vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals, with the goal of maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake.

Wait, but in the easy version, y is always 0, according to the problem statement. So, I don't need to choose any additional vertices; I just have to work with the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

My task is to maximize the number of triangular pieces by cutting non-intersecting diagonals among these chosen vertices.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangular piece in this context. Since the cake is a polygon, and we're cutting diagonals, I suppose that by adding diagonals, we're subdividing the polygon into smaller regions, some of which are triangles.

But there's a constraint: the diagonals must be non-intersecting. That means they shouldn't cross each other inside the polygon.

I need to maximize the number of triangular regions formed by these diagonals.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I recall that in polygon triangulation, for a convex polygon with n sides, the number of triangles formed is n-2, when diagonals are drawn in a way that triangulates the polygon.

But in this problem, I'm not necessarily triangulating the entire polygon. I can have other shapes besides triangles, but I want to count only the triangular pieces.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

Wait, but the chosen vertices are only x out of n vertices. So, I need to consider only those x vertices for drawing diagonals.

I need to think about the graph formed by these x vertices and the diagonals drawn between them, keeping in mind that diagonals cannot intersect inside the polygon.

This sounds similar to dividing a polygon into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

But in this case, the polygon isn't necessarily convex, and I'm only choosing some of the vertices.

Wait, but since it's a regular polygon, it is convex.

I need to consider the subset of x vertices and see how many non-intersecting diagonals I can draw among them to maximize the number of triangles.

I think I need to find a way to triangulate the polygon formed by these x vertices.

Wait, but these x vertices may not form a convex polygon themselves. Since they are chosen arbitrarily from the regular polygon's vertices.

Wait, but in a convex polygon, any diagonals drawn between the chosen vertices will lie entirely inside the polygon without intersecting each other, as long as they don't cross.

But in this problem, since y=0, I can't choose any additional vertices. So, I have to work only with the x chosen vertices.

I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals among these x vertices.

I need to find the maximum number of such triangles.

I recall that in a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is x-2.

But in this problem, the chosen vertices may not form a convex polygon, and the diagonals cannot intersect.

Wait, but since the original polygon is convex (as it's regular), any subset of vertices will also form a convex polygon, because all points lie on the circumference of the same circle, and thus any subset will also be convex.

Wait, is that true? Actually, no. If I choose vertices that are not all on the same half of the circle, the subset may not be convex. For example, in a square, choosing alternate vertices forms a diagonal, which is a straight line, not a convex quadrilateral.

Wait, but in a regular polygon with n sides, any subset of vertices will form a convex polygon only if they are chosen in such a way that no three are collinear, which they aren't since it's a polygon.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices will form a convex polygon because all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

So, in this case, any subset of vertices will form a convex polygon.

Therefore, the subset of x vertices forms a convex polygon, and in a convex polygon, triangulation is straightforward.

In a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is x-2.

But the problem allows for not necessarily triangulating the entire polygon; some regions can remain untriangulated, but we still count only the triangular pieces.

So, the maximum number of triangles would still be x-2, achieved by full triangulation.

But the problem mentions that in the example, for n=8, x=4, y=0, the output is 2.

Wait, according to the formula x-2, for x=4, it should be 2, which matches the first example.

In the second example, n=8, x=8, y=0, the output is 6.

According to x-2, for x=8, it should be 6, which matches.

In the third example, n=4, x=2, y=0, the output is 2.

Wait, according to x-2, for x=2, it should be 0, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look back at the problem.

"the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

So, I can only draw diagonals between the chosen vertices.

And the pieces that are triangles are those regions bounded by three diagonals.

But in the third example, with x=2, how can I have 2 triangular pieces?

Wait, with x=2, I have only two vertices chosen.

In a polygon with n=4, which is a square, choosing two vertices means either choosing adjacent vertices or opposite vertices.

In a square, choosing two adjacent vertices allows drawing one diagonal, but I'm not sure how that leads to two triangular pieces.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the entire polygon is divided into regions by the diagonals, and I count only those regions that are triangles.

But in the case of x=2 in a square, choosing two adjacent vertices doesn't create any diagonal, as the line between them is an edge of the polygon, not a diagonal.

Wait, the problem says "diagonals", which are non-adjacent vertex connections.

So, in a square, choosing two adjacent vertices doesn't allow drawing any diagonal, as the only connection is an edge.

But according to the sample input, it's outputting 2, which confuses me.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Looking back, the third test case is:

4 2 0

1 3

So, n=4, x=2, y=0, and the chosen vertices are 1 and 3.

In a square, vertices are 1,2,3,4.

Choosing 1 and 3, which are opposite vertices, allows drawing a diagonal between them.

This divides the square into two triangles: one triangle consisting of vertices 1,2,3, and the other consisting of vertices 1,3,4.

So, that's two triangular pieces.

Hence, the output is 2.

So, in this case, even though x=2, I can still have two triangular pieces by drawing one diagonal.

So, my earlier assumption that the number of triangles is x-2 is incorrect, at least in this case.

Wait, for x=2, according to x-2, it would be negative, which doesn't make sense.

So, perhaps the formula is different.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to consider the number of triangles formed based on the number of chosen vertices and how they are connected.

In general, for a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is x-2.

But in this problem, I might not be triangulating the entire polygon; some regions can remain untriangulated.

However, the problem states that I can have other shapes besides triangles, but I only count the triangular pieces.

So, to maximize the number of triangular pieces, I should aim to triangulate as much as possible.

Given that, perhaps the formula x-2 still holds, but only for x >=3.

For x=2, perhaps I can't form any triangles, but in the sample input, it's giving 2.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says that for x=2 in n=4, you can have 2 triangular pieces.

Wait, but according to the formula x-2, for x=2, it's 0, which doesn't match the sample input.

So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals."

"the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

So, I can only draw diagonals between the chosen vertices.

In the case where x=2, I can draw one diagonal between the two chosen vertices, provided they are not adjacent.

In the sample input, for n=4, choosing vertices 1 and 3, which are opposite, allows drawing a diagonal between them, dividing the square into two triangles.

Hence, two triangular pieces.

So, in this case, even with x=2, I can have two triangular pieces.

Similarly, in the first sample input, with x=4, choosing vertices 1,2,5,6 in an 8-sided polygon, perhaps drawing certain diagonals can create two triangular pieces.

Wait, but according to the formula x-2, for x=4, it's 2, which matches the first sample output.

But for x=8 in the second sample, it's 8-2=6, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the formula is indeed x-2 for x >=3, but for x=2, it's 2 in the case of n=4.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with x-2.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of x=2, the number of triangular pieces is 2, regardless of n.

But that seems too specific.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the number of chosen vertices and the cycles they form.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the number of triangles that can be formed by choosing triples of chosen vertices, but that doesn't seem right, because diagonals have to be non-intersecting.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the chosen vertices in order around the polygon and count the number of triangles formed by consecutive triples.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of triangles that can be formed by selecting three consecutive chosen vertices in the cyclic order.

In the case of x=2, it's zero, but in the sample input, it's 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices on a convex polygon.

The number of triangles that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals among these vertices is equal to the number of triangles in a triangulation of the polygon formed by these x vertices.

In a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles formed by any triangulation is x-2.

Hence, the maximum number of triangular pieces is x-2.

This matches the first and second sample inputs: for x=4, it's 2; for x=8, it's 6.

But in the third sample input, x=2, and according to x-2, it would be negative, but the sample output is 2.

So, there must be an exception for small x.

Wait, perhaps x refers to the number of chosen vertices, and I need to consider that for x < 3, I can't form any triangles, but in the sample input, for x=2, it's 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps in the case of x=2, I can have two triangular pieces by drawing one diagonal, which divides the polygon into two parts, each of which is a triangle.

Wait, but only if n=4.

In n=4, choosing two opposite vertices divides the square into two triangles.

But for n >4, choosing two vertices would divide the polygon into two parts, but not necessarily into triangles.

For example, in n=8, choosing vertices 1 and 5 would divide the octagon into two parts: one part with vertices 1,2,3,4,5 and the other with vertices 1,5,6,7,8.

Neither of these parts is a triangle.

So, perhaps the formula x-2 isn't applicable here.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of ears in a polygon.

In computational geometry, an ear clipping algorithm is used to triangulate a polygon.

The number of triangles in a triangulation is always x-2 for a convex polygon with x vertices.

But in this problem, it seems that even for x=2, I can have some triangular pieces.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for x=2, in a polygon with n sides, choosing two vertices divides the polygon into two parts, each of which can be considered as a polygon with more than two sides, and then I can triangulate those.

But in the sample input, for x=2 in n=4, it's giving 2, which would be two triangles.

Wait, maybe for x=2, the number of triangular pieces is n/2, but in the sample input, n=4, output=2.

Wait, that could be a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of separate cycles formed by the chosen vertices.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, x, y.

Then it reads a list of x chosen vertices.

It sorts the list.

Then it iterates through the sorted list and calculates the differences between consecutive vertices, and counts the number of times the difference is 2 (meaning there is one vertex in between).

Wait, no, it's checking if the difference minus one is 1, meaning there is exactly one vertex in between the chosen vertices.

Then it adds up such counts.

Finally, it prints count + x - 2.

Wait, so it's computing count + x - 2.

In the sample input 1:

n=8, x=4, y=0

chosen vertices: 1,6,2,5

sorted: 1,2,5,6

differences: 2-1=1 (num=0), 5-2=3 (num=2), 6-5=1 (num=0)

and then num = 1 + 8 - 6 = 3 - 6 = -3? Wait, no.

Wait, the code is:

for i in range(x - 1):

num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1

if num == 1:

count += 1

num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1

if num == 1:

count += 1

print(count + x - 2)

So, for the first sample input:

list0 = [1,2,5,6]

n=8

Differences:

2-1-1=0 (not 1)

5-2-1=2 (not 1)

6-5-1=0 (not 1)

Then, list0[0] + n - list0[-1] -1 =1 +8 -6 -1=2-1=1, so count=1

Then, count + x -2=1 +4 -2=3, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the code is:

num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1

if num == 1:

count += 1

and

num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1

if num == 1:

count += 1

So, for list0=[1,2,5,6], n=8

Differences:

i=0: 2-1-1=0 (not 1)

i=1:5-2-1=2 (not 1)

i=2:6-5-1=0 (not 1)

Then, list0[0] + n - list0[-1] -1 =1 +8 -6 -1=2-1=1, so count=1

Then, count + x -2=1 +4 -2=3, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps it's a modulo operation.

Wait, in the cyclic nature of the polygon, the difference between vertex 1 and vertex 6 is not 5, but min(5, n-5)=min(5,3)=3.

Wait, no, in a cyclic polygon, the distance between two vertices is the minimum of |i-j| and n - |i-j|.

But in the code, it's calculating list0[i+1] - list0[i] -1, which is the number of vertices between them in one direction minus one.

But in the sample input, it's not considering the minimal distance.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the circular arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the circular order.

Let me think differently.

In a circular arrangement, the distance between two vertices is the minimum number of steps along the circle.

But in the code, it's calculating list0[i+1] - list0[i] -1, which is the number of vertices between them in one direction minus one.

But in the sample input, for [1,2,5,6], the differences are:

Between 1 and 2: 0 vertices in between

Between 2 and 5: 2 vertices in between (3 and 4)

Between 5 and 6: 0 vertices in between

Between 6 and 1: 1 vertex in between (7)

So, num=1 in this case, so count=1

Then, count + x -2=1 +4 -2=3, but sample output is 2.

So, perhaps the formula is count + floor(x/2) or something.

Wait, perhaps it's count + floor(x/2) -1.

Wait, for x=4, count=1, floor(4/2)=2, so 1+2=3, which still doesn't match the sample.

Wait, maybe it's count + floor((x-1)/2).

For x=4, floor(3/2)=1, so 1+1=2, which matches the sample.

For x=8, count=4 (since there are 4 pairs with one vertex in between), floor((8-1)/2)=3, so 4+3=7, but sample output is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's count + x - floor(x/2) -1.

For x=4, count=1, floor(4/2)=2, so 1+4-2-1=2, matches sample 1.

For x=8, count=4, floor(8/2)=4, so 4+8-4-1=7, but sample output is 6.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's count + floor((x-1)/2).

For x=4, floor(3/2)=1, count=1, total=2, matches sample 1.

For x=8, floor(7/2)=3, count=4, total=7, but sample output is 6.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's min(count, floor((x-1)/2)).

For x=4, min(1,1)=1, plus floor((x-1)/2)=1, total=2.

For x=8, min(4,3)=3, plus 3=6, matches sample 2.

For x=2, count=1, min(1, floor(1/2)=0)=0, plus 0=0, but sample output is 2.

Doesn't match.

Hmm.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices with exactly one chosen neighbor in one direction.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times there are two chosen vertices with exactly one non-chosen vertex between them.

Wait, in the first sample input, there is one such pair: between 6 and 2, with vertex 7 in between.

Similarly, between 5 and 6, there are no vertices in between.

So, count=1, and then some formula.

Wait, perhaps it's count + floor((x-1)/2).

For x=4, count=1, floor(3/2)=1, total=2.

For x=8, count=4, floor(7/2)=3, total=7, but sample is 6.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's count + floor(x/2) -1.

For x=4, count=1, floor(4/2)=2, total=1+2-1=2.

For x=8, count=4, floor(8/2)=4, total=4+4-1=7, but sample is 6.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's count + floor(x/3).

Wait, for x=4, floor(4/3)=1, total=1+1=2.

For x=8, floor(8/3)=2, total=4+2=6, matches sample 2.

For x=2, count=1, floor(2/3)=0, total=1+0=1, but sample is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's count + floor((x-2)/2).

For x=4, floor(2/2)=1, total=1+1=2.

For x=8, floor(6/2)=3, total=4+3=7, but sample is 6.

Doesn't match.

I'm getting stuck here.

Let me look back at the provided code.

It's calculating count as the number of times there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices in the circular order.

Then, it's printing count + x -2.

In the first sample input, count=1 (only between 6 and 2), x=4, so 1+4-2=3, but sample output is 2.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I miscounted.

Let's see:

Chosen vertices: 1,2,5,6

In circular order:

1 - 2: 0 vertices in between

2 - 5: 2 vertices in between (3,4)

5 - 6: 0 vertices in between

6 - 1: 1 vertex in between (7)

So, count=1

Then, count + x -2=1+4-2=3, but sample output is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps it's min(count, x-2).

For x=4, count=1, min(1,2)=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's x-2 + number of times there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices.

But in the first sample, x-2=2, plus count=1, total=3, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's x - number of chosen pairs with no vertices in between.

In the first sample, x=4, number of chosen pairs with no vertices in between: 1-2 and 5-6, so 2 such pairs.

Then, 4 - 2 =2, matches sample output.

Similarly, in the second sample, x=8, number of chosen pairs with no vertices in between: probably 4, so 8 -4=4, but sample output is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's x - number of chosen pairs with exactly one vertex in between.

In the first sample, number of pairs with exactly one vertex in between: only 6 and 2, so 1.

Then, x -1=3, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's x -2 - count.

For x=4, 4-2-1=1, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's x - number of chosen pairs with no vertices in between -1.

In the first sample, number of pairs with no vertices in between: 1-2 and 5-6, so 2.

Then, x -2 -1=1, doesn't match.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think in terms of graph theory.

The chosen vertices form a cyclic graph, since the polygon is cyclic.

I need to maximize the number of triangular faces by adding non-intersecting diagonals.

In graph theory, the number of triangles in a triangulation of a cyclic graph with x vertices is x-2.

Hence, the formula should be x-2.

But in the third sample input, x=2, x-2=0, but sample output is 2.

So, clearly, x-2 is not the correct formula here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for x < 3, the number of triangular pieces is 2*(x-1).

For x=2, it's 2, which matches the sample.

For x=1, it would be 0, which makes sense.

For x >=3, it's x-2.

But in the first sample, x=4, output should be 2, which is x-2=2.

For x=8, output is 6, which is x-2=6.

Hence, perhaps the general formula is x-2, but for x=2, it's 2.

Wait, but x-2 for x=2 would be 0, which doesn't match the sample.

So, maybe it's max(x-2, 2).

But for x=2, it's 2, for x=4, it's 2, matches first sample.

But in the second sample, x=8, it's 6, which is x-2=6.

Seems plausible.

But in the first sample, x=4, x-2=2, but according to the sample input, it's 2, which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought count + x -2=3, but sample is 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding the count.

Wait, perhaps the count is the number of places where there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices, and I need to subtract this from x-2.

Wait, perhaps it's x-2 - count.

For x=4, 2 -1=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't make sense.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of separate chains of chosen vertices.

But in the sample input, for x=2, it's 2, which would imply one chain.

Wait, perhaps it's x - number of chains -1.

In x=2, if there are two separate chains, then 2 -1 -1=0, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times three chosen vertices form a triangle.

But for x=2, it's zero, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

I need to find another approach.

Let me consider that in a convex polygon, choosing x vertices, and drawing non-intersecting diagonals among them, the number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

But in the sample input, for x=2, it's 2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the number of "ears" in the polygon.

In computational geometry, an "ear" is a triangle that can be formed by connecting three consecutive vertices, such that the triangle lies entirely inside the polygon.

But for x=2, it doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the provided code.

It's calculating the number of times there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices in the circular order, and then adding x-2.

In the first sample input, this gives 1 +4 -2=3, but sample output is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out by cutting non-intersecting diagonals among the chosen vertices of a regular polygon.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of sides of the polygon), `x` (number of chosen vertices), and `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
   - Read the list of `x` chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting and Differences Calculation**:
   - Sort the list of chosen vertices.
   - Calculate the differences between consecutive vertices to determine the number of places where there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices.

3. **Counting Triangular Pieces**:
   - For each pair of chosen vertices with exactly one vertex in between, increment the count.
   - Additionally, check the wrap-around case from the first to the last vertex.
   - The formula to compute the number of triangular pieces is `count + x - 2`.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the number of test cases and for each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting Chosen Vertices**:
   - We sort the list of chosen vertices to easily calculate the differences between consecutive vertices.

3. **Calculating Differences**:
   - We iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between consecutive vertices.
   - If the difference minus one is 1 (meaning there is exactly one vertex between them), we increment the count.
   - We also handle the wrap-around case from the last vertex to the first vertex.

4. **Computing and Printing the Result**:
   - We compute the number of triangular pieces using the formula `count + x - 2`.
   - This formula accounts for the triangular pieces formed by the chosen vertices and the non-chosen vertices in between.
   - Finally, we print the result for each test case.

### Correctness

- **Formula Explanation**:
  - The formula `count + x - 2` is derived from the observation that each pair of chosen vertices with one vertex in between contributes to forming a triangular piece.
  - Additionally, `x - 2` accounts for the triangulation of the polygon formed by the chosen vertices.
  
- **Sample Input Verification**:
  - For the first sample input (n=8, x=4, y=0 with vertices 1,6,2,5), the count is 1 and the formula gives 1 + 4 - 2 = 3, but the sample output is 2, indicating a discrepancy.
  - This suggests that the formula might need adjustment or there is a misunderstanding in the approach.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum number of triangular pieces in all cases, as evidenced by the mismatch with the sample input.
  - Therefore, the correctness of the solution is **False**.
