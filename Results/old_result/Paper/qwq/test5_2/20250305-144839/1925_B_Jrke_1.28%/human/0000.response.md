Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a problem with difficulty x, and we need to break it into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty. The sum of these sub-problems' difficulties should equal x. Now, the balance of the problemset is defined as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all the sub-problems' difficulties. I need to find the maximum possible balance that Yash can achieve by optimally choosing the difficulties of the sub-problems.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if all sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of some number d, then d is a possible balance. The goal is to make d as large as possible.

Given that, I need to distribute x into n parts, each at least 1, such that their GCD is maximized.

Let me think about this.

If I choose all sub-problems to have the same difficulty, say d, then the sum would be n*d = x. So, d = x/n. But x and n may not be such that x is divisible by n. If x is not divisible by n, then I cannot have all sub-problems with the same difficulty. In that case, I need to adjust the difficulties accordingly.

Wait, but the GCD doesn't necessarily require all sub-problems to have the same difficulty, just that they share a common divisor.

So, perhaps I can find the largest d such that d divides x and x/d >= n.

Wait, let's think about it mathematically.

Suppose the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is d. Then, each difficulty can be expressed as d*ki, where ki is an integer >=1. The sum of difficulties is d*(k1 + k2 + ... + kn) = x. So, d must divide x, and k1 + k2 + ... + kn = x/d.

Since each ki >=1, the sum k1 + k2 + ... + kn >= n. Therefore, x/d >= n, which implies d <= x/n.

So, the maximum possible d is limited by x/n.

But d must be an integer, and it must be a divisor of x.

So, to maximize d, I need to find the largest d such that d <= x/n and d divides x.

Wait, but x/n may not be an integer. So, I should take the floor of x/n, denoted as k = floor(x/n). Then, I need to find the largest d <= k such that d divides x.

In other words, among all divisors of x that are less than or equal to k, I need to choose the largest one.

That makes sense.

So, the approach is:

1. Compute k = floor(x/n).

2. Find all divisors of x that are <= k.

3. Choose the largest among them.

That should be the maximum possible balance.

Let me check this with the first example.

Example 1:

x = 10, n = 3

k = floor(10/3) = 3

Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10

Divisors <= 3: 1, 2

Largest is 2.

Indeed, the output is 2.

Example 2:

x = 5, n = 5

k = floor(5/5) = 1

Divisors of 5: 1, 5

Divisors <=1: 1

Largest is 1.

Output is 1.

Example 3:

x = 420, n = 69

k = floor(420/69) = 6

Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420

Divisors <=6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Largest is 6.

Output is 6.

Seems correct.

Now, how to implement this efficiently, especially since x can be up to 10^8 and t can be up to 10^3.

Finding all divisors of x for each test case could be time-consuming if not optimized.

I need an efficient way to find all divisors of x that are <= k, and then select the maximum one.

An efficient way to find all divisors of a number is to iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, add both i and x/i to the list of divisors, if they are distinct.

But in this problem, I don't need to list all divisors, just find the largest d <= k.

So, I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), check if i divides x, and if i <= k, keep track of the maximum i. Also, if x/i <= k, keep track of the maximum x/i.

Wait, but x/i could be less than i if i > sqrt(x), but since I'm iterating up to sqrt(x), I need to handle both i and x/i.

But I need to make sure that x/i <= k.

Wait, let's think about it.

Initialize ans = 1

Iterate i from 1 to sqrt(x):

if x % i == 0:

if i <= k:

ans = max(ans, i)

if x/i <= k:

ans = max(ans, x/i)

This should give me the largest d <= k that divides x.

Seems efficient, as sqrt(10^8) is about 10^4, and with t=10^3, total operations are about 10^7, which should be acceptable.

Let me see if there are any edge cases.

Case 1: n = 1

Then k = x/1 = x

So, d can be up to x.

But since n=1, there's only one sub-problem with difficulty x.

So, GCD is x.

But according to the approach, k = x, and d = x, which is correct.

Case 2: n = x

Then k = x/x = 1

Divisors of x <=1: only 1

So, GCD is 1.

Which makes sense, because you have to split x into x parts of 1 each.

Case 3: x is prime, n=2

k = floor(x/2)

If x is prime, its divisors are 1 and x.

But x > k, so only 1 <=k.

So, GCD is 1.

Case 4: x is divisible by n, i.e., x % n ==0

Then, d can be up to x/n.

For example, x=12, n=3

k=4

Divisors of 12 <=4: 1,2,3,4

So, ans=4

Which is achieved by splitting into [4,4,4]

Yes, correct.

Another case: x=10, n=4

k=2

Divisors of 10 <=2: 1,2

ans=2

Possible split: [2,2,3,3], GCD is 1, but according to the approach, it's 2.

Wait, but [2,2,2,4] has GCD 2.

Wait, is that possible?

Sum is 2+2+2+4=10, which matches.

So, yes, GCD is 2.

Another split like [2,2,3,3] has GCD 1, but 2 is better.

So, the approach seems correct.

Another point: when x is 1, n=1

k=1

Divisors of 1:1

ans=1

Correct.

When x=1, n>1

But n cannot be greater than x, as per constraints: 1<=n<=x

Wait, no, n can be equal to x, as in case 2 above.

But in the constraints, it's 1<=n<=x

So, n can be up to x.

Another point: when x=2, n=2

k=1

Divisors of 2:1,2

Divisors <=1:1

ans=1

Split: [1,1], GCD=1

Which is correct.

Seems solid.

Now, looking at the given code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(x, n) = map(int, input().split())

k = x // n

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

ans = 1

for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

if x % i == 0:

l = [ans]

if i <= k:

l.append(i)

if x // i <= k:

l.append(x // i)

ans = max(l)

print(ans)



Wait, there are some parts here that need clarification.

First, the function is named func, and it seems like it's meant to be called somewhere, but in Python, typically in competitive programming, you'd have a main function or directly write the code.

But since it's given like this, I'll assume it's meant to be called.

Now, in the loop:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(x, n) = map(int, input().split())

k = x // n

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

ans = 1

for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

if x % i == 0:

l = [ans]

if i <= k:

l.append(i)

if x // i <= k:

l.append(x // i)

ans = max(l)

print(ans)



So, it's processing t test cases, reading x and n for each.

Then, k = x // n

If k ==1, it prints 1 immediately.

Else, it initializes ans=1 and iterates over i from 1 or 2 up to sqrt(x), stepping by 2, checking if i divides x, and if so, considering i and x/i if they are <=k.

Wait, but there's a condition here:

range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2)

This seems odd.

Let's decipher this.

1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)

So, if x is even, 1 + 1 = 2

if x is odd, 1 + 0 =1

Then, the range starts at 2 if x is even, else 1, and steps by 2.

So, it's iterating i from 1 or 2, up to sqrt(x), in steps of 2.

Wait, but if x is even, it starts from 2 and steps by 2, so i is even.

If x is odd, it starts from 1 and steps by 2, so i is odd.

Is this necessary?

Well, if x is even, starting from 2 and stepping by 2 means considering even i only.

But, if x is odd, starting from 1 and stepping by 2, considering odd i only.

This seems like an optimization to consider only possible divisors based on parity.

But, is it correct?

Wait, no.

Because, for x even, it's considering even i only, but x can have odd divisors as well.

For example, x=10 (even), its divisors are 1,2,5,10.

But if x is even, this code starts from 2 and steps by 2, so i=2,4,6,...

But sqrt(10)=3.16, so i=2,4, but 4 doesn't divide 10.

So, it would miss i=1 and i=5.

Wait, but earlier it checks i<=k and x/i <=k.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to optimize by skipping some steps.

But this seems flawed.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to only check odd divisors if x is odd, and even divisors if x is even.

But in the case of x=10, it starts from 2 and steps by 2, so i=2,4,6,... up to sqrt(10).

But in this range, i=2 and i=4.

x=10 %2==0, so start from 2.

But 4 does not divide 10, so it's irrelevant.

But still, it misses i=1 and i=5.

Wait, but i=1 is handled separately because k=x//n, and if k>=1, which it always is, ans starts at 1.

But i=5 is not considered in this loop because sqrt(10) is about 3.16, so i only goes up to 3.

So, x/i =10/1=10 (but i=1 is not considered in this loop if x is even), i=2, i=4.

Wait, this seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to handle i=1 separately, and then start from 2 if x is even.

But in the code, if x is even, it starts from i=2, and steps by 2.

So, it considers i=2,4,6,... up to sqrt(x).

But in this case, for x=10, it would consider i=2 and i=4.

But 4 does not divide 10.

So, it would only consider i=2, and x/i=5.

Since k= floor(10/3)=3, so x/i=5 >3, so it's not considered.

Thus, ans would remain 1, but in reality, the answer should be 2.

Wait, but according to the example, the answer is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Wait, in the code, for x=10, n=3, k=3.

It starts from i=2 (since x is even), and steps by 2.

i=2: x%2==0, so l=[ans=1, i=2], ans=max(1,2)=2

i=4: x%4 !=0, so skipped

So, ans=2, which is correct.

Wait, but in this approach, it misses i=1 and i=5.

But since i=1 is handled as ans=1 initially, and i=2 gives ans=2, and x/i=5 >k=3, so it's not considered.

Thus, ans=2, which is correct.

Similarly, for x=5, n=5, k=1, it prints 1 immediately.

For x=420, n=69, k=6, it would iterate i from 2 (since x is even) up to sqrt(420)=20.49, so i=2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20

Check which i divide 420 and x/i <=6.

i=2: x%2==0, l=[1,2,210/210>6], ans=2

i=4: x%4==0, l=[2,4,105/105>6], ans=4

i=6: x%6==0, l=[4,6,70/70>6], ans=6

i=8: x%8!=0

i=10: x%10==0, l=[6,10,42/42>6], ans=10 (but 10>k=6, so invalid)

Wait, but in the code, it appends x/i only if x/i <=k.

So, for i=10, x/i=42, which is >k=6, so not appended.

Thus, l=[ans=6, i=10], so ans=10, but 10 >k=6, which is invalid.

Wait, but according to the approach, we should have ans=6.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the code, it appends i and x/i to l only if they are <=k.

So, for i=10, x/i=42 >k=6, so only i=10 <=k=6, which it is not, so l=[ans=6]

Thus, ans remains 6.

Similarly for i=12: x%12==0, x/i=35 >k=6, i=12 >k=6, so l=[6], ans=6

i=14: x%14==0, x/i=30 >k=6, i=14 >k=6, l=[6], ans=6

i=16: x%16!=0

i=18: x%18!=0

i=20: x%20==0, x/i=21 >k=6, i=20 >k=6, l=[6], ans=6

So, finally ans=6, which is correct.

Thus, the code seems to work correctly for the given examples.

But I'm still a bit uneasy about the loop starting from 2 if x is even and stepping by 2.

Is there a better way to write this loop?

Alternatively, could I iterate i from 1 to sqrt(x), without considering parity?

Yes, I could iterate i from 1 to sqrt(x), checking if i divides x, and if i <=k, ans = max(ans, i)

and if x/i <=k, ans = max(ans, x/i)

This would be simpler and more straightforward.

In the given code, it seems to handle parity differently, but it appears to work.

Perhaps the author tried to optimize by skipping unnecessary i based on parity.

But in practice, for the constraints, it's acceptable.

I need to verify if this code covers all cases correctly.

Let's consider x=1, n=1

k=1

Since k==1, it prints 1 immediately, which is correct.

x=1, n=1: ans=1

x=2, n=2: k=1

Since k==1, prints 1, which is correct ([1,1])

x=3, n=2: k=1

print 1, which is correct ([1,2], GCD=1)

x=4, n=2: k=2

Loop: i starts from 1 (x is even, 1 +1=2, step 2)

i=2: x%2==0, l=[1,2,2], ans=2

i=4: x%4==0, but i=4 >k=2, so l=[2], ans=2

So, ans=2, which is correct ([2,2] or [1,3] with GCD=1, but 2 is better)

x=9, n=3: k=3

Loop: i starts from 1 (x is odd, 1 +0=1, step 2)

i=1: x%1==0, l=[1,1,9], but 9>3, so l=[1,1], ans=1

i=3: x%3==0, l=[1,3,3], ans=3

So, ans=3, which is correct ([3,3,3])

Seems correct.

Another test: x=100, n=5

k=20

Divisors of 100: 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100

Divisors <=20:1,2,4,5,10,20

ans=20, which is correct.

In the code, it would iterate i from 2 (since x is even) up to sqrt(100)=10, step 2

i=2: x%2==0, l=[1,2,50], but 50>20, so l=[1,2], ans=2

i=4: x%4==0, l=[2,4,25], but 25>20, so l=[2,4], ans=4

i=6: x%6!=0

i=8: x%8!=0

i=10: x%10==0, l=[4,10,10], ans=10

So, ans=10, but actually, 20 is possible.

Wait, but k=20, and x/i for i=5 is x/5=20 <=k=20, so ans should be 20.

But in this loop, i=5 is not considered because starting from i=2,4,6,8,10,...

i=5 is odd, but since x is even, it starts from i=2 and steps by 2, skipping i=5.

So, it misses i=5.

Wait, this is a problem.

In this case, the code would output 10, but the correct answer is 20.

Wait, but according to earlier examples, it should output 20.

Wait, in the earlier examples, it worked correctly, but in this case, it seems to miss i=5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, for x=100, n=5, k=20

The code starts i from 2 (since x is even), up to sqrt(100)=10, step 2

i=2: x%2==0, l=[1,2,50], but 50>20, so l=[1,2], ans=2

i=4: x%4==0, l=[2,4,25], but 25>20, so l=[2,4], ans=4

i=6: x%6!=0

i=8: x%8!=0

i=10: x%10==0, l=[4,10,10], ans=10

So, ans=10, but actually, d=20 is possible with sub-problems of difficulties [20,20,20,20,20], sum=100.

So, the code incorrectly outputs 10 instead of 20.

This suggests that the code is flawed.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it worked correctly.

Perhaps the approach needs adjustment.

Wait, in this case, d=20 divides x=100, and x/d=5 <=n=5, which satisfies the condition.

But the code misses d=20 because in the loop, i=5 is not considered.

So, perhaps the code needs to consider both i and x/i, ensuring that they are <=k.

Wait, but in the code, for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

if x % i == 0:

l = [ans]

if i <= k:

l.append(i)

if x // i <= k:

l.append(x // i)

ans = max(l)

So, for i=2, l=[1,2], ans=2

i=4, l=[2,4], ans=4

i=10, l=[4,10], ans=10

But d=20 is x/i where i=5, but i=5 is not considered in the loop because starting from i=2 and stepping by 2.

So, it skips i=5.

Hence, x/i=20 is not considered in the loop.

But, outside the loop, perhaps d=1 is already considered.

So, to fix this, maybe after the loop, we need to check if x itself is <=k, but in this case, x=100 >k=20.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when x is even, starting from i=2 skips some odd divisors that are less than or equal to k.

An alternative approach is to iterate i from 1 to sqrt(x), regardless of x's parity, and check both i and x/i.

Here's a better way to implement it:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

x, n = map(int, input().split())

k = x // n

ans = 1

sqrt_x = int(x**0.5) + 1

for i in range(1, sqrt_x):

if x % i == 0:

if i <= k:

ans = max(ans, i)

if x // i <= k:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

print(ans)



This way, we consider all possible divisors up to sqrt(x), and also their corresponding x/i.

This should cover all cases.

In the earlier code, by starting from i=2 and stepping by 2 when x is even, it skips some odd divisors, which can be less than or equal to k.

Hence, the given code is flawed.

Therefore, the answer is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the GCD (balance) of a set of sub-problems derived from a given problem of difficulty `x`, divided into `n` sub-problems. The goal is to optimally choose the difficulties of these sub-problems such that their sum equals `x` and their GCD is maximized.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Constraints**:
   - Each sub-problem must have a difficulty of at least 1.
   - The sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems must be equal to `x`.
   - The GCD of these difficulties should be as large as possible.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the GCD of the sub-problems is `d`, then each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of `d`.
   - Therefore, `d` must be a divisor of `x`.
   - Additionally, since there are `n` sub-problems, `d` cannot exceed `x // n` because each sub-problem must have a difficulty of at least 1.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Compute `k = x // n`, which is the maximum possible value for `d`.
   - Find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Efficient Divisor Search**:
   - Iterate from 1 to the square root of `x` to find all possible divisors.
   - For each `i` in this range, if `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i <= k`, consider it.
   - Also, consider `x // i` as a potential divisor, provided it is less than or equal to `k`.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        sqrt_x = int(x**0.5) + 1
        for i in range(1, sqrt_x):
            if x % i == 0:
                if i <= k:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if (x // i <= k):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

# To execute the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation
- **Step-by-step Execution**:
  1. **Read Inputs**: Read the number of test cases `t`.
  2. **Process Each Test Case**:
     - Read `x` and `n`.
     - Calculate `k = x // n`.
     - Initialize `ans = 1`.
     - Determine the square root of `x` to limit the search for divisors.
     - Iterate from 1 to `sqrt(x)`:
       - If `i` is a divisor of `x`:
         - If `i <= k`, update `ans` if `i` is greater than the current `ans`.
         - If `x // i <= k`, update `ans` if `x // i` is greater than the current `ans`.
     - Print the final answer for the test case.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The loop runs up to `sqrt(x)`, making it efficient for large values of `x` (up to 10^8).
  - Overall complexity is O(t * sqrt(x)), which is acceptable given the constraints.

This approach ensures that we find the largest possible GCD for the given constraints efficiently and correctly.
