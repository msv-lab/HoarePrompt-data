Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n containers of water, each containing a certain amount of water. The sum of all the water in these containers is divisible by n, which means that theoretically, we can distribute the water equally among all containers. The question is whether it's possible to achieve this equal distribution using a specific type of operation: pouring water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index.

First, I need to understand the constraints of the operation. The key point is that we can only pour water from a container with a smaller index to a larger one, and we can do this any number of times, possibly zero. This means that water can only move from left to right in the line of containers.

Given that, I need to figure out if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, which would be the total sum divided by n, since the sum is divisible by n.

Let's denote the target amount of water in each container as s = sum(a_i) / n. My goal is to make each a_i equal to s.

Now, since we can only pour water from left to right, I need to consider the cumulative effect of these operations.

One way to approach this is to think about the cumulative sum of water from left to right and see if at any point, the cumulative sum falls below what is needed to reach the target for all subsequent containers.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of prefixes. Let's consider the prefix sums of the array a_i.

Let prefix[i] = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i.

For the water distribution to be possible, at each step, the prefix sum up to index i should be at least s * i. Because if prefix[i] < s * i, it means that up to container i, there isn't enough water to distribute s units to each of the first i containers.

Similarly, since we can only pour water from left to right, each container must have at least s units by the time we reach it, otherwise, we can't compensate for it later by pouring water from right to left, which is not allowed.

Wait, but actually, since we can only pour from left to right, if a container has less than s, we can try to compensate by pouring water from previous containers to it.

But given the operation constraint, we can only pour from lower indices to higher ones, which means that once we've passed a container, we can't take water from it to pour into previous containers.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate from left to right, keeping track of the surplus or deficit of water, and see if we can balance it out with future containers.

Let me consider the first container. If a_1 >= s, then we can pour the excess (a_1 - s) to the next container. If a_1 < s, then we need to check if the previous containers can compensate for this deficit, but since it's the first one, there are no previous containers. So, if a_1 < s, it's impossible to make it equal to s by only pouring from left to right.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because in the example given, in the third test case, a = [4,5,2,1,3], and n=5. The sum is 15, so s=3.

Looking at the first container, a_1=4, which is greater than 3, so we can pour 1 unit to the second container.

Then a becomes [3,6,2,1,3].

Then, a_2=6, which is greater than 3, so we can pour 3 units to the third container.

But a_3=2 + 3 =5.

Then, a_4=1, which is less than 3, but we can't take water from a_5 to pour into a_4 because we can only pour from left to right. So, perhaps in this case, it's still possible because the excess from a_2 and a_3 can be used to compensate for the deficit in a_4.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if a_1 >= s, we can pour the excess to the next container, and so on.

But in this example, it's possible to make all containers have 3 units.

So, maybe I need to track the cumulative sum and ensure that at any point, the cumulative sum is at least s * i.

Let me try that.

For the third test case:

n=5, a=[4,5,2,1,3], s=3.

Compute prefix sums:

prefix[1] = 4 >= 3*1 = 3 → OK

prefix[2] = 4+5=9 >= 3*2=6 → OK

prefix[3] = 9+2=11 >= 3*3=9 → OK

prefix[4] = 11+1=12 >= 3*4=12 → OK

prefix[5] = 12+3=15 >= 3*5=15 → OK

Since all prefix[i] >= s*i, it's possible.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n=2, a=[1,3], s=2.

prefix[1] = 1 >= 2*1 = 2 → NOT OK

So, it's impossible, which matches the sample output "NO".

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3], s=2.

prefix[1] =1 >=2*1=2 → NOT OK

So, "NO", which matches the sample output.

Another one: n=7, a=[4,5,5,0,6,4,4], s=4.

prefix[1]=4 >=4*1=4 → OK

prefix[2]=4+5=9 >=8 → OK

prefix[3]=9+5=14 >=12 → OK

prefix[4]=14+0=14 >=16 → NOT OK

So, "NO", matches the sample.

Last one: n=7, a=[6,5,5,1,3,4,4], s=4.

prefix[1]=6 >=4 → OK

prefix[2]=6+5=11 >=8 → OK

prefix[3]=11+5=16 >=12 → OK

prefix[4]=16+1=17 >=16 → OK

prefix[5]=17+3=20 >=20 → OK

prefix[6]=20+4=24 >=24 → OK

prefix[7]=24+4=28 >=28 → OK

So, "YES", matches the sample.

Therefore, the condition seems to be that for all i from 1 to n, prefix[i] >= s*i.

If this condition holds, then it's possible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

last = nums[-1]

curr = 0

for i in nums:

if i != 0:

curr += i - last

if curr == 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Hmm, this seems different from what I've deduced.

Let me try to understand what this code is doing.

It reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and then the list of a_i.

It sets last = nums[-1], which is the last element in the list.

Then, it initializes curr = 0.

Then, for each i in nums, if i != 0, it adds i - last to curr.

Finally, if curr == 0, it prints "YES", else "NO".

Wait, this seems suspicious.

Let me try with the third test case: n=5, a=[4,5,2,1,3], last=3.

curr = (4-3) + (5-3) + (2-3) + (1-3) + (3-3) = 1 + 2 -1 -2 + 0 = 0

Which matches the sample output "YES".

Another test case: n=2, a=[1,3], last=3.

curr = (1-3) + (3-3) = -2 + 0 = -2 != 0 → "NO"

Another one: n=3, a=[1,2,3], last=3.

curr = (1-3) + (2-3) + (3-3) = -2 -1 + 0 = -3 != 0 → "NO"

Another one: n=7, a=[4,5,5,0,6,4,4], last=4.

curr = (4-4) + (5-4) + (5-4) + (0-4) + (6-4) + (4-4) + (4-4) = 0 +1 +1 -4 +2 +0 +0 = 0 → "YES"

But according to the sample, it should be "NO".

Wait, that doesn't match. In the sample, for this test case, the output is "NO".

But according to this code, curr=0, so it would print "YES", which is incorrect.

Wait, in my calculation, curr=0, but sample output is "NO", so there's a mismatch.

Wait, let's calculate curr again:

a=[4,5,5,0,6,4,4], last=4.

curr = (4-4) + (5-4) + (5-4) + (0-4) + (6-4) + (4-4) + (4-4) = 0 +1 +1 -4 +2 +0 +0 = 0

But according to the sample, it's "NO", meaning the code is incorrect.

So, the code is producing "YES" for a case that should be "NO". Hence, the code is flawed.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in each of the n containers the same by only pouring water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have n containers with given amounts of water.
   - We can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a higher one.
   - The total sum of water is divisible by n, so the target amount in each container is sum(a_i)/n.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - We need to ensure that at any point, the cumulative sum of water from the start up to any container is at least the target sum up to that point.
   - This ensures that we have enough water to distribute to each container as we move from left to right.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the target amount s = sum(a_i)/n.
   - Compute the prefix sums of the array a_i.
   - For each prefix sum, check if it is at least s * i, where i is the current index (starting from 1).
   - If all prefix sums satisfy this condition, it is possible to make all containers equal; otherwise, it is not.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        s = total_sum // n  # Since sum is divisible by n, this is integer division
        possible = True
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += nums[i]
            if current_sum < s * (i + 1):
                possible = False
                break
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases t.
   - For each test case, read the number of containers n and the list of water amounts a_i.

2. **Target Calculation**:
   - Calculate the target amount s that each container should have, which is sum(a_i)/n.

3. **Prefix Sum Check**:
   - Compute the prefix sums of a_i.
   - For each prefix sum up to index i (0-based), check if it is at least s * (i + 1).
   - If all prefix sums satisfy this condition, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

This approach ensures that we are correctly determining whether it is possible to equalize the water in all containers using the allowed operations.
