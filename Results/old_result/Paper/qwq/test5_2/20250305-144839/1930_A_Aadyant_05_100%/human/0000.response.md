Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and at the end, I need to have the maximum possible score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about this. If I have, say, n=1, so 2 numbers, I just pick those two and add the smaller one to my score. That's straightforward.

For n=2, I have 4 numbers. I need to pair them into two pairs, and for each pair, add the smaller one, and maximize the total sum.

I need to find a way to pair the numbers so that the sum of the minimums of each pair is as large as possible.

I recall that in order to maximize the sum of the minimums, I might want to pair smaller numbers with larger numbers, but I'm not sure.

Let me try with an example. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.

If I pair 1 with 2, and 3 with 4, the sum is min(1,2) + min(3,4) = 1 + 3 = 4.

If I pair 1 with 3, and 2 with 4, the sum is min(1,3) + min(2,4) = 1 + 2 = 3.

If I pair 1 with 4, and 2 with 3, the sum is min(1,4) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3.

So, in this case, pairing the higher numbers together gives a higher sum.

Wait, but in the second test case of the example, with numbers 1,1,2,1.

If I pair 1 with 1, and 2 with 1, the sum is min(1,1) + min(2,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 with 2, and 1 with 1, it's min(1,2) + min(1,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Same result. It seems that no matter how I pair them, I get the same sum.

Another example: n=3, numbers are all 1s. So, 1,1,1,1,1,1.

No matter how I pair them, the sum will be 1+1+1=3.

So, it seems that pairing doesn't affect the sum when all numbers are the same.

But in the first example, pairing higher numbers together gave a higher sum.

Wait, but in the second test case, pairing seems to not make a difference.

Hmm.

Let me think differently. Maybe I should sort the numbers first.

If I sort the numbers in ascending order, maybe there's a pattern.

Take the first example: 2,3. Sorted: 2,3. Pair them together, sum is 2.

Second example: 1,1,2,1. Sorted: 1,1,1,2. Pair them as 1 with 1, and 1 with 2. Sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

Third example: all 1s. Sum is 1+1+1=3.

It seems that pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but in the first example, pairing 2 and 3 gives 2, which is higher than pairing 2 with a smaller number, but there are no smaller numbers.

Wait, maybe I need to pair the smallest with the largest.

Wait, in the first example, if I had paired 2 with 3, I get 2, which is better than pairing 2 with a smaller number, but there are no smaller numbers.

In the second example, pairing 1 with 1 and 1 with 2 gives 1+1=2, which is the same as pairing 1 with 2 and 1 with 1.

So, maybe sorting and pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but why does that work?

Let me think about it mathematically.

Suppose I have two pairs: (a,b) and (c,d), where a <= b and c <= d.

I need to maximize min(a,b) + min(c,d).

Is there a way to arrange a,b,c,d to maximize this sum?

Wait, perhaps sorting and pairing consecutive numbers gives the optimal sum.

Let me test this hypothesis.

Take n=2, numbers: 1,2,3,4.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4.

Pair 1 with 2, and 3 with 4. Sum: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternative pairing: 1 with 3, 2 with 4. Sum: 1 + 2 = 3.

Another pairing: 1 with 4, 2 with 3. Sum: 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the first pairing gives the highest sum.

Another test: n=3, numbers: 1,1,1,1,1,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,1,1,1.

Pairing: 1 with 1, 1 with 1, 1 with 1. Sum: 1+1+1=3.

No other way to pair them.

Another test: n=2, numbers: 1,2,3,6.

Sorted: 1,2,3,6.

Pairing: 1 with 2, 3 with 6. Sum: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternative pairing: 1 with 3, 2 with 6. Sum: 1 + 2 = 3.

Another pairing: 1 with 6, 2 with 3. Sum: 1 + 2 = 3.

Again, the first pairing gives the highest sum.

So, it seems that sorting the list and pairing consecutive numbers gives the maximum sum.

But why?

Let me think about it.

If I sort the list in ascending order, and pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on, I'm ensuring that the smaller numbers are being paired with the next smaller numbers, which might maximize the sum of the minimums.

Wait, but in the first test case, pairing the two largest numbers together gave a higher sum.

Wait, no, in the first test case, there were only two numbers, so pairing them together is the only option.

In the second test case, pairing the two smallest together gave a higher sum.

Wait, in the second test case, pairing the two 1s together gave a sum of 1 + 1 = 2, which is the same as pairing 1 with 2 and 1 with 1.

So, it didn't make a difference.

But in the third test case, all numbers are the same, so it doesn't matter.

Another test: n=3, numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pairing: 1 with 2, 3 with 4, 5 with 6. Sum: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Alternative pairing: 1 with 3, 2 with 5, 4 with 6. Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Another pairing: 1 with 4, 2 with 5, 3 with 6. Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, again, the first pairing gives the highest sum.

It seems consistent that sorting and pairing consecutive numbers gives the maximum sum.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me consider that.

Suppose I sort the list in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

If I pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, up to a_{2n-1} with a_{2n}, then the sum is a1 + a3 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Because in each pair, the minimum is the first one in the pair, since the list is sorted.

Now, suppose I pair a1 with a3, a2 with a4, a5 with a6, and so on.

The sum would be a1 + a2 + a5 + ... .

But in the first pairing, a1 + a3 + a5 + ... is less than or equal to a1 + a2 + a4 + ..., because a2 >= a3, a4 >= a5, and so on.

Wait, no, in the first pairing, a1 + a3 + a5 + ... , and in the alternative pairing, a1 + a2 + a4 + a5 + ..., but wait, the number of terms is n, so for n=3, first pairing sum is a1 + a3 + a5, alternative pairing could be a1 + a2 + a4.

Given that a2 >= a3, a4 >= a5, etc., it's possible that the alternative pairing gives a higher sum.

But in my earlier test with numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6, the first pairing gave 1+3+5=9, and alternative pairing like 1+2+4=7, which is less.

Another alternative pairing: 1 with 4, 2 with 5, 3 with 6: 1+2+3=6, which is less than 9.

So, why is the first pairing giving the maximum sum?

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the list in ascending order.

Then, the sum of the minimums of each pair is equal to the sum of the first n elements in the sorted list.

Because in each pair, the smaller number is being added to the sum.

Wait, is that always true?

In the first pairing where I pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, the sum is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this equal to the sum of the smallest n numbers?

Well, in the sorted list, the smallest n numbers are a1 to an.

But in this pairing, I'm taking a1, a3, a5, ..., which may not include some of the smaller numbers.

Wait, for n=3: a1, a3, a5.

But a2 is smaller than a3, so why is a1 + a3 + a5 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is greater than a1 + a2 + a4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Wait, but a2 is smaller than a3, but a4 is larger than a3.

So, a1 + a3 + a5 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and a1 + a2 + a4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which is less.

So, in this case, sum of a1, a3, a5 is greater than sum of a1, a2, a4.

Wait, but a1 + a2 + a3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is less than 9.

So, sum of the smallest n numbers is a1 + a2 + ... + an.

But in the pairing, I'm summing a1 + a3 + a5, which is greater than a1 + a2 + a3.

Wait, no, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is greater than 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

But in general, is sum of a1 + a3 + a5 + ... >= sum of a1 + a2 + ... + an?

Wait, no, for n=3: a1 + a3 + a5 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, while a1 + a2 + a3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, in this case, sum of a1 + a3 + a5 > sum of a1 + a2 + a3.

But in another case, say n=2: a1 + a3 = 1 + 3 = 4, while a1 + a2 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Again, higher.

Wait, but in the second test case: n=2, numbers 1,1,2,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

Sum of a1 + a3 + a5 + ... would be 1 + 1 = 2.

Sum of smallest n numbers is a1 + a2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Same in this case.

In the third test case: n=3, all 1s.

Sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is same as sum of smallest n numbers.

So, in some cases, sum of a1 + a3 + a5 + ... is greater than sum of smallest n numbers, in some cases, equal.

But according to the problem, I need to maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair.

Is there a general way to do this?

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to sort the list in ascending order and sum the first n elements.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum of first n=1 element is 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case, sum of first n=2 elements is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

In the third test case, sum of first n=3 elements is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which matches the example.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to sort the list in ascending order and sum the first n elements.

But wait, in my earlier test with n=3 and numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6, sum of first n=3 elements is 1+2+3=6, but pairing as a1 with a2, a3 with a4, a5 with a6 gives sum a1 + a3 + a5 = 1+3+5=9, which is higher than 6.

But according to this strategy, I should sum the first n elements, which is 1+2+3=6, but in reality, I can get 9.

So, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

"There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. You will perform n moves, each time choosing two integers, adding the smaller one to your score, and erasing both.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve by optimally performing the n moves."

So, in each move, I choose two numbers, add the smaller one to the score, and remove both.

I need to maximize the sum of these minimums over n moves.

I need to find a way to pair the numbers such that the sum of the minimums of each pair is maximized.

In the test case with n=3 and numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6:

If I pair 1 with 2, 3 with 4, 5 with 6, sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

If I pair 1 with 3, 2 with 5, 4 with 6, sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

If I pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5, 3 with 6, sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, the first pairing gives the highest sum.

But according to the strategy of summing the first n elements, it would be 1+2+3=6, but in reality, I can get 9.

So, summing the first n elements is not giving the correct maximum sum.

Wait, maybe I need to sort and sum every other element starting from the first.

Wait, in the first pairing, I have a1 + a3 + a5 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

In the second pairing, a1 + a2 + a4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the third pairing, a1 + a2 + a3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, summing a1 + a3 + a5 gives the highest sum.

But in the sorted list, a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4 <= a5 <= a6.

So, a1 + a3 + a5 <= a2 + a4 + a6.

Wait, in this case, a2 + a4 + a6 = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, which is higher than 9.

But I can't pair them in a way that I get a sum of 12.

Because to get sum of 12, I would need to pair in a way that I add a2, a4, a6.

But according to the pairing rules, when I pair a2 with a4, I add min(a2, a4) = a2 = 2, and pair a6 with something, but there's no one left.

Wait, perhaps I can pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, a5 with a6, sum is min(a1,a2) + min(a3,a4) + min(a5,a6) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Alternatively, pair a1 with a3, a2 with a4, a5 with a6, sum is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

Another pairing: a1 with a4, a2 with a5, a3 with a6, sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, indeed, the first pairing gives the highest sum of 9.

But according to the earlier thought, summing a1 + a3 + a5 = 9, which is less than a2 + a4 + a6 = 12.

But I can't achieve a sum of 12 because to get min(a2, a4) = 2, min(a4, a6) = 4, but there's no pair left for a6.

Wait, perhaps I need to pair a2 with a6, and a4 with a6, but I can't pair a6 twice.

So, it's not possible.

Hence, the maximum sum is indeed 9, not 12.

Therefore, the strategy of summing the first n elements in the sorted list seems to be correct.

Wait, but in this case, sum of first n=3 elements is a1 + a2 + a3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but we can get 9.

So, summing the first n elements is not giving the correct maximum sum.

Wait, maybe I need to sum every other element starting from the first.

In sorted order: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6.

Sum a1 + a3 + a5 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Yes, that seems to be the maximum sum achievable.

So, perhaps the correct strategy is to sort the list in ascending order and sum every other element starting from the first.

Wait, but why does that work?

Let me see.

If I sort the list in ascending order, and pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, ..., a_{2k-1} with a_{2k}, then in each pair, the minimum is a_{2k-1}.

So, the sum is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

And in the sorted list, a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

So, a1 is the smallest, a3 is the next smallest after a2, and so on.

Hence, summing a1 + a3 + a5 + ... gives the sum of the smaller elements in each pair when pairs are formed in this way.

And as per the earlier examples, this seems to give the maximum sum possible.

Hence, the strategy is to sort the list in ascending order and sum every other element starting from the first.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this strategy.

Looking at the code:

def func():

n = input()

final = []

for num in range(int(n)):

s = 0

list2 = []

a = input()

list1 = []

b = input()

list1 = b.split()

for str in list1:

list2.append(int(str))

list2.sort()

for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):

s = s + int(list2[i])

final.append(s)

for fin in final:

print(fin)

So, it seems to read the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, then reads the list of 2n numbers, sorts them, and sums every other element starting from the first.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, this should give the correct maximum sum.

But in the earlier test case with n=3 and numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6, this approach sums 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is the maximum sum possible.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

Wait, but in the earlier confusion, I thought that summing the first n elements would be 1+2+3=6, which is less than 9, but that's not what the program is doing.

The program is summing a1 + a3 + a5 + ..., which in this case is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

So, it's actually summing every other element starting from the first in the sorted list.

Hence, this seems to be the correct approach.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
