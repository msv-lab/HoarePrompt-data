Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if, by performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero), I can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. So, I need to check if there's a sequence of operations that results in an array where each element is less than or equal to the next one.

First, I need to understand the operation thoroughly. When I apply the operation to an element that's at least 10, I'm essentially splitting it into its individual digits. For example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and so on. This operation can be applied to any qualifying element any number of times.

Now, the key here is to figure out when it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by applying these operations. I need to think about the implications of splitting numbers into their digits.

Let me consider the first example given:

Input:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting 12 and 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. This is sorted in non-decreasing order, so the answer is YES.

Another example:

Input:

3

12 28 5

After splitting 12 and 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. Even if I don't split 28, it's [12, 28, 5], which is not sorted. So, it seems like NO.

And the third example:

Input:

2

0 0

It's already sorted, so YES.

From these examples, it seems like splitting numbers can help in sorting, but there are limitations based on the digits and their order.

I need to think about how splitting affects the array. When I split a number, I'm inserting its digits in place of the number, maintaining their original order. So, for a number like 12, splitting it into 1 and 2 doesn't change the relative order of the digits.

I should consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with its digits in sequence. So, the array's elements are either the original numbers (if not split) or their digits (if split).

Now, the problem reduces to checking if there's a way to choose, for each element, whether to split it (if it's at least 10) or keep it as is, such that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a decision problem where I need to explore different possibilities of splitting or not splitting each eligible element.

Given that n can be up to 50, and t can be up to 10^3, I need an efficient solution, but since t is up to 10^3 and n is up to 50, a reasonable approach should work.

I need to find a way to model this problem effectively.

One way to approach this is to consider each element and decide whether to split it or not, then check if the resulting array is sorted.

However, since n is up to 50, and each element that's at least 10 can be either split or not, this could lead to a large number of possibilities, which is not feasible to check directly.

So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n is between 2 and 50

- a_i is between 0 and 99

- Only numbers >=10 can be split into their digits.

Given that a_i can be up to 99, the maximum number of digits I can get from splitting is two digits per number.

Wait, but single-digit numbers are already digits, so they can't be split.

So, only two-digit numbers (10 to 99) can be split into two digits.

Numbers from 0 to 9 cannot be split because they are less than 10.

So, for each element in the array, if it's less than 10, it remains as is.

If it's greater than or equal to 10, I have the option to either keep it as is or split it into two digits.

My goal is to choose, for each such element, whether to split it or not, so that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to check all possible splits efficiently.

One idea is to consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each element can contribute either its own value (if less than 10) or its digits (if >=10).

I need to interleave these choices in such a way that the entire sequence is non-decreasing.

But this seems a bit vague. Let's think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the array, and edges represent possible transitions between elements, considering whether to split or not.

But that might be too complicated for this problem.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Iterate through the array, and at each position, decide whether to split the number or keep it, based on the previous decision.

- Ensure that the sequence remains non-decreasing at each step.

But I need to ensure that the decisions are consistent across the array.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of maintaining a current value, and at each step, choose the smallest possible value that is >= the previous value.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the array, and j is some state representing the last value.

But with n up to 50, and possible values up to 99, this might not be efficient enough.

Wait, but t is up to 10^3, so a DP approach might be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following insight:

When splitting a number, it's equivalent to inserting its digits in place, maintaining their order.

So, for example, [12, 3, 45, 67] can be transformed by splitting 12 and 45 into [1,2,3,4,5,67].

Now, in this resulting array, the digits are in their original order relative to each other.

So, the constraint is that the digits from each number, if split, must maintain their original order.

This sounds similar to merging sequences or checking if a sequence can be sorted with certain constraints.

Maybe I can model this as a sequence of digits, where some digits are grouped together if the number is not split.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a string, where each number is represented by its digits, and splitting corresponds to inserting separators between digits.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I consider all possible splits and see if any of them result in a sorted array.

But with n=50, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, considering the possible splits.

But I need to ensure that the sequence remains non-decreasing.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that, at each step, decides whether to split the current number or not, and checks if the sequence can remain sorted.

But again, with n=50, this might be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the digits of the numbers.

Each number can be represented by its digits.

For example, 12 is '1' and '2', 45 is '4' and '5', etc.

If I split all possible numbers, I get a sequence of digits.

Then, I can check if this sequence is sorted.

But of course, I don't have to split all numbers.

So, I need to find a way to decide which numbers to split to achieve a sorted sequence.

This is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal possible sequence by choosing to split numbers only when necessary to maintain the sorted order.

But I'm not sure how to implement that.

Let me consider the first example again: [12,3,45,67]

If I split 12 into 1 and 2, and split 45 into 4 and 5, I get [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

If I don't split 12 but split 45, I get [12,3,4,5,67], which is not sorted.

If I split 12 but not 45, I get [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted because 1 <= 2 <= 3 <= 45 <= 67.

So, in this case, even without splitting all numbers, I can achieve a sorted sequence.

So, I need to find a way to decide for each number whether to split it or not, to achieve a sorted sequence.

Now, considering that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the sequence sorted if the digits are smaller than the number itself.

For example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 allows for smaller values, which might help in achieving a sorted sequence.

But in some cases, splitting might not help, or it might make things worse.

I need to find a way to model this decision process.

Let me try to think of this as processing the array from left to right, and at each step, choosing the smallest possible value that is >= the previous value.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the last value, and decide for each number whether to split it or not, based on the last value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize last = -1

Iterate through each element in the array:

if element >= last:

if element < 10:

last = element

else:

# Option 1: keep the number as is

if element >= last:

last = element

# Option 2: split the number into digits

tens = element // 10

units = element % 10

if tens >= last:

last = units

else:

# Only Option 1 is possible

if element >= last:

last = element

else:

# Cannot proceed

return False

return True

Wait, this seems too simplistic and might not cover all cases.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

[12,3,45,67]

Start with last = -1

First element: 12

Option 1: keep 12

if 12 >= -1: yes

last = 12

Option 2: split into 1 and 2

tens = 1, units = 2

if 1 >= -1: yes

last = 2

So, I have two choices: last=12 or last=2

I need to choose the one that allows the rest of the array to be sorted.

Now, proceed to the second element: 3

If I chose last=12:

is 3 >= 12? No, so cannot choose to keep 12.

So, have to choose to split 12 into 1 and 2.

last=2

Now, 3 >=2: yes, so last=3

Next, 45

45 >=3: yes, so can choose to keep 45 or split into 4 and 5.

Option 1: keep 45, last=45

Option 2: split into 4 and 5, last=5

Both options are possible.

Let's choose the one that leads to a sorted sequence.

Choose option 2: split into 4 and 5, last=5

Next, 67 >=5: yes, so last=67

End of array, so YES.

This seems to work.

Now, let's try the second example:

[12,28,5]

Start with last=-1

First element:12

Option 1: keep 12, last=12

Option 2: split into 1 and 2, last=2

Choose the one that allows the rest to be sorted.

Proceed with last=2

Second element:28

28 >=2: yes, can choose to keep 28 or split into 2 and 8.

Option 1: keep 28, last=28

Option 2: split into 2 and 8, last=8

Choose the one that allows the rest to be sorted.

Proceed with option 2: split into 2 and 8, last=8

Next element:5

5 >=8? No.

So, cannot proceed this way.

Let's try choosing option 1: keep 28, last=28

Then, 5 >=28? No.

So, no way to proceed.

Thus, NO.

Third example:

[0,0]

Start with last=-1

First element:0 >=-1: yes, last=0

Second element:0 >=0: yes, last=0

So, YES.

This seems to work for the given examples.

So, the general approach is:

- Iterate through the array, keeping track of the last value.

- For each element, if it's less than 10, it must be >= last.

- If it's >=10, choose to either keep it as is (if >= last), or split it into digits and ensure that the units digit >= last.

- Choose the option that allows the sequence to remain sorted.

This seems promising.

However, I need to ensure that this logic covers all possible cases.

Let me think of another example.

Suppose the array is [19, 2, 30]

Let's apply the logic.

Start with last=-1

First element:19 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 19, last=19

Option 2: split into 1 and 9, last=9

Choose the one that allows the rest to be sorted.

Second element:2

If I chose to keep 19, then 2 >=19? No, cannot choose to keep 19.

So, have to choose to split into 1 and 9, last=9

Now, 2 >=9? No, cannot proceed.

So, cannot make this array sorted.

Is that correct?

Alternatively, if I choose to split 19 into 1 and 9, then the array becomes [1,9,2,30]

Which is not sorted.

If I keep 19, the array is [19,2,30], which is not sorted.

So, indeed, it's not possible to make it sorted.

Another example: [15, 25, 30]

Start with last=-1

First element:15 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 15, last=15

Option 2: split into 1 and 5, last=5

Choose the one that allows the rest to be sorted.

If I choose option 1: keep 15, last=15

Second element:25 >=15: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 25, last=25

Option 2: split into 2 and 5, last=5

Choose option 1: keep 25, last=25

Third element:30 >=25: yes, keep 30, last=30

So, YES.

If I choose to split 15 into 1 and 5, last=5

Then, 25 >=5: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 25, last=25

Option 2: split into 2 and 5, last=5

Choose option 1: keep 25, last=25

Then, 30 >=25: yes, keep 30, last=30

So, still YES.

So, in this case, both options lead to a sorted sequence.

Now, let's consider [32, 2, 30]

Start with last=-1

First element:32 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 32, last=32

Option 2: split into 3 and 2, last=2

Choose the one that allows the rest to be sorted.

Second element:2

If I chose to keep 32, last=32, then 2 >=32? No.

So, have to choose to split into 3 and 2, last=2

Then, 2 >=2: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 2, last=2

Option 2: split 2 into 2 (since it's less than 10, no split), last=2

So, last remains 2

Then, 30 >=2: yes, keep 30, last=30

So, YES.

Wait, but if I split 32 into 3 and 2, then the array becomes [3,2,2,30], which is not sorted.

But according to this logic, it says YES, but the array is not sorted.

So, there's a mistake in the logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to track more than just the last value.

In this case, splitting 32 into 3 and 2 would make the array [3,2,2,30], which is not sorted, but according to the logic above, it seemed like it could be sorted.

So, my previous logic is flawed.

I need a better way to handle this.

Perhaps I need to consider the sequence of digits more carefully.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider each number as a sequence of digits, and I can choose to either keep the number as is or split it into its digits.

Then, I need to interleave these choices to form a sorted sequence.

This sounds like a complex problem, but maybe I can model it as a merge of multiple sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a merge of two sequences: one where numbers are kept as is, and another where they are split into digits.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each number can be represented as a list of its digits if split, or as the number itself if not split.

Then, I need to choose, for each number, one of these representations, and concatenate them into a single sequence that is sorted.

This seems similar to choosing elements from multiple possibilities and ensuring the entire sequence is sorted.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach, always choosing the smallest possible next element.

In other words, at each step, choose the smallest possible element from the available options that is >= the last element in the sequence.

This way, I can build the sequence step by step, ensuring it remains sorted.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty sequence.

Initialize last = -1

For each element in the array:

if element < 10:

if element >= last:

append element to sequence

last = element

else:

cannot proceed, return False

else:

# element >=10

options = []

if element >= last:

options.append(element)

digits = [element // 10, element % 10]

if digits[0] >= last:

options.extend(digits)

else:

# only option is to keep the number as is

if element >= last:

options.append(element)

else:

# cannot proceed

return False

# Choose the smallest option >= last

options = sorted(options)

for option in options:

if option >= last:

append option to sequence

last = option

break

else:

return False

return True

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps it's on the right track.

Let me test this logic with the earlier problematic example: [32,2,30]

Start with last=-1

First element:32 >=-1: yes, options: keep 32 or split into 3 and 2

options = [32,3,2]

sorted options = [2,3,32]

Choose the smallest >=-1, which is 2

append 2 to sequence, last=2

Next element:2 >=2: yes, options: keep 2 or split into 2 (since <10, no split), so options=[2]

append 2 to sequence, last=2

Next element:30 >=2: yes, options: keep 30 or split into 3 and 0

But wait, 30 >=2: yes, options: keep 30 or split into 3 and 0

If I split 30 into 3 and 0, then options=[30,3,0]

sorted options=[0,3,30]

Choose the smallest >=2, which is 3

append 3 to sequence, last=3

So, sequence is [2,2,3]

But originally, splitting 30 into 3 and 0 would make the sequence [2,2,3,0], which is not sorted.

Wait, there's a mismatch here.

In my logic, I'm choosing the smallest option >= last, but in reality, splitting 30 into 3 and 0 would insert both 3 and 0 into the sequence, which would break the sorted order.

So, my logic is incomplete because choosing to split 30 into 3 and 0 would require ensuring that both 3 and 0 are placed in the sequence in that order, which cannot be achieved without breaking the sorted order.

Thus, I need a way to consider the entire sequence of digits when splitting a number.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of merging multiple sequences.

Each number can be represented as a sequence: if split, its digits in order; if not split, the number itself.

Then, I need to interleave these sequences in a way that maintains the sorted order.

This sounds similar to merging sorted lists, but in this case, the sequences are dependent on the choices made for each number.

This is getting too complicated for my current approach.

Maybe I need to consider all possible ways to represent each number (either as itself or as its digits) and then check if there exists a combination that is sorted.

Given that n is up to 50, and each number that's >=10 can be represented in up to two ways (split or not split), the total number of possibilities could be up to 2^m, where m is the number of elements >=10.

With n=50 and assuming up to 50 elements >=10, 2^50 is way too large, so this brute-force approach is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the sequence sorted if the digits are smaller than the number itself.

In other words, splitting allows for smaller elements to be inserted into the sequence, which can help in maintaining the sorted order.

But in some cases, as we've seen, splitting can lead to sequences that are harder to sort.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal possible sequence by splitting all possible numbers, and then checking if that sequence is sorted.

But that might not be sufficient, as in the earlier example [32,2,30], where splitting all possible numbers doesn't lead to a sorted sequence.

Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal possible sequence by choosing to split numbers only when necessary to maintain the sorted order.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty sequence.

Initialize last = -1

For each element in the array:

if element < 10:

if element >= last:

append element to sequence

last = element

else:

return False

else:

# element >=10

if element >= last:

# Option 1: keep the number as is

option1 = element

# Option 2: split the number into digits

digits = [element // 10, element % 10]

if digits[0] >= last:

# If splitting, need to ensure that both digits are >= last

if digits[1] >= digits[0]:

option2 = digits[1]

else:

# Splitting would not help because digits are not in non-decreasing order

option2 = None

else:

option2 = None

else:

# Only Option 1 is possible

if element >= last:

option1 = element

else:

return False

# Choose the smallest option >= last

possible_options = [o for o in [option1, option2] if o is not None and o >= last]

if not possible_options:

return False

chosen = min(possible_options)

append chosen to sequence

last = chosen

return True

Let me test this logic with [32,2,30]

Start with last=-1

First element:32 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 32, option1=32

Option 2: split into 3 and 2

digits=[3,2]

since 3 >= -1 and 2 >=3? No, 2 < 3, so option2=None

So, only option1=32 is possible

append 32 to sequence, last=32

Next element:2

2 >=32? No, cannot proceed, return False

Which is correct, because [32,2,30] cannot be sorted with any operations.

Another test: [12,3,45,67]

Start with last=-1

First element:12 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 12, option1=12

Option 2: split into 1 and 2

digits=[1,2]

1 >= -1 and 2 >=1, so option2=2

Possible options: [12,2], choose the smallest >=-1, which is 2

append 2 to sequence, last=2

Next element:3 >=2: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 3, option1=3

Option 2: split into 3 (since 3 <10, no split), option2=None

Choose option1=3

append 3 to sequence, last=3

Next element:45 >=3: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 45, option1=45

Option 2: split into 4 and 5

digits=[4,5]

4 >=3 and 5 >=4, so option2=5

Possible options: [45,5], choose the smallest >=3, which is 5

append 5 to sequence, last=5

Next element:67 >=5: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 67, option1=67

Option 2: split into 6 and 7

digits=[6,7]

6 >=5 and 7 >=6, so option2=7

Possible options: [67,7], choose the smallest >=5, which is 7

append 7 to sequence, last=7

So, sequence is [2,3,5,7], which is sorted. So, YES.

Seems correct.

Another test: [12,28,5]

Start with last=-1

First element:12 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 12, option1=12

Option 2: split into 1 and 2, option2=2

Possible options: [12,2], choose 2

append 2 to sequence, last=2

Next element:28 >=2: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 28, option1=28

Option 2: split into 2 and 8, option2=8

Possible options: [28,8], choose 8

append 8 to sequence, last=8

Next element:5 >=8? No, cannot proceed, return False

Which matches the expected output of NO.

So, this logic seems to work for these cases.

Let me try another example: [19,2,30]

Start with last=-1

First element:19 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 19, option1=19

Option 2: split into 1 and 9, option2=9

Possible options: [19,9], choose 9

append 9 to sequence, last=9

Next element:2 >=9? No, cannot proceed, return False

Which is correct.

Another example: [3,25,30]

Start with last=-1

First element:3 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 3, option1=3

Option 2: split into 3 (since 3<10, no split), option2=None

Choose option1=3

append 3 to sequence, last=3

Next element:25 >=3: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 25, option1=25

Option 2: split into 2 and 5, option2=5

Possible options: [25,5], choose 5

append 5 to sequence, last=5

Next element:30 >=5: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 30, option1=30

Option 2: split into 3 and 0, option2=3 (since 0 <3, option2 is invalid)

So, only option1=30 is possible

append 30 to sequence, last=30

So, sequence is [3,5,30], which is sorted. So, YES.

Seems correct.

Wait, but if I choose to keep 25 instead of splitting, the sequence would be [3,25,30], which is also sorted.

But in my logic, I chose to split 25 into 5, leading to [3,5,30], which is still sorted.

So, it's still correct.

Another example: [1,22,3]

Start with last=-1

First element:1 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 1, option1=1

Option 2: split into 1 (since 1<10, no split), option2=None

Choose option1=1

append 1 to sequence, last=1

Next element:22 >=1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 22, option1=22

Option 2: split into 2 and 2, option2=2

Possible options: [22,2], choose 2

append 2 to sequence, last=2

Next element:3 >=2: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 3, option1=3

Option 2: split into 3 (since 3<10, no split), option2=None

Choose option1=3

append 3 to sequence, last=3

So, sequence is [1,2,3], which is sorted. So, YES.

Good.

What if the array is [11,11,11]?

Start with last=-1

First element:11 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 11, option1=11

Option 2: split into 1 and 1, option2=1

Possible options: [11,1], choose 1

append 1 to sequence, last=1

Next element:11 >=1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 11, option1=11

Option 2: split into 1 and 1, option2=1

Possible options: [11,1], choose 1

append 1 to sequence, last=1

Next element:11 >=1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 11, option1=11

Option 2: split into 1 and 1, option2=1

Possible options: [11,1], choose 1

append 1 to sequence, last=1

So, sequence is [1,1,1], which is sorted. So, YES.

But if I choose to keep some 11's, would that affect?

If I choose to keep the first 11, then sequence becomes [11], last=11

Next element:11 >=11: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 11, option1=11

Option 2: split into 1 and 1, option2=1

But 1 <11, so option2 is invalid

So, only option1=11

append 11 to sequence, last=11

Next element:11 >=11: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 11, option1=11

Option 2: split into 1 and 1, option2=1

Again, only option1=11

append 11 to sequence, last=11

So, sequence is [11,11,11], which is sorted. So, YES.

Thus, in this case, choosing to keep some numbers as is also works.

So, the logic seems to handle this correctly.

Another test case: [5,15,2]

Start with last=-1

First element:5 >=-1: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 5, option1=5

Option 2: split into 5 (since 5<10, no split), option2=None

Choose option1=5

append 5 to sequence, last=5

Next element:15 >=5: yes, options:

Option 1: keep 15, option1=15

Option 2: split into 1 and 5, option2=5

Possible options: [15,5], choose 5

append 5 to sequence, last=5

Next element:2 >=5? No, cannot proceed, return False

So, NO.

Which seems correct, because [5,15,2] cannot be sorted with any operations.

Wait, let's see:

If I keep 15, sequence would be [5,15], then 2 >=15? No.

If I split 15 into 1 and 5, sequence would be [5,1,5], then 2 >=5? No.

So, indeed, cannot be sorted.

Seems correct.

So, based on these tests, this logic seems to work.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

I need to iterate through the array, keeping track of the last value in the sequence.

For each element, if it's less than 10, it must be >= last.

If it's >=10, I have two options:

1. Keep it as is, if it's >= last.

2. Split it into digits, and choose the last digit as the value to append to the sequence, provided that the first digit is >= last and the second digit is >= the first digit.

Then, choose the smallest possible option >= last.

This seems manageable.

I need to make sure that when splitting, both digits are in non-decreasing order.

Wait, in my earlier logic, I only check if the second digit >= the first digit, but in reality, when splitting, both digits need to be inserted into the sequence in order.

So, in the sequence, after splitting 15 into 1 and 5, the sequence would have both 1 and 5 inserted in that order.

So, I need to ensure that both 1 and 5 are >= last.

Wait, no.

In the earlier logic, when splitting 15 into 1 and 5, I need to ensure that 1 >= last, and then 5 >=1.

So, the sequence would be [current sequence, 1,5], and both need to satisfy the sorted order.

Hence, 1 >= last, and 5 >=1.

Similarly, when keeping 15, it's [current sequence,15], with 15 >= last.

So, in the choice, I need to consider both possibilities and see if any of them lead to a sorted sequence.

In the earlier example [5,15,2], when considering 15:

- Option 1: keep 15, which would require 15 >=5, which is true.

- Option 2: split into 1 and 5, which would require 1 >=5? No, 1 <5, so cannot split.

Hence, only Option 1 is possible, leading to [5,15], then 2 >=15? No, so cannot proceed.

Hence, NO.

Seems correct.

Another example: [1,22,3]

When considering 22:

- Option 1: keep 22, which is >=1.

- Option 2: split into 2 and 2, which are both >=1.

So, possible options are 22 and 2.

Choose the smallest >=1, which is 2.

Append 2 to the sequence, last=2.

Then, 3 >=2: yes, append 3, last=3.

So, sequence is [1,2,3], which is sorted.

Good.

So, in code, I need to implement this logic.

I need to handle each element based on whether it's less than 10 or not.

If it's less than 10, no split, just check if it's >= last.

If it's >=10, choose to either keep it as is (if >= last) or split it into digits (if the first digit >= last and the second digit >= the first digit), and choose the smallest possible option >= last.

Then, proceed accordingly.

I need to implement this in a way that's efficient and doesn't involve unnecessary computations.

Given that n is up to 50 and t is up to 10^3, a straightforward implementation should work.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the program:

m = int(input())

b = []

for i in range(m):

func_1()

for i in range(m):

if b[i] == 1:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

def func_1():

k = int(input())

a = input()

a = list(map(int, a.split()))

x = 0

y = 0

n = 0

c = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y >= c[n - 1]:

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

d = sorted(c)

if c == d:

b.append(1)

else:

b.append(0)

So, the program defines a function func_1() that processes each test case.

It reads the input, processes the array a, builds a new array c based on some conditions, sorts it, and checks if c is sorted.

But looking at the logic inside func_1():

It iterates through the array a, and for each element:

- If it's >10 and not the first element, it splits it into digits x and y.

- It checks if y >= the last element in c.

- If y <= x, it appends y and x to c.

- Else, it appends the original number a[i] to c.

- If it's the first element and >10, it splits into digits and appends them if y <= x, else appends the original number.

- If the element is <=10, it appends it as is.

Then, it sorts c and checks if c is sorted.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if c == d, where d is sorted(c).

But in the earlier examples, just splitting and checking if the resulting array is sorted isn't sufficient, because splitting is conditional based on the previous elements.

In other words, the way the program builds c doesn't take into account the previous elements when deciding whether to split or not.

It seems to split elements >10 unconditionally, without considering the sorted order.

This is different from the logic I developed earlier, where splitting is conditional based on the last element in the sequence.

Hence, this program seems flawed.

For example, in the first test case:

Input:

4

12 3 45 67

The program would split 12 into 1 and 2, and split 45 into 4 and 5, resulting in c=[1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

But in the earlier problematic example [32,2,30], the program would split 32 into 3 and 2, and split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in c=[3,2,2,3,0], which is not sorted.

Hence, the program would correctly output NO for [32,2,30], which matches the expected behavior.

But in the earlier test case [1,22,3], splitting 22 into 2 and 2 would result in c=[1,2,2,3], which is sorted, so YES, which is correct.

Another test case: [5,15,2]

Splitting 15 into 1 and 5 would result in c=[5,1,5,2], which is not sorted, so NO, which is correct.

Seems like the program's approach, although simplistic, might still be correct for these cases.

But in the earlier problematic example [19,2,30], splitting 19 into 1 and 9, and splitting 30 into 3 and 0, would result in c=[1,9,2,3,0], which is not sorted, so NO, which is correct.

Another test case: [15,25,30]

Splitting all into digits: [1,5,2,5,3,0], which is not sorted, but if I don't split some, it might be possible.

Wait, according to the program, it splits all eligible numbers, and checks if the resulting array is sorted.

But in the earlier logic, I was choosing to split only when necessary.

So, in this program's approach, it seems to always split all numbers >10, and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.

But in reality, splitting is optional, and not always beneficial.

However, in the examples I tested, it seems to give the correct answers.

Perhaps, for the problem's constraints, this approach works.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about a case where this approach might fail.

Consider the array [15, 5, 25]

If I split all numbers >10, I get [1,5,5,2,5], which is not sorted.

But if I choose to keep 15 as is and split 25 into 2 and 5, I get [15,5,2,5], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if I keep 15 as is and keep 25 as is, I get [15,5,25], which is not sorted.

Another option is to split 15 into 1 and 5, and keep 25 as is, resulting in [1,5,25], which is sorted.

But the program would split all >10 numbers, resulting in [1,5,5,2,5], which is not sorted, so it would output NO.

But in reality, it's possible to make it sorted by splitting only 15 and keeping 25 as is.

Hence, the program would incorrectly output NO for this case, whereas the correct answer should be YES.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by optionally splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.
