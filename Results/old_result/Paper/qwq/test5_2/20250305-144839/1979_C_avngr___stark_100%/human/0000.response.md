Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the money I get back is more than the total amount I bet.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For each test case, there's a number n, which is the number of outcomes, and then a list of k_i values, which are the multipliers for each outcome. The k_i values are at least 2, which makes sense because if you win, you get back more than you bet.

So, for each outcome i, if it wins, I get back k_i times the amount I bet on that outcome. I need to make sure that for every possible winning outcome, the amount I get back is greater than the total amount I bet on all outcomes.

Let me try to formalize this. Let x_i be the amount I bet on outcome i. Then, the total amount bet is sum(x_i) for all i from 1 to n.

For each i, if outcome i wins, I get back k_i * x_i coins. I need k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j from 1 to n.

This needs to hold for every i from 1 to n.

Hmm, this seems like a system of inequalities:

For each i:

k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j

I need to find integer values for x_i that satisfy all these inequalities simultaneously.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a way to find a common multiple or something.

Wait, maybe I can think about it in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) of the k_i values.

But actually, in the code provided, there's a function func_2 which computes something similar to the LCM using another function func_1, which calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using their absolute product divided by their GCD.

So, func_2 seems to be computing the LCM of all k_i in the list.

Then, in the main part of the code, for each test case, it computes m = LCM of all k_i, then sets c_i = m // k_i for each i.

So, c_i is essentially m divided by k_i.

Then, it checks if sum(c_i) for all i is greater than or equal to m. If it is, it prints -1, meaning no solution exists. Otherwise, it prints the c_i values.

Wait, that seems interesting. Let me see why this works.

First, let's recall that if I set x_i = m / k_i, where m is the LCM of all k_i, then k_i * x_i = m for each i.

But, in this case, sum(x_i) needs to be less than m, because m is the amount I get back for any winning outcome.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if sum(c_i) >= m, and if so, it prints -1.

Wait, but according to my previous thought, sum(c_i) should be equal to m, because c_i = m / k_i, and sum(m / k_i) over all i.

But actually, in the example, for the first test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

m = LCM of 3,2,7, which is 42.

Then, c = [42//3, 42//2, 42//7] = [14,21,6]

Sum of c = 14+21+6=41, which is less than 42.

In the code, it would print the c_i values since sum(c_i)=41 < m=42.

But in the sample output, it's printing 27 41 12, which sums to 80, and m would be 42, but wait, in the sample output, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the code.

Looking back at the code, it's using func_2 to compute m, which is the LCM of all k_i.

Then, c_i = m // k_i.

Then, it checks if sum(c_i) >= m. If yes, print -1; else, print c_i.

In the first test case, sum(c_i)=41 < 42, so it prints c_i.

But in the sample output, it's printing 27 41 12, which sums to 80.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is not matching the sample output.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking again at the code:

It's using func_2 to compute m, which is the LCM of all k_i.

Then, c_i = m // k_i.

Then, it checks if sum(c_i) >= m. If yes, print -1; else, print c_i.

But in the sample output, for the first test case, it's printing 27 41 12, which sums to 80.

But according to the code, it should print c_i = [14,21,6], sum=41 < 42, so why is it printing 27 41 12?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the code is not matching the sample output, or perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, in the sample input, there are 6 test cases, and in the first one, n=3, k=[3,2,7], and the output is 27 41 12.

But according to the code, it should be printing [m//k_i] = [42//3,42//2,42//7] = [14,21,6], but the sample output is 27 41 12.

So, perhaps the code is not correct, or perhaps there's something I'm missing.

Wait, maybe the LCM needs to be adjusted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set x_i = m / k_i, where m is some common multiple of all k_i.

Then, for each i, k_i * x_i = m.

I need sum(x_j) < m.

But sum(x_j) = sum(m / k_j) for all j.

So, sum(m / k_j) < m.

Dividing both sides by m: sum(1 / k_j) < 1.

So, the condition for a solution to exist is that sum(1 / k_j) < 1.

If that's the case, then m can be set to the LCM of all k_i, and x_i = m / k_i.

But in the code, it's checking sum(c_i) >= m, which seems different.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of inequalities.

Let me consider the inequalities:

For each i:

k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j.

But if I set x_i = c_i = m / k_i, then k_i * x_i = m.

And sum(x_j) = sum(m / k_j) = m * sum(1 / k_j).

So, for the condition to hold, m > m * sum(1 / k_j), which simplifies to 1 > sum(1 / k_j).

So, as long as sum(1 / k_j) < 1, a solution exists.

And in that case, setting x_i = m / k_i, where m is the LCM of all k_i, should work, because sum(x_j) = m * sum(1 / k_j) < m.

But in the sample output, for the first test case, sum(1 / k_j) = 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/7 = (14 + 21 + 6)/42 = 41/42 < 1, so a solution exists.

And according to the code, it should print c_i = [14,21,6], sum=41 < 42.

But in the sample output, it's printing 27 41 12, sum=80.

Wait, that's different.

So, perhaps the code is not matching the sample output.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

It's computing m = LCM of all k_i.

Then, c_i = m // k_i.

Then, it checks if sum(c_i) >= m.

If yes, print -1; else, print c_i.

But in the first test case, sum(c_i)=41 < 42, so it should print [14,21,6], but the sample output is 27 41 12.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Maybe the bets need to be scaled up by some factor to make sum(x_j) < m.

Wait, perhaps the minimal m is not sufficient, and I need to choose a larger m.

Wait, but in the sample output, for n=3, k=[3,2,7], it's printing 27 41 12, sum=80.

Let's check:

m = LCM of 3,2,7 is 42.

But 42 * (1/3 + 1/2 + 1/7) = 42 * (14/42 + 21/42 + 6/42) = 42 * (41/42) = 41 < 42, so it should work with m=42.

But in the sample output, it's using 80.

Wait, maybe m needs to be adjusted to be greater than sum(x_j), but in this case, m=42, sum(x_j)=41 < 42, so it should work.

But perhaps the code is not correctly implementing this.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that x_i must be integers, and perhaps m needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, in the first test case, with m=42, x_i=[14,21,6], sum=41 < 42, which satisfies the condition.

But in the sample output, it's printing 27 41 12, which sums to 80.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple solutions, and the code is finding a different one.

But according to the problem statement, if there are multiple solutions, any one can be printed.

So, perhaps the code is correct, and it's finding a different valid solution.

But in the second test case, n=2, k=[3,3], the output is 1 1.

With m=3, x_i=[1,1], sum=2 < 3.

Which is correct.

In the third test case, n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5], output is -1.

Sum(1/5)*5=1, which is not less than m=5, so no solution exists.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13], output is 1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071, sum=11614, m=LCM of all k_i.

Let's compute LCM of [7,9,3,17,9,13].

LCM of 7,9 is 63; LCM of 63,3 is 63; LCM of 63,17 is 1071; LCM of 1071,9 is 1071; LCM of 1071,13 is 13923.

So m=13923.

Then x_i = m // k_i = [13923//7,13923//9,13923//3,13923//17,13923//9,13923//13] = [1989, 1547, 4641, 819, 1547, 1071], sum=11614 < 13923, which is correct.

In the fifth test case, n=3, k=[6,3,2], output is -1.

Sum(1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2) = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 =1, which is not less than m, so no solution exists.

In the sixth test case, n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3], output is 8 18 12 9 24, sum=71.

Let's check:

m=LCM of [9,4,6,8,3]=72.

x_i=[72//9,72//4,72//6,72//8,72//3]=[8,18,12,9,24], sum=71 <72.

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, the code seems to be working correctly.

But in the first test case, according to the code, it should print [14,21,6], sum=41<42, but the sample output is [27,41,12], sum=80.

Is there a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the code is not correctly implemented.

Looking back at the code:

It's using func_2 to compute m, which is the LCM of all k_i.

Then, c_i = m // k_i.

Then, it checks if sum(c_i) >= m.

If yes, print -1; else, print c_i.

In the first test case, sum(c_i)=41 <42, so it should print [14,21,6].

But in the sample output, it's printing [27,41,12].

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to scale m to ensure that sum(c_i) < m.

But in this case, with m=42, sum(c_i)=41 <42, which should be acceptable.

But perhaps the problem requires a different scaling.

Wait, maybe the bets need to be scaled up by a factor to make sum(x_j) < m.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, it's printing [8,18,12,9,24], which is exactly m // k_i with m=72.

So, perhaps in some cases, m needs to be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample output is just showing a different valid solution.

But in the first test case, [14,21,6] is a valid solution, but the sample output shows [27,41,12].

So, maybe there are multiple valid solutions, and the code is finding a different one.

But in the second test case, it's printing [1,1], which matches m//k_i with m=3.

In the fourth test case, it's printing [1989,1547,4641,819,1547,1071], which matches m//k_i with m=13923.

In the sixth test case, it's printing [8,18,12,9,24], which matches m//k_i with m=72.

So, perhaps in the first test case, the code should print [14,21,6], but the sample output is [27,41,12].

Wait, maybe I need to check if [27,41,12] is a valid solution.

Let's check:

sum(x_j)=27+41+12=80.

For each i:

If outcome 1 wins: 3*27=81 >80.

Outcome 2: 2*41=82>80.

Outcome 3:7*12=84>80.

So, it's valid.

But according to the code, it should print [14,21,6], which also sums to 41<42.

But 14*3=42>41, 21*2=42>41, 6*7=42>41.

So, that's also valid.

So, multiple solutions exist.

Perhaps the code can be modified to find a minimal sum or something, but the problem allows any valid solution.

So, the code seems to be correct in finding a valid solution when it exists, and printing -1 when it doesn't.

Hence, Correctness: **True**
