Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array. An array \( a \) of length \( m \) is considered good if there exists another integer array \( b \) of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in \( a \) is equal to the sum of elements in \( b \).

2. For every index \( i \), \( a_i \) is not equal to \( b_i \).

3. Every element in \( b \) is greater than 0.

And I'm given an array \( c \) of length \( n \), where each element is greater than 0. Then, there are \( q \) queries, each asking whether a subarray from index \( l_i \) to \( r_i \) is good.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good". So, for a given subarray \( c_l \) to \( c_r \), I need to check if there exists an array \( b \) that satisfies the three conditions above.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions:

- The sum of \( a \) should equal the sum of \( b \).

- All elements in \( b \) are positive integers.

- No element in \( b \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( a \).

Given that \( a \) is the subarray of \( c \) from \( l \) to \( r \), and \( b \) is another array with the same length, I need to find if such a \( b \) exists that meets these criteria.

Let me think about this. If I have \( a \) and I need \( b \) such that \( sum(a) = sum(b) \), and \( b_i \neq a_i \) for all \( i \), and \( b_i > 0 \), what does that imply?

Well, for each \( a_i \), \( b_i \) must be a positive integer not equal to \( a_i \). So, if \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) can be 2, 3, 4, etc. If \( a_i = 2 \), \( b_i \) can be 1, 3, 4, etc.

The sum of \( b \) must equal the sum of \( a \). So, the differences \( b_i - a_i \) must sum to zero over all \( i \).

Wait a minute, let's define \( d_i = b_i - a_i \). Then, \( sum(d_i) = 0 \), and \( d_i \neq 0 \) for all \( i \), and \( b_i = a_i + d_i > 0 \), which implies \( d_i > -a_i \).

So, \( d_i \) are non-zero integers such that \( sum(d_i) = 0 \), and \( d_i > -a_i \) for all \( i \).

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at this.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for \( b \):

- The minimal sum occurs when \( b_i \) is the smallest possible positive integer not equal to \( a_i \).

- If \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \) must be at least 2.

- If \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i \) can be as small as 1.

So, the minimal possible sum for \( b \) is:

\( sum_{min} = sum(max(1, a_i - 1)) \)

Wait, no. If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) must be at least 2. If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \) can be as small as 1.

So, \( sum_{min} = sum(2) \) for \( a_i = 1 \), and \( sum(1) \) for \( a_i > 1 \).

Similarly, there's no upper bound on \( b_i \), but since we need \( sum(b) = sum(a) \), we have to make sure that the sum matches.

So, for the subarray to be "good", it must be possible to adjust each \( a_i \) to some \( b_i \) such that the sum doesn't change, \( b_i > 0 \), and \( b_i \neq a_i \).

Let me think about the constraints:

- If all \( a_i > 1 \), then setting \( b_i = a_i - 1 \) would satisfy \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq a_i \), but then \( sum(b) = sum(a) - m \), which is less than \( sum(a) \), so to make \( sum(b) = sum(a) \), I need to adjust some \( b_i \) to higher values to compensate for the overall reduction.

- If there are \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \geq 2 \), which increases the sum by at least 1 for each such \( a_i \).

So, I need to balance the increases and decreases in \( b_i \) to keep the sum equal to \( sum(a) \).

This seems tricky. Maybe I can look for a condition that makes it impossible for the subarray to be good, and then conclude that if those conditions aren't met, it is good.

Let's consider some examples:

Example 1:

n = 5, q = 4

c = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5 → subarray [1,2,1,4,5]

2. l=4, r=4 → subarray [4]

3. l=3, r=4 → subarray [1,4]

4. l=1, r=3 → subarray [1,2,1]

According to the sample output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, let's try to understand why some are YES and some are NO.

First query: [1,2,1,4,5]

- sum = 1+2+1+4+5 = 13

- We need to find b = [b1,b2,b3,b4,b5], all bi > 0, bi != ai, and sum(bi) = 13.

Possible b:

- For a_i=1, b_i >=2

- For a_i=2, b_i !=2, so can be 1 or >=3

- For a_i=1, b_i >=2

- For a_i=4, b_i !=4, so can be 1 to 3 or 5 or more

- For a_i=5, b_i !=5, so can be 1 to 4 or 6 or more

One possible b: [2,1,2,3,5] → sum=13, all b_i != a_i, and b_i >0.

So, it's possible → YES

Second query: [4]

- sum=4

- Need b=[b1], b1 !=4, b1>0, and sum(b)=4 → so b1=4 is not allowed, but sum must be 4.

So, b1 cannot be 4, but must be 4, which is impossible → NO

Third query: [1,4]

- sum=5

- Possible b: [2,3] → sum=5, both b_i != a_i, and b_i >0 → YES

Fourth query: [1,2,1]

- sum=4

- Possible b: [2,1,2] → sum=5, which is not equal to 4 → not good.

Wait, sum is 5, which is not equal to original sum 4 → not good.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's NO, which matches.

Wait, but in the explanation above, I thought it should be NO, which matches the sample output.

So, seems like the logic is consistent.

From these examples, it seems that:

- If there is only one element, and it's being replaced by something else, but the sum must remain the same, which is only possible if a_i != b_i and b_i = a_i, which is impossible → NO

- For multiple elements, it's possible to adjust them as long as there are enough elements that can be increased or decreased to balance the sum.

But, I need a general condition to determine if a subarray is good or not.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal possible sums for b.

Minimal sum for b:

- For each a_i >1, b_i can be 1

- For a_i =1, b_i >=2

So, sum_min = number of a_i >1 *1 + number of a_i=1 *2

Similarly, maximal sum for b is unbounded, but since we need sum(b)=sum(a), we don't really care about the upper bound.

So, sum_min = (number of a_i >1) + 2*(number of a_i=1)

If sum(a) < sum_min, then it's impossible to have sum(b)=sum(a), because even the minimal sum of b is greater than sum(a).

If sum(a) >= sum_min, then it might be possible.

But, there's another condition: we need to have sum(b) = sum(a), and b_i != a_i for all i.

Wait, in the first query, sum(a)=13, sum_min=2+1+2+1+1=7, which is less than 13, and it's possible.

In the third query, sum(a)=5, sum_min=2+1=3, which is less than 5, and it's possible.

In the fourth query, sum(a)=4, sum_min=1+1+2=4, which equals sum(a).

Is it possible to have b such that sum(b)=4, b_i !=a_i, and b_i>0?

Wait, a=[1,2,1], sum=4

sum_min=1+1+2=4

So, b must be [1,1,2]

But, a[1]=1, b[1]=1, which violates b_i !=a_i.

So, even though sum(b)=sum(a), there is a conflict because b_i must not equal a_i.

Hence, it's impossible → NO

So, in this case, sum_min = sum(a), but because of the constraint b_i !=a_i, it's still impossible.

So, the condition sum(a) >= sum_min is necessary but not sufficient.

I need a stronger condition.

Let me think about the difference between sum(a) and sum_min.

If sum(a) >= sum_min, then the difference d = sum(a) - sum_min >=0

Then, I need to distribute this difference d among the elements where b_i > minimal b_i.

But, I also have to ensure that b_i != a_i.

Wait, in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, sum_min=4, but it's impossible because for a=[1,2,1], minimal b=[1,1,2], but b[1]=1 != a[1]=2, which is okay, but b[1]=1 !=a[1]=2, actually it's okay.

Wait, a=[1,2,1], minimal b=[2,1,2], sum=6, which is more than sum(a)=4.

Wait, earlier I thought minimal b=[1,1,2], but b[1]=1 !=a[1]=2 is okay.

Wait, no, if a_i=1, b_i must be >=2, and if a_i>1, b_i can be 1.

So, for a=[1,2,1], minimal b=[2,1,2], sum=5.

Wait, but sum(a)=4, sum_min=5, which is greater than sum(a), so it's impossible.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum_min=1+1+2=4, but actually, for a_i=1, b_i>=2, and for a_i=2, b_i can be 1 or >=3.

So, minimal b=[2,1,2], sum=5.

Wait, but sum(a)=4, which is less than sum_min=5 → impossible → NO

But in the sample output, it's NO, which matches.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's sum_min=5, which is greater than sum(a)=4, so impossible.

Hence, the condition is sum(a) >= sum_min.

But in the third query, sum(a)=5, sum_min=3, which is less than sum(a), and it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum_min=2+1=3 for [1,4], sum(a)=5, which is greater than sum_min=3, and it's possible.

Wait, but in the first query, sum(a)=13, sum_min=2+1+2+1+1=7, which is less than 13, and it's possible.

So, perhaps sum(a) >= sum_min is necessary and sufficient.

Wait, but in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, sum_min=5, which is less, so impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5, sum_min=3, which is less, and it's possible → YES

Wait, but in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, sum_min=4, and it's impossible because minimal b sums to 4, but with b_i !=a_i, which might not be possible due to specific constraints.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that sum(a) > sum_min, but in the third query, sum(a)=5, sum_min=3, which is sum(a) > sum_min, and it's possible.

In the first query, sum(a)=13, sum_min=7, sum(a) > sum_min, possible.

In the fourth query, sum(a)=4, sum_min=4, but it's impossible due to specific constraints.

So, perhaps sum(a) > sum_min is sufficient, but sum(a) == sum_min might be impossible if certain conditions aren't met.

Hence, maybe sum(a) > sum_min is sufficient, and sum(a) < sum_min is impossible, and sum(a) == sum_min needs to be checked for specific constraints.

But, in practice, for implementation, it might be too slow to check for each query whether sum(a) == sum_min is possible or not.

I need a better way to generalize this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray of length m.

Define:

- k = number of a_i ==1

- m - k = number of a_i >1

Then,

sum_min = k*2 + (m - k)*1 = k*2 + m - k = k + m

So, sum_min = m + k

Where k is the number of a_i ==1.

Now, sum(a) must equal sum(b), and sum(b) >= sum_min = m + k

So, if sum(a) < m + k, impossible.

If sum(a) >= m + k, possible.

But, in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m=3, k=2 (since two a_i=1), so m + k =5, which is greater than sum(a)=4 → impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5, m=2, k=1 (one a_i=1), m + k=3, which is less than sum(a)=5 → possible → YES

In the first query, sum(a)=13, m=5, k=2 (two a_i=1), m + k=7, which is less than sum(a)=13 → possible → YES

In the second query, sum(a)=4, m=1, k=0 (no a_i=1), m + k=1 +0=1, which is less than sum(a)=4, but it's impossible because m=1, and a_i=4, so b_i !=4, but sum(b)=4, which is only possible if b_i=4, which violates b_i !=a_i → NO

Wait, but according to earlier analysis, sum_min = m + k, and sum(a) >= m + k is necessary, but not sufficient when m=1.

Hence, perhaps there is an additional condition when m=1.

So, generalizing:

- If m >=2, then sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient.

- If m=1, then it's impossible unless a_i != b_i, but sum(a) = sum(b), which implies a_i = b_i, which is impossible unless a_i !=a_i, which is never true → hence, for m=1, it's always NO.

Wait, but in the second query, m=1, a_i=4, sum(a)=4, need b_i !=4 and sum(b)=4, which is impossible because b_i cannot be 4 but must sum to 4 → NO

In the fourth query, m=3, sum(a)=4, sum_min=5, which is less → impossible → NO

In the third query, m=2, sum(a)=5, sum_min=3, which is less → possible → YES

In the first query, m=5, sum(a)=13, sum_min=7, which is less → possible → YES

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If m=1, then NO

- Else, if sum(a) >= m + k, then YES, else NO

Wait, but in the fourth query, m=3, sum(a)=4, sum_min=4, which is equal, but it's impossible due to specific constraints → so perhaps sum(a) > m + k is required.

Wait, but in the third query, sum(a)=5, m + k=3, which is less, and it's possible.

In the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m + k=3 +2=5, which is greater, but it's impossible due to specific constraints.

Wait, m + k =3 +2=5, sum(a)=4 < m + k → impossible → NO

Wait, no, in the fourth query, m=3, k=2 (two a_i=1), m + k=5, sum(a)=4 <5 → impossible → NO

In the third query, m=2, k=1, m + k=3, sum(a)=5 >=3 → possible → YES

In the first query, m=5, k=2, m + k=7, sum(a)=13 >=7 → possible → YES

In the second query, m=1, k=0, m + k=1, sum(a)=4 >=1, but m=1 → NO

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If m=1, then NO

- Else, if sum(a) > m + k, then YES

- Else if sum(a) == m + k, need to check if it's possible to have b_i !=a_i for all i

But, in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m + k=5, which is less → impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5, m + k=3, which is less → possible → YES

Wait, m + k seems to be m + k=3, sum(a)=5 >3 → possible → YES

In the fourth query, m + k=5, sum(a)=4 <5 → impossible → NO

So, perhaps sum(a) > m + k is sufficient, and sum(a) <= m + k is impossible.

But in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m + k=5, which is sum(a) < m + k → impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5 > m + k=3 → possible → YES

In the first query, sum(a)=13 > m + k=7 → possible → YES

In the second query, m=1, which is a special case → NO

Hence, perhaps the general condition is:

- If m=1, then NO

- Else, if sum(a) > m + k, then YES

- Else if sum(a) == m + k, need to check additional constraints

But, in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m + k=5, which is sum(a) < m + k → impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5 > m + k=3 → possible → YES

In the first query, sum(a)=13 > m + k=7 → possible → YES

So, perhaps it's sum(a) >= m + k, and m >=2

But in the fourth query, sum(a)=4, m + k=5, which is sum(a) < m + k, and m=3 >=2 → impossible → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5 >= m + k=3, and m=2 >=2 → possible → YES

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

- If m=1, then NO

- Else, if sum(a) >= m + k, then YES

- Else, NO

But, in the fourth query, sum(a)=4 < m + k=5, and m=3 >=2 → NO

In the third query, sum(a)=5 >= m + k=3, and m=2 >=2 → YES

In the first query, sum(a)=13 >= m + k=7, and m=5 >=2 → YES

In the second query, m=1 → NO

So, perhaps this is the general condition.

But, I need to verify if sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient when m >=2.

Let's see.

Take m=2, k=1, sum_min=3

sum(a)=3, is it possible to have b_i !=a_i for both elements?

Suppose a=[1,2], sum=3

Minimal b=[2,1], sum=3, which satisfies b_i !=a_i, and b_i >0 → YES

So, sum(a)=m + k=3 is possible → YES

Similarly, in the fourth query, m=3, k=2, sum_min=5, sum(a)=4 <5 → impossible → NO

Hence, sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient when m >=2

Hence, the condition is:

- If m=1, NO

- Else if m >=2 and sum(a) >= m + k, YES

- Else, NO

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to preprocess the array to compute prefix sums and prefix counts of a_i=1.

Given that n and q can be up to 3e5, I need an efficient way to compute for each query the sum of the subarray and the number of a_i=1 in the subarray.

So, I can compute prefix sums and prefix counts of a_i=1.

Then, for each query [l,r], m = r - l +1

sum(a) = prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l-1]

k = prefix_count[r] - prefix_count[l-1]

Then, if m=1, NO

Else if m >=2 and sum(a) >= m + k, YES

Else, NO

This seems efficient, as it's O(n + q)

Now, looking at the given program:

It seems to implement this logic.

It reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and q, then reads the array nums.

Then, it computes two arrays:

ones: prefix counts of a_i=1

sum: prefix sums of a_i -1

Then, for each query, it computes:

onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l-1]

sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l-1]

Then, it checks if l==r, prints NO

Else if 2*onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange, prints YES, else NO

Wait, let's see.

m = r - l +1

sum(a) = sumInRange + (r - l +1), because sum array is sum of a_i -1

Wait, sum array is defined as sum[i] = sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] -1

So, sum[i] is sum of (a_i -1) from i=1 to i

Hence, sum[r] - sum[l-1] = sum of (a_i -1) from i=l to i=r

Which is sum(a[l..r]) - (r - l +1)

So, sum(a) = sumInRange + (r - l +1)

Wait, but in the code, sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l-1], which is sum of (a_i -1) from l to r.

Hence, sum(a) = sumInRange + (r - l +1)

Similarly, ones[r] - ones[l-1] is the count of a_i=1 in the range l to r.

So, onesInRange = number of a_i=1 in the subarray.

Now, the condition in the code is:

if l == r:

print('NO')

else:

if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Simplify the condition:

2*onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange = onesInRange + (r - l +1)

So, it's checking if onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sumInRange

But sumInRange = sum(a) - (r - l +1)

Hence, the condition is:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum(a) - (r - l +1)

Which simplifies to:

onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sum(a) - (r - l +1)

=> onesInRange + 2*(r - l +1) <= sum(a)

But earlier, I thought the condition should be sum(a) >= m + k, where m = r - l +1, k = onesInRange

m + k = (r - l +1) + onesInRange

So, sum(a) >= (r - l +1) + onesInRange

Which is the same as sum(a) - (r - l +1) >= onesInRange

Which is sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's checking onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sumInRange + (r - l +1)

Wait, no, sumInRange = sum(a) - (r - l +1)

So, sum(a) = sumInRange + (r - l +1)

Hence, sum(a) >= m + k => sumInRange + (r - l +1) >= (r - l +1) + onesInRange

=> sumInRange >= onesInRange

So, the condition should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's onesInRange + (r - l +1) <= sumInRange

Wait, that would be:

onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

Wait, no, sumInRange = sum(a) - m

So, onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

=> onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

=> sum(a) >= m + onesInRange + m = m + k + m

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

I think there's a mistake in the code's condition.

It should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

Wait, no, sumInRange = sum(a) - m

And sum(a) >= m + k => sum(a) - m >= k => sumInRange >= onesInRange

Hence, the condition should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

But the code has onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

Wait, that's incorrect.

It should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

Hence, the code has a mistake in the condition.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me re-express the condition.

We have sum(a) >= m + k

sum(a) = sumInRange + m

Hence, sumInRange + m >= m + k => sumInRange >= k

Which is sumInRange >= onesInRange

So, the condition should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

Which is different.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it produces the correct output.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying.

Let me check with the third query:

n=5, q=4

c=[1,2,1,4,5]

Query 3: l=3, r=4 → subarray [1,4]

m=2

sum(a)=5

onesInRange=1 (only one 1 in positions 3 and 4)

sumInRange = sum(a) - m =5 -2=3

Condition: onesInRange + m <= sumInRange =>1 +2 <=3 →3<=3 → true → YES

Which matches the sample output.

Fourth query: l=1, r=3 → subarray [1,2,1]

m=3

sum(a)=4

onesInRange=2

sumInRange =4 -3=1

Condition:2 +3 <=1 →5<=1 → false → NO

Which matches the sample output.

First query: l=1, r=5 → subarray [1,2,1,4,5]

m=5

sum(a)=13

onesInRange=2

sumInRange=13-5=8

Condition:2 +5 <=8 →7<=8 → true → YES

Which matches.

Second query: l=4, r=4 → subarray [4]

m=1 → directly NO

Which matches.

So, even though the condition seems off in my analysis, it produces the correct output.

Hence, perhaps my analysis is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the relationship between sum(a), sum_min, and the condition.

sum_min = m + k

sum(a) >= m + k

sum(a) - m >= k

sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

Wait, no, sumInRange = sum(a) - m

sum(a) - m >= k => sumInRange >= onesInRange

But in the code, it's onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

Which is onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

=> sum(a) >= m + onesInRange + m = m + k + m

Wait, that seems too strict.

Wait, in the third query, m=2, k=1, sum(a)=5

sum(a) >= m + k + m =>5 >=2 +1 +2 =>5 >=5 → true

But earlier, I thought sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient, which is 5 >=3 → true

But here, it's checking sum(a) >= m + k + m = m + k + m

Wait, that seems too strict.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have m elements.

Each b_i != a_i, and b_i >0.

I need sum(b) = sum(a)

Let me consider the minimal sum for b.

For each a_i:

- If a_i ==1, b_i >=2

- If a_i >1, b_i >=1 (but !=a_i)

Wait, but if a_i >1, b_i can be 1, which is allowed since b_i !=a_i unless a_i=1.

Wait, but a_i=1 implies b_i >=2, adding at least 1 to the sum.

For a_i >1, b_i can be as low as 1, which may be less than a_i.

Hence, the minimal sum for b is:

sum_min = sum(2 for a_i=1) + sum(1 for a_i >1)

Which is sum_min = k*2 + (m -k)*1 = k + m

Hence, sum_min = m + k

For sum(a) to be equal to sum(b), we need sum(a) >= sum_min = m + k

Additionally, for m=1, it's impossible since b_i !=a_i and sum(b)=sum(a) would require b_i=a_i, which is impossible.

Hence, the condition is:

- If m=1, NO

- Else if sum(a) >= m + k, YES

- Else, NO

Now, in the code:

if l == r:

print('NO')

else:

if onesInRange + m <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

But sumInRange = sum(a) - m

Hence, the condition is onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

=> sum(a) >= m + onesInRange + m = m + k + m

Wait, that seems too strict.

Wait, in the third query, m=2, k=1, sum(a)=5

Condition:5 >=2 +1 +2 →5 >=5 → true → YES

In the fourth query, m=3, k=2, sum(a)=4

Condition:4 >=3 +2 +3 →4 >=8 → false → NO

In the first query, m=5, k=2, sum(a)=13

Condition:13 >=5 +2 +5 →13 >=12 → true → YES

In the second query, m=1 → NO

So, it seems that the condition onesInRange + m <= sumInRange is equivalent to sum(a) >= m + k + m

But earlier, I thought sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that when m >=2, sum(a) >= m + k + m -1 or something.

Wait, perhaps the condition needs to account for the fact that for m >=2, sum(a) needs to be at least m + k + (m -1)

Wait, but in the third query, m=2, k=1, sum(a)=5 >=2 +1 +2=5 → true

In the fourth query, m=3, k=2, sum(a)=4 >=3 +2 +3=8 → false

In the first query, m=5, k=2, sum(a)=13 >=5 +2 +5=12 → true

Hence, it seems that sum(a) >= 2*m + k is the condition.

Wait, m + k + m = 2*m + k

But earlier, I thought sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient.

But according to this, it's sum(a) >= 2*m + k

Wait, that seems too strict.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express sum_min.

Wait, sum_min = m + k

Hence, sum(a) >= m + k is necessary.

But in the code, it's checking sum(a) >= 2*m + k

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

The condition is:

if l == r:

print('NO')

else:

if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l +1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Simplify:

2 * onesInRange + m - onesInRange <= sumInRange

Which is onesInRange + m <= sumInRange

But sumInRange = sum(a) - m

Hence, onesInRange + m <= sum(a) - m

=> sum(a) >= onesInRange + 2*m

So, sum(a) >= k + 2*m

But earlier, I thought sum(a) >= m + k is sufficient.

Hence, the code seems to have a mistake.

Wait, but in the sample input, it produces the correct output.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, q=2

c=[1,1,1]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=3 → subarray [1,1,1]

sum(a)=3, m=3, k=3

Condition: sum(a) >= 2*m + k =>3 >=6 +3=9 → false → NO

But according to earlier analysis, sum_min = m + k =6, sum(a)=3 <6 → impossible → NO

Hence, the code's condition seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, sum_min = m + k =3 +3=6, sum(a)=3 <6 → impossible → NO

Hence, sum(a) >= 2*m +k is the condition in the code, but actually, sum_min = m +k

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it works correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider another example.

n=4, q=1

c=[1,1,1,2]

Query: l=1, r=4 → subarray [1,1,1,2]

m=4, k=3

sum(a)=5

sum_min = m +k =7

sum(a)=5 <7 → impossible → NO

According to the code:

condition: k + m <= sum(a) - m =>3 +4 <=5 -4 =>7 <=1 → false → NO

Hence, correct.

Another example:

n=4, q=1

c=[1,1,1,3]

Query: l=1, r=4 → subarray [1,1,1,3]

m=4, k=3

sum(a)=6

sum_min=7 →6 <7 → NO

Code's condition:3 +4 <=6 -4 →7 <=2 → false → NO

Correct.

Another example:

n=4, q=1

c=[1,1,2,3]

Query: l=1, r=4 → subarray [1,1,2,3]

m=4, k=2

sum(a)=7

sum_min=6 →7 >=6 → possible → YES

Code's condition:2 +4 <=7 -4 →6 <=3 → false → NO

Which is incorrect, as per my earlier analysis, it should be YES

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, sum(a) >= m +k is sufficient, which is 7 >=6 → possible → YES

But according to the code, it's NO

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample input, it works correctly.

Hence, perhaps the condition needs to be sum(a) >= m +k + something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m >=2, sum(a) >= m +k + (m -1)

Wait, in the above example, m=4, k=2, sum(a)=7

m +k + (m-1)=4 +2 +3=9 →7 <9 → NO

But according to earlier analysis, sum(a) >= m +k is sufficient →7 >=6 → YES

But in practice, is it possible?

a=[1,1,2,3], sum=7

Minimal b:

For a_i=1, b_i >=2

For a_i=2, b_i !=2, can be 1 or >=3

For a_i=3, b_i !=3, can be 1 or 2 or 4 or more

Let's try to find such b:

Option 1: b=[2,2,1,2], sum=7, which matches sum(a)=7, and b_i !=a_i for all i.

Hence, it's possible → YES

But according to the code's condition, it would be NO, since sum(a) < m +k + (m-1)=9

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Hence, the condition should be sum(a) >= m +k, and m >=2 → YES

Else, NO

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix it, the condition should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

Which is sum(a) - m >= k → sum(a) >= m +k

Hence, the condition should be sumInRange >= onesInRange

So, in the code, it should be:

if sumInRange >= onesInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

But currently, it's:

if onesInRange + m <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Which is too strict, as shown in the example above.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{false}} \]
