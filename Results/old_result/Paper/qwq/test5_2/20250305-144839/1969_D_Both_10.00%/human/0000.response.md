Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she bought less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the amount Bob pays her minus the amount she spent buying the items. Alice wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what Alice's profit will be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the interactions here. Alice chooses which items to buy, and Bob chooses which k items to take for free if Alice bought at least k items.

So, for Alice, she needs to select a subset of items to buy, considering that Bob will take the best k items for himself (in terms of minimizing Alice's profit).

Let me try to model this.

Let's denote S as the set of items Alice buys.

If |S| < k, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i, because she bought them and Bob didn't pay her anything.

If |S| >= k, Bob takes k items for free, and pays for the remaining |S| - k items. So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i, where T is the set of k items Bob takes for free.

Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he will choose the k items to take for free that maximize the sum of b_i, because taking higher b_i items for free reduces Alice's profit the most.

Wait, no. Let's see.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

So, Bob chooses T to minimize this expression.

Wait, actually, Bob chooses T to minimize Alice's profit, which is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

To minimize this, Bob wants to minimize sum_{i in S \ T} b_i, because the smaller sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is, the smaller the profit.

So, Bob should choose T such that sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is minimized.

But sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is minimized when T contains the items with the largest b_i.

Wait, no. If T contains items with the largest b_i, then S \ T contains items with the smallest b_i, which minimizes sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

So, Bob should choose the k items with the largest b_i in S to take for free.

Therefore, in the case where |S| >= k, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

Alice wants to maximize this profit, so she needs to choose S such that this expression is maximized.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the difference between what Bob pays and what Alice spends.

For each item i in S, Alice pays a_i, and if it's not taken by Bob, Bob pays b_i.

So, for each item i in S \ T, the net profit is b_i - a_i.

For items in T, the net profit is -a_i, since Alice paid a_i and Bob took them for free.

But Bob chooses T to minimize Alice's profit, so he chooses the k items in S with the largest b_i to be in T.

Wait, no. As I thought earlier, Bob wants to minimize sum_{i in S \ T} b_i, so he should choose T to include the items with the largest b_i in S.

So, in other words, T contains the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, S \ T contains the items in S with the smallest b_i.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which can be written as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - 2 * sum_{i in T} b_i.

Wait, let's see.

sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Bob chooses T to minimize this, so he chooses the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

Alice wants to maximize this.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider sorting the items based on some criteria.

Suppose I sort the items based on b_i in ascending order.

Then, if Alice selects a subset S, Bob will take the k items with the largest b_i in S for free.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting items and considering the cost and benefit.

Let me consider the profit for each item if Alice buys it and Bob doesn't take it for free: b_i - a_i.

But if Bob takes it for free, the profit is -a_i.

So, Alice wants to select items such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the items not taken by Bob, minus sum of a_i for all items in S, is maximized.

This seems messy.

Maybe I can reframe this.

Let me consider that Alice pays a_i for each item in S, and receives b_i for each item in S \ T.

So, her profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is equal to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Bob chooses T to minimize this, so he chooses the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose S such that this expression is maximized.

This seems tricky, but maybe I can find a way to select S optimally.

Let me consider different cases.

Case 1: |S| < k.

Then, Bob takes all items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

Alice wants to maximize this, so she should choose S to minimize sum_{i in S} a_i.

But since a_i are positive, the smallest sum is 0, by choosing S empty.

But maybe there are better options.

Case 2: |S| >= k.

Then, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

This can be rewritten as sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

I need to maximize this.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can think differently.

Let me consider the items sorted by b_i in ascending order.

Then, if Alice selects a subset S of size m >= k, the T will be the k items in S with the largest b_i.

So, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the smallest m - k b_i in S.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum of the smallest m - k b_i in S minus sum of a_i over all items in S.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of the smallest m - k b_i is as large as possible, and the sum of a_i is as small as possible.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider the difference b_i - a_i and think about selecting items based on that.

Wait, but Bob can take away the k items with the largest b_i, which affects the profit.

Perhaps I need to consider the items in a way that accounts for both b_i and a_i, considering that the k items with the largest b_i will be taken for free.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S of size m >= k.

Then, Bob takes the k items with the largest b_i in S for free.

So, Alice gets sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

I can rewrite this as sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting m - k items to keep and selling them to Bob, and buying all m items.

So, Alice buys m items and sells m - k items to Bob.

Bob pays for m - k items, and Alice paid for m items.

So, profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Again, Bob chooses T to minimize this.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Alice's profit is equal to the sum of (b_i - a_i) for items not taken by Bob minus sum of a_i for items taken by Bob.

But this seems convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose Alice decides to buy a subset S of size m.

If m < k, her profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

If m >= k, her profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

I need to find the maximum possible profit over all possible S.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5, I need an efficient algorithm.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me try to think about it in terms of selecting items to maximize profit.

Perhaps I can sort the items in a certain order and select them accordingly.

Let me consider the items sorted by some criterion.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i - a_i.

Then, Alice would want to select items with higher b_i - a_i, but Bob can take away the k items with the highest b_i, which might not be the same as highest b_i - a_i.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to consider the items in a different way.

Let me consider that for items where b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to sell them to Bob, but Bob can take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, Alice wants to have as many items as possible with b_i - a_i > 0, but Bob will take away the k with the highest b_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to select S such that the sum of b_i - a_i for the items not taken by Bob is maximized.

This seems similar to selecting a subset where the smallest m - k b_i are as large as possible, minus the sum of a_i.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose Alice selects S, and Bob selects T as the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Then, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

I can rewrite this as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Alice wants to maximize this, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, for a given S, Bob will choose T to minimize Alice's profit, which means choosing the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, Alice needs to choose S to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider the items sorted by b_i in ascending order.

Let me sort the items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for a given S, the set T that Bob chooses will be the k items in S with the largest b_i.

So, if S contains m items, T contains the k largest b_i in S.

Therefore, S \ T contains the m - k smallest b_i in S.

So, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the m - k smallest b_i in S.

And sum_{i in S} a_i is the sum of a_i over all items in S.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum of the m - k smallest b_i in S minus sum of all a_i in S.

Alice wants to maximize this.

This seems tricky to optimize directly, but maybe I can consider adding items in a certain order.

Let me consider that for items where b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to include them, but Bob can take away the ones with highest b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of including items with negative a_i, but that doesn't make sense since a_i are positive.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think about the extreme cases.

If k = 0, then Bob takes nothing for free, so he pays for all items Alice buys.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

To maximize this, she should include items where b_i - a_i > 0.

If k = n, Bob can take up to n items for free, so he can take all items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

To maximize this, she should choose S to minimize sum_{i in S} a_i, which would be S empty, giving profit 0.

But in the example, when n=2, k=0, a=[2,1], b=[1,2], the output is 1.

In this case, Alice buys the second item, sells it to Bob for 2, and pays 1, so profit is 1.

If she buys both, profit is (1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 0.

So, choosing to buy only the second item is better.

Another example: n=4, k=1, a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3].

If Alice buys all 4, Bob takes the item with b=3 (one of them), say the first one, so Alice's profit is (3 + 2 + 3) - (1 + 2 + 1 + 4) = 8 - 8 = 0.

But in the example, the output is 1, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the second example, the output is 1.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, k=1, a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3].

According to the problem, the output is 1.

So, perhaps Alice buys three items, say items 2,3,4: a=2+1+4=7, b=3+2+3=8.

Bob takes the one with the largest b_i, which is b=3, so Alice's profit is (8 - 3) - 7 = 5 - 7 = -2.

Wait, but the correct output is 1, so this is not the optimal choice.

Wait, maybe Alice buys items 1,2,3: a=1+2+1=4, b=3+3+2=8.

Bob takes the one with b=3 (either item 1 or 2), so profit is (8 - 3) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1.

Ah, that matches the sample output.

So, in this case, Alice should buy items 1,2,3, and Bob takes one of them with b=3 for free, resulting in profit 1.

Alternatively, if Alice buys only item 4, profit is 3 - 4 = -1.

Buying items 1 and 2: a=1+2=3, b=3+3=6, Bob takes one with b=3, profit (6-3) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.

So, buying items 1,2,3 gives the best profit of 1.

Okay, so in this case, it's better to buy more items, but not all of them, and let Bob take one with the highest b_i.

This suggests that Alice should choose a subset S of size m >= k, and Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i in S for free.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of b_i for S \ T is as large as possible, and the sum of a_i is as small as possible.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can sort the items in a certain way and select the subset accordingly.

Let me try to sort the items based on some combination of a_i and b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the items based on b_i - a_i in descending order.

Then, Alice would want to select items with higher b_i - a_i, but Bob can take away the k items with the highest b_i.

This is still confusing.

Maybe I need to consider the items in terms of their contribution to the profit.

Let me consider that for items in S \ T, the profit is b_i - a_i, and for items in T, the profit is -a_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's total profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is equal to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Since Bob chooses T to minimize this, he will choose the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose S such that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i is maximized.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can iterate over possible sizes m of S, and for each m, find the optimal S.

But with n up to 2e5, this is not feasible directly.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for a given S of size m >= k, the sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the smallest m - k b_i in S.

So, Alice's profit is sum of the smallest m - k b_i in S minus sum of a_i over all items in S.

To maximize this, Alice wants to maximize the sum of the smallest m - k b_i while minimizing the sum of a_i.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can sort the items in ascending order of b_i and try to select the ones with smaller b_i but lower a_i.

Wait, maybe I can sort the items based on b_i - a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the difference b_i - a_i and sort the items based on that.

Let me try that.

Sort the items in descending order of b_i - a_i.

Then, for a given m, select the top m items, and let Bob take the k items with the highest b_i among them.

Wait, but b_i - a_i being high is good for Alice, but Bob will take the k items with highest b_i, which might not correspond to the highest b_i - a_i.

This is still confusing.

Maybe I need to consider the items in a different order.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for a given S, the items in S \ T are the items in S with the smallest b_i.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S \ T} b_i, Alice wants S \ T to have as large b_i as possible.

But since S \ T contains the smallest b_i in S, to maximize their sum, Alice should choose S such that the smallest b_i are as large as possible.

This suggests selecting S such that the smallest b_i in S are as large as possible, but also considering the a_i.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible thresholds for b_i, and see what profit Alice can achieve.

But that seems too slow.

Let me consider that for a given S, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the m - k smallest b_i in S, where m = |S|.

So, to maximize sum of m - k smallest b_i - sum of a_i over S.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I need to think about inclusion of items one by one, maintaining some kind of heap or priority queue.

Let me consider that I sort the items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for a given S, the m - k smallest b_i are the first m - k items in S.

So, if I select the first m items, S \ T would be the first m - k items.

Therefore, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is sum of the first m - k b_i, and sum_{i in S} a_i is sum of the first m a_i.

So, profit is sum_{i=1 to m - k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Wait, but this assumes that the items are sorted by b_i.

So, perhaps I can sort the items by b_i in ascending order, and then consider selecting the first m items, and compute the profit as sum of the first m - k b_i minus sum of the first m a_i.

Then, I can iterate over m from k to n, and find the maximum profit.

But this might not be correct, because Alice can choose any subset S, not just contiguous subsets in the sorted order.

Wait, but maybe it is correct.

Let me see.

If I sort the items by b_i in ascending order, then for any m, the first m items have the m smallest b_i.

So, if Alice selects these m items, S \ T would be the first m - k items, which have the m - k smallest b_i.

And T would be the last k items in S, which have the k largest b_i in S.

Therefore, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the first m - k b_i, and sum_{i in S} a_i is the sum of the first m a_i.

So, profit is sum_{i=1 to m - k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Alice can choose m from k to n, and select the subset that maximizes this profit.

Additionally, she can also choose subsets where m < k, in which case her profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

So, I need to consider all possible m from 0 to n, and for m >= k, compute sum_{i=1 to m - k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, and for m < k, compute -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Then, take the maximum over all these possibilities.

Wait, but Alice can choose any subset S, not necessarily the first m in the sorted order.

So, is this approach correct?

Wait, no. Alice can choose any subset S, not just the first m.

But perhaps, the optimal subset S is indeed the m items with the smallest b_i.

Wait, but Bob will take the k items with the largest b_i in S for free.

So, if S is the m items with the smallest b_i, then T would be the k items with the largest b_i among these m items.

Therefore, S \ T would be m - k items with the smallest b_i in S.

So, in this case, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the m - k smallest b_i in S, which are the m - k smallest b_i overall.

And sum_{i in S} a_i is the sum of the a_i of these m items.

Therefore, by choosing the m items with the smallest b_i, Alice ensures that S \ T has the m - k smallest b_i, and sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of the m - k smallest b_i.

Is this the optimal choice?

Wait, perhaps.

Because if Alice selects any other subset S, the sum of the m - k smallest b_i in S would be less than or equal to the sum of the m - k smallest b_i in the overall smallest b_i items.

Therefore, selecting the m items with the smallest b_i seems optimal.

Is this correct?

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose there is an item with a very small b_i but a very large a_i.

Then, including that item might not be beneficial for Alice, because it increases sum_{i in S} a_i significantly, even if b_i is small.

So, perhaps selecting the m items with the smallest b_i isn't always optimal.

Wait, in that case, maybe Alice should select items based on some combination of b_i and a_i.

Perhaps I need to sort the items based on b_i - a_i or something similar.

Wait, but Bob can take away the k items with the highest b_i.

So, maybe I need to consider the difference b_i - a_i and sort accordingly.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the items based on b_i - a_i in descending order.

Then, Alice would want to select items with higher b_i - a_i.

But Bob can take away the k items with the highest b_i.

So, if Alice selects items with high b_i - a_i, Bob can take away the ones with the highest b_i, which might reduce Alice's profit.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the items in terms of their a_i and b_i separately.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for items where b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to include them, but Bob can take away the ones with highest b_i.

So, Alice should include items with b_i - a_i > 0, but make sure that the ones with highest b_i are not all included, so Bob doesn't take them for free.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Define S as the set of items Alice buys, with |S| = m.

Define T as the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

Then, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Bob chooses T to minimize this profit.

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Maybe I can model it as selecting S to maximize the profit, considering that Bob will choose T to minimize it.

So, it's a game where Alice chooses S, then Bob chooses T in S to minimize Alice's profit.

I need to find the maximum profit Alice can guarantee, assuming Bob plays optimally to minimize her profit.

This seems like it could be formulated as a linear program or something, but that's not practical for the constraints given.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that for a given S, the profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i, where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

I can rewrite this as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

To maximize this, Alice wants to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) minus sum_{i in T} b_i.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can consider selecting S such that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) is maximized, and sum_{i in T} b_i is minimized.

But sum_{i in T} b_i depends on S.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over possible S and compute the profit accordingly.

But with n up to 2e5, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider sorting the items based on b_i in ascending order.

Then, for a given m, select the first m items, and set T as the last k items in S.

So, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is sum of the first m - k b_i, and sum_{i in S} a_i is sum of the first m a_i.

Therefore, profit is sum_{i=1 to m - k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Then, I can iterate over m from k to n, and find the maximum profit among these.

Additionally, for m < k, profit is -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, so I can consider m from 0 to n, and for m >= k, use the formula above.

Then, take the maximum over all m.

This seems like a possible approach.

Let me check it with the sample input.

Sample Input 2:

4

2 0

2 1

1 2

4 1

1 2 1 4

3 3 2 3

4 2

2 1 1 1

4 2 3 2

6 2

1 3 4 9 1 3

7 6 8 10 6 8

Sample Output:

1

1

0

7

Let's take the second test case: n=4, k=1, a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3]

Sort items by b_i ascending: items with b_i=2,3,3,3.

Corresponding a_i: b=2 -> a=1; b=3 -> a=1,2,4.

So sorted: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)

Now, for m from 1 to 4:

m=0: profit=0

m=1: sum_{i=1 to 0} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 1} a_i = 0 - 1 = -1

m=2: sum_{i=1 to 1} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 2} a_i = 2 - (1+1)=0

m=3: sum_{i=1 to 2} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 3} a_i = 2+3 - (1+1+2)=5-4=1

m=4: sum_{i=1 to 3} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 4} a_i = 2+3+3 - (1+1+2+4)=8-8=0

So the maximum is 1, which matches the sample output.

Good, seems correct.

Let me check another sample.

First test case: n=2, k=0, a=[2,1], b=[1,2]

Sort by b_i: (1,2), (2,1)

m=0: 0

m=1: sum_{1 to 1} b_i - sum_{1 to 1} a_i =1 -2=-1

m=2: sum_{1 to 2} b_i - sum_{1 to 2} a_i =1+2 - (2+1)=3-3=0

So maximum is 0, but sample output is 1.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=0, a=[2,1], b=[1,2]

According to the sample, output is 1.

But according to my calculation, it should be 0.

Wait, perhaps because k=0, Bob takes nothing for free.

So, if Alice buys both items, profit is sum_{S \ T} b_i - sum_{S} a_i = sum_{S} b_i - sum_{S} a_i =1+2 -2-1=0

If she buys only the second item, profit=2-1=1

So, indeed, buying only one item gives higher profit.

So, in this case, m=1: sum_{i=1 to 1-0} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 1} a_i =2-1=1

m=2: sum_{i=1 to 2} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 2} a_i=1+2 -2-1=0

So, maximum is 1, which matches the sample.

Earlier, I mistakenly considered m=1 for k=0 as sum_{i=1 to 1-0} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 1} a_i=2-1=1

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, for k=0, m - k = m, so sum_{i=1 to m} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i

Which, for m=1, is b1 - a1=1-2=-1

But in reality, when k=0, Bob takes nothing for free, so Alice's profit is sum_{S} b_i - sum_{S} a_i

So, in sorted order, if I have (1,2),(2,1)

For m=1, sum_{i=1 to 1} b_i - sum_{i=1 to 1} a_i=1-2=-1

But in reality, selecting the second item gives 2-1=1

So, there's a mistake in my approach.

Ah, I see the issue.

When k=0, Bob takes nothing for free, so S \ T = S, and sum_{i in S \ T} b_i = sum_{i in S} b_i

Thus, profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i

But in sorted order, if I select the first m items, which have the smallest b_i, it might not give the maximum profit.

In the first sample, selecting the second item (b=2, a=1) gives profit 1, while selecting the first item (b=1, a=2) gives profit -1.

So, in this case, selecting the item with higher b_i - a_i is better.

Therefore, perhaps for k=0, it's better to sort by b_i - a_i descending and select the items with highest b_i - a_i.

But in general, for k >=0, how to handle?

Wait, perhaps in general, I should sort the items by b_i in ascending order, and then for each m from k to n, compute sum_{i=1 to m - k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, and for m <k, compute -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, and take the maximum.

But in the first sample, with k=0, m=1: sum_{1 to 1-0} b_i - sum_{1 to 1} a_i = b1 - a1=1-2=-1

But selecting m=1, but choosing the item with b=2, a=1, which is better.

So, perhaps I need to sort by b_i in descending order when k=0.

Wait, no, in k=0, Bob takes nothing, so Alice can choose any subset S, and her profit is sum_{S} b_i - sum_{S} a_i.

To maximize this, she should choose items where b_i - a_i >0, and exclude those with b_i -a_i <=0.

So, for k=0, it's straightforward: select items where b_i - a_i >0, and sum b_i - sum a_i for those items.

But for k >=1, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize the approach.

Sort the items by b_i in ascending order.

Then, for m from k to n, compute sum_{i=1 to m -k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

For m <k, compute -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Take the maximum over all m.

But as seen in the first sample, this doesn't always give the correct answer, because selecting m=1 with k=0 gives profit 1, but according to the formula, sum_{1 to 1} b_i - sum_{1 to 1} a_i=1-2=-1, which is worse than selecting m=1 with the better item.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the sorting.

Wait, maybe I should sort the items by b_i - a_i in descending order for k=0, and by b_i ascending for k >=1.

But that seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort by b_i - a_i in descending order, and then select the top m items, and let Bob take the k items with highest b_i among them.

Then, sum_{S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{T} b_i.

But this still seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix S, and Bob chooses T to minimize Alice's profit.

So, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum_{S \ T} b_i - sum_{S} a_i, where T is the set of k items in S with highest b_i.

So, to maximize this, Alice needs to maximize sum_{S \ T} b_i - sum_{S} a_i.

This can be rewritten as sum_{S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{T} b_i.

To maximize this, Alice wants sum_{S} (b_i - a_i) to be as large as possible and sum_{T} b_i to be as small as possible.

But sum_{T} b_i depends on S, and it's the sum of the k largest b_i in S.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Maybe I can iterate over possible candidates for the k-th largest b_i in S.

Let me denote z as the k-th largest b_i in S.

Then, sum_{T} b_i is at least z * k.

But this might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps I can use the idea of prefix sums.

Let me sort the items by b_i in ascending order.

Then, for any m >=k, sum_{S \ T} b_i is sum of the first m -k b_i, and sum_{S} a_i is sum of the first m a_i.

So, profit is sum_{i=1 to m -k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Additionally, for m <k, profit is -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Then, the maximum over all m is the answer.

In the first sample, n=2, k=0.

Sorted by b_i ascending: (1,2),(2,1)

For m=0: 0

m=1: sum_{1 to 1} b_i - sum_{1 to 1} a_i =1-2=-1

m=2: sum_{1 to 2} b_i - sum_{1 to 2} a_i=1+2 -2-1=0

But the sample output is 1, which suggests that selecting m=1 with the second item is better.

Wait, but in sorted order, m=1 corresponds to selecting the first item, which is b=1, a=2.

But in reality, Alice can select the second item, which is b=2, a=1, giving profit 1.

So, perhaps sorting by b_i ascending isn't the right approach for k=0.

Wait, maybe for k=0, it's better to sort by b_i - a_i descending.

Let me try that.

Sort the items by b_i - a_i in descending order.

For the first sample, b-a: -1,1.

So, sorted: (2,1,b-a=1), (1,2,b-a=-1)

Then, for m=1: sum_{1 to 1} (b_i - a_i)=1-1=0

Wait, no, sum_{S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{T} b_i.

But for k=0, T is empty, so sum_{T} b_i=0.

Therefore, profit is sum_{S} (b_i - a_i).

So, selecting m=1 with b-a=1, profit=1-1=0.

Wait, no, sum_{S} (b_i - a_i)=1-1=0, but actually, profit is b_i - a_i=1-1=0 for that item.

But in reality, selecting that item gives profit 1-1=0, which is less than selecting only the second item, which gives 2-1=1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the first sample, n=2, k=0.

Alice can choose to buy:

- nothing: profit 0

- item 1: b=1, a=2, profit 1-2=-1

- item 2: b=2, a=1, profit 2-1=1

- both items: b=1+2=3, a=2+1=3, profit 3-3=0

So, the maximum profit is 1, by selecting only item 2.

So, in this case, sorting by b_i - a_i descending would select item 2 first, which gives profit 1.

So, perhaps for k=0, sorting by b_i - a_i descending and selecting items with b_i - a_i >0 is the way to go.

But for k >=1, sorting by b_i ascending seems to work, as in the second sample.

So, maybe I need to handle k=0 differently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for k=0, it's a special case where Bob takes nothing for free, so Alice's profit is sum_{S} (b_i - a_i), and she should select items where b_i - a_i >0.

For k >=1, use the approach of sorting by b_i ascending and selecting m items to compute sum_{i=1 to m -k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i.

Then, take the maximum over all possible m for k >=1 and for k=0 separately.

But in the first sample, k=0, and the maximum is 1.

In the second sample, k=1, and the maximum is 1.

In the third sample, k=2, and the maximum is 0.

In the fourth sample, k=2, and the maximum is 7.

Seems plausible.

So, in code, I can handle k=0 as a special case, where Alice selects items with b_i - a_i >0, and sum b_i - sum a_i for those items.

For k >=1, sort the items by b_i ascending, and for m from k to n, compute sum_{i=1 to m -k} b_i - sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, and for m <k, compute -sum_{i=1 to m} a_i, and take the maximum over all m.

Wait, but in the first sample, k=0, and selecting items with b_i - a_i >0 gives profit 1.

For k >=1, use the other approach.

Then, take the maximum of these two.

But in the first sample, k=0, and the maximum is 1.

For k >=1, using m from 1 to 2:

m=1: sum_{1 to 0} b_i - sum_{1 to 1} a_i=0 -2=-2

m=2: sum_{1 to 1} b_i - sum_{1 to 2} a_i=1 - (2+1)= -2

So, maximum is 1 from k=0 case.

In the second
