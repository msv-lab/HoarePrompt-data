Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My task is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for "minimum excluded," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array up to that point. For example, MEX of [1,2,3] is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. MEX of [3,1,0] is 2 because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in p. That's important to keep in mind.

Maybe I can try to build p step by step, from the first element to the last, calculating the MEX at each step and seeing what p_i should be based on a_i.

Wait, but the MEX depends on the previous elements of p, so maybe it's easier to work backwards.

Let's consider the last element. For i = n, a_n = MEX(p_1 to p_n) - p_n.

At this point, since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of p_1 to p_n should be n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

So, a_n = n - p_n.

From this, p_n = n - a_n.

Wait, but the problem says that a_i can be between -n and n, so p_n could be between 0 and 2n.

But p_n has to be between 0 and n-1, since it's a permutation.

Wait, no, the problem says that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, so p_i is between 0 and n-1.

But a_i can be between -n and n.

In the example, for n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2], and p=[0,1,4,2,3].

Let's check:

For i=1: MEX(0)=1, a_1=1-0=1.

For i=2: MEX(0,1)=2, a_2=2-1=1.

Wait, but in the note, it says a_2 = MEX(0,1)-1=1, which matches.

For i=3: MEX(0,1,4)=2, a_3=2-4=-2.

For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2)=3, a_4=3-2=1.

For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3)=5, a_5=5-3=2.

Wait, but MEX(0,1,4,2,3) should be 5, since all numbers from 0 to 4 are present.

But in the note, it says a_5=2, which is 5-3=2, matching p_5=3.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, for the last element, p_n = n - a_n.

In the example, p_5=5-2=3, which matches.

So, generalizing, p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

But MEX(p_1 to p_i) is a_i + p_i.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Alternatively, since p is a permutation, all p_i are distinct and range from 0 to n-1.

Maybe I can keep track of which numbers are used in p.

Let me think about building p from the end.

Suppose I start from i=n.

At this point, MEX(p_1 to p_n) is n, because p contains all numbers from 0 to n-1.

So, a_n = n - p_n.

Therefore, p_n = n - a_n.

This seems straightforward.

Now, for i=n-1, MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Since p_1 to p_n contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all except p_n.

So, MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) is p_n, because p_n is the only number from 0 to n-1 missing in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Therefore, a_{n-1} = p_n - p_{n-1}.

So, p_{n-1} = p_n - a_{n-1}.

Wait, but p_n is known from the previous step.

So, I can compute p_{n-1} based on p_n and a_{n-1}.

Similarly, for i=n-2, MEX(p_1 to p_{n-2}) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{n-2}.

Since p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all numbers from 0 to n-1 except p_n, and p_{n-1} is now known, I need to see what's missing in p_1 to p_{n-2}.

If p_{n-1} is already in p_1 to p_{n-2}, then MEX is the smallest not in p_1 to p_{n-2}.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look at the code provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = [-1] * n

mex = n

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

p[i] = mex - a[i]

mex = min(mex, p[i])

print(*p)

So, it initializes p as a list of -1's, and mex as n.

Then, it iterates from i = n-1 down to 0.

For each i, it sets p[i] = mex - a[i], then updates mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i].

In the example:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize p=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], mex=5

i=4: p[4]=5 - 2=3, mex=min(5,3)=3

i=3: p[3]=3 - 1=2, mex=min(3,2)=2

i=2: p[2]=2 - (-2)=4, mex=min(2,4)=2

i=1: p[1]=2 - 1=1, mex=min(2,1)=1

i=0: p[0]=1 - 1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the example.

That seems to work.

Let me see why this approach makes sense.

Starting from the end, mex is initially n.

For each i from n-1 down to 0:

- Set p[i] = mex - a[i]

- Update mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i]

So, for i=4, p[4]=5-2=3, mex=min(5,3)=3

For i=3, p[3]=3-1=2, mex=min(3,2)=2

For i=2, p[2]=2 - (-2)=4, mex=min(2,4)=2

For i=1, p[1]=2-1=1, mex=min(2,1)=1

For i=0, p[0]=1-1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

This seems to correctly reconstruct p.

But why does this work?

Let's think about what mex represents at each step.

At i=n, mex is n, as all numbers from 0 to n-1 are in p.

Then, for i=n-1, mex should be p_n, since p_1 to p_{n-1} misses p_n.

But in the code, mex is updated to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i].

In the first iteration, mex is n, p[4]=3, so mex becomes 3.

Then, for i=3, mex=3, p[3]=2, so mex becomes 2.

For i=2, mex=2, p[2]=4, so mex remains 2.

For i=1, mex=2, p[1]=1, so mex becomes 1.

For i=0, mex=1, p[0]=0, so mex becomes 0.

This seems to maintain the correct mex at each step.

But I need to verify if this logic holds in general.

Let me consider another example.

Take n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

From the example, p=[2,0,1]

Let's simulate the code:

Initialize p=[-1,-1,-1], mex=3

i=2: p[2]=3-2=1, mex=min(3,1)=1

i=1: p[1]=1-1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

i=0: p[0]=0 - (-2)=2, mex=min(0,2)=0

So, p=[2,0,1], which matches the example.

Another example: n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

From the example, p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Simulate:

Initialize p=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], mex=5

i=4: p[4]=5-1=4, mex=min(5,4)=4

i=3: p[3]=4-1=3, mex=min(4,3)=3

i=2: p[2]=3-1=2, mex=min(3,2)=2

i=1: p[1]=2-1=1, mex=min(2,1)=1

i=0: p[0]=1-1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Let me try to reason about why this works.

At each step, p[i] = mex - a[i]

And then mex is updated to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i]

We need to ensure that p[i] is unique and within 0 to n-1.

Also, that the MEX calculation is correct.

Let's think about what MEX(p_1 to p_i) should be.

From the way mex is updated, it seems that mex represents the MEX of p_1 to p_{i+1}.

Wait, in the first iteration, for i=n-1, mex is n, which is MEX(p_1 to p_n).

Then, p[n-1] = n - a[n-1]

Then, mex is updated to min(mex, p[i]), which is min(n, p[n-1])

In the next iteration, for i=n-2, p[i] = mex - a[i], and then mex is updated to min(mex, p[i])

This seems to maintain that mex is the MEX of p_1 to p_{i+1}

Because after setting p[i], the MEX of p_1 to p_i would be the minimum of the previous mex and p[i]

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of available numbers.

Let me consider that at each step, we're choosing p[i], and the MEX is the smallest non-used number up to that point.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the code works based on the examples and move on.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are any constraints or edge cases where this might fail.

Constraints:

- 1 <= t <= 10^4

- 1 <= n <= 2*10^5

- -n <= a_i <= n

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

Given that, the code seems efficient enough, O(n) per test case.

But does it always produce a valid permutation?

In the code, p[i] = mex - a[i]

Given that mex is initially n and is updated to min(mex, p[i]) at each step.

We need to ensure that p[i] is between 0 and n-1 and that all p[i] are unique.

Let's see:

In the first iteration, p[n-1] = n - a[n-1]

Given that a[n-1] can be between -n and n, p[n-1] can be between 0 and 2n.

But p[n-1] must be between 0 and n-1.

Wait, but in the example, p[n-1] = n - a[n-1] was 3 when n=5 and a[4]=2.

Which is fine, since 3 is between 0 and 4.

But what if a[n-1] is -n, then p[n-1] = n - (-n) = 2n, which is greater than n-1.

Wait, but p[n-1] has to be between 0 and n-1.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Looking back at the first example:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

p[4]=5-2=3, which is fine.

But suppose a[n-1]=-n, then p[n-1]=n - (-n)=2n, which is invalid.

But the problem states that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists.

Perhaps there's some constraint on a that prevents p[i] from being out of range.

Alternatively, maybe the update to mex takes care of it.

Wait, in the code, after setting p[i], mex is updated to min(mex, p[i])

So, in the first iteration, p[n-1]=n - a[n-1], then mex = min(mex, p[i])

In the next iteration, p[n-2]=mex - a[n-2], and so on.

But if p[n-1] = n - a[n-1] > n-1, which could happen if a[n-1] < 0, then p[n-1] would be invalid.

Wait, in the first example, a[4]=2, p[4]=5-2=3, which is valid.

In the second example, a[4]=1, p[4]=5-1=4, which is valid.

In the third example, a[2]=-2, p[2]=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid for n=3.

Wait, in the third example, n=3, a=[-2,1,2], p=[2,0,1]

According to the code:

Initialize p=[-1,-1,-1], mex=3

i=2: p[2]=3 - 2=1, mex=min(3,1)=1

i=1: p[1]=1 - 1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

i=0: p[0]=0 - (-2)=2, mex=min(0,2)=0

So, p=[2,0,1], which is valid.

But if a[2] were -3, then p[2]=3 - (-3)=6, which is invalid for n=3.

But the problem states that the input is given such that at least one valid p exists.

So, perhaps in such a case, a[2] cannot be -3 for n=3.

Alternatively, maybe the update to mex prevents p[i] from being out of range.

Wait, in the first iteration, mex is n, p[i]=n - a[i]

If a[i] < 0, p[i] could be greater than n-1, but in the next iteration, mex is updated to min(mex, p[i])

If p[i] < mex, then mex is updated to p[i], which could be less than n.

Then, in the next iteration, p[i-1]=mex - a[i-1]

If mex is now less than n, p[i-1] could be adjusted accordingly.

But I'm not sure if this always prevents p[i] from being out of range.

Let me try to think of a case where p[i] goes out of range.

Suppose n=2, a=[0,0]

Then, p[1]=2 - 0=2, which is invalid for n=2.

But according to the problem, inputs are such that at least one valid p exists.

So, perhaps a=[0,0] is not possible for n=2.

Wait, if p=[0,1], then a[1]=MEX(0)=1 - 0=1, a[2]=MEX(0,1)=2 - 1=1

So, a=[1,1], not [0,0]

Or p=[1,0], a[1]=MEX(1)=0 - 1=-1, a[2]=MEX(1,0)=2 - 0=2

So, a=[-1,2]

So, for n=2, a=[1,1] corresponds to p=[0,1], and a=[-1,2] corresponds to p=[1,0]

There is no p for n=2 that would give a=[0,0], so the input wouldn't have a=[0,0] for n=2.

Therefore, the code can assume that p[i] won't go out of range because the input is constructed such that at least one valid p exists.

Moreover, in the code, p[i] is set to mex - a[i], and mex is updated to min(mex, p[i])

So, if p[i] < mex, then mex is updated to p[i], which would affect the next iteration.

This seems to be a way to maintain the correct MEX at each step.

Given that, and that the examples match, and that the code is efficient, I can conclude that the code is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the permutation p from the given array a, using the relationship a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. We will iterate backwards from the end of the array to the start, calculating each p_i and updating the MEX accordingly.

This approach ensures that we correctly reconstruct the permutation p by maintaining the correct MEX at each step, iterating backwards for efficient calculation. The solution is both time-efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem constraints and ensuring correctness.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the permutation p from the given array a, using the relationship a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. We will iterate backwards from the end of the array to the start, calculating each p_i and updating the MEX accordingly.

## Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases, t.
   - For each test case, read the integer n and the array a of length n.
   
2. **Permutation Reconstruction**:
   - Initialize a list p of size n with -1.
   - Start with mex set to n.
   - Iterate from the last element to the first:
     - Set p[i] = mex - a[i].
     - Update mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i].
   
3. **Output**:
   - Print the permutation p for each test case.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
