Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at its number x, and then checks if there's already a card with that number x on the table. If there is, the player gets one point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is turn-based, with me going first.

- Each player plays n cards.

- Points are awarded if a card's number is already on the table when played.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

- I need to maximize my score, given that Nene is playing optimally.

Given that, I need to find out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, knowing that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand how the game progresses and how the choices made affect the scores.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

So, for the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. Nene's cards would be the remaining ones: 2,3,4,4.

The explanation says that in one possible sequence:

1. I play one of the 1's.

2. Nene plays one of her 4's.

3. I play the other 1, getting a point because 1 is already on the table.

4. Nene plays her other 4, getting a point because 4 is already on the table.

5. I play 2, no point.

6. Nene plays 2, gets a point.

7. I play 3, no point.

8. Nene plays 3, gets a point.

So, I end up with 1 point.

The problem states that this is the maximum I can get if Nene plays optimally.

Looking at this, it seems that the key is to maximize the number of times I can play a second card of a number that's already on the table.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to prevent me from getting points while maximizing her own.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to know which numbers I have one of, and which numbers I have two of.

Similarly, I need to know which numbers Nene has one of, and which numbers she has two of.

But wait, since there are exactly two cards for each number, if I have one card of a number, Nene has the other, and if I have two cards of a number, Nene has none of that number.

So, for each number from 1 to n:

- If I have one card of it, Nene has the other.

- If I have two cards of it, Nene has none.

Given that, I can categorize the numbers into two groups:

1. Numbers where I have one card, and Nene has the other.

2. Numbers where I have two cards, and Nene has none.

My goal is to maximize the number of times I can play a second card of a number that's already on the table.

Let's consider the two categories:

- For numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other: only one of these cards is in our hands; the other is with Nene.

- For numbers where I have two cards: both cards are with me.

Given that, when I have two cards of a number, I can play the first one, and then the second one, potentially getting a point for the second one, provided that Nene hasn't played her cards in a way that interferes.

Wait, but Nene has no cards of the numbers where I have two cards, so she can't play any cards of those numbers.

So, for numbers where I have two cards, I can play them in such a way that the second one gets a point, unless Nene plays a card in between that affects my ability to get that point.

But, since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to play her cards in a way that minimizes my opportunities to get points.

Wait, but in the case where I have two cards of a number, and Nene has no cards of that number, her plays can't directly affect my ability to play both cards of that number and get a point for the second one.

So, perhaps for each number where I have two cards, I can arrange to get one point.

But, I need to consider the interaction between different numbers.

Let me think about the first test case again:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

In this case, I have two 1's, and one each of 2 and 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

In the sequence described:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 4.

3. I play 1, getting a point.

4. Nene plays 4, getting a point.

5. I play 2.

6. Nene plays 2, getting a point.

7. I play 3.

8. Nene plays 3, getting a point.

In this sequence, I get one point, from playing the second 1.

Is there a way for me to get more than one point?

Let's try different sequences.

Suppose I play 2 first.

1. I play 2.

2. Nene plays 4.

3. I play 1.

4. Nene plays 4.

5. I play 1, getting a point.

6. Nene plays 3.

7. I play 3.

8. Nene plays 3, getting a point.

In this case, I still get only one point.

What if I play 3 first?

1. I play 3.

2. Nene plays 4.

3. I play 1.

4. Nene plays 4.

5. I play 1, getting a point.

6. Nene plays 2.

7. I play 2.

8. Nene plays 2, getting a point.

Again, only one point for me.

Is there a way for me to get two points?

Let's see: to get two points, I need to have two cards where the second one is played after the first one is already on the table.

In this setup, I have two 1's, and one each of 2 and 3.

So, I can get a point only from the second 1.

Even if I arrange the plays differently, Nene can always play in a way that prevents me from getting more than one point.

For example:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 3.

3. I play 1, getting a point.

4. Nene plays 2.

5. I play 2.

6. Nene plays 4.

7. I play 3.

8. Nene plays 4, getting a point.

Again, only one point for me.

So, in this case, the maximum I can get is indeed one point.

Looking at the second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: the remaining cards, which are the other cards not in my hand.

Wait, the full deck has two of each number from 1 to 8.

So, my cards are: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have:

- Two 8's

- Two 5's

- One 7

- One 4

- One 1

- One 2

Nene has:

- One 7

- One 4

- One 1

- One 2

- No 5's

- No 8's

In this case, I have two 8's and two 5's, and one each of 7,4,1,2.

Nene has one each of 7,4,1,2, and no 5's or 8's.

In this case, I can potentially get points from playing the second 8 and the second 5.

But Nene can play in a way that affects when I play these cards.

Let's think about how to maximize my points.

I need to play the second 8 and the second 5 after their first ones are already on the table.

So, for the 8's: I need to play the first 8, then sometime later play the second 8, getting a point.

Similarly for the 5's.

But Nene can play her cards in a way that influences when I can play my second cards.

Wait, but Nene has no 5's or 8's, so she can't play any cards of those numbers.

Therefore, the only way Nene can influence my ability to get points from playing the second 8 and second 5 is by controlling when I can play them.

But since she has no 5's or 8's, she can't play those numbers.

So, perhaps I can arrange to get points from both second 8 and second 5.

For example:

1. I play 7.

2. Nene plays, say, 1.

3. I play 8.

4. Nene plays, say, 4.

5. I play 8, getting a point.

6. Nene plays 2.

7. I play 5.

8. Nene plays, say, 1.

9. I play 5, getting a point.

10. Nene plays 2.

11. I play 2.

12. Nene plays 4, getting a point.

13. I play 4.

14. Nene plays 7, getting a point.

In this case, I get two points, from the second 8 and the second 5.

Is this possible?

Wait, but in this sequence, I played the second 8 after the first 8, and the second 5 after the first 5, getting points for both.

Nene couldn't interfere because she has no 8's or 5's.

So, in this case, I can get two points.

Looking back at the output, for this test case, the output is 2, which matches this.

So, in this case, I can get two points.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's cards: the remaining cards.

So, my cards are: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Which means:

- Two 4's

- One each of 1,2,3,5,6,7

Nene has:

- One each of 1,2,3,5,6,7

- No 4's

In this case, I have only one pair: two 4's.

So, I can potentially get one point from playing the second 4.

Is that what the output shows? Yes, the output is 1.

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

In this case, I have one each of 1,2,3, and Nene has one each of 1,2,3.

I have no pairs, so I can't get any points.

Output is 0, which matches.

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards: 1

Nene's cards: 1

Only one number, one each.

I have no pairs, so I can't get any points.

Output is 0, which matches.

From these observations, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, assuming Nene plays optimally.

Wait, but in the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), and I can get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), and I can get one point.

In the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), but I can only get one point.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have only one pair, so I can get at most one point.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, provided that Nene doesn't interfere.

But in the first test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs, and I can get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, so I get zero points.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, is this always true?

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

But, could there be a scenario where I have two pairs but can only get one point?

Let me think.

Suppose n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,2.

Nene's cards are 3,3,4,4.

In this case, I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

Nene has two pairs: two 3's and two 4's.

If I play one 1, then Nene plays one 3, then I play one 2, Nene plays one 4, then I play the second 1, getting a point, then Nene plays the second 3, getting a point, then I play the second 2, getting a point, then Nene plays the second 4, getting a point.

In this case, I get two points, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Another scenario: n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,4.

In this case, I have one pair: two 1's.

Nene has one pair: two 4's.

In this case, I can get one point from playing the second 1.

Nene can get one point from playing the second 4.

The other cards are single, so no points from them.

So, again, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in the first test case, that's exactly what's happening.

I have one pair, and I get one point.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, is this always true, regardless of Nene's plays?

Let me consider a more complex example.

Suppose n=5, my cards are 1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,5,5.

Here, I have one pair: two 1's.

Nene has one pair: two 5's.

I have single cards of 2,3,4.

Nene has single cards of 2,3,4, and a pair of 5's.

In this case, I can get one point from playing the second 1.

Nene can get one point from playing the second 5.

The other cards are singles, so no points from them.

So, again, I get one point, which is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Another example: n=6, my cards are 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Nene's cards are 4,4,5,5,6,6.

I have three pairs: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

Nene has three pairs: two 4's, two 5's, two 6's.

In this case, I can get three points: one from each pair.

Nene can get three points similarly.

So, again, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in this case, Nene has her own pairs, but since she plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she might try to interfere with my ability to get points.

But in reality, since her cards are separate from mine, she can't directly interfere with my pairs.

She can only control the sequence in which cards are played, but she can't play my pairs for me.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is indeed equal to the number of pairs I have.

Looking back at the problem, it seems that the function `func_1(a, n)` is counting the number of pairs I have and returning that as the maximum score I can get.

Given that, and given the examples provided, it seems that this approach is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
