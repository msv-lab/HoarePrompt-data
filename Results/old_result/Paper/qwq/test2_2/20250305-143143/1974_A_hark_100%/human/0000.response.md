Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, Little Rosie has a desktop with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5x3=15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: 

- Type A: 1x1 cells, so each icon takes one cell.

- Type B: 2x2 cells, so each icon takes four cells in a square.

Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and I need to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

Given that, the input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers x and y, representing the number of type A and type B icons, respectively.

My task is to, for each test case, determine the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons.

First, I need to understand how to optimally place these icons on the screens to minimize the number of screens used.

Let's consider the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns, so:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon occupies a square of four cells. Given the grid dimensions, where can I place these 2x2 icons?

Looking at the grid, a 2x2 square can be placed in positions that cover:

- Cells 1,2,4,5

- Cells 2,3,5,6

- Cells 4,5,7,8

- Cells 5,6,8,9

- Cells 7,8,10,11

- Cells 8,9,11,12

- Cells 10,11,13,14

- Cells 11,12,14,15

So, in each screen, you can place up to how many 2x2 icons?

Looking at the positions, it seems that you can place up to 2x2 icons in a way that they don't overlap. Let's see:

If I place one 2x2 icon covering cells 1,2,4,5, then another can cover cells 7,8,10,11, and possibly another covering cells 13,14,15 (but that's only three cells, which isn't a complete 2x2 icon). Wait, 13,14,15 is only three cells, so that's invalid for a 2x2 icon.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to place them.

Let me try to visualize this.

Screen grid:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

10 11 12

13 14 15

If I place a 2x2 icon on cells 1,2,4,5, then another on cells 7,8,10,11, that's two 2x2 icons per screen, using up 8 cells (4 per icon). That leaves 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to place more than two 2x2 icons per screen, but from the above, it seems only two non-overlapping 2x2 icons fit per screen.

Wait, is there a way to place three 2x2 icons on a screen?

Let's see:

- Icon 1: cells 1,2,4,5

- Icon 2: cells 7,8,10,11

- Icon 3: cells 13,14,15

But cell 15 is only one cell, which is not enough for a 2x2 icon. So, only two 2x2 icons per screen.

Therefore, per screen:

- Up to two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells.

- Remaining cells: 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if there are not enough 2x2 icons, we can place only one 2x2 icon per screen, using 4 cells, and the remaining 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if there are no 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, the strategy should be to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, and then use the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.

Given that, let's think about how to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

First, consider the number of 2x2 icons (y). Since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the minimum number of screens required solely for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

However, we also have to place x 1x1 icons, and each screen can hold up to 15 - 4*number_of_2x2_icons used on that screen.

Wait, more precisely, if a screen has two 2x2 icons, it uses 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If a screen has one 2x2 icon, it uses 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If a screen has no 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the use of screens with two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total cell requirement and divide by the maximum cells per screen.

Total cells needed: x (for 1x1 icons) + 4*y (for 2x2 icons).

Total cells available per screen: 15.

So, total screens needed: ceil((x + 4*y)/15).

But is this correct? Let's check with the example.

In the first test case: x=1, y=1.

Total cells needed: 1 + 4*1 = 5.

Ceil(5/15) = 1 screen.

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2.

Total cells needed: 7 + 8 = 15.

Ceil(15/15) = 1 screen.

Matches sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4.

Total cells needed: 12 + 16 = 28.

Ceil(28/15) = 2 screens.

Matches sample output.

Seems correct so far.

But wait, is this always optimal?

Let's consider another example.

Suppose x=1, y=3.

Total cells needed: 1 + 12 = 13.

Ceil(13/15)=1 screen.

Is this possible?

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons (using 8 cells) and 7 1x1 icons.

So, two 2x2 icons use 8 cells, plus 7 1x1 icons, total 15 cells.

But here, y=3, which would require ceil(3/2)=2 screens.

Wait, there's a conflict here.

According to the earlier formula, ceil((1 + 12)/15)=1 screen, but according to the 2x2 icon placement, we need ceil(3/2)=2 screens.

So, which one is correct?

Looking back at the sample input, when y=3 and x=0, the output is 2 screens.

So, in that case, even if total cells needed is 12, which is less than 15, we still need 2 screens because each screen can hold only two 2x2 icons.

Hence, the initial formula ceil((x + 4*y)/15) is not always correct.

Therefore, a better approach is needed.

Let me think differently.

First, calculate the number of screens needed solely for the 2x2 icons, which is ceil(y / 2).

Then, calculate the remaining cells available on these screens for 1x1 icons.

If y is even, then ceil(y / 2) = y / 2, and each screen has two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, leaving 7 cells per screen for 1x1 icons.

If y is odd, ceil(y / 2) = (y // 2) + 1, and one screen will have one 2x2 icon, using 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons, and the other screens will have two 2x2 icons each, leaving 7 cells per screen.

So, total available cells for 1x1 icons is:

If y is even:

screens_for_y = y / 2

available_cells = screens_for_y * 7

If y is odd:

screens_for_y = (y // 2) + 1

available_cells = (screens_for_y - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, if any, is ceil(max(x - available_cells, 0) / 15)

So, total screens needed = screens_for_y + ceil(max(x - available_cells, 0) / 15)

Let's test this with the earlier conflicting example: x=1, y=3.

y=3, which is odd.

screens_for_y = 2

available_cells = (2 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18

x=1, which is less than 18, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=7, y=2.

y=2, even.

screens_for_y = 1

available_cells = 1 * 7 = 7

x=7, which is equal to available_cells, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 1

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

y=4, even.

screens_for_y = 2

available_cells = 2 * 7 = 14

x=12, which is less than 14, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 2

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=8, y=1.

y=1, odd.

screens_for_y = 1

available_cells = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 11

x=8, which is less than 11, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 1

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=0.

screens_for_y = 0

available_cells = 0

x=0, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 0

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=2, y=0.

screens_for_y = 0

available_cells = 0

x=2, ceil(2/15)=1 screen

Total screens: 1

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

screens_for_y = 0

available_cells = 0

x=15, ceil(15/15)=1 screen

Total screens: 1

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=9.

y=9, odd.

screens_for_y = 5

available_cells = (5 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 4*7 + 11 = 28 + 11 = 39

x=0, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 5

Matches sample output.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

import math

func_1()

def func_1():

ap = int(input())

for k in range(ap):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x == 0 and y > 0:

print(math.ceil(y / 2))

elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15))

else:

print(0)

Wait, there's something off here.

In the code, when x > 0 and y > 0:

- Calculate bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

- Total screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

This seems different from what I derived earlier.

Wait, let's see.

First, bxsfory = ceil(y / 2), which is correct for the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems odd.

Wait, in my earlier approach, after allocating screens for y, we have available cells for x.

But here, it's subtracting bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 from x, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to calculate the remaining x after accounting for the cells used by y.

But, if bxsfory screens are used for y, and each such screen can have two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, and leaving 7 cells for x.

So, total available cells for x is bxsfory * 7.

But in the code, it's doing x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, that's x - (bxsfory * 15) + (y * 4), which is strange.

I think there's a mistake in the formula.

It should probably be x - (available_cells_for_x), where available_cells_for_x is bxsfory * 7 (if y is even) or (bxsfory - 1) * 7 + 11 (if y is odd).

But in the code, it's x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4, which doesn't align with the correct calculation.

Moreover, in my earlier correct approach, we calculate:

- screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

- available_cells = screens_for_y * 7 (if y is even) or (screens_for_y - 1) * 7 + 11 (if y is odd)

- remaining_x = x - available_cells

- additional_screens = ceil(remaining_x / 15) if remaining_x > 0 else 0

- total_screens = screens_for_y + additional_screens

But in the code, it's doing:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which seems incorrect.

Let's test this with the sample input.

First test case: x=1, y=1.

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0 (since x <= 0)

total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2.

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 7 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4.

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Matches sample output.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3.

bxsfory = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

x = 0 - 2*15 + 3*4 = 0 - 30 + 12 = -18

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Matches sample output.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0.

Not covered by this branch, goes to elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(ceil(1 / 15)) = 1

Matches sample output.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1.

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches sample output.

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0.

Goes to else: print(0)

Matches sample output.

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0.

print(ceil(2 / 15)) = 1

Matches sample output.

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0.

print(ceil(15 / 15)) = 1

Matches sample output.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2.

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Matches sample output.

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9.

bxsfory = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

x = 0 - 5*15 + 9*4 = 0 - 75 + 36 = -39

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 5 = 5

Matches sample output.

So, all sample inputs match the expected outputs, but is this just a coincidence, or is there a correct logic behind it?

Looking back, in my correct approach:

- screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

- if y is even:

available_cells = screens_for_y * 7

else:

available_cells = (screens_for_y - 1) * 7 + 11

- remaining_x = x - available_cells

- additional_screens = ceil(remaining_x / 15) if remaining_x > 0 else 0

- total_screens = screens_for_y + additional_screens

But in the code:

- bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

- total_screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

So, the formula in the code is:

x_modified = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Then, additional_screens based on x_modified.

Wait, perhaps the formula is simplifying the cell calculations.

Let's see:

Total cells needed: x + 4*y

Cells provided by bxsfory screens: bxsfory * 15

So, remaining cells needed: x + 4*y - bxsfory * 15

Then, additional screens needed: ceil(max(remaining_cells, 0) / 15)

Which is similar to what the code is doing, but with a sign error.

Wait, in the code, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

But, total cells needed is x + 4*y, and cells provided is bxsfory * 15.

So, remaining cells needed should be x + 4*y - bxsfory*15.

But in the code, it's x - bxsfory*15 + y*4, which is x - bxsfory*15 + 4*y, which is the same as x + 4*y - bxsfory*15.

So, it's correct in terms of calculating remaining cells needed.

Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

Which is ceil(max(remaining_cells, 0) / 15)

Hence, total screens = bxsfory (for y) + bxsfory1 (for remaining x)

This seems correct.

So, despite my initial confusion, the formula in the code is actually correct.

It's calculating the total cells needed (x + 4*y), subtracting the cells provided by the screens allocated for y (bxsfory * 15), and then calculating additional screens needed for any remaining cells.

This is a valid way to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
