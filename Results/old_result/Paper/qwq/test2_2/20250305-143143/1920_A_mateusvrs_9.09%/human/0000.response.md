Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have the number of constraints n, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint.

My goal is to count the number of integers k that satisfy all these constraints for each test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range that k can take based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers that are excluded by the constraints of type 3.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among these constraints because k needs to satisfy all of them. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among these because k needs to satisfy all of these constraints as well.

Then, the possible values of k would be in the range from the maximum of type 1 constraints to the minimum of type 2 constraints.

After that, I need to account for the constraints of type 3 (k != x), which means I have to exclude certain specific values from this range.

Wait, but I need to be careful because it's possible that some of the type 3 constraints are outside the range defined by type 1 and type 2 constraints, but the problem says that all constraints are considered, and no two constraints are the same.

Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, so the range will always be finite.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For each test case, read n.

2. Initialize variables to track the lower and upper bounds of k.

- For type 1 constraints (k >= x), keep track of the maximum x.

- For type 2 constraints (k <= x), keep track of the minimum x.

- For type 3 constraints (k != x), collect all x values in a set.

3. After processing all constraints, determine the range of k: from the maximum of type 1 constraints to the minimum of type 2 constraints.

4. If the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, meaning there's no possible k, then the answer is 0.

5. Otherwise, calculate the total number of integers in this range: upper - lower + 1.

6. Then, subtract the number of type 3 constraints that fall within this range.

- Since type 3 constraints exclude specific values, I need to count how many of these x values are within the range [lower, upper].

7. The final answer is the total number in the range minus the number of exclusions.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the type 3 constraints don't overlap with the range defined by type 1 and type 2 constraints.

Also, since it's guaranteed that the range is finite, I don't have to worry about infinite ranges.

Let me consider an example to verify my approach.

Take the first example from the problem:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4.

Type 1: k >= 3

Type 2: k <= 10

Type 3: k != 1 and k != 5

First, the range is from 3 to 10.

Then, within this range, k cannot be 5 (since k !=1 is outside the range, it's already excluded by the lower bound).

So, possible k: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But k !=5, so exclude 5.

Total: 7 values.

According to the sample output, it's 7, which matches.

Another sample:

2

1 5

2 4

Here, the range is k >=5 and k <=4, which is impossible, so answer is 0.

Another one:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Quite a few constraints here.

First, find the effective lower and upper bounds.

Type 1 constraints: k >=7 (since it's the maximum among 2,7,3)

Type 2 constraints: k <=98 (since it's the minimum among 100,98)

So, range is from 7 to 98.

Then, type 3 constraints: exclude 6,7,100,44,99.

But within the range 7 to 98, the exclusions are 7 and 44.

So, total numbers in range: 98 - 7 +1 = 92.

Exclude 7 and 44: 92 - 2 = 90.

Sample output is 90, which matches.

Seems like my approach is correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

def func():

t = int(input())

r = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

cx = set()

ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)

bx = -1

for _ in range(n):

(a, x) = map(int, input().split())

if a == 1:

bx = max(x, bx)

elif a == 2:

ax = min(x, ax)

else:

cx.add(x)

if bx >= ax:

r.append(0)

else:

tmp = 0

for i in cx:

if i >= bx and i <= ax:

tmp += 1

r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)

print(*r, sep='\n')



Let's analyze this code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, the number of constraints.

It initializes:

- cx as an empty set to store the x values of type 3 constraints.

- ax as a large number (1000000000.0 + 7), which will be used for the upper bound.

- bx as -1, which will be used for the lower bound.

Then, it reads n lines, each containing a and x.

- If a ==1, it's type 1: k >= x, so it sets bx to the maximum of x and current bx.

- If a ==2, it's type 2: k <= x, so it sets ax to the minimum of x and current ax.

- If a ==3, it's type 3: k != x, so it adds x to the set cx.

After processing all constraints, it checks if bx >= ax, which means the range is invalid, so it appends 0 to the result list r.

Otherwise, it calculates the number of exclusions tmp by counting how many x in cx are within the range [bx, ax].

Then, it calculates the total number of k values as ax - bx +1 - tmp and appends it to r.

Finally, it prints all results in r separated by newlines.

This seems to match my earlier reasoning.

Let me check if there are any potential issues.

- Using a set for cx ensures that each exclusion is only counted once, which is correct because no two constraints are the same.

- The initialization of ax to a large number and bx to -1 is appropriate.

- The checks for a==1 and a==2 correctly update bx and ax to the maximum and minimum respectively.

- The final calculation ax - bx +1 gives the number of integers in the range, and subtracting tmp accounts for the exclusions.

I think this should work correctly for all test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
