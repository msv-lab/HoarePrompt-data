Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller elements will leave larger elements in the array, which is good for the sum.

But wait, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1 after Alice removes elements. Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll try to reduce the total sum as much as possible by multiplying the largest positive elements by -1, making them negative.

Hmm, so Alice needs to consider what Bob will do after she removes elements. She needs to think ahead and remove elements in such a way that even after Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1, the sum is still as large as possible.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum, considering that Bob will minimize it given his actions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, Alice can remove up to k elements. So, she can choose any subset of the array of size up to k to remove.

Then, Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1.

I need to find the maximum sum that Alice can achieve, knowing that Bob will try to minimize the sum by multiplying up to x elements by -1.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think about it in terms of sorting the array.

Let's sort the array in descending order. So, the largest elements are first.

If Alice removes the smallest elements (which are at the end of the sorted array), that would leave the largest elements for Bob.

But Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1, so he might choose to turn the largest positive elements into negative to reduce the sum.

Wait, but if Alice removes the smallest elements, then the remaining elements are the largest, and Bob will try to make the sum smaller by turning some of these large positive numbers into negative.

So, perhaps Alice needs to balance between removing some small elements and leaving some elements for Bob to flip.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to consider different scenarios.

Let's consider that after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left.

Bob can then multiply up to x of these n - k elements by -1.

To minimize the sum, Bob would probably choose to multiply the largest positive elements by -1.

So, if Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action, she needs to leave a set of elements such that even after Bob flips the x largest elements, the sum is still as large as possible.

This sounds like Alice should try to leave as many positive elements as possible, and perhaps remove elements that are negative, but in this problem, all elements are positive since it's given that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Wait, no, actually, the problem states that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, which means all elements are positive integers.

So, all elements are positive initially.

Wait, but Bob can multiply elements by -1, turning positive elements into negative.

So, Bob can choose up to x elements and make them negative, to minimize the sum.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action.

Given that, Alice should try to remove elements that would cause Bob to have less impact when he flips up to x elements.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements. Then, Bob will multiply up to x of the remaining elements by -1.

To maximize the sum after Bob's action, Alice should leave the largest possible elements, but considering that Bob will flip the largest ones among them.

So, if Alice leaves the largest elements, Bob will flip the largest ones among them, making them negative.

Therefore, Alice needs to find a balance: she shouldn't leave too many large elements for Bob to flip, but she also shouldn't remove too many large elements.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Alice can choose to keep n - k elements.

Then, Bob will choose up to x of these n - k elements to multiply by -1.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action.

So, Alice should choose which n - k elements to keep, knowing that Bob will flip up to x of them to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice should choose the n - k largest elements, because they are the best candidates before Bob flips any.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest among these n - k elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Therefore, Alice should choose the n - k largest elements, and Bob will flip the x largest among them to negative.

So, the sum would be the sum of the n - k largest elements, minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

Because flipping a positive element to negative subtracts twice its value from the sum.

Wait, let's see:

If we have an element a, and we flip it to -a, the change in sum is -2a.

So, yes, flipping a positive element to negative reduces the sum by twice its value.

Therefore, the sum after Bob's action would be the sum of the n - k largest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements among them.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice should choose the n - k largest elements, and Bob will flip the x largest among them to negative.

Therefore, the sum would be sum of n - k largest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

So, to compute this, we can sort the array in descending order.

Then, take the first n - k elements, and from them, subtract twice the sum of the first x elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, the n - k largest elements are the first n - k elements in the sorted array.

Then, the x largest among them are the first x elements.

So, sum of n - k largest elements is sum of the first n - k elements.

Then, subtract twice the sum of the first x elements among them.

So, sum = sum(a[0] to a[n - k - 1]) - 2 * sum(a[0] to a[x - 1])

Wait, but this seems too straightforward.

But let's think about it.

In the example given:

Test case 2:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

So, n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: [3,1,2,4]

Sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]

Alice can remove up to 1 element. So, she can choose to remove 1 element.

If she removes the smallest element, which is 1, then the remaining array is [4,3,2].

Bob can multiply up to 1 element by -1. To minimize the sum, he will multiply the largest element, which is 4, by -1, making it -4.

So, the sum becomes -4 + 3 + 2 = 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says:

"In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements. Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is 3+1+2-4=2 ."

Wait, so Alice chose not to remove any elements, meaning she removed 0 elements.

But k=1, so she could remove up to 1 element.

If she removes the smallest element, which is 1, then the array becomes [3,2,4], and Bob will multiply 4 by -1, making it -4, so sum is 3 + 2 -4 = 1, which is less than 2.

So, it's better for Alice to not remove any elements, so the sum is 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

So, in this case, not removing any elements is better for Alice than removing the smallest element.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, removing the smallest element would lead to a sum of 1, which is less than 2.

So, why is it better for Alice to not remove any elements?

Because if she removes the smallest element, Bob can flip the largest remaining element, resulting in a sum of 1.

If she doesn't remove any elements, Bob flips the largest element, resulting in a sum of 2.

So, in this case, not removing any elements is better for Alice.

Wait, but according to my earlier approach, the sum would be sum of n - k largest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

In this case, n=4, k=1, x=1.

If Alice removes 1 element, the n - k = 3 largest elements are [4,3,2], sum=9.

Bob flips the largest one, which is 4, so sum = 9 - 2*4 = 1.

If Alice removes 0 elements, n - k =4, sum=10.

Bob flips the largest one, which is 4, sum=10 - 2*4 = 2.

So, indeed, it's better for Alice to not remove any elements.

But according to my earlier logic, Alice can choose to remove up to k elements, and she should choose to remove elements in such a way that the sum of the n - k largest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them is maximized.

In this case, removing 1 element leads to sum=9 - 8 =1, while not removing any leads to sum=10 -8=2.

So, Alice should choose to not remove any elements.

Wait, but in general, how does Alice decide how many elements to remove?

She can choose to remove 0 to k elements.

For each possible number of elements to remove, i, from 0 to k, she removes i elements, leaving n - i elements.

Then, Bob flips the x largest among them.

So, for each i, the sum would be sum of the n - i largest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

Alice needs to choose the i that maximizes this sum.

So, she needs to consider all possible i from 0 to k, and choose the one that gives the maximum sum after Bob's action.

In the second test case, for i=0, sum=10 -8=2; for i=1, sum=9-8=1.

So, i=0 is better.

In the first test case, n=1, k=1, x=1.

Array: [1]

If Alice removes 1 element, sum=0.

If she removes 0 elements, sum=1 -2*1=-1.

So, better to remove the element, sum=0.

Which matches the sample output.

So, in general, Alice needs to consider all possible numbers of elements to remove, from 0 to k, and choose the one that maximizes the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

To compute this efficiently, we can sort the array in descending order.

Then, for each i from 0 to k, the sum of the n - i largest elements is sum(a[0] to a[n - i -1]).

Then, Bob will flip the x largest among them, which are a[0] to a[x-1].

So, the sum after Bob's action is sum(a[0] to a[n - i -1]) - 2*sum(a[0] to a[x-1]).

But we need to consider that if n - i < x, then Bob can flip all n - i elements.

So, we need to handle that case.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to handle this.

Let's look at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

a.reverse()

sum1 = sum(a)

ans = []

for i in range(k + 1):

if i == 0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])

ans.append(sums)

elif i + x - 1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]

ans.append(sums)

else:

sums = sums + a[i - 1]

ans.append(sums)

print(max(ans))

So, it's iterating through i from 0 to k, considering removing i elements.

For i=0, it calculates sum1 - 2*sum(a[:x]), which is sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements.

Then, for i from 1 to k, it updates sums by adding a[i - 1] (the element being removed) and subtracting 2*a[i + x -1].

This seems like it's trying to maintain the sum after removing i elements and considering Bob's flipping.

I need to verify if this correctly computes the sum for each i.

Let's see for i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2*sum(a[:x])

Which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements.

This makes sense, as Bob will flip the x largest elements.

For i=1:

sums = sums + a[0] - 2*a[1 + x -1] = sums + a[0] -2*a[x]

Wait, is this correct?

Wait, when i=1, Alice removes 1 element, which is a[0], the largest element.

Then, the remaining elements are a[1] to a[n-1].

Bob will flip the x largest among them, which are a[1] to a[x].

So, the sum should be sum(a[1:] ) - 2*sum(a[1:x+1])

Compared to i=0:

sum(a) - 2*sum(a[:x])

So, the difference between sum(a[1:]) - 2*sum(a[1:x+1]) and sum(a) - 2*sum(a[:x])

Let's compute:

sum(a[1:]) - 2*sum(a[1:x+1]) = sum(a) - a[0] - 2*(sum(a[1:x+1]))

sum(a) - 2*sum(a[:x]) = sum(a) - 2*(sum(a[0:x]))

Difference:

(sum(a) - a[0] - 2*sum(a[1:x+1])) - (sum(a) - 2*sum(a[0:x]))

Simplify:

- a[0] - 2*sum(a[1:x+1]) + 2*sum(a[0:x])

Which is:

- a[0] - 2*(sum(a[1:x+1]) - sum(a[0:x]))

Wait, sum(a[1:x+1]) - sum(a[0:x]) = sum(a[1:x+1]) - sum(a[0:x])

= (a[1] + ... + a[x]) - (a[0] + ... + a[x-1])

= a[x] - a[0]

So, the difference is:

- a[0] - 2*(a[x] - a[0]) = -a[0] -2*a[x] + 2*a[0] = a[0] - 2*a[x]

Therefore, sums for i=1 is sums for i=0 plus a[0] minus 2*a[x]

Which matches the code's update: sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]

Because for i=1, a[i - 1] = a[0], and a[i + x -1] = a[1 + x -1] = a[x]

So, it seems correct for i=1.

Similarly, for i=2:

sums = sums + a[1] - 2*a[x +1]

Which would be the sum for i=1 plus a[1] minus 2*a[x+1]

This seems to follow the pattern.

So, the code is maintaining the sum for each i by updating it based on the previous sum.

Then, for i from 0 to k, it collects all possible sums in the list ans, and finally prints the maximum among them.

This seems to be a correct implementation of the approach we discussed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
