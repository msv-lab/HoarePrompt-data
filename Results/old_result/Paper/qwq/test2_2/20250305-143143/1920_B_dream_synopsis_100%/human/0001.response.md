Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some moves to affect the sum of these numbers.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller elements will leave larger elements in the array, which is good for the sum.

Wait, but Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1 after Alice removes elements. So, Bob will try to minimize the sum by flipping the sign of the largest positive elements or the smallest negative elements.

Hmm, this is tricky because their objectives are opposed. Alice wants to make the sum as large as possible, and Bob wants to make it as small as possible.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, Alice removes up to k elements. She should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. So, she removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1. He wants to minimize the sum, so he should flip the largest positive elements to negative, because that would reduce the sum the most.

But wait, if there are negative elements left after Alice's removal, Bob might choose to flip them to positive, which would actually increase the sum. But since Bob wants to minimize the sum, he wouldn't do that unless it benefits him.

Actually, Bob should flip the x largest positive elements to negative, because that would reduce the sum the most.

So, overall, Alice removes the smallest k elements, and then Bob flips the x largest remaining positive elements to negative.

But I need to consider that Alice knows what Bob will do, so she needs to remove elements in a way that, after Bob's moves, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum considering Bob's minimizing move.

I need to find a way to calculate the optimal sum given these constraints.

Let me consider sorting the array first. If I sort the array in ascending order, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and the largest are at the end.

Alice can remove up to k elements from the beginning of this sorted array, but I'm not sure if that's the best strategy.

Wait, no. Since Alice wants to maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest elements, which are the negative ones or the smallest positive ones, depending on the array.

But in the problem, it says that the array elements are >=1, wait, looking back at the problem, it says "1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000", so all elements are positive.

Ah, important note: all elements are positive. So, no negative elements in the array initially.

Given that, Alice can remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements to negative.

Since all elements are positive, Bob will always choose to flip the largest x elements to negative, to minimize the sum.

So, the sum will be the total sum minus twice the sum of the x largest elements that Bob flips.

But Alice can remove up to k elements before Bob acts. So, she needs to remove some elements to minimize the impact of Bob's flip.

Let me think about different scenarios.

Scenario 1: Alice removes k elements.

Scenario 2: Bob flips x elements from the remaining ones.

Since all elements are positive, removing smaller elements would leave larger elements for Bob to flip, which is not desirable for Alice, because Bob will flip the largest ones to negative.

Wait, actually, Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's moves.

So, if Alice removes the smallest elements, that leaves larger elements for Bob to flip.

Bob will then flip the largest x elements to negative, which reduces the sum by twice the sum of those x largest elements.

So, Alice needs to decide how many elements to remove, up to k, in a way that minimizes the impact of Bob's flip.

Alternatively, perhaps Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But that seems counterintuitive because Alice wants to maximize the sum.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let’s denote that after Alice removes k elements, the remaining array is sorted in descending order.

Then, Bob will flip the first x elements to negative.

So, the sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the first x elements.

Wait, no. If Bob flips the first x elements to negative, then their contribution to the sum is subtracted twice.

Wait, no. If an element is positive, and Bob flips it to negative, then its contribution to the sum changes from +a to -a, which is a decrease of 2*a in the sum.

So, the new sum is the original sum minus twice the sum of the x largest elements that Bob flips.

So, if Alice removes k elements, she can choose which elements to remove.

To maximize the sum after Bob's move, she needs to choose which elements to remove such that the sum minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This is a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and then Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum after both moves is the sum of all elements minus the sum of the k smallest elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no.

Let’s think carefully.

Initial sum: sum of all elements.

After Alice removes k elements, the sum is sum of all elements minus sum of the k elements she removes.

Then, Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative, which reduces the sum by twice the sum of those x elements.

So, the final sum is:

sum of all elements - sum of k elements removed by Alice - 2 * sum of x largest remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize this sum, so she needs to choose which k elements to remove such that the sum - sum_k - 2 * sum_x is maximized.

This is equivalent to choosing k elements to remove and x elements that Bob will flip, to maximize sum - sum_k - 2 * sum_x.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, and find a way to compute the minimax sum.

Let me look for a better approach.

I recall that in game theory, in minimax problems, we can sometimes find an optimal strategy by considering the order of operations and the choices available at each step.

Given that all elements are positive, perhaps there is a way to compute the optimal sum efficiently.

Let me consider sorting the array in ascending order.

So, the array is sorted: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Alice can remove up to k elements. Since all elements are positive, removing the smallest elements would leave larger elements for Bob to flip.

But Bob will flip the largest x elements to negative.

So, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, then the remaining array is ak+1 to an.

Bob will flip the largest x elements in this remaining array to negative.

So, the sum would be sum from k+1 to n minus 2 * sum of the largest x elements in this subset.

Therefore, the sum is sum[k+1 to n] - 2 * sum[ n-x to n ].

Wait, no. The largest x elements in ak+1 to an would be a(n) down to a(n-x+1).

So, sum from k+1 to n minus 2 * sum from n-x+1 to n.

Wait, but this might not be accurate if k + x >= n.

I need to handle cases where k + x >= n.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice removes the smallest k elements, and Bob flips the largest x remaining elements.

So, the sum would be sum of elements from k+1 to n - 2 * sum of the largest x elements in this subset.

To maximize this sum, Alice needs to choose k elements to remove such that the sum from k+1 to n - 2 * sum of the largest x elements is maximized.

But since the array is sorted in ascending order, the sum from k+1 to n is maximized when Alice removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the largest x elements in this remaining set, which are a(n) to a(n-x+1).

So, the sum would be sum from k+1 to n minus 2 * sum from n-x+1 to n.

Therefore, the sum is sum[k+1 to n] - 2 * sum[n-x+1 to n].

But is this the optimal strategy for Alice?

Wait, maybe not.

Perhaps Alice can remove some of the larger elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But that seems counterintuitive because those larger elements contribute more to the sum.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements, then Bob flips the largest x remaining elements to negative.

Is there a better strategy for Alice where she removes some of the larger elements to minimize the impact of Bob's flip?

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

If Alice removes the smallest element, 1, then the remaining array is [2,3,4]

Bob will flip the largest x=1 element, which is 4, to -4.

Sum = 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1

But in the explanation, it says the sum is 2.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the explanation, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2+(-4)=2.

But if Alice removes 1, then sum=2+3+(-4)=1, which is less than 2.

So, in this case, Alice should not remove any elements.

Hence, my initial approach is flawed.

So, perhaps Alice should remove elements in such a way that the sum after Bob's flip is maximized.

In this case, by not removing any elements, the sum is 3+1+2+(-4)=2, which is better than removing 1 and getting 2+3+(-4)=1.

So, in this case, Alice should not remove any elements.

But according to my previous approach, she would remove the smallest element.

So, my previous approach is incorrect.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any k elements to remove.

She needs to choose which k elements to remove such that after Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice maximizes the sum after Bob minimizes it.

To solve this, perhaps I can consider all possible choices of k elements to remove, and for each choice, compute the sum after Bob flips the x largest remaining elements, and then choose the maximum among those.

But that's too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum will be the sum of the remaining n - k elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Because flipping them to negative reduces their contribution by 2*ai.

So, sum = sum(all) - sum(k smallest) - 2 * sum(x largest from remaining)

I need to maximize sum(all) - sum(k smallest) - 2 * sum(x largest from remaining)

Given that sum(all) is constant, this is equivalent to maximizing - sum(k smallest) - 2 * sum(x largest from remaining)

Which is equivalent to minimizing sum(k smallest) + 2 * sum(x largest from remaining)

So, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove to minimize sum(k) + 2 * sum(x largest from remaining n - k elements)

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that Alice chooses to remove some elements, and Bob responds by flipping the x largest remaining elements.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me try to think of it in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Alice wants to keep as many large elements as possible, but she has to account for Bob flipping the largest x of them to negative.

So, perhaps Alice should aim to keep as many positive elements as possible, while minimizing the impact of Bob's flip.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice chooses to keep n - k elements, and among those, Bob will flip the x largest to negative.

So, the sum will be sum of the n - k elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove such that the remaining n - k elements have the maximum possible sum minus twice the sum of their x largest elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for a given set of n - k elements, the sum after Bob's flip is sum - 2 * sum of the top x.

I need to maximize this over the choice of which k to remove.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over the possible number of elements Alice removes, and compute the corresponding sum after Bob's flip.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice removes i elements, for i from 0 to k.

Then, Bob flips the x largest from the remaining n - i elements.

So, for each i, the sum is sum of the remaining n - i elements minus twice the sum of the top x of them.

Then, I need to choose the i that maximizes this sum, for i from 0 to k.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Then, for each i from 0 to k:

sum_remaining = sum(a[i+1] to a[n])

sum_top_x = sum(a[i+1] to a[i + x])

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

Then, choose the i that maximizes sum_after_flip.

Wait, but I need to make sure that i + x <= n.

Otherwise, if i + x > n, then Bob can flip all remaining elements.

Wait, no, Bob can flip up to x elements, so if n - i < x, he flips all remaining elements.

So, for each i from 0 to k:

if n - i >= x:

sum_after_flip = sum(a[i+1 to n]) - 2 * sum(a[i+1 to i + x])

else:

sum_after_flip = sum(a[i+1 to n]) - 2 * sum(a[i+1 to n])

Then, choose the maximum sum_after_flip over i from 0 to k.

This seems correct.

Now, I need to compute this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is 2e5, so it should be acceptable.

I need to sort the array in descending order, which is O(n log n), but since n can be up to 2e5, it should be fine.

Then, for each i from 0 to k, compute sum_remaining and sum_top_x.

To compute sum_remaining, I can precompute prefix sums.

Similarly, for sum_top_x, I can use prefix sums.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, sort the array in descending order.

Then, compute prefix sums.

Let's say prefix[i] = sum of a[0 to i-1]

Then, sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_top_x = prefix[i + x] - prefix[i]

if i + x <= n:

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

else:

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * (prefix[n] - prefix[i])

Then, find the maximum sum_after_flip over i from 0 to k.

This should work.

Let me verify this with the second test case.

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]

prefix sums: [0,4,7,9,10]

for i=0:

if 0 + 1 =1 <=4: sum_remaining=10-0=10, sum_top_x=7-0=7, sum_after_flip=10-14=-4

for i=1:

if 1+1=2<=4: sum_remaining=10-4=6, sum_top_x=9-4=5, sum_after_flip=6-10=-4

for i=2:

if 2+1=3<=4: sum_remaining=10-7=3, sum_top_x=10-7=3, sum_after_flip=3-6=-3

for i=3:

if 3+1=4<=4: sum_remaining=10-9=1, sum_top_x=10-9=1, sum_after_flip=1-2=-1

for i=4:

no elements left.

The maximum among these is -1, but according to the sample, it's 2.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood something.

Wait, in the sample explanation for the second test case, it says that Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2+(-4)=2.

But according to my calculation, when i=0, sum_after_flip=-4, but in reality, it should be 2.

So, there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I have misdefined sum_remaining or sum_top_x.

Let me re-examine.

After sorting in descending order: [4,3,2,1]

For i=0:

sum_remaining = sum(a[0 to 3]) = 4+3+2+1=10

sum_top_x = sum(a[0 to 0]) =4

sum_after_flip =10 - 2*4=2

Ah, here's the mistake. In my earlier calculation, I had prefix[i+x] - prefix[i], which for i=0, x=1 would be a[0] =4, so sum_after_flip=10-8=2, which matches the sample.

Wait, but earlier I had sum_top_x=7-0=7, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscomputed the prefix sums.

Let me redefine prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[i] as sum of a[0 to i-1]

So, for a=[4,3,2,1], prefix=[0,4,7,9,10]

For i=0:

sum_remaining=prefix[4]-prefix[0]=10-0=10

sum_top_x=prefix[1]-prefix[0]=4-0=4

sum_after_flip=10-8=2

For i=1:

sum_remaining=prefix[4]-prefix[1]=10-4=6

sum_top_x=prefix[2]-prefix[1]=7-4=3

sum_after_flip=6-6=0

For i=2:

sum_remaining=prefix[4]-prefix[2]=10-7=3

sum_top_x=prefix[3]-prefix[2]=9-7=2

sum_after_flip=3-4=-1

For i=3:

sum_remaining=prefix[4]-prefix[3]=10-9=1

sum_top_x=prefix[4]-prefix[3]=10-9=1

sum_after_flip=1-2=-1

For i=4:

no elements left.

So, the maximum sum_after_flip is 2, which matches the sample.

Earlier, I mistakenly used prefix[i+x] instead of prefix[i+x] - prefix[i], which led to incorrect calculations.

So, the correct approach is:

Sort the array in descending order.

Compute prefix sums where prefix[i] is sum of a[0 to i-1].

Then, for each i from 0 to k:

if i + x <= n:

sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_top_x = prefix[i+x] - prefix[i]

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

else:

sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_top_x = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

Then, choose the maximum sum_after_flip over i from 0 to k.

This seems correct now.

Let me verify with another sample.

Take the first test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

sorted descending: [1]

prefix=[0,1]

for i=0:

sum_remaining=1-0=1

sum_top_x=1-0=1

sum_after_flip=1-2= -1

for i=1:

no elements left.

Maximum is -1, but according to the sample, it's 0.

Wait, in the sample, it says output 0, but according to this, it's -1.

So, there's still an issue.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if Alice removes all k elements, then the sum is 0.

Yes, that makes sense.

In the first test case, if Alice removes the only element, then the sum is 0, which is better than -1.

So, in addition to considering i from 0 to k, I need to include the case where Alice removes all k elements, leading to sum=0.

So, perhaps I need to consider i from 0 to k, and also include the case where i=k, sum=0.

Wait, but in the loop, i goes up to k, inclusive.

For i=k:

sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[k]

sum_top_x = prefix[k+x] - prefix[k], but if k+x >n, it's prefix[n] - prefix[k]

But in the first test case, n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

sorted: [1]

prefix=[0,1]

for i=0:

sum_remaining=1-0=1

sum_top_x=1-0=1

sum_after_flip=1-2=-1

for i=1:

sum_remaining=1-1=0

sum_top_x=0-1=0 (but should be prefix[n]-prefix[k]=0-1= -1, which is incorrect.

Wait, prefix[n]=1, prefix[k]=1, so sum_remaining=0

sum_top_x=prefix[min(n,k+x)] - prefix[k] =prefix[1]-1=0

sum_after_flip=0-0=0

Then, the maximum among -1 and 0 is 0, which matches the sample.

So, in this case, it works.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

sorted descending: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

prefix=[0,6,11,15,18,20,21]

for i=0:

sum_remaining=21-0=21

sum_top_x= sum of top 3: 6+5+4=15

sum_after_flip=21-30=-9

for i=1:

sum_remaining=21-6=15

sum_top_x=15-6=9

sum_after_flip=15-18=-3

for i=2:

sum_remaining=21-11=10

sum_top_x=15-11=4

sum_after_flip=10-8=2

for i=3:

sum_remaining=21-15=6

sum_top_x=18-15=3

sum_after_flip=6-6=0

for i=4:

sum_remaining=21-20=1

sum_top_x=21-20=1

sum_after_flip=1-2=-1

for i=5:

sum_remaining=21-21=0

sum_top_x=0

sum_after_flip=0-0=0

for i=6:

sum=0

Maximum is 2.

But according to the sample, the output is 0.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in the sample, n=6, k=6, x=3, a=[1,4,3,2,5,6], output is 0.

But according to my calculation, the maximum sum_after_flip is 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in this case, k=6, n=6, so when i=6, sum=0.

But according to my earlier calculation, the maximum is 2, but the sample output is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the maximum between the calculated sum_after_flip and 0.

Because if Alice removes all k elements, the sum is 0, and she can choose to do that instead of leaving some elements for Bob to flip.

So, perhaps I need to take the maximum of all sum_after_flip and 0.

In this case, the maximum sum_after_flip is 2, which is greater than 0, but according to the sample, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if Alice removes k elements, the sum is 0, but in my calculation, i=6 gives sum=0, but i=3 gives sum_after_flip=0, i=2 gives 2, which is higher.

But sample output is 0, not 2.

There's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that when i + x <=n, then sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x, else sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_remaining.

Wait, no, if i + x >=n, then Bob can flip all remaining elements.

So, sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x, where sum_top_x is sum of the top x remaining elements.

If n - i < x, then sum_top_x is sum of all remaining elements.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, for i=2, n=6, k=6, x=3, i=2, n - i=4 >=x=3, so sum_top_x= sum(a[3 to 5])=4+3+2=9, sum_remaining=21-6=15, sum_after_flip=15-18=-3, which is less than 0.

Wait, but earlier I had sum_top_x=4, which was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misindexed.

Wait, a sorted descending: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

prefix=[0,6,11,15,18,20,21]

for i=2:

sum_remaining=21-11=10

sum_top_x=prefix[i+x]-prefix[i]=prefix[5]-prefix[2]=20-11=9

sum_after_flip=10-18=-8

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4, but it's 9.

So, sum_after_flip=10-18=-8, which is worse than 0.

Hence, in this case, the maximum sum_after_flip is 0, which matches the sample.

So, earlier I miscalculated sum_top_x for i=2.

Hence, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct way is:

Sort the array in descending order.

Compute prefix sums.

For each i from 0 to k:

if i + x <= n:

sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_top_x = prefix[i+x] - prefix[i]

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

else:

sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_top_x = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

Keep track of the maximum sum_after_flip.

Finally, take the maximum between this maximum sum_after_flip and 0.

Wait, no, because when i=k, sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[k], and sum_top_x accordingly.

But in the case where k=n, sum_remaining=0, sum_after_flip=0.

Wait, no, when i=k, sum_remaining = prefix[n] - prefix[k].

If k=n, sum_remaining=0.

Hence, sum_after_flip=0.

So, including i=k covers the case where Alice removes all k elements, leading to sum=0.

Hence, I just need to consider i from 0 to k inclusive, and choose the maximum sum_after_flip.

In the earlier miscalculation, I had sum_top_x wrong for i=2, but correcting it gives sum_after_flip=-8, which is less than 0.

Hence, the maximum is 0, matching the sample.

Therefore, the approach is correct.

Now, let's see the given code and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

a.reverse()

sum1 = sum(a)

ans = []

for i in range(k + 1):

if i == 0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])

ans.append(sums)

elif i + x - 1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]

ans.append(sums)

else:

sums = sums + a[i - 1]

ans.append(sums)

print(max(ans))

So, it sorts the array in descending order, computes the total sum sum1.

Then, it initializes ans as an empty list.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to k inclusive.

For i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x-1])

ans.append(sums)

Then, for i from 1 to k:

if i + x -1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2 * a[i+x-1]

else:

sums = sums + a[i-1]

ans.append(sums)

Finally, print the maximum of ans.

Wait, this seems to be implementing the approach I just described, but with some optimizations.

Let's see.

For i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x-1])

which is sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x, since sum_remaining = sum1 - sum(a[0 to i=0-1]) = sum1 - 0 = sum1

sum_top_x = sum(a[0 to x-1])

Hence, sum_after_flip = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x-1])

Then, for i=1:

if 1 + x -1 =x <n:

sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2 * a[i+x-1]

Which is sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Wait, a is sorted in descending order, so a[0] is the largest, a[1] is the next, and so on.

Wait, is this correctly updating sums?

Let me check.

From i=0 to i=1:

sums_new = sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

But, according to the earlier approach, sum_after_flip for i=1 is:

sum_remaining = sum1 - a[0]

sum_top_x = sum(a[1 to x])

sum_after_flip = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

Which is sum1 - a[0] - 2 * (sum(a[1 to x]))

Which is equal to (sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x])) + a[0]

Wait, no.

Wait:

sum1 - a[0] - 2 * (sum(a[1 to x]))

= sum1 - a[0] - 2 * (sum(a[0 to x]) - a[0])

= sum1 - a[0] - 2 * sum(a[0 to x]) + 2 * a[0]

= sum1 + a[0] - 2 * sum(a[0 to x])

= (sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x])) + a[0]

Which is equal to sums + a[0]

But in the code, it's sums + a[i-1] - 2 * a[i+x-1], which for i=1, is sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Wait, a[i+x-1] = a[1 + x -1] = a[x]

So, it's sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

But according to the earlier calculation, it should be sums + a[0] - 2 * (sum(a[1 to x]) )

But sum(a[1 to x]) = sum(a[0 to x]) - a[0]

Hence, -2 * sum(a[1 to x]) = -2 * (sum(a[0 to x]) - a[0]) = -2 * sum(a[0 to x]) + 2 * a[0]

So, sums + a[0] - 2 * sum(a[1 to x]) = sums + a[0] -2*(sum(a[0 to x]) - a[0]) = sums + a[0] -2*sum(a[0 to x]) + 2*a[0] = sums + 3*a[0] -2*sum(a[0 to x])

Wait, but earlier I had sums + a[0], which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Let me try to see the difference between sum_after_flip for i=0 and i=1.

sum_after_flip(i=0) = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[0 to x-1])

sum_after_flip(i=1) = sum1 - a[0] - 2 * sum(a[1 to x])

Difference:

sum_after_flip(i=1) - sum_after_flip(i=0) = -a[0] - 2*(sum(a[1 to x]) - sum(a[0 to x-1]))

But sum(a[1 to x]) - sum(a[0 to x-1]) = a[x] - a[0]

Hence, difference = -a[0] - 2*(a[x] - a[0]) = -a[0] -2*a[x] + 2*a[0] = a[0] - 2*a[x]

Therefore, sum_after_flip(i=1) = sum_after_flip(i=0) + a[0] - 2*a[x]

Which matches the code's update: sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2 * a[i+x-1]

For i=1, a[i-1]=a[0], a[i+x-1]=a[x]

Hence, sums = sums + a[0] - 2*a[x]

Similarly, for i=2:

sums = sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x+1]

And so on.

This seems correct.

Therefore, the code is correctly implementing the approach where it computes sum_after_flip for each i from 0 to k, and keeps track of the maximum sum_after_flip.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
