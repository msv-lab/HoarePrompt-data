Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a hidden array `a` of size `n`, and each element is either 1 or -1. From this array, we calculate prefix sums `p`, where `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`. Then, this prefix sum array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The task is, given this sorted prefix sum array `p`, to count how many initial arrays `a` could lead to this sorted `p`, and output this count modulo 998244353.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. We have an array `a` of 1s and -1s, we compute its prefix sums, sort them, and we're given this sorted array. We need to find out how many such `a` arrays can result in the given sorted prefix sums.

Let me think about the properties of prefix sums and sorting. The prefix sums represent the cumulative sum of the array `a` up to each position. Sorting these prefix sums changes their order, so I need to consider all possible permutations of prefix sums that could sort to the given array.

Wait, but the problem says that `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we're given this sorted `p`. So, we need to find all possible `a` such that when we compute their prefix sums and sort them, we get the given `p`.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look at small examples to get some intuition.

Let's look at the first test case in the example:

Input:

5

1

0

1

1

3

-1 1 2

5

-1 0 0 1 1

5

-4 -3 -3 -2 -1

Output:

0

1

0

3

1

So, for n=1, p=[0], the output is 0. For n=1, p should be either [1] or [-1], so indeed, there's no a that can result in p=[0] after sorting.

For n=1, p=[1], output is 1, which makes sense because a=[1] leads to p=[1], and sorting doesn't change it.

For n=3, p=[-1,1,2], output is 0, meaning no such a exists.

For n=5, p=[-1,0,0,1,1], output is 3, meaning there are three possible a's that can lead to this sorted p.

And for n=5, p=[-4,-3,-3,-2,-1], output is 1.

So, I need to find a way to count the number of a's that can lead to the given sorted p.

Let me think about the properties of prefix sums.

First, p[0] = a[0], p[1] = a[0] + a[1], ..., p[n-1] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1].

Now, these p's are sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, p_sorted = sorted(p).

Given p_sorted, I need to find the number of a's such that when you compute p and sort it, you get p_sorted.

This seems complicated because sorting p changes the order, so I need to consider all possible permutations of p that sort to p_sorted.

Wait, but since p_sorted is already sorted, and we're given p_sorted, maybe I can work with the properties of sorted prefix sums.

Let me consider that the minimal prefix sum is p[0], and the maximal is p[n-1].

In the sorted p, p[0] is the smallest prefix sum, and p[n-1] is the largest.

Now, in the original p before sorting, the prefix sums can be in any order, but after sorting, they are in non-decreasing order.

I need to find the number of a's such that when you compute p and sort it, you get the given p_sorted.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can think about the differences between consecutive prefix sums.

Wait, no. Because after sorting, the order is changed.

Perhaps I should consider that the sorted prefix sums are in non-decreasing order, so the differences between consecutive elements are non-negative.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently. Since a consists only of 1 and -1, the prefix sums can be seen as a random walk on the integer line, starting from 0.

Each step moves either up by 1 or down by 1.

Given that, the sorted prefix sums are the set of positions reached, sorted.

I need to find how many such paths have the same set of positions, regardless of order.

This seems related to the number of paths that touch certain points.

But I'm not sure about the exact approach.

Maybe I can think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me consider that.

I can keep track of the possible sums at each step and see how they lead to the sorted p.

But I need to ensure that after sorting, the prefix sums match the given p_sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal prefix sum is p[0], and from there, build up the possible a's.

But it's still confusing.

Let me look at the constraints.

n can be up to 5000, and t (number of test cases) is up to 1000, but the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

So, overall time complexity should be O(T*N), which is acceptable.

Now, in the code provided, there's a function func_1(n, p) which seems to be attempting a dynamic programming approach.

Let me try to understand what it's doing.

In func_1, there's a dp array of size 2*n +1, with an offset of n.

dp[offset] is initialized to 1, which probably represents the starting point at sum=0.

Then, for each step i from 1 to n, it updates dp by considering adding +1 or -1 to the current sum.

Finally, it computes the final sum required, which is p[-1] + offset, and returns dp[final_sum].

Wait, but in the problem, p is sorted, and p[-1] is the maximum prefix sum.

So, this seems to be trying to count the number of paths where the final sum is p[-1], given that each step can add +1 or -1.

But, this seems too simplistic because it doesn't take into account the intermediate sums and their sorting.

In other words, this dp only ensures that the final sum is p[-1], but it doesn't ensure that the sorted intermediate sums match the given p.

So, this approach is incomplete.

Looking back at the example, for n=5, p=[-1,0,0,1,1], the correct answer is 3.

But if I use this dp approach, it would just check if the final sum is 1, and count all paths with sum=1, but that's not correct because not all of them will have sorted prefix sums equal to [-1,0,0,1,1].

So, this func_1 is incorrect.

Then, why is it wrapped in func_2, which reads input and calls func_1 for each test case?

Because func_1 is incorrect, the entire program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=1, p=[1], it outputs 1, which is correct, and for n=1, p=[0], it outputs 0, which is also correct.

But for n=3, p=[-1,1,2], it outputs 0, which is correct, and for n=5, p=[-1,0,0,1,1], it outputs 3, which seems correct based on the note.

And for n=5, p=[-4,-3,-3,-2,-1], it outputs 1, which is correct.

So, maybe it's coincidentally giving correct answers for small cases, but is it generally correct?

I suspect not.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2, p_sorted=[-2,0].

Possible a's:

a=[-1,-1], p=[-1,-2], sorted=[-2,-1] ≠ [-2,0]. So, no.

a=[-1,1], p=[-1,0], sorted=[-1,0] ≠ [-2,0]. No.

a=[1,-1], p=[1,0], sorted=[0,1] ≠ [-2,0]. No.

a=[1,1], p=[1,2], sorted=[1,2] ≠ [-2,0]. No.

So, there are no such a's, so output should be 0.

But, according to the dp approach in func_1, it would check if final sum is 0, and count paths with sum=0.

For n=2, number of paths with sum=0 is C(2,1)=2, since we need 1 +1 and 1 -1.

But in reality, neither of them has sorted p=[-2,0].

So, in this case, func_1 would return 2, but the correct answer is 0.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, it seems to give correct answers.

Maybe the example test cases are not sufficient to catch the error.

Let me think of another test case.

n=2, p_sorted=[-1,1].

Possible a's:

a=[-1,1], p=[-1,0], sorted=[-1,0] ≠ [-1,1].

a=[1,-1], p=[1,0], sorted=[0,1] ≠ [-1,1].

a=[1,1], p=[1,2], sorted=[1,2] ≠ [-1,1].

a=[-1,-1], p=[-1,-2], sorted=[-2,-1] ≠ [-1,1].

So, no a's satisfy this, so output should be 0.

But func_1 would check if final sum is 1, and count paths with sum=1, which is C(2,0)=1 (a=[1,1]).

But in reality, a=[1,1] doesn't have sorted p=[-1,1], it has [1,2].

So, again, func_1 would return 1, but correct answer is 0.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

I need to think of a correct approach.

Let me consider that the sorted prefix sums must match the given p.

So, the set of prefix sums, regardless of order, must be equal to p.

But, since p is sorted, I need to consider all permutations of p that could be the original prefix sums before sorting.

Wait, but it's not just any permutation, because prefix sums have dependencies.

p_i depends on p_{i-1} and a_i.

So, perhaps I can reconstruct possible a's from the sorted p.

Let me consider that.

Given sorted p, I need to find all possible a's such that the multiset of prefix sums is equal to p.

This seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that the sorted prefix sums must include all possible sums that can be obtained by any permutation of the original prefix sums.

Wait, that's not clear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the sorted prefix sums p.

I need to find the number of sequences a of 1 and -1 such that when I compute the prefix sums of a and sort them, I get p.

This is equivalent to finding the number of sequences a where the multiset of prefix sums is equal to p.

This seems related to counting the number of paths in a 1D random walk that pass through certain points.

But I need to ensure that the set of positions reached (prefix sums) is exactly p.

This is tricky.

Maybe inclusion-exclusion can be applied here, but it might be too slow.

Another idea: since p is sorted, p[0] is the minimal possible prefix sum, and p[n-1] is the maximal.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the sorted p and keep track of possible a's that can lead to these prefix sums.

But I need to ensure that the multiset of prefix sums matches p.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to have the first i prefix sums (in some order) sum up to j.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look back at the provided func_1.

It seems to only check that the final sum is equal to p[-1], which is insufficient, as we've seen in the counterexamples.

So, I need a dp that keeps track of all prefix sums.

But that would be too slow for n=5000.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sorted prefix sums must include all sums from the minimal to the maximal, with certain constraints based on the steps being +1 or -1.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the minimal prefix sum, say p[0].

Then, the other prefix sums must be greater than or equal to p[0], and the differences between consecutive prefix sums must be possible given the steps of +1 or -1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sorted prefix sums as a new sequence, and try to build a sequence a that can achieve this sequence of prefix sums in some order.

This seems promising.

Let me think more carefully.

Suppose I have the sorted prefix sums p.

I need to arrange them in some order such that they form a valid sequence of prefix sums for some a.

That is, starting from p[0], each subsequent p[i] should differ by +1 or -1.

But p is sorted, so I need to find a permutation of p that forms a valid path where each step is +1 or -1.

This sounds like finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where nodes are the elements of p, and edges exist between nodes that differ by +1 or -1.

But finding Hamiltonian paths is NP-hard, which is not feasible for n=5000.

So, this approach is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the frequency of each sum value in p.

Since p is sorted, duplicates indicate that multiple prefix sums have the same value.

Now, in a sequence of prefix sums, the number of times a sum s appears is equal to the number of times the sum returns to s, plus one for the initial reach.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I can look at the differences between consecutive sorted prefix sums.

Wait, but since p is sorted, the differences are non-negative.

But in the original prefix sums, the differences can be +1 or -1.

So, this doesn't directly help.

Let me think about the number of times each sum is achieved.

In the original sequence of prefix sums, each sum p_i is unique or can be repeated.

The key is that the multiset of prefix sums must match p.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Perhaps I can consider generating functions or some combinatorial formula.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider small n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n=1:

p=[-1] or p=[1], depending on a=[-1] or a=[1].

So, if given p=[-1], answer is 1.

Given p=[1], answer is 1.

Given p=[0], answer is 0.

This matches the first two test cases.

For n=2:

Possible p's:

a=[1,1]: p=[1,2]

a=[1,-1]: p=[1,0]

a=[-1,1]: p=[-1,0]

a=[-1,-1]: p=[-1,-2]

Sorted p's:

[1,2], [0,1], [-1,0], [-2,-1]

So, if given p=[-1,0], it can be achieved by a=[-1,1].

Given p=[0,1], it can be achieved by a=[1,-1].

Given p=[-2,-1], by a=[-1,-1].

Given p=[1,2], by a=[1,1].

Any other p, like p=[-1,1], p=[-2,0], etc., are impossible.

So, for n=2, p=[-1,0], answer is 1.

p=[0,1], answer is 1.

p=[-2,-1], answer is 1.

p=[1,2], answer is 1.

p=[-1,1], answer is 0.

Now, if I use func_1 for n=2, p=[-1,0], it would check if final sum is 0, and count paths with sum=0, which is 2 (a=[-1,1] and a=[1,-1]). But only one of them has sorted p=[-1,0], which is a=[-1,1]. So, it would incorrectly return 2 instead of 1.

Wait, but in my earlier counterexample, I thought it would return 1, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, for n=2, p=[-1,0], p[-1]=0.

So, func_1 would compute dp[0 + offset], where offset = n=2, so dp[2].

It initializes dp[2]=1.

Then, for i=1, it can go to dp[1] or dp[3].

For i=2, from dp[1], it can go to dp[0] and dp[2], from dp[3], it can go to dp[2] and dp[4].

Assuming a certain way of updating dp.

But in reality, I need to see the exact implementation.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(n, p):

dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

offset = n

dp[offset] = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):

new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

for j in range(2 * n + 1):

if dp[j] > 0:

if j + 1 <= 2 * n:

new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

if j - 1 >= 0:

new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

dp = new_dp

final_sum = p[-1] + offset

return dp[final_sum]

So, it's keeping track of the sum after n steps, with each step adding +1 or -1, and checking if the final sum matches p[-1].

But this doesn't ensure that the sorted prefix sums match p.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
