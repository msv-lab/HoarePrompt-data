Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips according to specific rules, and I need to determine who wins or if it's a draw when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game setup. The board has h rows and w columns, with rows numbered from 1 to h from top to bottom, and columns numbered from 1 to w from left to right. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a) and Bob at (x_b, y_b). The key points are:

- Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left, meaning her row increases by 1 each move.

- Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left, meaning his row decreases by 1 each move.

- Both cannot move beyond the board's boundaries.

- If a player moves to the position occupied by the other player, they win.

- If Alice cannot move (she's in row h), or Bob cannot move (he's in row 1), it's a draw.

Given that, I need to figure out, for multiple test cases, who wins or if it's a draw, assuming both play optimally.

Let me think about the possible scenarios:

1. **Alice is below Bob:** If Alice is already in a row higher than Bob's (xa > xb), Alice can't catch up to Bob because Alice can only move down and Bob up. So, in this case, it's a draw.

2. **Alice is above Bob:** If Alice is above Bob (xa < xb), Alice needs to reach Bob's row while Bob is moving up. I need to calculate if Alice can reach Bob before Bob escapes or vice versa.

Let's consider the relative positions and movements.

- The vertical distance between Alice and Bob is d = xb - xa.

- Each move, Alice closes the vertical gap by 1 (since she moves down and Bob moves up, their row difference decreases by 2 each turn).

- So, in terms of rows, Alice needs to cover d rows, and each turn (consisting of one move by Alice and one by Bob) reduces the gap by 2.

- Therefore, the number of turns to close the gap is ceil(d / 2).

But wait, let's think carefully.

If d is even, say d = 4, then in 2 turns, Alice can close the gap:

- Turn 1: Alice moves down to xa+1, Bob moves up to xb-1. New d = 2.

- Turn 2: Alice moves down to xa+2, Bob moves up to xb-2. Now Alice is at xa+2 and Bob at xb-2.

If d was 3:

- Turn 1: Alice moves down to xa+1, Bob to xb-1. New d = 1.

- Turn 2: Alice moves down to xa+2, Bob to xb-2. Now d = -1, meaning Alice has passed Bob.

Wait, but in this setup, Alice is moving down and Bob up, so their row difference decreases by 2 each turn.

Wait, actually, in each turn, Alice moves down by 1 and Bob moves up by 1, so the row difference decreases by 2.

So, for d rows between them, it takes d/2 turns to close the gap if d is even, and (d-1)/2 turns if d is odd.

But I need to think about the horizontal positions as well.

The horizontal positions can change by at most 1 per move, either left or right.

So, not only do they need to close the vertical gap, but their horizontal positions must also match at some point.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s define:

- Initial vertical distance: d_v = xb - xa.

- Initial horizontal distance: d_h = |ya - yb|.

Now, in each turn:

- Alice moves down by 1 and can adjust her column by -1, 0, or +1.

- Bob moves up by 1 and can adjust his column by -1, 0, or +1.

The game continues until:

- Alice and Bob are on the same cell.

- Alice cannot move (xa = h).

- Bob cannot move (xb = 1).

Given that, I need to see under what conditions Alice can make them land on the same cell before she cannot move, and similarly for Bob.

Let me consider the number of turns available:

- Alice can make moves until xa reaches h.

- Bob can make moves until xb reaches 1.

But since Alice starts and moves first, I need to account for that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of turns it takes for Alice to reach Bob's initial row and see if within those turns, they can align horizontally.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of meeting points.

Let me consider that Alice is moving down and Bob is moving up. So, their paths can intersect if their horizontal positions align at some row.

I need to find if there exists a row where both can reach, and their horizontal positions can coincide at that row.

Let me define:

- Let k be the number of turns Alice moves down.

- Then, Alice will be at row xa + k, and Bob will be at xb - k.

- They meet when xa + k = xb - k, which implies k = (xb - xa)/2.

- So, if (xb - xa) is even, k = (xb - xa)/2.

- If (xb - xa) is odd, there is no integer k where they are at the same row.

But, since Alice moves first, and they alternate moves, I need to consider the parity properly.

Wait, actually, since Alice moves down and Bob moves up alternately, the number of moves Alice makes is equal to the number of moves Bob makes, unless the total number of moves is odd.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total number of moves.

Let’s think recursively or in terms of game theory.

But that might be too slow for the constraints (t up to 10^4, h up to 10^6 per test case, but sum of h over all test cases is up to 10^6).

I need an O(1) or O(log n) per test case solution.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

First, if xa > xb, as I thought earlier, Alice can't catch up to Bob because she can only move down and Bob up. So, it's a draw.

Now, if xa <= xb:

- They can potentially meet at some row.

- I need to see if Alice can force a win or if Bob can escape.

Let me consider the vertical distance d = xb - xa.

- Each turn consists of Alice moving down by 1 and Bob moving up by 1, so the vertical distance decreases by 2 per turn.

- Therefore, it takes ceil(d / 2) turns to close the vertical gap.

But I need to relate this to their horizontal positions.

Let’s consider that in k turns, Alice can adjust her column by up to k steps (since she can move left or right by 1 each move).

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to k steps.

So, after k turns:

- Alice is at row xa + k, column ya + c_a, where -k <= c_a <= k.

- Bob is at row xb - k, column yb + c_b, where -k <= c_b <= k.

They meet when xa + k = xb - k and ya + c_a = yb + c_b.

From xa + k = xb - k, we get k = (xb - xa)/2, assuming (xb - xa) is even.

If (xb - xa) is odd, they can't be on the same row at the same time.

So, two cases:

1. (xb - xa) is even:

- k = (xb - xa)/2

- Then, Alice can reach row xb - k, and Bob reaches xa + k, which are the same.

- At this point, their columns must match: ya + c_a = yb + c_b, with |c_a| <= k and |c_b| <= k.

- So, yb - k - k <= ya <= yb + k + k, because c_a and c_b can be up to k in either direction.

- Wait, more precisely, ya can be from ya - k to ya + k, and yb can be from yb - k to yb + k.

- So, the overlap in columns is max(ya - k, yb - k) to min(ya + k, yb + k).

- If this overlap is non-empty, Alice can choose to move to a column within this overlap, and Bob can't prevent it.

- So, if max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k), then Alice can win.

- This simplifies to |ya - yb| <= 2k.

- Since k = (xb - xa)/2, then |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa).

- So, if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), Alice wins; else, draw.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let me verify.

Wait, actually, since k = (xb - xa)/2, and |ya - yb| <= 2k, which is |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa).

So, if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), Alice can win; else, draw.

But let's think about it.

Suppose xa = 1, xb = 3, ya = 1, yb = 3, w = 3.

Then, d_v = 2, k = 1.

So, |ya - yb| = 2 <= 2, so Alice can win.

Indeed, Alice moves down to row 2, column 2; Bob moves up to row 2, column 2; Alice wins.

Another example: xa = 1, xb = 3, ya = 1, yb = 4, w = 4.

Then, |ya - yb| = 3 > 2, so Alice cannot win; it's a draw.

Wait, but in this case, Alice moves down to row 2, column can be 0,1,2; Bob moves up to row 2, column can be 2,3,4.

If Alice moves to column 2, Bob can move to column 2 and win.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, since |ya - yb| = 3 > 2, it's a draw.

But in this case, Bob can win.

Hmm, so maybe my earlier logic is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider who moves last.

If (xb - xa) is even, then the number of turns k = (xb - xa)/2, and Alice moves k times, Bob moves k times.

But Alice moves first, so in even k, Bob moves last; in odd k, Alice moves last.

Wait, no, in k turns, Alice moves k times, Bob moves k times, since Alice moves first.

Wait, in k turns, Alice moves k times, Bob moves k times if k > 0; if k = 0, Bob doesn't move.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Let me try to think differently.

Let’s consider the total number of moves until they meet.

If (xb - xa) is even, k = (xb - xa)/2.

Then, after k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob, they are at the same row.

At that point, their column positions must match.

Alice can be at ya - k to ya + k.

Bob can be at yb - k to yb + k.

For Alice to win, there must be at least one column where Alice and Bob are at the same position.

So, the intersection of Alice's possible columns and Bob's possible columns must be non-empty.

That is, max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k).

Which simplifies to |ya - yb| <= 2k.

Since k = (xb - xa)/2, then |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa).

So, if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), Alice can win; else, it's a draw.

But in the earlier example, xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

Then, |ya - yb| = 3 <= 2 (xb - xa) = 2? Wait, 3 > 2, so it should be a draw, but according to the earlier thought, Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps Bob can win in some cases where |ya - yb| > (xb - xa).

But according to the problem statement, if a player places their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip, they win.

So, if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can move away, Alice wins.

But in the case where |ya - yb| > (xb - xa), Bob can potentially move away and avoid Alice.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can also try to avoid Alice.

So, perhaps in some cases, even if |ya - yb| > (xb - xa), Bob can't avoid Alice.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of who has the last move.

If (xb - xa) is even, then after k = (xb - xa)/2 moves, they are at the same row.

At that point, if their column positions can coincide, Alice wins; else, it's a draw.

If (xb - xa) is odd, they never meet at the same row, so it's a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example, xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

Then, d_v = 2, k=1.

After 1 move by Alice and 1 by Bob, Alice is at row 2, column can be 0,1,2; Bob is at row 2, column can be 2,3,4.

So, overlapping columns are 2.

If Alice moves to column 2, Bob can also move to column 2 and win.

So, in this case, Bob can win.

But according to the earlier condition, |ya - yb| = 3 > 2, so it should be a draw.

But in reality, Bob can win.

So, perhaps my condition is incomplete.

Maybe I need to consider that Bob can also affect the horizontal position.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can also choose his horizontal movement to either meet Alice or avoid her.

In this case, since Bob moves second, he can react to Alice's move.

So, perhaps when (xb - xa) is even, and |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), Alice can win; else, Bob can win or it's a draw.

But in the earlier example, |ya - yb| = 3 > 2, so according to that, it should be a draw, but actually Bob can win.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose (xb - xa) is even, and k = (xb - xa)/2.

Then, Alice can reach columns from ya - k to ya + k.

Bob can reach columns from yb - k to yb + k.

If these intervals overlap, Alice can choose a column in the overlap and win.

Else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example, ya=1, yb=4, k=1.

Alice's possible columns: 0,1,2.

Bob's possible columns: 2,3,4.

Overlap at column 2.

So, Alice can move to column 2, Bob moves to column 2, and Bob wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, Alice can win by choosing column 2.

But in reality, Bob can choose to move to column 2 and win.

So, perhaps when (xb - xa) is even, and the intervals overlap, Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Let me think again.

If (xb - xa) is even, and the intervals overlap, then Bob can win by choosing the overlapping column; else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example, Bob can win by choosing column 2.

So, perhaps in this case, Bob wins if (xb - xa) is even and the intervals overlap; else, it's a draw.

But according to the problem statement, the player who places their chip on the other player's chip wins.

So, if Alice moves to Bob's position, Alice wins; if Bob moves to Alice's position, Bob wins.

In the overlapping case, both can choose to move to the overlapping column, so perhaps the one who moves second can choose to win.

Wait, in the example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

- Alice moves first to row 2, column can be 0,1,2.

- Bob moves second to row 2, column can be 2,3,4.

- If Alice chooses column 2, Bob can choose column 2 and win.

- If Alice chooses column 1, Bob can choose column 2 or 3.

- If Alice chooses column 0, Bob can choose column 2 or 3.

So, in this case, Bob can always choose to move to column 2 and win.

Hence, Bob wins.

So, perhaps when (xb - xa) is even and the intervals overlap, Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in another example:

xa=1, xb=3, ya=2, yb=2, w=3.

Then, k=1.

Alice can be at columns 1,2,3; Bob can be at columns 1,2,3.

Overlap is 1,2,3.

If Alice moves to column 2, Bob moves to column 2 and wins.

Same as before.

Wait, but if Alice moves to column 1, Bob can move to column 1 and win.

Similarly, if Alice moves to column 3, Bob moves to column 3 and wins.

So, Bob can always win in this case.

So, perhaps when (xb - xa) is even and the intervals overlap, Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

But in the case where |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), it's Bob who can win.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the condition.

Wait, perhaps if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

But in the earlier example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

|ya - yb| = 3 <= 2 (xb - xa), which is false (3 > 2), so it should be a draw, but in reality, Bob can win.

Wait, that's contradictory.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Bob can always choose to move to the column where Alice is, if possible.

So, if their column intervals overlap, Bob can choose to move to that column and win.

Else, it's a draw.

Hence, if max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k), then Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example, the intervals overlap at column 2, so Bob can win.

In another example where |ya - yb| > (xb - xa), the intervals don't overlap, so it's a draw.

Hence, perhaps:

- If (xb - xa) is even and max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k), then Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in the case where Alice can force a win, when should Alice win?

In the earlier thought process, I concluded that Alice can win only if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), but in reality, Bob can also win in that scenario.

So, perhaps I need to consider who moves last.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of k.

Let’s define k = floor((xb - xa)/2).

Then, after k moves, Alice is at xa + k, Bob is at xb - k.

If xa + k == xb - k, i.e., when (xb - xa) is even, then they are at the same row.

At that row, if their column intervals overlap, Bob can win by choosing to move to the overlapping column.

Else, it's a draw.

If (xb - xa) is odd, they never reach the same row at the same time, so it's a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example, xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

Then, k=1, xa + k = 2, xb - k = 2.

Column intervals: Alice 0,1,2; Bob 2,3,4. Overlap at 2.

So, Bob can win by moving to column 2.

In another example where |ya - yb| > (xb - xa), e.g., xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=5, w=5.

Then, k=1, Alice's columns 0,1,2; Bob's columns 3,4,5.

No overlap, so it's a draw.

Hence, perhaps the rule is:

- If (xb - xa) is even, and the column intervals overlap, then Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

- If (xb - xa) is odd, it's always a draw.

But in the earlier example, when (xb - xa) is even, and column intervals overlap, Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

Wait, but in another case:

xa=1, xb=3, ya=2, yb=2, w=3.

Then, k=1, Alice's columns 1,2,3; Bob's columns 1,2,3.

Overlap is 1,2,3.

So, Bob can win by moving to any of these columns.

If Alice moves to column 2, Bob moves to column 2 and wins.

Hence, Bob wins when (xb - xa) is even and column intervals overlap.

Else, it's a draw.

But in the case where (xb - xa) is odd, it's always a draw.

Wait, but what if (xb - xa) is odd, but their column positions coincide at some point?

Wait, if (xb - xa) is odd, they never reach the same row at the same time, so it's always a draw.

Hence, the condition is:

- If (xb - xa) is even:

- Let k = (xb - xa)/2.

- If max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k), then Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

- If (xb - xa) is odd, it's always a draw.

Wait, but in the earlier example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

Then, k=1, max(1-1,4-1)=0,3; min(1+1,4+1)=2,5.

So, 0 <= 5 is true, so Bob wins.

But in reality, their overlapping column is 2, so Bob can win.

In another example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=5, w=5.

Then, k=1, max(1-1,5-1)=0,4; min(1+1,5+1)=2,6.

So, 0 <= 2 is true, but in reality, there is no overlapping column.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, in the first example, max(ya - k, yb - k) = max(0,3) = 3

min(ya + k, yb + k) = min(2,5) = 2

So, 3 <= 2 is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should be true.

Wait, perhaps I messed up.

Wait, in the first example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

k=1

max(ya - k, yb - k) = max(0,3) = 3

min(ya + k, yb + k) = min(2,5) = 2

3 <= 2 is false, so according to this, it's a draw, but earlier reasoning suggests Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the condition.

Wait, perhaps if max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k), then there is an overlap, and Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

But in this case, max(0,3)=3 and min(2,5)=2, 3 > 2, so no overlap, it's a draw.

But earlier, I thought Bob can win by moving to column 2.

Wait, but in that case, Alice can only reach column 2 if she moves right, but Bob can choose to move to column 2 and win.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the possible columns Alice can reach and the possible columns Bob can reach at the meeting row.

Let me think again.

At the meeting row, row = xa + k = xb - k.

Alice can be at columns ya - k to ya + k.

Bob can be at columns yb - k to yb + k.

For their columns to coincide, there must be at least one column c where ya - k <= c <= ya + k and yb - k <= c <= yb + k.

Which is equivalent to max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k).

If this is true, then Bob can win by choosing such a column; else, it's a draw.

Hence, in the first example, max(0,3)=3 and min(2,5)=2, 3 > 2, so no overlap, it's a draw.

But earlier, I thought Bob could win by moving to column 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in that example, Alice can reach columns 0,1,2; Bob can reach 2,3,4.

So, they overlap at column 2.

Hence, max(ya - k, yb - k) = max(0,3)=3

min(ya + k, yb + k)=min(2,5)=2

3 > 2, so no overlap? But in reality, there is an overlap at column 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps it should be max(ya - k, yb - k) <= min(ya + k, yb + k).

In this case, max(0,3)=3 <= min(2,5)=2 is false, but there is an overlap at 2.

Wait, but 3 > 2, so no overlap according to the condition, but in reality, there is an overlap.

So, perhaps the condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the intervals separately.

Alice's possible columns: max(1, ya - k) to min(w, ya + k)

Bob's possible columns: max(1, yb - k) to min(w, yb + k)

Then, overlap exists if max(max(1, ya - k), max(1, yb - k)) <= min(min(w, ya + k), min(w, yb + k))

Simplify that:

max(1 + max(-ya + k, -yb + k), 1) <= min(w - max(ya + k, yb + k), w)

Wait, this seems too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the horizontal distance d_h = |ya - yb|.

Then, after k moves, Alice can reduce the horizontal distance by up to k (if she moves towards Bob).

Similarly, Bob can adjust his position by up to k.

So, the minimal possible horizontal distance after k moves is |d_h - 2k|.

If this is zero or less, then they can coincide.

Wait, but horizontal distance can be reduced by up to k by Alice and increased or decreased by Bob.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose to minimize the horizontal distance, while Bob can choose to maximize it.

But this is getting too involved.

Let me look for a simpler condition.

Looking back at the initial thought, perhaps it's sufficient to check if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa).

- If yes, Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

In the first example, |1 - 4| = 3 <= 2 (xb - xa), which is false, so draw.

But earlier, I thought Bob could win by moving to column 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), then Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

But in the earlier example, |1 - 4| = 3 > 2, so it's a draw.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, Bob can still win by moving to column 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that even if |ya - yb| > (xb - xa), Bob can still win if the overlapping columns exist.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the meeting row and see if their possible columns overlap.

Let me try to implement this in code.

Define k = (xb - xa) // 2 if (xb - xa) is even.

Then, Alice's possible columns: max(1, ya - k) to min(w, ya + k)

Bob's possible columns: max(1, yb - k) to min(w, yb + k)

If these intervals overlap, Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

Hence, in code, it would be:

if (xb - xa) % 2 == 0:

k = (xb - xa) // 2

l = max(1, ya - k, yb - k)

r = min(w, ya + k, yb + k)

if l <= r:

print("Bob")

else:

print("Draw")

else:

print("Draw")

Wait, but in the earlier example, xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

k=1

l = max(1, 1-1, 4-1) = max(1,0,3) = 3

r = min(4, 1+1, 4+1) = min(4,2,5) = 2

3 > 2, no overlap, so draw.

But earlier, I thought Bob could win by moving to column 2.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in determining the intervals.

Wait, Alice can be at columns ya - k to ya + k, but bounded by 1 to w.

Similarly for Bob.

So, Alice's possible columns: max(1, ya - k) to min(w, ya + k) = max(1,1-1)=1 to min(4,1+1)=2.

So, Alice can be at columns 1 and 2.

Bob's possible columns: max(1, yb - k)=max(1,4-1)=1 to min(4,4+1)=4.

So, Bob can be at columns 1,2,3,4.

Overlap is columns 1 and 2.

Hence, Bob can choose to move to column 2, where Alice is, and win.

Hence, it should be "Bob".

But according to the earlier condition, l = max(1, ya - k, yb - k)=max(1,0,3)=3

r = min(4,2,5)=2

3 > 2, no overlap, so draw.

But in reality, there is an overlap.

So, perhaps the condition should be:

l = max(max(1, ya - k), max(1, yb - k))

r = min(min(w, ya + k), min(w, yb + k))

if l <= r, then Bob can win; else, it's a draw.

In this case, max(max(1,0), max(1,3))=max(1,3)=3

min(min(4,2), min(4,5))=min(2,4)=2

3 > 2, no overlap, so draw.

But in reality, Alice's possible columns are 1,2 and Bob's are 1,2,3,4, so overlap at 1 and 2.

Hence, the earlier condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider:

l = max(max(1, ya - k), max(1, yb - k))

r = min(min(w, ya + k), min(w, yb + k))

if l <= r, then overlap exists.

In this case, max(1,1-1)=0, but bounded by 1, so 1

max(1,4-1)=3

So, l = max(1,3)=3

r = min(4,2)=2

3 > 2, no overlap.

But in reality, Alice can be at 1 and 2, Bob at 1,2,3,4, so overlap at 1 and 2.

Hence, perhaps the condition should be:

l = max(1, ya - k, yb - k)

r = min(w, ya + k, yb + k)

if l <= r, then overlap exists.

In this case, l = max(1,0,3)=3

r = min(4,2,5)=2

3 > 2, no overlap.

But in reality, there is an overlap.

So, perhaps I need to separate the intervals.

Alice's interval: max(1, ya - k) to min(w, ya + k)

Bob's interval: max(1, yb - k) to min(w, yb + k)

Overlap exists if max(alice_left, bob_left) <= min(alice_right, bob_right)

So, in this case:

alice_left = max(1,1-1)=1

alice_right = min(4,1+1)=2

bob_left = max(1,4-1)=3

bob_right = min(4,4+1)=4

max(alice_left, bob_left)=max(1,3)=3

min(alice_right, bob_right)=min(2,4)=2

3 > 2, no overlap.

But in reality, Alice can be at 1 and 2, Bob at 3 and 4, so no overlap.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was an overlap at 2.

Wait, no, in this specific example, Alice can be at 1 and 2, Bob at 3 and 4, no overlap.

Wait, but in the earlier thought, I thought Bob could move to column 2, but actually, in this case, Alice can only reach up to column 2, and Bob can be at columns 3 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps in this case, there is no overlap, hence it's a draw.

Wait, but according to the earlier condition, l=3, r=2, no overlap, draw.

Hence, it's a draw.

So, perhaps the condition is correct.

Wait, but in another example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=2, yb=2, w=3.

Then, k=1

alice_left = max(1,2-1)=1

alice_right = min(3,2+1)=3

bob_left = max(1,2-1)=1

bob_right = min(3,2+1)=3

max(1,1)=1 <= min(3,3)=3, so overlap exists, Bob can win.

Hence, the condition is:

if (xb - xa) is even:

k = (xb - xa) // 2

alice_left = max(1, ya - k)

alice_right = min(w, ya + k)

bob_left = max(1, yb - k)

bob_right = min(w, yb + k)

l = max(alice_left, bob_left)

r = min(alice_right, bob_right)

if l <= r:

print("Bob")

else:

print("Draw")

else:

print("Draw")

Wait, but in the problem statement, Alice can also win in some cases.

But according to this, it's either Bob wins or draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider who can reach the other first.

Wait, perhaps Alice can win in some cases.

Wait, in the example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=2, yb=2, w=3.

According to the above, it's Bob wins.

But in reality, Alice can move to row 2, column 2, and Bob moves to row 2, column 2, and Bob wins.

Hence, Bob wins.

In another example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4.

According to above, it's a draw.

Hence, perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's possible for Alice to win in some cases.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the condition for Alice's win.

Wait, perhaps when (xb - xa) is odd, it's a draw.

When (xb - xa) is even:

- If the intervals overlap, Bob wins.

- Else, it's a draw.

But in some cases, Alice can win.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can win if she can reach Bob before he can move away.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can win if |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), and (xb - xa) is even.

Else, it's a draw.

But in the earlier example, |1 - 4| = 3 > 2, so draw.

Wait, but in another example where xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=3, w=3.

Then, |1 - 3| = 2 <= 2, so Bob wins.

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

- If (xb - xa) is even and |ya - yb| <= (xb - xa), then Bob wins.

- Else, it's a draw.

But in the problem statement, Alice can also win in some cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can win if she can reach Bob before he can move away.

Wait, perhaps if (xb - xa) is even and the intervals overlap, Bob wins; else, check if Alice can win in some other way.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice can win if she can reach Bob's initial position before Bob can move away.

But according to the problem, Alice moves first, then Bob, alternately.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and see if she can align horizontally in time.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())

if xa > xb:

print('Draw')

else:

x = abs(xa - xb) // 2

if abs(xa - xb) % 2:

l = max(1, yb - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])

else:

l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])

So, the code does:

- If xa > xb, print 'Draw'

- Else:

- x = floor((xb - xa)/2)

- If (xb - xa) is odd:

- l = max(1, yb - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- If abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1, print 'Alice'; else 'Draw'

- Else (if (xb - xa) is even):

- l = max(1, ya - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- If abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, print 'Bob'; else 'Draw'

Wait, this seems similar to what I was thinking earlier.

In the odd case, it's checking if Alice can win, and in the even case, if Bob can win.

In the odd case:

- l = max(1, yb - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- Check if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1

- If yes, Alice wins; else, draw.

In the even case:

- l = max(1, ya - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- Check if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x

- If yes, Bob wins; else, draw.

I need to understand these conditions.

In the odd case, when (xb - xa) is odd:

- x = floor((xb - xa)/2)

- l = max(1, yb - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- Check if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1

What does this mean?

It seems to be checking if ya is within x + 1 steps from both l and r.

Wait, perhaps it's checking if Alice can reach both ends of Bob's possible columns within x + 1 steps.

But I'm not sure.

In the even case:

- x = (xb - xa)/2

- l = max(1, ya - x)

- r = min(w, yb + x)

- Check if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x

This seems similar to the earlier thought process.

Given that, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to verify it with some examples.

Let me take the example from earlier:

xa=1, xb=3, ya=1, yb=4, w=4

Then, xa <= xb, so x = floor(2/2)=1

Since (xb - xa) % 2 == 0

Then, l = max(1,1-1)=0, but bounded by 1

r = min(4,4+1)=4

Check if abs(1 - 4) <=1 and abs(4 - 4)<=1

abs(1-4)=3 >1, and abs(4-4)=0<=1

So, both conditions need to be true, which they are not, so draw.

Which matches the earlier thought.

Another example: xa=1, xb=3, ya=2, yb=2, w=3

x=1

l = max(1,2-1)=1

r = min(3,2+1)=3

Check if abs(1-2)<=1 and abs(3-2)<=1

abs(1-2)=1<=1 and abs(3-2)=1<=1, both true, so Bob wins.

Which makes sense.

Another test case: xa=1, xb=2, ya=1, yb=3, w=3

Then, xa <= xb, x=floor(1/2)=0

Since (xb - xa) % 2 ==1 (odd)

l = max(1,3-0)=3

r = min(3,3+0)=3

Check if abs(3-1)<=0+1 and abs(3-1)<=1

abs(3-1)=2 <=1? No.

So, draw.

Which makes sense, since (xb - xa)=1 is odd, and Alice can't reach Bob's column in time.

Another test case: xa=1, xb=4, ya=1, yb=4, w=4

x=floor(3/2)=1

(xb - xa) %2 ==1 (odd)

l=max(1,4-1)=3

r=min(4,4+1)=4
