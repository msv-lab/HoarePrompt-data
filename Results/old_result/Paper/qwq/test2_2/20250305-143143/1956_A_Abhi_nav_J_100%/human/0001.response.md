Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game where there are n players lined up in a row, and there's a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k that determines who gets kicked out in each round. The process repeats until no one is kicked out in a round, and those left are the winners.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics. In each round, we look at the a_1-th, a_2-th, ..., a_k-th players in the current lineup and kick them out simultaneously. If a player should be kicked out but their position doesn't exist because there aren't enough players, we skip them.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. The problem gives one: a = [3,5] and n = 5, with players named A, B, C, D, E.

- Initial lineup: A B C D E

- First round: Kick out 3rd (C) and 5th (E). So, remaining: A B D

- Second round: Now lineup is A B D. Kick out 3rd (D), no 5th. So, remaining: A B

- Third round: No one to kick out, so winners are A and B.

Got it. So, for each round, we need to identify the players at positions a_1, a_2, ..., a_k in the current lineup and remove them, provided those positions exist.

Now, the task is, given k, q, the sequence a, and q different values of n, to find out how many players will be winners for each n.

Constraints:

- t (number of test cases): 1 <= t <= 250

- k and q: 1 <= k, q <= 100

- a sequence: 1 <= a1 < a2 < ... < ak <= 100

- n_i: 1 <= n_i <= 100

So, for each test case, we have up to 100 queries (q), each with n up to 100.

I need to find an efficient way to compute the number of winners for each n.

Let me think about how to model this process.

One straightforward way is to simulate the rounds for each n until no one is kicked out.

But simulation might be too slow because t * q * n * k could be up to 250 * 100 * 100 * 100 = 250,000,000, which is too much.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about what happens in each round.

In the first round, we remove players at positions a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, provided they exist.

In the second round, the lineup is shortened, and we again remove the a_1-th, a_2-th, ..., a_k-th players in this new lineup, if they exist.

This continues until no players are removed in a round.

I need to find out how many rounds it takes and who remains at the end.

But simulating this step by step for each n seems inefficient.

Maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical way to compute the number of winners directly.

Let me consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

k=2, a=[3,5], n=5

- Round 1: remove 3rd and 5th => remaining: 1,2,4

- Round 2: remove 3rd (which is now position 4), no 5th => remaining: 1,2

- Round 3: no one to remove => winners: 1,2 => 2 winners

Example 2:

k=5, a=[2,4,6,7,9], n=1

- Round 1: can't remove 2nd, since only 1 player => no one removed => 1 winner

Example 3:

k=5, a=[3,4,5,6,7], n=1

- Round 1: can't remove any, since n=1 < a1=3 => 1 winner

Example 4:

k=2, a=[69,96], n=1

- Round 1: can't remove 69th and 96th, since n=1 < 69 => 1 winner

Example 5:

k=1, a=[100], n=50

- Round 1: remove 100th, but n=50 < 100 => no one removed => 50 winners

Example 6:

k=3, a=[10,20,30], n=1

- Round 1: can't remove 10th, 20th, 30th, since n=1 < 10 => 1 winner

n=10

- Round 1: remove 10th, but n=10, so remove 10th => remaining: 1 to 9

- Round 2: can't remove 10th, since only 9 left => 9 winners

n=100

- Round 1: remove 10th, 20th, 30th

- New lineup: players excluding 10,20,30

- Continue until no one is removed

This seems complicated to simulate for large n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the positions that are never removed.

If I can find a way to determine which positions are never targeted for removal, those players would be the winners.

But the removal affects future rounds because the lineup changes.

This is tricky.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think recursively or iteratively, keeping track of which positions are removed in each round.

But that might still be too slow for the given constraints.

Another idea: since a is strictly increasing, and we remove positions a_1, a_2, ..., a_k in each round, perhaps there's a way to compute how many players are removed in total.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the number of players left after all rounds.

I need to find a function that, given n and a, returns the number of winners.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently for up to 250 test cases, each with up to 100 queries.

Total operations should be in the order of millions at most, preferably less.

I need a O(t * q * log n) or something similar.

Looking back at the examples, in some cases, if n is less than a1, no one is removed in the first round, so all n players are winners.

If n is greater than or equal to a1, some players are removed.

But it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can compute how many players are removed in total.

But players can be removed in multiple rounds, and the lineup shrinks each time.

This seems complex.

Let me consider the positions that are safe, i.e., never get removed.

If I can find a way to calculate how many positions are never targeted, that would be the number of winners.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look for a pattern in the sequence.

Suppose a = [3,5], n=5, winners=2.

a = [2,4,6,7,9], n=1, winners=1.

a = [3,4,5,6,7], n=1, winners=1.

a = [69,96], n=1, winners=1.

a = [100], n=50, winners=50.

a = [10,20,30], n=1, winners=1; n=10, winners=9; n=100, winners=?.

Wait, for a = [10,20,30], n=100:

- Round 1: remove 10,20,30.

- Remaining: 1 to 9, 11 to 19, 21 to 29, 31 to 100.

- Round 2: remove the 10th,20th,30th of the remaining.

- The new lineup has 97 players.

- 10th: position 10 in the new lineup is position 11 in the original.

- 20th: position 20 in the new lineup is position 21 in the original.

- 30th: position 30 in the new lineup is position 31 in the original.

- So remove positions 11,21,31.

- Continue this process.

This seems like it would take many rounds, and it's time-consuming to simulate.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the minimal a1.

If a1 > n, then no one is removed in the first round, so winners = n.

Otherwise, in the first round, players at positions a1, a2, ..., a_k are removed, provided they exist.

In the next round, the lineup is shortened, and we repeat the process.

I need to find a way to calculate the number of rounds and the final number of winners without simulating each round.

An optimization could be to calculate how many players are removed in total.

But players can be removed in multiple rounds, and the positions change each time.

This is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of how many players are removed in the first round, then how many in the second, and so on, until no one is removed.

But calculating this iteratively for each n separately seems inefficient for large q.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in each round, we remove up to k players, depending on how many positions a1, a2, ..., a_k exist in the current lineup.

The number of players decreases by the number of players removed in each round.

I need to find the total number of players removed across all rounds.

But again, this seems like it would require simulating the rounds.

Is there a mathematical formula or a pattern that can be exploited?

Let me consider a simple case where a = [1].

So, in each round, the first player is removed.

This continues until no players are left.

Wait, but according to the rules, once no one is kicked out in a round, the game ends.

But in this case, every round removes one player until only zero players are left.

So, winners would be zero.

But according to the problem, if no one is kicked out in some round, the remaining players are winners.

So, in this case, the last player not removed would be the winner.

Wait, no.

If a = [1], then in the first round, the first player is removed.

In the second round, the new first player is removed, and so on, until no players are left.

So, winners would be zero.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, in the example with a=[3,5], n=5, winners are 2.

So, in that case, some players are left.

But with a=[1], n=anything, winners would be 0, because all players are eventually removed.

Wait, no.

If a=[1], then in each round, the first player is removed.

So, after n rounds, all players are removed.

Hence, winners are zero.

Wait, but according to the problem's termination condition: "Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners."

So, in the case where a=[1], and n=1: 

- Round 1: remove the 1st player. 

- No players left. 

- So, no one is winner.

Similarly, for n=2: 

- Round 1: remove 1st player. Remaining: 2nd. 

- Round 2: remove 1st player in remaining, which is the 2nd original player. 

- No players left. 

- So, no winners.

Hence, for a=[1], winners are always 0.

Another case: a=[2], n=1.

- Only one player, can't remove 2nd. 

- So, 1 winner.

a=[2], n=2.

- Remove 2nd player. Remaining: 1st player. 

- Next round: can't remove 2nd, since only one left. 

- So, 1 winner.

a=[2], n=3.

- Remove 2nd player. Remaining: 1st, 3rd. 

- Next round: remove 2nd in remaining, which is original 3rd. 

- Remaining: 1st player. 

- Next round: can't remove 2nd, since only one left. 

- So, 1 winner.

So, for a=[2], winners seem to be 1 for n >=1.

Wait, but for n=1, winners=1; n=2, winners=1; n=3, winners=1.

Seems like for a=[2], winners are always 1, regardless of n.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me check n=0: invalid, since n >=1.

n=1: winners=1.

n=2: winners=1.

n=3: winners=1.

n=4:

- Remove 2nd. Remaining: 1,3,4.

- Remove 2nd in remaining, which is 3rd original. Remaining: 1,4.

- Remove 2nd in remaining, which is 4th original. Remaining: 1.

- No more removals. Winners:1.

So, yes, for a=[2], winners are always 1.

Interesting.

So, for a=[2], winners are always 1.

For a=[1], winners are always 0.

For a=[3,5], winners are floor(n minus some function).

Wait, perhaps for a=[a1,a2,...,ak], there's a pattern based on the sequence a.

Let me consider a=[1,2].

So, in each round, the first two players are removed.

So, for n=1: remove 1st, no 2nd, so remaining: none. Winners:0.

n=2: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining: none. Winners:0.

n=3: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining: 3rd. No more removals. Winners:1.

n=4: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining: 3rd and 4th. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 3rd and 4th original. Remaining: none. Winners:0.

n=5: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining: 3rd,4th,5th. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 3rd and 4th original, remaining: 5th. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which is 5th. Remaining: none. Winners:0.

n=6: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining:3,4,5,6. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 3rd and 4th original, remaining:5,6. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 5th and 6th original, remaining: none. Winners:0.

n=7: remove 1st and 2nd, remaining:3,4,5,6,7. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 3rd and 4th, remaining:5,6,7. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which are 5th and 6th, remaining:7. Remove 1st and 2nd in remaining, which is 7th. Remaining: none. Winners:0.

So, for a=[1,2], winners are 1 for n >=3 and n is odd.

Wait, n=3:1; n=5:0; n=7:0.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, n=3:1; n=4:0; n=5:0; n=6:0; n=7:0.

Seems like only for n=3, winners=1.

For n >=4, winners=0.

Wait, perhaps for n - 2*floor(n/2) ?

Not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that in each round, we remove k players, provided there are at least a_k players.

But actually, we remove as many as possible based on the current number of players.

Wait, perhaps I can compute how many rounds are needed and how many players are removed in total.

But it's still tricky.

Let me consider that the number of winners is n minus the total number of players removed across all rounds.

So, if I can find the total number of players removed, I can find the winners as n - removed.

But how do I find the total number of players removed efficiently?

Let me think recursively.

Define winners(n, a) = n - removed(n, a)

Where removed(n, a) is the total number of players removed.

In the first round, we remove floor(n / a1) players.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the first round, we remove as many as possible based on the current n and a.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to repeatedly removing players in each round until no more can be removed.

This sounds like a process that can be modeled by finding the largest m such that a_m <= n, and removing m players, then repeating on the remaining n - m players.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the Josephus problem, where people are eliminated in a circle based on a counting sequence.

But in this problem, it's not a circle, it's a line, and we're removing specific positions in each round.

This seems different.

I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula that can directly give me the number of winners for a given n and a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute for each possible n the number of winners.

Given that n can be up to 100 and q up to 100, and t up to 250, precomputing for n from 1 to 100 for each test case might be feasible.

But precomputing for each test case seems redundant.

Wait, but since t can be up to 250 and q up to 100, and n up to 100, it's manageable.

But I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a given a, the number of winners for n is n minus the number of times we can remove k players until n is less than a1.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus ceil(n / a1) * k.

But that doesn't seem right, because a can have multiple values.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the greatest a_i <= n.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the number of a_i that are <= n.

But in the first example, a=[3,5], n=5: number of a_i <=5 is 2, so winners=5-2=3, but actual winners are 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's more complex.

Wait, in the first round, we remove all a_i <=n, then in the next round, we remove a_i <= n - removed so far, and so on.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that in each round, the number of players removed is equal to the number of a_i that are less than or equal to the current n.

So, in the first round, removed1 = number of a_i <= n.

Then, n becomes n - removed1.

In the second round, removed2 = number of a_i <= n - removed1.

And so on, until removed_r = 0.

Total removed = sum of removed1, removed2, ...

Then, winners = n - total removed.

But is this correct?

Let's test with a=[3,5], n=5.

- removed1 = number of a_i <=5: a1=3<=5, a2=5<=5 => removed1=2

- n becomes 5-2=3

- removed2 = number of a_i <=3: a1=3<=3, a2=5>3 => removed2=1

- n becomes 3-1=2

- removed3 = number of a_i <=2: a1=3>2 => removed3=0

- Total removed = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

- Winners = 5 - 3 = 2

Which matches the example.

Another test: a=[2], n=1.

- removed1 = number of a_i <=1: a1=2>1 => removed1=0

- So, total removed=0

- Winners=1-0=1

But earlier, I thought winners should be 0 for a=[1], but in this case a=[2].

Wait, a=[2], n=1: winners=1

a=[2], n=2:

- removed1 = number of a_i <=2: a1=2<=2 => removed1=1

- n becomes 2-1=1

- removed2 = number of a_i <=1: a1=2>1 => removed2=0

- Total removed=1+0=1

- Winners=2-1=1

Which matches my earlier manual simulation.

Another test: a=[1], n=1.

- removed1 = number of a_i <=1: a1=1<=1 => removed1=1

- n becomes 1-1=0

- removed2=0

- Total removed=1

- Winners=1-1=0

Which matches the earlier conclusion.

Another test: a=[10], n=15.

- removed1 = number of a_i <=15: a1=10<=15 => removed1=1

- n becomes 15-1=14

- removed2 = number of a_i <=14: a1=10<=14 => removed2=1

- n becomes 14-1=13

- removed3 = number of a_i <=13: a1=10<=13 => removed3=1

- n becomes 13-1=12

- removed4 = number of a_i <=12: a1=10<=12 => removed4=1

- n becomes 12-1=11

- removed5 = number of a_i <=11: a1=10<=11 => removed5=1

- n becomes 11-1=10

- removed6 = number of a_i <=10: a1=10<=10 => removed6=1

- n becomes 10-1=9

- removed7 = number of a_i <=9: a1=10>9 => removed7=0

- Total removed=1+1+1+1+1+1+0=6

- Winners=15-6=9

Seems correct.

Another test: a=[3,5], n=5.

- removed1=2 (a1=3<=5, a2=5<=5)

- n=5-2=3

- removed2=1 (a1=3<=3, a2=5>3)

- n=3-1=2

- removed3=0

- Total removed=3

- Winners=5-3=2

Matches the example.

Another test: a=[2,4,6,7,9], n=5.

- removed1=3 (a1=2<=5, a2=4<=5, a3=6>5)

- n=5-3=2

- removed2=1 (a1=2<=2, a2=4>2)

- n=2-1=1

- removed3=0

- Total removed=4

- Winners=5-4=1

But according to the problem's second test case, when n=5, winners=1.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=5, q=3, a=[2,4,6,7,9], n=1,3,5.

Outputs:1 1 1

So, for n=5, winners=1, which matches my calculation.

Another test: a=[3,4,5,6,7], n=1.

- removed1=0 (a1=3>1)

- Total removed=0

- Winners=1-0=1

Which matches the second test case.

Another test: a=[69,96], n=1.

- removed1=0 (a1=69>1)

- Total removed=0

- Winners=1-0=1

Which matches the fourth test case.

Another test: a=[100], n=50.

- removed1=0 (a1=100>50)

- Total removed=0

- Winners=50-0=50

Which matches the fifth test case.

Another test: a=[10,20,30], n=1.

- removed1=0 (a1=10>1)

- Total removed=0

- Winners=1-0=1

For n=10:

- removed1=1 (a1=10<=10)

- n=10-1=9

- removed2=0 (a1=10>9)

- Total removed=1

- Winners=10-1=9

Which matches the sixth test case.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Hence, the number of winners is n minus the total number of players removed across all rounds, where in each round we remove the number of a_i that are less than or equal to the current n.

So, in code, for each n, I can iterate until no more players are removed, keeping track of the total removed.

But even better, since a is sorted in increasing order, I can calculate how many a_i are <= n, then subtract that from n, and repeat.

But to optimize, perhaps I can compute it in a loop.

But since n can be up to 100 and q up to 100, and t up to 250, it's manageable.

But perhaps there's a way to compute it without looping for each n.

Wait, perhaps I can find a formula for the total removed.

Let me think.

In each round, the number of players removed is equal to the number of a_i <= current n.

Let me denote c as the number of a_i <= n.

Then, removed1 = c

n becomes n - c

Then, c = number of a_i <= n - c

And so on.

This seems like a recursive process.

But perhaps I can find a closed-form formula.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the largest m such that sum of m terms of a is <= n.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n minus the minimal m such that n - sum_{i=1 to m} 1_{a_i <= n - (m-1)} = 0

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a=[3,5], n=5.

- removed1 = number of a_i <=5: 2

- n becomes 5-2=3

- removed2 = number of a_i <=3:1

- n becomes 3-1=2

- removed3=0

- Total removed=3

- Winners=5-3=2

Similarly, for a=[2], n=1.

- removed1=0

- Total removed=0

- Winners=1

For a=[1], n=1.

- removed1=1

- n becomes 0

- Total removed=1

- Winners=0

Seems consistent.

Hence, I can implement this process for each n.

But since t can be up to 250 and q up to 100, and n up to 100, it's acceptable.

I can write a function that, given a and n, computes the total removed by repeatedly counting how many a_i are <= current n and subtracting that from n until no more are removed.

Then, winners = n - total_removed.

I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that a is sorted in increasing order, I can use binary search to find how many a_i <= current n.

In Python, I can use bisect.bisect_right for this.

So, for each n, I can do:

total_removed = 0

while n > 0:

removed = bisect.bisect_right(a, n)

if removed == 0:

break

total_removed += removed

n -= removed

winners = n

But wait, in the example a=[3,5], n=5:

- removed1 = bisect_right(a,5)=2

- total_removed=2

- n=5-2=3

- removed2 = bisect_right(a,3)=1

- total_removed=3

- n=3-1=2

- removed3 = bisect_right(a,2)=0

- break

- winners=2

Which matches.

Another test: a=[1], n=1.

- removed1 = bisect_right(a,1)=1

- total_removed=1

- n=1-1=0

- break

- winners=0

Correct.

Another test: a=[2], n=2.

- removed1 = bisect_right(a,2)=1

- total_removed=1

- n=2-1=1

- removed2 = bisect_right(a,1)=1

- total_removed=2

- n=1-1=0

- break

- winners=0

Wait, but earlier I thought winners should be 1 for a=[2], n=2.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, earlier manual simulation for a=[2], n=2:

- Remove 2nd player, remaining:1st player.

- Next round: can't remove 2nd, since only 1 left.

- So, winners=1.

But according to this code:

- removed1=1, n=2-1=1

- removed2=1, n=1-1=0

- total_removed=2

- winners=2-2=0

Which is incorrect.

So, there's a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that in each round, the number of players removed is the number of a_i <= current n.

In the case a=[2], n=2:

- removed1=1 (a1=2<=2)

- n=2-1=1

- removed2=1 (a1=2<=1? No, a1=2>1 => removed2=0

- total_removed=1

- winners=2-1=1

Wait, but according to bisect_right(a,1)=0, since a[0]=2>1.

Wait, but in the earlier test, it seemed to work.

Wait, perhaps I need to use bisect_right(a, n) to get the number of a_i <=n.

Wait, in Python, bisect.bisect_right(a, n) returns the insertion point which is also the number of elements <= n.

Wait, actually, bisect_right returns the insertion point after the last occurrence of n.

So, for a=[2], n=1:

bisect_right(a,1)=0, since 1 < 2.

Hence, removed2=0, total_removed=1, winners=2-1=1.

Which matches.

Wait, but in my earlier test, I thought bisect_right(a,1)=1, but actually it's 0.

Wait, no.

Let me check:

a=[2], n=2:

bisect_right(a,2)=1, since a[0]=2, and 2==2, so insertion point is after 2.

Hence, removed1=1.

n=2-1=1

bisect_right(a,1)=0, since 1 < 2.

Hence, removed2=0

Total removed=1

Winners=2-1=1

Which is correct.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought bisect_right(a,1)=1, but it's actually 0.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Another test: a=[1], n=1.

- removed1=1 (bisect_right(a,1)=1)

- n=1-1=0

- stop

- total_removed=1

- winners=1-1=0

Correct.

Another test: a=[3,5], n=5.

- removed1=2 (bisect_right(a,5)=2)

- n=5-2=3

- removed2=1 (bisect_right(a,3)=1)

- n=3-1=2

- removed3=0

- total_removed=3

- winners=5-3=2

Correct.

Hence, the correct way is to use bisect_right(a, n) to get the number of a_i <= n.

Then, in each iteration, remove that many players, update n, and repeat until no more players are removed.

Hence, I can implement this using bisect_right from the bisect module in Python.

Now, I need to implement this function for each test case and for each query n in the test case.

Given that t can be up to 250, q up to 100, and n up to 100, it's manageable.

I need to read t test cases, each consisting of k, q, the sequence a, and then q values of n.

For each n, compute the number of winners as described.

I need to make sure that a is sorted and unique, as per the problem statement: 1 <= a1 < a2 < ... < ak <=100.

Hence, a is already sorted and unique.

In code, I need to:

- Read t

- For each test case:

- Read k and q

- Read a as a list of integers

- Read q as a list of integers

- For each n in q, compute the number of winners and print it.

Implement the function to compute winners as described.

Edge cases to consider:

- a=[1], n=anything: winners=0

- a=[anything], n=0: invalid, but n >=1 as per constraints.

- a=[anything], n < a1: winners=n

- a=[a1], n >= a1: winners=n - ceil(n / a1)

Wait, no, as per the earlier analysis, it's iterative.

Wait, no, it's n minus the total removed in all rounds.

I need to implement this function carefully.

Also, ensure that a is sorted and the function uses bisect_right correctly.

Let me write a sample code snippet.

Sample code:

import bisect

def winners(a, n):

total_removed = 0

while n > 0:

removed = bisect.bisect_right(a, n)

if removed == 0:

break

total_removed += removed

n -= removed

return n - total_removed

Wait, but in the earlier test, for a=[2], n=2:

- removed1=1, n=1

- removed2=0, stop

- winners=2 -1=1

Which is correct.

Another test: a=[1], n=1:

- removed1=1, n=0, stop

- winners=1-1=0

Correct.

Another test: a=[3,5], n=5:

- removed1=2, n=3

- removed2=1, n=2

- removed3=0, stop

- winners=5-3=2

Correct.

Hence, the function seems correct.

Hence, in code, for each test case, read k, q, read a as list of k integers, read q as list of q integers, and for each n in q, compute winners(a,n) and print it.

Also, ensure that a is sorted and unique, as per the problem statement.

Hence, the code should work correctly.

Hence, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
