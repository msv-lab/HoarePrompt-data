Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n mushrooms, each with a certain magic power v_i. Kirill wants to pick some mushrooms to make an elixir, and the strength of this elixir is the product of the number of mushrooms he picks and the smallest magic power among those mushrooms. That makes sense. So, if he picks k mushrooms, and the smallest among them has magic power m, then the strength is k * m.

But there's a catch. There's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if he picks k mushrooms, then the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes zero, and he can't use those in his elixir.

His goal is to pick mushrooms in such a way that the elixir strength is maximized, and among all options that give the maximum strength, he wants to pick the smallest number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the effect of the permutation p. The permutation defines the order in which the magic powers of some mushrooms are zeroed out as he picks more mushrooms.

Let's think about this step by step.

Suppose Kirill decides to pick k mushrooms. Then, before picking the k-th mushroom, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero. So, when he picks the k-th mushroom, he can't use any mushrooms whose positions are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, because their magic powers are zero.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order." But the permutation p seems to define the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out based on the number of mushrooms picked.

Wait, re-reading: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0. Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 positions in the permutation have their magic powers set to zero, and he can't use those in his elixir. He can only use the mushrooms he picks, but their magic powers might have been zeroed out.

Wait, no: "The magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0. Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero, and he can't use those in his elixir, even if he picks them.

Wait, but he can't use mushrooms with zero magic power, which are p_1 to p_{k-1}, but he picks k mushrooms, which could be any mushrooms, but among those k mushrooms, if any of them are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic power is zero, so they can't be used.

Wait, this is a bit confusing.

Let me try to rephrase: When Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are set to zero. Then, among the k mushrooms he picks, any that are among p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power and can't be used in the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms he uses for the elixir are only those among the k picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are k-1 distinct positions.

So, when picking k mushrooms, k-1 mushrooms have their magic power set to zero, and Kirill can't use those in the elixir.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, and among those k, if any are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic power is zero, so he can't use them.

So, the mushrooms he can use are those among the k picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions whose magic powers are set to zero before picking the k mushrooms.

Wait, no: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, picking k mushrooms causes p_1 to p_{k-1} to have their magic powers set to zero.

Then, Kirill will prepare the elixir using the k mushrooms he picked, but excluding those whose positions are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, because their magic powers are zero.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic power is zero, so he can't use them in the elixir.

Therefore, the elixir is prepared using only those among the k picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions whose magic powers are set to zero when he picks k mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 positions in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero, and he picks the k-th mushroom with its original magic power.

Wait, but the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero, and he picks the k-th mushroom, but it's not clear which mushroom he picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that he picks k mushrooms in a specific order defined by p.

Wait, but p is a permutation, and the problem says "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

Wait, maybe I need to consider that p defines the order in which he picks the mushrooms, but he can choose any order.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the mushrooms are picked, and when he picks the k-th mushroom, the first k-1 mushrooms have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the mushrooms are picked, and for each k, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, maybe I need to consider p as the order in which he picks the mushrooms.

Suppose p is the order in which he picks the mushrooms, so p_1 is the first he picks, p_2 is the second, and so on.

Then, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms he picks have their magic powers set to zero, and the k-th one retains its magic power.

Then, the elixir is made using only the k-th mushroom, since the first k-1 have zero magic power.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 have zero magic power, and only the k-th one has its original magic power, so he can only use that one in the elixir.

Wait, but the elixir strength is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the smallest magic power among them.

But in this case, he's only using one mushroom, the k-th one, so the strength would be 1 * v_{p_k}.

Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

"The magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

"Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, it's not about the order in which he picks them, but rather that for picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 positions in p have their magic powers set to zero, and he can't use those.

Wait, perhaps p defines which mushrooms have their magic power zeroed out based on how many mushrooms he picks.

In other words, p defines a fixed order in which magic powers are zeroed out as he picks more mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the mushrooms are considered to be picked, and when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in this order have their magic powers set to zero, and he can't use them.

Then, he can only use the k-th mushroom in this order, because only that one retains its magic power.

So, in this case, the elixir strength would be 1 * v_{p_k}, since he's only using one mushroom, the k-th one in the permutation p.

But that seems too narrow. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the mushrooms are considered to be picked, but Kirill can choose which k mushrooms to pick, not necessarily the first k in p.

Wait, but the problem says "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, regardless of which k mushrooms he picks, the first k-1 positions in p have their magic powers set to zero.

So, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power, and Kirill can't use them in his elixir.

Therefore, among the k mushrooms he picks, only those that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} can be used in the elixir.

Wait, but if he picks k mushrooms, and p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power, then only the k-th mushroom he picks, which is p_k, has non-zero magic power, assuming that p_k is among the k mushrooms he picks.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, but p defines a specific order, and p_k might or might not be among the k mushrooms he picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the k mushrooms he picks include p_1 to p_k, but only p_k has non-zero magic power.

Wait, no, p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p_1 to p_k are positions of mushrooms.

When he picks k mushrooms, the positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero, and p_k retains its magic power.

Then, when he picks the k mushrooms, which include p_k and k-1 other mushrooms, but those other mushrooms have their magic powers set to zero, so he can only use p_k in the elixir.

Wait, that seems to be the case.

So, in this scenario, for any k, if he picks k mushrooms, including p_k, and the rest have zero magic power, so he can only use p_k in the elixir.

Therefore, the elixir strength would be 1 * v_{p_k}.

But that seems too restrictive. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out as he picks more mushrooms.

Let me consider that when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero, regardless of which k mushrooms he picks.

So, regardless of which k mushrooms he picks, the positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero.

Then, among the k mushrooms he picks, any that are in p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power and can't be used.

Therefore, the only mushroom he can use is one that is not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, and among those k, if any are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, they have zero magic power and can't be used.

So, to maximize the elixir strength, which is the number of mushrooms used times the smallest magic power among them, he needs to pick k mushrooms such that as many as possible are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, and among those, the smallest magic power is maximized.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the magic powers of p_1 to p_{k-1} are set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic power is zero and can't be used.

Therefore, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as few as possible are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but he has to pick k mushrooms, and p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 positions in p.

Wait, p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 positions in the permutation.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of p as the order in which he picks the mushrooms.

Suppose p defines the order in which he picks the mushrooms.

So, p_1 is the first he picks, p_2 is the second, and so on.

Then, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 have their magic powers set to zero, and the k-th one retains its magic power.

Therefore, in this scenario, he can only use the k-th mushroom in the elixir, since the first k-1 have zero magic power.

So, for each k, the elixir strength would be 1 * v_{p_k}.

But the problem says he can pick any k mushrooms, not necessarily in any particular order.

Wait, perhaps p defines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out.

Alternatively, perhaps p defines the order in which he picks the mushrooms, but he can choose any order.

Wait, the problem says "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

But "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, regardless of the order in which he picks them, the first k-1 positions in p have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, perhaps p defines a fixed ordering, and picking k mushrooms causes the first k-1 positions in p to have their magic powers set to zero.

So, for any k mushrooms he picks, p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are specific positions.

So, for any k, p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power.

Wait, but p is fixed, so for any k, p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power.

Wait, that can't be, because p is a permutation, and k can vary.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of p as the order in which he picks the mushrooms.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, it's the first k in p, and p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero.

Then, p_k is the k-th mushroom picked, which retains its magic power.

So, in this case, he can only use p_k in the elixir, since the others have zero magic power.

But then, the elixir strength would be 1 * v_{p_k}.

But the problem says "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

So, perhaps p defines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out based on how many mushrooms he picks.

Wait, maybe p defines the order in which the mushrooms are considered to be picked, and for any k, p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power, and p_k retains its magic power.

Then, when he picks k mushrooms, he can only use those among the k picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But in this scenario, if he picks p_k along with some other mushrooms, but those other mushrooms are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic powers are zero, so he can't use them.

So, effectively, he can only use p_k in the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

So, perhaps p defines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out, but Kirill can choose which k mushrooms to pick.

Wait, maybe p defines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out based on the number of mushrooms picked, not the specific mushrooms picked.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, regardless of which ones, the first k-1 positions in p have their magic powers set to zero.

Then, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, their magic powers are zero and can't be used.

Therefore, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as many as possible are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are fixed based on k.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p is a fixed permutation, and for any k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions whose magic powers are zeroed out.

So, for each possible k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are known, and he picks k mushrooms, some of which may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

To maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as few as possible are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is fixed, and k is variable.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over possible k and find the maximum elixir strength.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each k from 1 to n, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power, and he picks k mushrooms, including some with zero magic power.

But only the ones with non-zero magic power are used in the elixir.

So, for each k, the mushrooms he can use are the ones among the k picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are specific positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each possible k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power, and the remaining n - (k - 1) positions have their original magic power.

Then, when he picks k mushrooms, he can pick any k mushrooms, but among them, those that are in p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power and can't be used.

So, for each k, the available mushrooms for the elixir are the k picked mushrooms minus those in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for a fixed k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are known, and he picks k mushrooms, some of which may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

He can't use the ones in p_1 to p_{k-1}, so the elixir is made only from the mushrooms he picks that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for each k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power.

Then, when he picks k mushrooms, he can pick any k mushrooms, but only those among them that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} can be used in the elixir.

So, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as many as possible are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for a fixed k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are fixed, and he picks k mushrooms, some of which may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

He can't use the ones in p_1 to p_{k-1}, so the number of mushrooms he can use is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power, regardless of which k mushrooms he picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power.

Then, the mushrooms he can use in the elixir are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, when he picks k mushrooms, he can pick any k mushrooms, but only those not in p_1 to p_{k-1} can be used in the elixir.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for a given k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power.

Then, the mushrooms he can use in the elixir are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms from the ones not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, if possible.

Wait, but he has to pick k mushrooms, and p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power.

So, if he picks k mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, then all k mushrooms can be used in the elixir.

But p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions with zero magic power, so if he picks k mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, then none of them have zero magic power, and all can be used.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for a given k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power.

Then, if he picks k mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, all k mushrooms have their original magic power and can be used in the elixir.

Alternatively, if he picks some mushrooms in p_1 to p_{k-1}, those have zero magic power and can't be used.

Therefore, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for each k, p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power.

Then, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, if possible.

So, for each k, he can pick k mushrooms from the n - (k - 1) mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, the elixir strength would be k times the smallest magic power among the k picked mushrooms.

To maximize this, he should pick the k mushrooms with the highest magic powers from the available n - (k - 1) mushrooms.

Wait, but to maximize k times the smallest magic power, he needs to balance k and the smallest magic power.

So, he needs to pick a k and then pick k mushrooms with the highest possible smallest magic power.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the magic powers and find the optimal k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the magic powers in descending order: a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)

Then, for a given k, if I pick the top k mushrooms from a_sorted, but I have to make sure that none of them are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power when picking k mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions p_k and beyond for the mushrooms with non-zero magic power.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over possible k and compute the maximum possible elixir strength.

Let me consider that for each possible k from 1 to n:

- p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions with zero magic power.

- So, the mushrooms he can use are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

- So, he can pick k mushrooms, but only those not in p_1 to p_{k-1} can be used in the elixir.

- So, to maximize the elixir strength, he should pick k mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, and among those, pick the ones with the highest magic powers.

Wait, but he wants to maximize k * m, where m is the smallest magic power among the mushrooms used in the elixir.

So, for each k, he needs to pick k mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, and among those, find the smallest magic power, and maximize k * m.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the available mushrooms for each k and pick the top k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 3

a = [9, 8, 14]

p = [3, 2, 1]

So, positions are 1-based: p1=3, p2=2, p3=1

So, for k=1:

- p1=3, so position 3 has zero magic power.

- He picks 1 mushroom, which
