Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and settling into positions based on a parameter k, where k > 1. The settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. The pattern is that the first k positions are numbered 1 to k, and the next k-2 positions are numbered k-1 down to 2. Then this repeats.

For example, for k=3:

Position numbers: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,...

So, positions 1 to 3: 1,2,3

Positions 4 to 6: 2,1,2

Positions 7 to 9: 3,2,1

Positions 10 to 12: 2,3,2

And so on.

Given that, Vasya remembers his position in the line (n) and the number he received during the settling (x). I need to find how many natural numbers k (greater than 1) satisfy these conditions.

Constraints:

- k > 1

- 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t (number of test cases) ≤ 100

First, I need to understand the settling pattern.

For a given k, the pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions.

Let's see for k=3:

Pattern: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,...

So, positions:

1:1

2:2

3:3

4:2

5:1

6:2

7:3

8:2

9:1

10:2

...

I need to find all k >1 where the n-th position has number x.

Given that the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions, I can consider the positions modulo 2k-2.

But I need to express this in terms of k.

Let me try to find a formula for the number at position n for a given k.

Let’s observe the pattern:

For k=3:

Positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, 10:2,...

So, every 4 positions (2*3 -2 =4), the pattern repeats.

Similarly, for k=2:

Positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2,...

Repeat every 2 positions (2*2 -2=2).

For k=4:

Positions: 1:1,2,3,4,5:3,6:2,7:1,8:2,9:3,10:4,11:3,12:2,...

Repeat every 6 positions (2*4 -2=6).

So, in general, the pattern repeats every m=2k-2 positions.

Now, within each block of m=2k-2 positions:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a given n, to find the number at that position, I can find the position within its block.

Let’s define:

m = 2k -2

block = floor((n-1)/m)

position_in_block = (n-1) % m

Then, within the block:

if position_in_block < k:

number = position_in_block +1

else:

number = 2k -2 - position_in_block

But wait, let's see for k=3:

m=4

position_in_block:

0:1

1:2

2:3

3:2

For k=4:

m=6

0:1

1:2

2:3

3:4

4:3

5:2

So, in general:

if position_in_block < k:

number = position_in_block +1

else:

number = 2k -1 - position_in_block

Wait, for k=3:

position_in_block=3: number=2k-1 -3=3

But in the example, position 4: number=2

Wait, something's off.

Wait, for k=3, m=4

position_in_block=0: number=1

position_in_block=1: number=2

position_in_block=2: number=3

position_in_block=3: number=2

So, yes, for position_in_block >=k, number=2k-1 - position_in_block

For k=3, 2*3-1=5 -3=2, which matches.

Similarly, for k=4, m=6

position_in_block=0:1

1:2

2:3

3:4

4:3

5:2

Which is 2*4-1=7 -4=3, 7-5=2, correct.

So, general formula:

number = position_in_block +1 if position_in_block <k else 2k-1 - position_in_block

Given that, we have:

number = x, position = n

So, for each k>1, check if at position n, the number is x.

But since t<=100 and n can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Instead of iterating over all possible k, which is up to n, I need a smarter approach.

Let me try to find a relationship between k and n that satisfies number=x.

Given the periodicity, perhaps I can find equations that k must satisfy.

Let’s denote m=2k-2

Then, the block size is m.

The position within the block is (n-1) % m

Let’s denote p = (n-1) % m

Then, number = p+1 if p <k else 2k-1 -p

Set this equal to x:

If p <k:

p+1 =x ⇒ p=x-1

Else:

2k-1 -p =x ⇒ p=2k-1 -x

Now, since p=(n-1) % m, and m=2k-2, p < m=2k-2

So, we have two cases:

1. p <k: p=x-1

2. p >=k: p=2k-1 -x

In both cases, p=(n-1) % m

Also, m=2k-2

So, for case 1: p=x-1 <k

And p=(n-1) % m

So, (n-1) % m =x-1

Similarly, for case 2: p=2k-1 -x >=k

And p=(n-1) % m

So, (n-1) % m =2k-1 -x

Now, m=2k-2

So, in both cases, (n-1) % m equals something.

But m=2k-2

Let’s consider case 1: p=x-1 <k

So, (n-1) % m =x-1

But m=2k-2

So, (n-1) - (x-1) is divisible by m=2k-2

Thus, (n -x) is divisible by 2k-2

Similarly, in case 2: p=2k-1 -x >=k

So, (n-1) % m =2k-1 -x

Thus, (n-1) - (2k-1 -x) is divisible by m=2k-2

Simplify: (n-1) -2k +1 -x =n -2k -x

So, n -2k -x is divisible by 2k-2

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider both cases together.

From case 1: (n -x) is divisible by m=2k-2

From case 2: (n -2k -x) is divisible by m=2k-2

Wait, in case 2, (n-1) - (2k-1 -x) =n-1-2k+1+x=n-2k+x is divisible by m=2k-2

Wait, earlier I had n -2k -x, but let's double-check:

(n-1) - (2k-1 -x) =n-1-2k+1+x=n-2k+x

Yes, so n-2k+x is divisible by m=2k-2

So, in summary:

Either (n -x) is divisible by m=2k-2 (case 1)

Or (n -2k +x) is divisible by m=2k-2 (case 2)

Also, in case 1: p=x-1 <k

In case 2: p=2k-1 -x >=k

So, for case 1: x-1 <k ⇒ x-1 <k ⇒ x-1 <k ⇒ x-1 <k

For case 2: 2k-1 -x >=k ⇒ 2k -1 -x >=k ⇒ k >= x+1

So, in case 1: k >x-1

In case 2: k >= ceil((x+1)/1)

But perhaps I need to relate this back to m=2k-2

Let me consider that.

So, for case 1: (n -x) is divisible by 2k-2

And k >x-1

Similarly, for case 2: (n -2k +x) is divisible by 2k-2

And k >= ceil((x+1)/1), which is always true since k>=2 and x>=1

Wait, x >=1, but x <n <=1e9

Wait, x >=1, n >=2 (since x <n)

But k >=2

Wait, need to be careful.

So, in case 1: (n -x)/(2k-2) is integer, and k >x-1

In case 2: (n -2k +x)/(2k-2) is integer, and k >= ceil((x+1)/1)

Wait, perhaps I need to find k such that either (n -x) is divisible by 2k-2, with k >x-1

Or (n -2k +x) is divisible by 2k-2, with k >= ceil((x+1)/1)

But I need to find all k>1 that satisfy either of these conditions.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that m=2k-2

Then, for k>1, m >=2*2 -2=2

So, m >=2

Now, in the first case: (n -x) is divisible by m

In the second case: (n -2k +x) is divisible by m

But m=2k-2, so 2k=m+2 ⇒ k=(m+2)/2

So, perhaps I can express everything in terms of m

Let’s set m as a variable and iterate over possible m

Given that m=2k-2, and k>=2, m>=2

Also, m must be even, since m=2k-2, and k is integer >=2

Wait, for k=2, m=2

k=3, m=4

k=4, m=6

So, m is always even, starting from 2 and increasing by 2.

So, m can be 2,4,6,8,...

Now, let’s express k in terms of m: k=(m+2)/2

Now, for each m=2,4,6,..., I can compute k=(m+2)/2

Then, check if either (n -x) is divisible by m

Or (n -2k +x) is divisible by m

But since k=(m+2)/2, then 2k=m+2

So, n -2k +x =n -m -2 +x

So, (n -m -2 +x) is divisible by m

Which is equivalent to (n +x -m -2) % m ==0

Wait, but m divides (n +x -m -2), which is equivalent to m divides (n +x -2 -m)

But m divides (n +x -2 -m) ⇒ m divides (n +x -2)

Wait, because m divides m, so m divides (n +x -2 -m) ⇒ m divides (n +x -2)

So, in this case, (n +x -2) % m ==0

Similarly, in the first case, (n -x) % m ==0

So, for each m=2,4,6,..., I need to check if (n -x) % m ==0 or (n +x -2) % m ==0

But I need to make sure that k=(m+2)/2 is integer and k>=2

Which it is, since m=2,4,6,... and k=(m+2)/2 is integer.

Now, to find all m=2,4,6,... such that either (n -x) % m ==0 or (n +x -2) % m ==0

But m can be up to... well, m=2k-2, and k can be up to n, so m can be up to 2n-2, but need to find a better bound.

But since m divides either (n -x) or (n +x -2), and n and x are up to 1e9, m can be up to 1e9.

But iterating up to 1e9 is not feasible, as t=100 and time limits would be exceeded.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2)

Because m must divide either (n -x) or (n +x -2)

So, all m that divide (n -x) or (n +x -2), and m is even, m>=2, m=2k-2, k>=2

Wait, m=2k-2, which is even, as established.

So, I can find all even divisors m>=2 of (n -x) and (n +x -2), and count the unique k=(m+2)/2 for those m.

But need to make sure that k=(m+2)/2 >=2, which is already satisfied for m>=2.

Also, need to ensure that in case 1: p=x-1 <k, which translates to x-1 <k=(m+2)/2

Similarly, in case 2: p=2k-1 -x >=k, which is equivalent to x <=k-1

Wait, perhaps I need to consider these constraints to avoid overcounting.

Wait, maybe not, as the conditions are mutually exclusive for different m.

I need to make sure that for each m, I don't count the same k multiple times.

But since k=(m+2)/2, and m is unique for each k, I can collect all m from divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), that are even and >=2, and then map m to k=(m+2)/2, and count the number of unique k.

Wait, but m=2k-2 ⇒ k=(m+2)/2

So, for each even m>=2 that divides either (n -x) or (n +x -2), I can compute k=(m+2)/2, and collect those k.

Now, I need to make sure that for a given m, it corresponds to only one k, which it does.

Hence, the number of valid k is equal to the number of unique m that divide either (n -x) or (n +x -2), are even, and >=2.

But since m=2k-2, and k>=2, m>=2, and m is even.

So, I can find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), that are >=2, and count the unique k=(m+2)/2.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), excluding m=0 or invalid m.

But n and x can be up to 1e9, so (n -x) and (n +x -2) can be up to 2e9.

I need an efficient way to find all even divisors of two large numbers.

First, I need to factorize (n -x) and (n +x -2), but factorizing numbers up to 2e9 is feasible, but t=100, so need an efficient factorization method.

Once I have the divisors, I can filter the even ones that are >=2, collect them into a set, and count the number of unique k=(m+2)/2.

Wait, but (n -x) and (n +x -2) can be zero or negative?

Wait, n >x >=1, so n -x >=0, and n +x -2 >=0.

Wait, n +x -2 can be negative if n +x <2, but since n >=2 (because x >=1 and x <n), n +x -2 >=0.

So, no need to worry about negative divisors.

Also, n -x >=0.

If n -x =0, then m must divide 0, which is only possible for m=0, but m>=2, so no solution in this case.

Similarly, n +x -2 >=0.

So, I need to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), that are >=2, and then compute k=(m+2)/2, and count unique k.

But I need to make sure that k >=2, which is already satisfied since m >=2.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a function to find all even divisors of a number.

Given a number, to find all its even divisors, I can first find all divisors and select the even ones.

But for large numbers, this might be time-consuming.

Wait, but since t=100 and n up to 1e9, I need an efficient way.

Let me think about how to find all even divisors of a number.

Given a number z, to find its even divisors, I can find all divisors of z/2.

Because if d is a divisor of z/2, then 2d is a divisor of z, and it's even.

So, for z, the even divisors are 2*d for each d in divisors of z/2.

But z might be odd or even.

Wait, if z is odd, it has no even divisors.

If z is even, then its even divisors are 2*d for each d in divisors of z/2.

Wait, more precisely, if z is even, its even divisors are the divisors of z that are multiples of 2.

So, to find even divisors of z, if z is odd, none; if z is even, find divisors of z that are even.

To find divisors of z that are even, I can find divisors of z/2 and multiply by 2.

Wait, yes, that's a standard approach.

So, for z even, even divisors are 2*d for d in divisors of z/2.

For z odd, no even divisors.

Hence, for z even, even divisors are 2,4,6,... up to z (if z is even).

Similarly for z odd, no even divisors.

So, in code, for a given z, if z is even, find all divisors of z/2, and multiply by 2 to get even divisors of z.

Now, in this problem, I need to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), that are >=2, collect them into a set, and then compute k=(m+2)/2 for each unique m, and count the number of unique k.

But since m=2k-2, and k=(m+2)/2, and m is even, this mapping is one-to-one.

Hence, the number of unique k is equal to the number of unique m that are even divisors of (n -x) or (n +x -2).

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

1. For each test case:

a. Compute z1 = n - x

b. Compute z2 = n + x - 2

c. Find all even divisors of z1 and z2, combine them into a set, and count the number of unique m >=2.

d. For each m in the set, compute k=(m+2)/2, and count the number of unique k.

But since m=2k-2, k=(m+2)/2, and m>=2, k>=2, and m is even.

Hence, the number of unique m is equal to the number of unique k.

So, I can just find the number of unique even divisors of z1 and z2 that are >=2.

Hence, the answer is the number of unique even divisors of z1 and z2 that are >=2.

Now, in code, I need to implement a function to find all even divisors of a number.

Given that, I can find all even divisors of z1 and z2, combine them into a set, and count the number of elements in the set that are >=2.

Edge cases to consider:

- z1 or z2 is 0: z1=n -x=0 ⇒ no even divisors, since m >=2.

- z1 or z2 is negative: but n >=x+1, so z1 >=0, z2=n +x -2 >=0.

- z1 or z2 is 1: only divisor is 1, no even divisors.

- z1 or z2 is even or odd.

- k=2, m=2

- k=3, m=4

- etc.

Let me look at the sample input and output to verify.

Sample Input:

5

10 2

3 1

76 4

100 99

1000000000 500000000

Sample Output:

4

1

9

0

1

Let me try to compute for the first test case:

n=10, x=2

z1 =10-2=8

z2=10+2-2=10

Even divisors of 8: 2,4,8

Even divisors of 10:2,10

Combined unique m:2,4,8,10

Hence, 4 possible m, so 4 possible k.

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=3, x=1

z1=3-1=2

z2=3+1-2=2

Even divisors of 2:2

Hence, only m=2, so k=2

Hence, 1 possible k.

Third test case:

n=76, x=4

z1=76-4=72

z2=76+4-2=78

Even divisors of 72:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

Even divisors of 78:2,6,26,78

Combined unique m:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72,26,78

Total 11 m, but need m>=2, which all are.

But sample output is 9, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe some m don't satisfy the original conditions.

Wait, perhaps some m correspond to the same k.

But m=2k-2, so k=(m+2)/2, which is unique for each m.

Wait, but in this case, m=2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72,26,78

Corresponding k=2,3,4,5,7,10,13,19,37,14,40

Total 11 k, but sample output is 9, so perhaps some m don't correspond to valid k.

Wait, perhaps some m don't satisfy the original conditions.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the constraints from case 1 and case 2.

Wait, perhaps some m correspond to both case 1 and case 2, but I need to ensure uniqueness.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm considering m from both z1 and z2, and taking unique m.

But in the sample input 3, output is 9, but I have 11 m.

Perhaps some m are invalid.

Wait, maybe m must satisfy m=2k-2 with k>x-1 in case 1, and k>=ceil((x+1)/1) in case 2.

Wait, need to check the constraints for k.

Wait, perhaps some k don't satisfy k > x-1.

Wait, for x=4, k >3.

So, for k=2,3, which are in the list, they might be invalid.

Wait, for k=2, m=2, but k must be > x-1=3, which is not satisfied for k=2,3.

Hence, only k >=4 are valid.

Hence, in this case, k=4,5,7,10,13,19,37,14,40 are valid, which is 9 k's.

Hence, the sample output is 9.

So, in general, I need to ensure that for each m, the corresponding k satisfies k > x-1.

Hence, in the code, after collecting all m from even divisors of z1 and z2, compute k=(m+2)/2, and count only those k where k > x-1.

Wait, but in the first case, k > x-1, and in the second case, k >= ceil((x+1)/1), which is always true for k >=2 and x >=1.

But to be safe, I should ensure k > x-1.

Hence, in code, after collecting all m from even divisors of z1 and z2, compute k=(m+2)/2, and count only those k where k > x-1.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a function to find all even divisors of a number.

Given that, I can find even divisors of z1 and z2, combine them into a set, compute k=(m+2)/2 for each m, and count how many k satisfy k > x-1.

But since m=2k-2, k=(m+2)/2, and m>=2, k>=2.

Hence, in code, I can implement a function to find all even divisors of a number.

Given z, if z is even, find all divisors of z/2, then m=2*d for d in divisors of z/2.

Then, m=2*d, which are even divisors of z.

Now, implement this function.

Then, for each test case:

- Compute z1=n -x

- Compute z2=n +x -2

- Find all even divisors of z1 and z2, combine into a set

- For each m in the set, compute k=(m+2)/2

- Count how many k satisfy k > x-1

- Output the count

Now, implement this in code.

But in the given code, it seems to have a different approach.

Let me look at the given code.

Given code:

import math

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

n = L[0]

x = L[1]

ans = 0

y = n + x

if y % 2 != 0:

print(0)

continue

else:

L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)

if n >= 3 * x - 2:

L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)

L1 = list(set(L1))

print(len(L1))

continue

def func_1(q, x):

M = []

w = math.sqrt(q)

if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:

M += [w]

i = 1

while i < w:

if q % i == 0:

if i >= x - 1:

M += [i]

if q // i >= x - 1:

M += [q // i]

i += 1

return M

So, this code defines a function func_1(q, x) that finds divisors of q that are >= x-1.

Then, for each test case:

- If (n + x) is odd, output 0

- Else, compute q1=(y -2)//2 where y=n +x

- Call func_1(q1, x) to get some k

- If n >=3x -2, compute q2=(n -x)//2

- Call func_1(q2, x)

- Combine the results, make a set, and print the length

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

From my earlier analysis, I need to find all even divisors of z1=n -x and z2=n +x -2, that are >=2, compute k=(m+2)/2, and count unique k where k > x-1.

But in the given code, it's doing something different.

It first checks if y=n +x is even. If not, output 0.

Else, compute q1=(y -2)//2

Then, call func_1(q1, x), which finds divisors of q1 that are >=x-1

Then, if n >=3x -2, compute q2=(n -x)//2, call func_1(q2, x), and combine the results.

Finally, make a set and print the length.

I need to see if this corresponds to the number of valid k.

Let me try to relate this to my earlier analysis.

From earlier, z1=n -x, z2=n +x -2

For z1 and z2, find even divisors >=2, collect unique m, compute k=(m+2)/2, and count k where k >x-1.

In the given code, it computes q1=(n +x -2)//2, which is z2//2

Then, finds divisors of q1 that are >=x-1

Similarly, if n >=3x -2, computes q2=(n -x)//2, and finds divisors of q2 that are >=x-1

Then, combines them, makes a set, and counts.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, for even divisors of z1 and z2, m=2*d where d divides z1/2 and z2/2.

But in the code, it's computing q1=(n +x -2)//2, which is z2/2, and finding its divisors >=x-1.

Similarly, q2=(n -x)//2, and finding its divisors >=x-1.

Then, combining these divisors, making a set, and counting.

But in my approach, I need to find even divisors m of z1 and z2, which are m=2*d where d divides z1/2 and z2/2.

But in the code, it's finding divisors of q1=z2/2 and q2=z1/2, which correspond to d in m=2*d.

Then, k=(m+2)/2=(2*d +2)/2=d +1

So, in the code, it's effectively finding d where d divides q1=z2/2, and d >=x-1

Similarly, d divides q2=z1/2, and d >=x-1

Then, k=d +1

And m=2*d

Hence, in my earlier notation, k=d +1, where d is a divisor of z1/2 or z2/2, and d >=x-1

Then, the code combines these d's, makes a set, and counts the number of unique d's, which corresponds to the number of unique k's.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I have k=(m+2)/2, where m=2*d, so k=d +1

Hence, the number of unique d's corresponds to the number of unique k's minus one.

Wait, no, k=d +1, so for each unique d, there's a unique k.

Hence, the number of unique d's is equal to the number of unique k's.

But in the code, it's collecting d's from divisors of q1=z2/2 and q2=z1/2, where d >=x-1

Then, k=d +1, and need to ensure k >x-1, which is d +1 >x-1 ⇒ d >x-2

But in the code, it's taking d >=x-1

Hence, it's ensuring d >=x-1, which implies k >=x

But in my earlier analysis, I had k >x-1, which is k >=x

Hence, d >=x-1 corresponds to k >=x

Wait, but in the first case, k >x-1, which is k >=x

In the second case, k >=ceil((x+1)/1), which is k >=x+1

But in the code, it's taking d >=x-1, which corresponds to k >=x

Hence, it might be overcounting the second case.

Wait, perhaps not, because in the first case, k >x-1, which is k >=x

And in the second case, k >=x+1

But in the code, it's taking d >=x-1 for both q1 and q2.

Wait, perhaps the condition n >=3x -2 is related to when to include q2.

Need to verify this.

Let me consider the first sample input:

n=10, x=2

z1=8, z2=10

q1=(10 -2)//2=4

q2=(10 -2)//2=4

Find divisors of q1=4 that are >=1 (x-1=1):

divisors of 4:1,2,4

But d >=1:1,2,4

Then, k=d +1:2,3,5

Then, if n >=3x -2=4, which it is, so q2=(10 -2)//2=4

Find divisors of q2=4 that are >=1:1,2,4

k=2,3,5

Combine:2,3,5

Unique k:2,3,5

But sample output is 4, which includes k=2,3,5,6

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the code, q1=(y -2)//2 where y=n +x=12, so q1=5

Wait, wait, in the code, y=n +x=12, q1=(12 -2)//2=5

Then, func_1(5,2), which finds divisors of 5 that are >=1:1,5

k=2,6

Then, since n >=4, compute q2=(10 -2)//2=4

func_1(4,2): divisors of 4 >=1:1,2,4

k=2,3,5

Combine:2,3,5,6

Unique k:2,3,5,6 ⇒4 k's, which matches the sample output.

Hence, the code seems correct in this case.

Another sample input: n=3, x=1

y=4, q1=(4 -2)//2=1

func_1(1,1): divisors of 1 >=0:1

k=2

n >=1, q2=(3 -1)//2=1

func_1(1,1):1

k=2

Combine:2 ⇒1 k, matches sample output.

Third sample input: n=76, x=4

y=80, q1=(80 -2)//2=39

func_1(39,4): divisors of 39 >=3:3,13,39 ⇒k=4,14,40

n >=10, q2=(76 -4)//2=36

func_1(36,4): divisors of 36 >=3:3,4,6,9,12,18,36 ⇒k=4,5,7,10,13,19,37

Combine:4,5,7,10,13,14,19,37,40 ⇒9 k's, matches sample output.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**
