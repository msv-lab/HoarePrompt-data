Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific properties:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the array a.

2. r is a subset of the last n elements of the array a.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging the remaining elements. So, the order doesn't matter, and I can choose any 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n, as long as their XORs are equal.

Given that, I need to find a way to select these subsets such that their XORs match.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which I perform the operations doesn't matter, and I can group elements any way I want.

Also, XOR of a number with itself is zero. Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, there are pairs of identical numbers in both the first n and the last n elements.

Given that, if I select a pair of the same number for both l and r, their XOR would be zero for both, satisfying the condition. But k can be up to n/2, and I need to select 2k elements each in l and r.

Wait, 2k elements in l and r each, so total 4k elements, but n is up to 5*10^4 and t is up to 5000, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 5*10^4.

I need an efficient solution because n can be large.

Let me consider the XOR properties more carefully.

Suppose I select some elements for l and some for r such that the XOR of l and r are equal.

That means XOR of l equals XOR of r, which implies that XOR of l XORed with XOR of r is zero.

In other words, XOR of all selected elements in l and r together should be zero.

Wait, no. Actually, XOR of l equals XOR of r implies that XOR of l XOR r is zero.

So, if I consider the combined XOR of l and r, it should be zero.

Given that, I need to select subsets l and r from the first n and last n elements respectively, such that their combined XOR is zero.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements in each.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Since it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, I need to find one possible pair.

Maybe I can find pairs of elements that have the same XOR and select them accordingly.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Perhaps I can select k pairs from the first n and k pairs from the last n, and ensure that their XORs match.

But I need to select 2k elements, which could be k pairs, but I'm not sure.

Let me look at the example to get some idea.

In the first example:

n=2, k=1

a = [1,2,2,1]

So, first n elements: [1,2]

Last n elements: [2,1]

I need to select 2 elements for l and 2 for r.

They chose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1], and 2 XOR 1 = 3 for both.

In the second example:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First n: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Last n: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

They chose l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], and 6 XOR 4 = 2, and 1 XOR 3 = 2.

So, their XOR matches.

In the third example:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First n: [1,2,3,4]

Last n: [1,2,3,4]

They chose l=[1,2] and r=[1,2], and 1 XOR 2 = 3 for both.

In the fourth example:

n=6, k=2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First n: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Last n: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

They chose l=[5,1,3,3] and r=[6,4,2,4], and 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 = 4, and 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 2 = 4.

So, in all cases, the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need to select 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n, such that their XORs are equal.

One approach could be to select pairs of identical elements, since their XOR would be zero, and zero equals zero.

But k can be up to n/2, so I might need to select multiple pairs.

Wait, but in the first example, they selected both pairs [2,1] and [2,1], and their XORs are equal.

In the second example, they selected [6,4] from l and [1,3] from r, whose XORs are both 2.

In the third example, [1,2] and [1,2], both XOR to 3.

In the fourth example, [5,1,3,3] and [6,4,2,4], both XOR to 4.

So, in some cases, they selected identical pairs, in others, different elements that happen to have the same XOR.

I need to find a way to select such subsets.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have a set of elements, their XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

I need to have two sets, l and r, each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

An idea could be to select k pairs from the first n and k pairs from the last n, and select those pairs such that the XOR of the selected pairs in l equals the XOR of the selected pairs in r.

But I need to select 2k elements, which could be k pairs.

Wait, but in the fourth example, they selected four elements in l and four in r, but the pairs are not necessarily the same.

Maybe I need to think in terms of individual elements, not necessarily pairs.

Wait, but the problem allows subsets, which can be any 2k elements from the first n and any 2k from the last n, as long as their XORs are equal.

I need an efficient way to select these subsets.

Given the constraints, with n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me think about the XOR of all elements in the first n and the last n.

Let me denote XOR of first n elements as XOR(a[1..n]) and XOR of last n elements as XOR(a[n+1..2n]).

Let’s denote XOR_full = XOR(a[1..2n]), which is XOR(a[1..n]) XOR XOR(a[n+1..2n]).

But since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, XOR_full should be zero, because each number XORed with itself is zero.

So, XOR(a[1..n]) = XOR(a[n+1..2n]).

Let’s denote this common XOR as XOR_common.

Wait, but if each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, once in the first n and once in the last n, then XOR(a[1..n]) should be equal to XOR(a[n+1..2n]), as you said.

Let’s denote this common XOR as XOR_common.

Now, I need to select subsets l and r from a[1..n] and a[n+1..2n], each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(a[1..n]) = XOR(a[n+1..2n]) = XOR_common, perhaps I can relate the XOR of l to the XOR of the remaining elements in a[1..n].

Wait, let’s think about it.

Let’s denote the remaining elements in a[1..n] after selecting l as l_complement, so XOR(l_complement) = XOR_common XOR XOR(l).

Similarly, for r, the remaining elements in a[n+1..2n] after selecting r would be r_complement, with XOR(r_complement) = XOR_common XOR XOR(r).

But since XOR(l) = XOR(r), it follows that XOR(l_complement) = XOR(r_complement).

Not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that I need to select subsets l and r with equal XOR, and both have 2k elements.

Given that, and that XOR(a[1..n]) = XOR(a[n+1..2n]), perhaps I can find a way to balance the selections.

Another idea: since XOR is associative and commutative, maybe I can select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that I can select any 2k elements from the first n and any 2k from the last n, as long as their XORs are equal.

Given that, and given that it's guaranteed that at least one solution exists, perhaps I can find a way to select elements in pairs that have the same XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can look for elements that appear in both the first n and the last n.

Wait, no, since each number appears exactly twice, once in the first n and once in the last n.

So, for each number from 1 to n, one occurrence is in the first n and one in the last n.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting certain numbers' occurrences in the first n and their counterparts in the last n.

Wait, maybe I can select some numbers to be included in l and their counterparts in r.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s create a mapping from each number to its positions, one in the first n and one in the last n.

For example, for number x, let’s say it appears at position p in the first n and position q in the last n.

So, p <= n and q > n.

Then, for each number, I have a pair of positions.

Now, perhaps I can select some numbers to be included in l and r.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Wait, perhaps I can select k pairs for l and k pairs for r.

Wait, but 2k elements in l would mean k pairs, assuming each pair consists of two identical numbers.

But in this problem, the pairs are of identical numbers, since each number appears twice.

Wait, no, the pairs are of the same number, but in different halves.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting some numbers to be included in l and their counterparts in r.

Wait, perhaps I can select some numbers to be included in l and their counterparts in r, ensuring that the XOR of selected numbers in l equals the XOR of their counterparts in r.

But their counterparts have the same number, so their XOR would be zero, which might not help.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each number, I have two occurrences, one in the first n and one in the last n.

I need to decide for each number whether to include both in l and r, or neither.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Wait, but I need to select subsets of first n for l and subsets of last n for r, not necessarily the same numbers.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

An alternative idea is to note that since XOR(a[1..n]) = XOR(a[n+1..2n]), and I need to select subsets l and r with equal XOR, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of l is equal to the XOR of r.

Given that, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR is equal to a certain value, and since the total XOR is zero, maybe I can find subsets with XOR zero.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case, because XOR(l) needs to equal XOR(r), but not necessarily zero.

Wait, but since XOR(a[1..n]) = XOR(a[n+1..2n]), and l is a subset of a[1..n], r is a subset of a[n+1..2n], perhaps I can relate their XORs.

Wait, perhaps I can fix l and find a corresponding r with the same XOR.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Given time constraints, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can select any 2k elements from the first n for l, and then select 2k elements from the last n for r such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that, and since XOR(a[n+1..2n]) = XOR(a[1..n]), perhaps I can use this property.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

I need to find two subsets with equal XOR.

Given that, maybe I can find subsets whose XOR is equal to a certain value.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for q in range(t):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

b = a[:n]

c = a[n:]

b.sort()

c.sort()

ans1 = []

ans2 = []

k = 2 * k

req = k

l = []

if b[0] != b[1]:

l.append(b[0])

if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:

l.append(b[n - 1])

else:

ans1.append(b[n - 1])

ans1.append(b[n - 1])

k -= 2

for i in range(1, n - 1):

if k == 0:

break

if b[i] == b[i - 1]:

ans1.append(b[i])

ans1.append(b[i])

k -= 2

elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:

l.append(b[i])

k = req

for i in range(1, n):

if k == 0:

break

if c[i] == c[i - 1]:

ans2.append(c[i])

ans2.append(c[i])

k -= 2

for i in range(len(l)):

if k == 0:

break

ans1.append(l[i])

ans2.append(l[i])

k -= 1

print(*ans1)

print(*ans2)

So, the code sorts both halves, b and c.

Then, it initializes ans1 and ans2 as empty lists.

It sets k to 2k and req to k.

It creates a list l.

Then, it checks if b[0] != b[1], and if so, appends b[0] to l.

Similarly, if b[n-2] != b[n-1], appends b[n-1] to l.

Else, appends b[n-1] twice to ans1, and decrements k by 2.

Then, it loops from 1 to n-2, and if k is 0, breaks.

If b[i] == b[i-1], appends b[i] twice to ans1 and decrements k by 2.

Else if b[i] != b[i+1], appends b[i] to l.

Then, resets k to req.

Loops from 1 to n-1, and if k is 0, breaks.

If c[i] == c[i-1], appends c[i] twice to ans2 and decrements k by 2.

Then, loops through l, and if k is 0, breaks.

Appends l[i] to ans1 and ans2, and decrements k by 1.

Finally, prints ans1 and ans2.

Wait, this seems a bit messy.

Let me try to understand what it's doing.

It sorts both halves, b and c.

Then, it tries to build ans1 and ans2 by selecting pairs of identical elements from b and c.

But in the first step, it checks if b[0] != b[1], and if so, adds b[0] to l.

Similarly for b[n-2] != b[n-1], adds b[n-1] to l.

Else, adds b[n-1] twice to ans1.

Then, iterates through b[1] to b[n-2], and if b[i] == b[i-1], adds b[i] twice to ans1.

Else if b[i] != b[i+1], adds b[i] to l.

Then, it processes c to add pairs of identical elements to ans2.

Finally, it adds elements from l to ans1 and ans2, one by one, until k is satisfied.

I'm not entirely sure about this approach.

Let me think about whether this would work.

In the first example:

n=2, k=1

a = [1,2,2,1]

b = [1,2], sorted: [1,2]

c = [2,1], sorted: [1,2]

l = []

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, so l.append(1)

Check b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 2 != 1, so l.append(2)

So, l = [1,2]

Then, loop from i=1 to n-2: no need, n=2

Then, k = req = 2

Loop from i=1 to n-1: i=1, c[1]=2 == c[0]=1? No, so skip

So, ans2 remains empty

Then, loop through l, which has [1,2]

Append 1 to ans1 and ans2, k=1

Append 2 to ans1 and ans2, k=0

So, ans1 = [1,2], ans2 = [1,2]

Which matches the first example.

In the second example:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

b = [6,4,2,1,2,3], sorted: [1,2,2,3,4,6]

c = [1,6,3,5,5,4], sorted: [1,3,4,5,5,6]

l = []

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, so l.append(1)

Check b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 2 != 3, so l.append(3)

So, l = [1,3]

Then, loop from i=1 to n-2: i=1, b[1]=2 == b[0]=1? No, and b[1]!=b[2]=2? No, so skip

i=2, b[2]=2 == b[1]=2, so ans1.append(2), append(2), k=0

Then, k=0, break

Then, k = req=2

Loop from i=1 to n-1: i=1, c[1]=3 == c[0]=1? No, skip

i=2, c[2]=4 == c[1]=3? No, skip

i=3, c[3]=5 == c[2]=4? No, skip

i=4, c[4]=5 == c[3]=5, so ans2.append(5), append(5), k=0

Then, k=0, break

Then, loop through l=[1,3]

Append 1 to ans1 and ans2, k=1

Append 3 to ans1 and ans2, k=0

So, ans1 = [2,2,1,3], ans2 = [5,5,1,3]

But in the example output, it's [6,4] and [1,3]

So, different from the example, but as long as it's correct, it's fine.

Wait, in the example, they chose [6,4] and [1,3], both with XOR=2.

In this approach, ans1=[2,2,1,3] XOR is 2 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 3 = 1

ans2=[5,5,1,3] XOR is 5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2

So, XOR(ans1)=1, XOR(ans2)=2, which are not equal.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, they set k=2k at the beginning, which is 2 in this case.

Then, they append pairs of identical elements to ans1 and ans2.

In this case, for ans1, they appended [2,2], which is fine.

For ans2, they appended [5,5].

Then, they append [1,3] to both ans1 and ans2.

So, ans1=[2,2,1,3], ans2=[5,5,1,3]

XOR of ans1: 2 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2

XOR of ans2: 5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2

So, XOR(ans1)=2 and XOR(ans2)=2, which matches.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But in the earlier step, I miscalculated the XOR of ans1.

So, it seems the code is working correctly in this case.

In the third example:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

b = [1,2,3,4], sorted: [1,2,3,4]

c = [1,2,3,4], sorted: [1,2,3,4]

l = []

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, so l.append(1)

Check b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 3 != 4, so l.append(4)

So, l=[1,4]

Then, loop from i=1 to n-2: i=1, b[1]=2 == b[0]=1? No, and b[1]!=b[2]=3? Yes, so l.append(2)

i=2, b[2]=3 == b[1]=2? No, and b[2]!=b[3]=4? Yes, so l.append(3)

So, l=[1,4,2,3]

Then, k=2*1=2, req=2

Then, loop from i=1 to n-1: i=1, c[1]=2 == c[0]=1? No, skip

i=2, c[2]=3 == c[1]=2? No, skip

i=3, c[3]=4 == c[2]=3? No, skip

So, ans2 remains empty

Then, loop through l=[1,4,2,3], append 1 to ans1 and ans2, k=1

append 4 to ans1 and ans2, k=0

So, ans1=[1,4], ans2=[1,4]

XOR(ans1)=1 XOR 4=5, XOR(ans2)=1 XOR 4=5, which matches.

But in the example, they chose [1,2] and [1,2], which also matches.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

In the fourth example:

n=6, k=2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

b = [5,1,3,3,5,1], sorted: [1,1,3,3,5,5]

c = [2,6,4,6,4,2], sorted: [2,2,4,4,6,6]

l = []

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 1? No, so ans1.append(1), append(1), k=2

Then, k=0, break

So, ans1=[1,1], ans2=[]

Then, k=req=4

Loop from i=1 to n-1: i=1, c[1]=2 == c[0]=2? Yes, ans2.append(2), append(2), k=2

i=2, c[2]=4 == c[1]=2? No, skip

i=3, c[3]=4 == c[2]=4? Yes, ans2.append(4), append(4), k=0

Then, break

Then, l=[]

So, ans1=[1,1], ans2=[2,2,4,4]

XOR(ans1)=1 XOR 1=0, XOR(ans2)=2 XOR 2 XOR 4 XOR 4=0, which matches.

But in the example, they chose [5,1,3,3] and [6,4,2,4], which also matches.

So, again, multiple solutions are possible.

From these observations, it seems that the code is trying to select pairs of identical elements from b and c, and then filling in any remaining required elements from l.

But in the second example, it selected [2,2] from b and [5,5] from c, and then [1,3] from both, which worked.

In the fourth example, it selected [1,1] from b and [2,2,4,4] from c, which also worked.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

Let me try to understand the general logic.

The code sorts both b and c.

Then, it tries to select pairs of identical elements from b and c.

For b, it checks for consecutive duplicates and adds them to ans1.

For c, it does the same and adds to ans2.

If there are unpaired elements in b, it adds them to l, and then adds them to both ans1 and ans2.

In the process, it ensures that the number of elements added to ans1 and ans2 is 2k each.

Given that, and given that the total XOR of b and c are equal, this seems to maintain the property that XOR(ans1) == XOR(ans2).

Hence, it seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find two subsets, l and r, from the first and second halves of the array respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in both subsets is equal.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases, t. For each test case, read n and k, followed by the array a of size 2n.

2. **Sorting**: Split the array a into two halves, b (first n elements) and c (last n elements). Sort both b and c.

3. **Selecting Pairs for Subset l**:
    - Identify unique elements in b that can be added to list l.
    - If there are duplicate elements in b, add both occurrences to ans1 and reduce k accordingly.

4. **Selecting Pairs for Subset r**:
    - Identify pairs of identical elements in c and add them to ans2, reducing k accordingly.

5. **Balancing Subsets**:
    - If k is still greater than zero, add remaining unique elements from l to both ans1 and ans2 to balance the subsets.

6. **Output the Subsets**: Print the subsets ans1 and ans2 for each test case.

### Solution Code

                k -= 2
            elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:

        for i in range(len(l)):
            if k == 0:
                break
            ans1.append(l[i])
            ans2.append(l[i])
            k -= 1
        print(*ans1)
        print(*ans2)

```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - **Input Parsing**: Read t test cases.
  - **Sorting**: Sort both halves of the array to easily identify duplicates.
  - **Selecting Pairs for Subset l**: Add pairs of identical elements from b to ans1.
  - **Selecting Pairs for Subset r**: Add pairs of identical elements from c to ans2.
  - **Balancing Subsets**: Add unique elements from b to both ans1 and ans2 to ensure the subsets have the same XOR.

- **Correctness**: The approach ensures that the subsets l and r have the same XOR by carefully selecting pairs of identical elements and balancing unique elements. This maintains the equality of XOR values for both subsets.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find two subsets, l and r, from the first and second halves of the array respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in both subsets is equal.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases, t. For each test case, read n and k, followed by the array a of size 2n.

2. **Sorting**: Split the array a into two halves, b (first n elements) and c (last n elements). Sort both b and c.

3. **Selecting Pairs for Subset l**:
    - Identify unique elements in b that can be added to list l.
    - If there are duplicate elements in b, add both occurrences to ans1 and reduce k accordingly.

4. **Selecting Pairs for Subset r**:
    - Identify pairs of identical elements in c and add them to ans2, reducing k accordingly.

5. **Balancing Subsets**:
    - If k is still greater than zero, add remaining unique elements from l to both ans1 and ans2 to balance the subsets.

6. **Output the Subsets**: Print the subsets ans1 and ans2 for each test case.
