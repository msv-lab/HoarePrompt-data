Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR-ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the binary representation of the result has as many 1s as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, if n is 1, it's straightforward. I just output k itself because there's only one number, and its bitwise OR is itself.

But when n is greater than 1, I need to distribute k into n numbers such that their sum is k and their bitwise OR has as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

Let me consider what affects the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Each bit in the OR result is 1 if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

In other words, I want to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one 1 in that position across all the numbers.

Given that, I need to distribute the sum k across n numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of these numbers has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.

One way to think about this is to maximize the number of distinct bit positions that are set to 1 across all the numbers.

Wait, but it's not just about distinct bit positions; it's about ensuring that each bit position that is set in any of the numbers is set in at least one number.

Wait, no, it's about the OR, which sets a bit in the result if it's set in any of the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bit positions set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

In other words, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one 1.

Given that, I should try to spread the 1s across different bit positions in the numbers.

But I also have to ensure that the sum of the numbers is k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider an example to get some intuition.

Take the second example in the problem:

n=2, k=3

Possible sequences:

- [1,2]: sum is 3, and 1|2 = 3, which has two 1s in binary (11).

- [0,3]: sum is 3, and 0|3 = 3, which also has two 1s.

- [3,0]: same as above.

- [1,2] is already considered.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is 2.

Is there a way to get more than two 1s? Let's see.

If I choose [1,2], which is 01 and 10, OR is 11.

If I choose [3,0], which is 11 and 00, OR is 11.

If I choose [1,1], which is 01 and 01, OR is 01, which has only one 1.

So, [1,2] or [3,0] gives me two 1s, which is better than [1,1] with one 1.

So, seems like spreading the 1s across different numbers is better.

Wait, but in this case, both [1,2] and [3,0] give the same number of 1s.

But [1,2] uses two different numbers with different bit positions set, while [3,0] uses one number with both bits set and another with no bits set.

Both achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

So, in this case, it's equivalent.

Let me consider another example.

Take n=2, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: 101 | 000 = 101, which has two 1s.

- [1,4]: 001 | 100 = 101, which has two 1s.

- [2,3]: 010 | 011 = 011, which has two 1s.

- [3,2]: 011 | 010 = 011, which has two 1s.

- [4,1]: 100 | 001 = 101, which has two 1s.

- [5,0]: already considered.

Seems like all these combinations give two 1s in the OR.

Is there a way to get more than two 1s?

Wait, 101 has two 1s, but 011 has two 1s as well.

Is there a combination that gives three 1s?

Let me try [1,4]: 001 | 100 = 101, two 1s.

[2,3]: 010 | 011 = 011, two 1s.

[1,3]: 001 | 011 = 011, two 1s.

[2,2]: 010 | 010 = 010, one 1.

[3,1]: 011 | 001 = 011, two 1s.

Seems like the maximum is two 1s in the OR.

But according to the problem's example, for n=2 and k=5, they output [5,0], which has two 1s in the OR, which seems to be the maximum possible.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Now, let's look at the fourth example:

n=6, k=51

Output: [3,1,1,32,2,12]

Let's compute the sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12 = 51, correct.

Now, compute the bitwise OR: 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12

Let's find their binary representations:

3:  00003:     00000011

1:  00001:     00000001

1:  00001:     00000001

32: 00032:     00100000

2:  00002:     00000010

12: 00012:     00001100

Now, OR-ing them together:

  00000011

| 00000001

| 00000001

| 00100000

| 00000010

| 00001100

= 00101111, which is 47 in decimal, and its binary representation is 101111, which has five 1s.

So, the OR result has five 1s.

Is this the maximum possible?

Let me see if I can do better.

Suppose I choose different numbers that sum to 51.

For example, [1,1,1,1,1,46]

Their OR would be 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 46 = 46 in binary is 101110, which is 101110, which has four 1s.

So, the original output has five 1s, which is better than this.

Another try: [31,16,2,1,1,1]

31: 11111

16: 10000

2:  00010

1:  00001

1:  00001

1:  00001

OR: 11111 | 10000 | 00010 | 00001 = 11111, which is 31 in decimal, binary 11111, which has five 1s.

So, same as the original output.

Is there a way to get more than five 1s?

Let's see, 31 is 11111, which is five 1s.

To get more than five 1s, I need at least a number with the sixth bit set.

But 31 is 11111, which is 5 bits.

Wait, 31 is 11111, which is five 1s.

16 is 10000, which adds the sixth bit.

So, 11111 | 10000 = 11111, which is still five 1s.

Wait, but 11111 OR 10000 is 11111, which is still five 1s.

So, seems like I can't get more than five 1s in this case.

Hence, the output is correct.

So, from these examples, it seems that the strategy is to maximize the number of 1s in the OR by covering as many bit positions as possible.

But in practice, it's about maximizing the number of set bits in the OR result.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it does.

The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

If n is 1, it simply prints k.

Otherwise, it tries to find a sequence of n numbers that sum to k and maximizes the number of 1s in their bitwise OR.

Looking at the code:

It initializes an empty list arr.

Then, it sets k0 to k (but k0 is not used later).

It initializes i to 0.

It sets temp to 1.

Then, it enters a loop where it doubles temp as long as temp*2 is less than k.

So, it finds the largest temp such that temp*2 < k.

Wait, no.

Wait, it sets temp = 1, then while temp*2 < k, temp *= 2, i +=1.

So, it's finding the largest power of 2 that is less than k.

For example, if k=5, temp starts at 1.

1*2=2 <5, so temp=2, i=1.

2*2=4 <5, so temp=4, i=2.

4*2=8 not less than 5, so loop breaks.

So, temp is 4, i is 2.

Then, it appends (1<<i)-1 to ans, which is (1<<2)-1 = 4-1=3.

Then, it appends k - sum(ans), which is 5 - 3 =2.

So, ans is [3,2].

Then, it appends [0] * (n - len(ans)), which is [0] * (2-2)=0, so no appending.

Finally, it prints *ans, which is 3 2.

But in the example, for n=2, k=5, the output is 5 0.

Wait, in the example, it's 5 0, but according to this code, it would output 3 2.

But both are correct because 3|2 = 3 in binary is 11, which has two 1s, and 5|0 = 5 in binary is 101, which also has two 1s.

So, both achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, both are valid outputs.

So, in this case, the code's output is correct.

Another example: n=2, k=3.

According to the code:

temp=1, 1*2=2 <3, so temp=2, i=1.

2*2=4 not <3, so loop breaks.

ans.append(1<<1 -1)=2-1=1.

ans.append(3-1=2).

So, output is 1 2, which matches the example's output.

For n=6, k=51.

It would set temp=1, then 1*2=2<51, temp=2,i=1.

2*2=4<51, temp=4,i=2.

4*2=8<51, temp=8,i=3.

8*2=16<51, temp=16,i=4.

16*2=32<51, temp=32,i=5.

32*2=64 not <51, loop breaks.

ans.append(1<<5 -1)=32-1=31.

ans.append(51-31=20).

Then, ans += [0]* (6-2)=4 zeros.

So, output would be 31,20,0,0,0,0.

But in the example, it's 3,1,1,32,2,12.

Let's check the OR:

3:  00003:     00000011

1:  00001:     00000001

1:  00001:     00000001

32: 00032:     00100000

2:  00002:     00000010

12: 00012:     00001100

OR:                 101111, which is 47, with five 1s.

Now, in the code's output:

31: 00031:     00011111

20: 00020:     00010100

0:  00000:     00000000

0:  00000:     00000000

0:  00000:     00000000

0:  00000:     00000000

OR:                 0011111 | 00010100 = 0011111 | 00010100 = 0011111, which is 31 in decimal, binary 11111, which has five 1s.

So, both outputs achieve the same number of 1s in the OR, which is five.

Hence, both are correct.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for these examples.

Now, let's try to understand the logic behind the code.

It seems to be trying to maximize the number of 1s in the OR by choosing numbers that cover as many bit positions as possible.

The way it does this is by finding the largest i such that (1<<i)-1 < k, which is effectively finding the largest number whose binary representation has i consecutive 1s starting from the least significant bit.

Then, it sets one number to be (1<<i)-1, which sets the first i bits to 1, and sets another number to be k - (1<<i)-1.

Then, it sets the remaining numbers to 0.

This ensures that the OR has at least i bits set to 1, plus any higher bits set in the second number.

In the case where k is large enough, this seems to cover a good number of bit positions.

In the example with n=6 and k=51, it sets one number to 31 (11111), which sets the first five bits, and another to 20 (10100), which sets the 5th and 3rd bits.

The OR of these is 11111 | 10100 = 11111, which is 31, having five 1s.

In the example's output, [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is also five 1s.

So, both achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, the code seems to be correct.

Let me try another test case to verify.

Suppose n=3, k=6.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2,3]: sum=6, OR=1|2|3=3 (11 in binary, two 1s)

- [0,0,6]: OR=6 (110 in binary, two 1s)

- [1,1,4]: OR=1|1|4=5 (101 in binary, two 1s)

- [2,2,2]: OR=2 (10 in binary, one 1)

- [3,2,1]: OR=3|2|1=3 (11 in binary, two 1s)

- [4,1,1]: OR=4|1|1=5 (101 in binary, two 1s)

- [5,1,0]: OR=5|1|0=5 (101 in binary, two 1s)

- [6,0,0]: OR=6 (110 in binary, two 1s)

Seems like all these combinations give at most two 1s in the OR.

Is there a way to get more than two 1s?

Let me see.

If I choose [3,2,1], OR is 3|2|1=3 (11), two 1s.

[3,3,0]: OR=3|3|0=3 (11), two 1s.

[7,1,-2]: invalid, since negative numbers are not allowed.

Wait, non-negative integers, so no negatives.

Seems like the maximum is two 1s.

Now, according to the code:

For n=3, k=6.

temp=1, 1*2=2<6, temp=2,i=1.

2*2=4<6, temp=4,i=2.

4*2=8 not <6, loop breaks.

ans.append(1<<2 -1)=4-1=3.

ans.append(6-3=3).

Then, ans += [0]*(3-2)=1 zero.

So, output is [3,3,0].

OR: 3|3|0=3 (11), two 1s.

Which matches the maximum we found earlier.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=4, k=7.

Possible sequences:

- [1,1,1,4]: OR=1|1|1|4=5 (101), three 1s.

- [1,2,2,2]: OR=1|2|2|2=3 (11), two 1s.

- [3,3,1,0]: OR=3|3|1|0=3 (11), two 1s.

- [7,0,0,0]: OR=7 (111), three 1s.

- [3,2,1,1]: OR=3|2|1|1=3 (11), two 1s.

- [4,1,1,1]: OR=4|1|1|1=5 (101), two 1s.

- [2,2,2,1]: OR=2|2|2|1=3 (11), two 1s.

Seems like [7,0,0,0] gives three 1s, which is better than others.

Is there a way to get more than three 1s?

Let's see.

7 in binary is 111, which is three 1s.

To get more than three 1s, I need at least a number with four 1s.

But k=7 is only 111, which is three 1s.

Hence, maximum is three 1s.

Now, according to the code:

n=4, k=7.

temp=1, 1*2=2<7, temp=2,i=1.

2*2=4<7, temp=4,i=2.

4*2=8 not <7, loop breaks.

ans.append(1<<2 -1)=4-1=3.

ans.append(7-3=4).

Then, ans += [0]*(4-2)=2 zeros.

So, output is [3,4,0,0].

OR: 3|4|0|0 = 7 (111), which has three 1s.

Which matches the maximum.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=1.

Only possible sequences:

- [1,0]: OR=1 (1), one 1.

- [0,1]: OR=1 (1), one 1.

- [1,0]: same as above.

So, maximum is one 1.

According to the code:

n=2, k=1.

temp=1, 1*2=2 not <1, loop doesn't run.

ans.append(1<<0 -1)=1-1=0.

ans.append(1-0=1).

So, output is [0,1].

OR: 0|1=1 (1), one 1.

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=5, k=1.

Only possible sequences:

- [1,0,0,0,0]: OR=1 (1), one 1.

- [0,1,0,0,0]: OR=1 (1), one 1.

- etc.

Maximum is one 1.

According to the code:

n=5, k=1.

temp=1, 1*2=2 not <1, loop doesn't run.

ans.append(1<<0 -1)=0.

ans.append(1-0=1).

ans += [0]*(5-2)=3 zeros.

So, output is [0,1,0,0,0].

OR: 0|1|0|0|0=1 (1), one 1.

Correct.

Seems like the code is working correctly for these test cases.

Now, let's try to understand the logic behind the code.

The code tries to find the largest i such that (1<<i)-1 < k.

Then, it sets one number to (1<<i)-1, which is a number with i consecutive 1s in binary.

Then, it sets another number to k - (1<<i)-1.

The rest are set to 0.

The idea is to set as many low bits as possible in one number, and then use the remaining value in another number.

This way, the OR will have those i bits set from the first number, plus any bits set in the second number.

In the case where k is less than (1<<i)-1 for some i, it adjusts accordingly.

From the test cases I've checked, it seems to be achieving the maximum number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
