Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's an array `c` of length `n`, and each element is greater than zero. Then, there are `q` queries, each specifying a subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i`, and I need to determine if that subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good". According to the problem, a subarray `a` of length `m` is good if there exists another integer array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.

3. Every element in `b` is greater than zero.

So, I need to check for each query whether such a `b` array exists for the given subarray.

Let me try to rephrase this in my own words. Given a subarray, I need to see if I can create another array with different values but the same sum, and all values in this new array are positive integers.

I should think about what constraints this imposes on the original subarray.

Let's consider the sum condition: sum(a) = sum(b). Since b_i > 0 for all i, and a_i != b_i for all i, I need to find a way to adjust the a_i's to get a new set of values that still add up to the same total, but none of them are equal to their original values.

One way to approach this is to think about how much I can adjust each a_i while ensuring that b_i is positive and not equal to a_i.

For example, if I have a subarray [1, 2, 3], I need to find a b = [b1, b2, b3] such that b1 + b2 + b3 = 6, b1 != 1, b2 != 2, b3 != 3, and all b_i > 0.

One possible b could be [2, 1, 3], but that doesn't satisfy b3 != 3. So that's invalid. Another try: [2, 1, 3] doesn't work because b3 == 3. How about [2, 1, 3]? Wait, same as before. Hmm.

Wait, actually, [2, 1, 3] has b1 != 1, b2 != 2, but b3 == 3, which violates the condition. So that's invalid.

What if I try [2, 1, 3]? Same issue.

Wait, maybe [2, 1, 3] is invalid because b3 == 3.

So, to make it valid, I need to ensure that none of the b_i equal a_i.

So, for [1, 2, 3], a possible b could be [2, 3, 1], which sums to 6, and none of the b_i equal a_i.

Another possible b is [3, 1, 2], which also sums to 6 and satisfies all conditions.

So, for this subarray, it's good.

Now, consider a subarray of length 1, say [1]. I need to find b = [b1] such that b1 > 0 and b1 != 1, and sum(b) = 1. So, b1 = 1, but b1 != 1. Contradiction. So, it's not possible. Hence, subarrays of length 1 are not good.

Wait, but according to the problem, b_i > 0, and sum(b) = sum(a), and a_i != b_i for all i.

So, for a subarray of length 1, [x], I need b = [y], where y > 0, y != x, and y = x. But y != x and y = x can't hold simultaneously. So, it's impossible. Hence, subarrays of length 1 are not good.

Now, what about subarrays of length 2? Let's take [1, 2]. Sum is 3. I need b = [b1, b2] where b1 > 0, b2 > 0, b1 != 1, b2 != 2, and b1 + b2 = 3.

Possible b: [2,1]. This satisfies all conditions. So, it's good.

Another example: [2,2]. Sum is 4. Possible b: [1,3], [3,1]. Both satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but [1,3] and [3,1] both have b1 != 2 and b2 != 2, and sum to 4.

Now, what if the subarray is [1,1]. Sum is 2. Possible b: [2,0], but b2 != 0 is not allowed since b_i > 0.

So, [2,0] is invalid because b2 = 0.

Alternatively, [1,1], but b_i must be different from a_i, so [1,1] is invalid.

Is there any other possibility? [1,1] again, not allowed.

So, it seems like for [1,1], it's impossible to find such a b.

Because sum is 2, and b_i > 0, b_i != 1, and sum(b) = 2.

So, possible b: [2,0] invalid, [0,2] invalid, [1,1] invalid, [3,-1] invalid, etc.

No valid b exists. Hence, [1,1] is not good.

So, subarrays of length 2 are good unless all elements are equal and sum to a value that cannot be split into two positive integers different from the original values.

Wait, more specifically, for length 2, if the two elements are equal and sum to s, then to have b with b1 + b2 = s, b1 != a1, b2 != a2, and b1, b2 > 0.

In the case where a1 = a2 = x, sum s = 2x.

Possible b: [y, 2x - y], where y != x, and 2x - y != x, and y > 0, 2x - y > 0.

So, y != x and 2x - y != x.

2x - y != x implies y != x.

So, y != x and 2x - y != x, which is y != x.

Also, y > 0 and 2x - y > 0.

So, y > 0 and y < 2x.

As long as y is not equal to x and y is between 1 and 2x -1, excluding x, there are possibilities.

For example, if x = 1, s = 2.

Possible y: 1 is invalid, so no valid y.

Hence, [1,1] is not good.

If x = 2, s = 4.

Possible y: 1 or 3.

b = [1,3] or [3,1], both valid.

Hence, [2,2] is good.

Similarly, [3,3], s = 6, b = [1,5], [2,4], [4,2], [5,1], all valid.

So, for length 2, subarrays where all elements are equal to 1 are not good, but others are.

Wait, more generally, for length 2, as long as the sum s is greater than twice the value of the elements minus 1, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me think about the general case.

Given a subarray a[l..r], I need to check if there exists a b such that:

1. sum(a) = sum(b)

2. a_i != b_i for all i

3. b_i > 0 for all i

I need to find such a b.

One way to approach this is to consider that b_i can be any positive integer not equal to a_i.

So, for each a_i, b_i can be any positive integer except a_i.

Now, I need to choose b_i's such that their sum equals sum(a).

This sounds similar to the problem of finding a derangement of sums or something, but that might be too vague.

An alternative approach is to think about adjusting each a_i by some value, ensuring that the adjustments cancel each other out to maintain the total sum.

But that might be complicated.

Another angle: since b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i, I can think of b_i as a_i plus some delta_i, where delta_i != 0 and b_i > 0.

Wait, but b_i doesn't have to be a_i plus some delta; it can be any positive integer different from a_i.

Perhaps a better way is to fix b_i for some elements and see what constraints that imposes on the remaining elements.

But that might be too time-consuming for the constraints given.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for b.

Since b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i, the minimal possible b_i is max(1, a_i + 1).

Wait, not necessarily.

If a_i = 1, then b_i can be any positive integer except 1, so minimal b_i is 2.

If a_i > 1, then b_i can be as low as 1, as long as b_i != a_i.

Wait, no.

If a_i > 1, then b_i can be any positive integer except a_i, including 1.

So, for a_i > 1, minimal b_i is 1.

For a_i = 1, minimal b_i is 2.

Similarly, there is no upper bound on b_i, as long as sum(b) equals sum(a).

Now, to have sum(b) = sum(a), with b_i >= minimal_b_i for each i, and b_i != a_i.

So, for each a_i:

- If a_i > 1, then b_i >= 1 and b_i != a_i.

- If a_i = 1, then b_i >= 2.

So, the minimal possible sum for b is sum over i of minimal_b_i.

I need to ensure that sum(b) = sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i).

If sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), then it might be possible to choose such a b.

But I also need to ensure that it's possible to adjust the b_i's to match the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the minimal possible sum for b under the constraints that b_i >= minimal_b_i for each i.

If sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), then it might be possible.

But I also need to ensure that sum(a) can be achieved given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the minimal sum for b and the maximal sum for b, but there is no upper limit, so maybe just checking the minimal sum is sufficient.

Let me formalize this.

Define minimal_b_i as:

- If a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1

- If a_i = 1, minimal_b_i = 2

Then, if sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), it might be possible to have such a b.

But I need to ensure that I can adjust the b_i's to match sum(a), while ensuring b_i != a_i.

Wait, but in some cases, even if sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), it might not be possible.

For example, consider a subarray [1,1]. sum(a) = 2.

sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than sum(a), so it's impossible.

Wait, no.

Wait, for a_i = 1, minimal_b_i = 2.

For a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, earlier I thought:

- If a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1

- If a_i = 1, minimal_b_i = 2

So, for [1,1], sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than sum(a) = 2.

Hence, it's impossible, which matches our earlier conclusion that [1,1] is not good.

Similarly, for [1,2], sum(a) = 3, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 1 = 3.

Since sum(a) = sum(minimal_b_i), it's possible to set b_i = minimal_b_i, as long as b_i != a_i.

For [1,2], minimal_b_i = 2 and 1, respectively.

So, b = [2,1], which satisfies b_i != a_i and sum(b) = sum(a).

Hence, it's good.

Another example: [2,2], sum(a) = 4, sum(minimal_b_i) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 4.

Hence, it's possible to find b such that sum(b) = 4.

For example, b = [2,2], but that would violate b_i != a_i.

Wait, b_i cannot be equal to a_i.

So, b cannot be [2,2].

Alternative options: [1,3], [3,1], both satisfy sum(b) = 4 and b_i != 2.

Hence, it's good.

Another example: [1,1,1], sum(a) = 3, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is greater than 3.

Hence, impossible.

Hence, the subarray is not good.

Another example: [1,2,3], sum(a) = 6, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is less than 6.

Hence, possible to find b with sum(b) = 6.

For example, b = [2,2,2], which sums to 6, and none of the b_i equal a_i.

Hence, it's good.

Wait, but in this case, a_i are [1,2,3], b = [2,2,2], which satisfies b_i != a_i for all i.

Hence, it's good.

So, it seems like a general rule:

- Compute sum(a) and sum(minimal_b_i), where minimal_b_i = 1 if a_i > 1, else 2 (when a_i = 1).

- If sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), then it's possible to find such a b.

But, there's a catch.

In the case where all a_i > 1, sum(minimal_b_i) = m (since minimal_b_i = 1 for all i), and sum(a) >= m.

In this case, setting b_i = 1 for all i would satisfy sum(b) = m, but if sum(a) > m, I need to adjust some b_i's to make sum(b) = sum(a).

But since b_i can be greater than 1, as long as b_i != a_i, it's possible.

Wait, but in this case, if I set some b_i's to values greater than 1, ensuring b_i != a_i, I can adjust the sum.

Hence, as long as sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), it should be possible.

Wait, but earlier example: [1,1], sum(a) = 2, sum(minimal_b_i) = 4.

But sum(a) < sum(minimal_b_i), hence impossible.

Similarly, [1,2], sum(a) = 3 >= sum(minimal_b_i) = 3, possible.

[2,2], sum(a) = 4 >= sum(minimal_b_i) = 2, possible.

[1,1,1], sum(a) = 3 < sum(minimal_b_i) = 6, impossible.

[1,2,3], sum(a) = 6 >= sum(minimal_b_i) = 4, possible.

Hence, it seems like the condition sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) is necessary and sufficient.

Wait, but is it really sufficient in all cases?

Let me think about a case where sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), but it's still impossible.

Suppose a = [1,3], sum(a) = 4, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 1 = 3 <= 4.

Possible b:

- [2,2]: sums to 4, b_i != a_i for both.

Hence, it's good.

Another case: a = [1,1,2], sum(a) = 4, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

sum(a) < sum(minimal_b_i), hence not good.

Indeed, trying to find b:

- b1 >= 2, b2 >= 2, b3 >= 1, and sum(b) = 4.

Possible options:

- [2,2,0]: invalid, b3 = 0.

- [2,1,1]: b2 = 1 == a2 = 1, invalid.

- [1,2,1]: b1 = 1 == a1 = 1, invalid.

- [2,2,0]: invalid.

- [3,1,0]: invalid.

No valid b exists.

Hence, it's not good.

Wait, but according to the condition, sum(a) = 4 >= sum(minimal_b_i) = 5, which is false.

Wait, sum(a) = 4 < 5, hence not good.

Wait, but in this case, sum(a) < sum(minimal_b_i), which aligns with the condition.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Wait, but I need to confirm if sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) is always sufficient.

Let me think of a case where sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), but it's still impossible to find such a b.

Suppose a = [2,2,2], sum(a) = 6, sum(minimal_b_i) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <= 6.

Possible b:

- [1,1,4]: sums to 6, b_i != a_i for all i.

Hence, good.

Another case: a = [3,3,3], sum(a) = 9, sum(minimal_b_i) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <= 9.

Possible b: [1,1,7], [1,2,6], etc., all satisfy b_i != a_i and sum(b) = 9.

Hence, good.

Wait, but is there a case where sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), but it's still impossible?

Let me consider a = [1,1,2], sum(a) = 4, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

Earlier, I saw that it's impossible because any b with sum(b) = 4 and b_i >= minimal_b_i doesn't satisfy all conditions.

Wait, but according to the condition, sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) should hold for it to be possible, but in this case, sum(a) < sum(minimal_b_i), which correctly identifies it as not good.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

So, generalizing:

- Compute sum(minimal_b_i), where minimal_b_i = 1 if a_i > 1, else 2 (if a_i = 1).

- If sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), then it's possible to find such a b.

- Else, it's impossible.

Wait, but earlier I thought about sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) being sufficient, but in the case where sum(a) = sum(minimal_b_i), and minimal_b_i is achievable without violating b_i != a_i.

Wait, in the case where sum(a) = sum(minimal_b_i), setting b_i = minimal_b_i for all i should satisfy the conditions, as long as minimal_b_i != a_i.

But, in the case where a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1 != a_i.

In the case where a_i = 1, minimal_b_i = 2 != a_i.

Hence, setting b_i = minimal_b_i for all i should satisfy sum(b) = sum(a) and b_i != a_i.

Hence, sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) should be sufficient.

Wait, but what if there are constraints where setting some b_i to minimal_b_i forces others to adjust in a way that violates b_i != a_i.

Is there a case where even if sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i), it's still impossible to find such a b?

Let me think carefully.

Suppose a = [1,1,3], sum(a) = 5, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

So, sum(a) = sum(minimal_b_i).

Possible b: [2,2,1].

Check:

- b1 = 2 != a1 = 1

- b2 = 2 != a2 = 1

- b3 = 1 != a3 = 3

Hence, it's good.

Another case: a = [1,2,3], sum(a) = 6, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Possible b: [2,1,3], but b3 = 3 == a3 = 3, invalid.

Wait, earlier I thought [2,1,3] is invalid because b3 == a3.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, in this case, sum(a) = 6, sum(minimal_b_i) = 4.

I need to find b where sum(b) = 6 and b_i != a_i.

Possible b: [2,1,3] is invalid because b3 == a3.

Alternative: [2,2,2], which sums to 6, and none of the b_i equal a_i.

Hence, it's good.

So, in this case, even though sum(a) > sum(minimal_b_i), I need to ensure that there's a way to distribute the sum such that b_i != a_i.

In this case, [2,2,2] works.

Hence, sum(a) >= sum(minimal_b_i) seems to be sufficient.

Another example: a = [1,1,1], sum(a) = 3, sum(minimal_b_i) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Since sum(a) < sum(minimal_b_i), it's not possible.

Hence, the condition holds.

Hence, the general rule is:

- For each a_i, define minimal_b_i as 1 if a_i > 1, else 2.

- Compute sum_min = sum of minimal_b_i for i from l to r.

- If sum(a[l..r]) >= sum_min and number of a_i == 1 is less than or equal to the excess sum (sum(a) - sum_min), then it's possible.

Wait, actually, perhaps just sum(a) >= sum_min is sufficient.

Because, in the cases where sum(a) >= sum_min, I can set b_i = minimal_b_i for all i, and if sum(a) == sum_min, it's fine.

If sum(a) > sum_min, I can adjust some b_i's to be higher while ensuring b_i != a_i.

Hence, sum(a) >= sum_min seems to be both necessary and sufficient.

Hence, for each query, I can compute sum_min for the subarray and check if sum(a) >= sum_min.

If yes, print "YES"; else, "NO".

Now, to implement this efficiently, given the constraints:

- t <= 10^4 test cases

- n, q <= 3*10^5

- sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5

- sum of q over all test cases <= 3*10^5

Hence, I need an O(n + q) per test case solution, or O(n + q) overall.

I can precompute prefix sums for the array c.

Let me define prefix_sum[i] = sum of c[0 to i-1].

Similarly, prefix_min[i] = sum of minimal_b_i for c[0 to i-1].

Then, for each query [l, r], sum(a[l..r]) = prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l-1]

sum_min = prefix_min[r] - prefix_min[l-1]

Then, if sum(a[l..r]) >= sum_min, print "YES"; else, "NO"

Hence, I need to compute prefix_sum and prefix_min arrays.

Implementing this should be efficient enough.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = []

c = 0

for x in l:

c += x

p.append(c)

for _ in range(m):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

s = p[b - 1]

if a - 2 >= 0:

s -= p[a - 2]

if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it reads t test cases, then for each test case:

- Reads n and m

- Reads the array l

- Computes prefix sums in p

Then, for each query:

- Reads l and r (1-based indices)

- Computes s = p[r-1]

- If l - 2 >= 0, s -= p[l-2]

- If r - l + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (r - l + 1), print "YES"; else "NO"

First, let's see if this aligns with my logic.

I need to compute sum(a[l..r]) and sum_min for the subarray [l..r].

In the code, p is the prefix sum array, so p[r-1] - (p[l-2] if l-2 >=0 else 0) gives sum(a[l..r]).

So, s = sum(a[l..r])

Then, it checks if r - l + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (r - l + 1)

Wait, according to my earlier logic, sum_min should be sum over i from l to r of minimal_b_i, where minimal_b_i = 1 if a_i > 1, else 2.

But in the code, it's checking s >= 2 * (r - l + 1)

Wait, 2 * (r - l + 1) is like assuming minimal_b_i = 2 for all i in [l..r], which is only true if all a_i = 1.

But if there are a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1 for those.

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the author tried to simplify the condition.

But it's not accurate.

For example, in the case where a_i > 1, minimal_b_i = 1.

Hence, sum_min = number of a_i > 1 * 1 + number of a_i = 1 * 2.

But in the code, it's just checking s >= 2 * length of subarray.

Which is too restrictive, as it assumes minimal_b_i = 2 for all i.

Hence, this condition is too strict and will give incorrect results.

For example, consider a subarray [2,2], sum(a) = 4, sum_min = 1 + 1 = 2.

According to the code, it checks s >= 2 * 2 = 4, which is true, so "YES".

Which is correct in this case.

But consider [1,2], sum(a) = 3, sum_min = 2 + 1 = 3.

According to the code, s >= 2 * 2 = 4, which is false, so "NO", but actually it should be "YES".

Hence, it's incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
