Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that adds up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that adds up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where no subsequence sums to k, but every other value from 1 to n (except k) can be obtained as the sum of some subsequence.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Let's consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Take the first sample input:

2 2

Here, n=2 and k=2. So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 2, but there should be a subsequence that sums to 1.

A possible sequence is [1]. This works because:

- The only possible subsequence is [1], which sums to 1, so there's no subsequence that sums to 2.

- There is a subsequence that sums to 1, which is [1] itself.

Another sample input is:

6 1

Here, n=6 and k=1. So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, but there should be subsequences that sum to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

One possible sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This works because:

- There's no way to get a sum of 1 from these numbers since the smallest number is 2.

- Each of the numbers itself can be a subsequence that sums to that number.

Another sample input is:

8 8

Here, n=8 and k=8. So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 8, but there should be subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

One possible sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has 7 elements. This works because:

- The sum of any subsequence can be from 1 up to 7, but not 8.

- There's no way to get a sum of 8 since the maximum sum is 7.

Wait, but the sample output for this case is:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Which matches my thinking.

Another sample input is:

9 3

Here, n=9 and k=3. I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but there should be subsequences that sum to every other value from 1 to 9, except 3.

The sample output is:

4

7 1 4 1

Let's check this:

Possible subsets and their sums:

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [7]: 7

- [1]: 1

- [1,1]: 2

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,7]: 8

- [4,1]: 5

- [4,7]: 11

- [1,1,4]: 6

- [1,1,7]: 9

- [1,4,7]: 12

- [1,1,4,7]: 13

So, the possible sums are: 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,11,12,13. Missing sums are 3,7,10. Wait, but 7 is present from [7], and 10 is not present, but it's okay because n=9, so we don't need sums beyond 9.

Wait, but n=9, so I only need sums from 1 to 9, except 3. Looking at the sums above, we have 1,2,4,5,6,8,9. Sum 7 is also present, which is okay because 7 ≠ k=3.

So, this sequence works.

Last sample input:

10 7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Possible subsets and their sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, the sums are:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

We need sums from 1 to 10 except 7. So, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10 are present. 7 is missing, which is good because k=7.

Wait, but [1,2,4]=7, but in this sequence, there is no 4. Wait, in this sequence, it's [1,2,8,3], so [1,2,3,4] is not present. Wait, no, there is no 4 in the sequence. Wait, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], so [1,2,3,4] is not possible because 4 is not in the sequence.

Wait, but in the sums above, 7 is not present. Wait, in the earlier list, [1,2,3,4] is not in this sequence because there is no 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, the sequence is [1,2,8,3]. Let's list all possible subsets and their sums:

- []: 0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

We need sums from 1 to 10 except 7. So, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10 are needed, and 7 should not be present.

In this sequence, 7 is not present, which is good.

So, this sequence works.

Now, looking at these examples, I need to find a general way to construct such a sequence for any n and k.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 1000

- For each test case, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 10^7

- Sequence should have at most 25 elements, each 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

Given that m ≤ 25, and a_i can be up to 10^9, which is quite large, so there's flexibility in choosing the values.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

I need to find a sequence where:

- No subsequence sums to k.

- Every v from 1 to n, except k, can be obtained as the sum of some subsequence.

First, I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable.

Second, ensure that k is not achievable.

One way to approach this is to construct a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

But constructing such a set directly might be tricky.

An alternative approach is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it in such a way that k becomes unachievable.

But how?

One idea is to exclude k from the possible sums. To do that, I need to ensure that there's no combination of elements in the sequence that adds up to k.

But at the same time, all other sums from 1 to n, except k, should be achievable.

This seems similar to the concept of subset sum problems, where we need to select a set of numbers that can form certain sums.

I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, the subsets can generate any sum from 0 up to the sum of all elements.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can generate any sum from 0 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while including all other sums up to n.

So, perhaps I can start with a set that can generate all sums from 0 to some value, and then adjust it to make k unachievable.

But how?

Another idea: since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, and m can be up to 25, which allows for a large number of possible subsets (2^25 -1 subsets), which is more than enough to cover the requirements.

But I need a systematic way to construct such a sequence.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

In the first sample, n=2, k=2: sequence [1]

In the second, n=6, k=1: sequence [2,3,4,5,6]

In the third, n=8, k=8: sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

In the fourth, n=9, k=3: sequence [7,1,4,1]

In the fifth, n=10, k=7: sequence [1,2,8,3]

I need to find a pattern or a general method from these examples.

In the third sample, to make sure that no subsequence sums to 8, and all other sums from 1 to 7 are achievable, using seven 1's allows sums from 1 to 7, and since all elements are 1, any subset sum is just the number of elements chosen, so sums from 1 to 7 are possible, and 8 is not achievable.

But for larger n, using only 1's wouldn't cover larger sums.

So, that approach might not be general.

In the fourth sample, with n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1]. Here, 7 is a large number that helps cover higher sums, and the 1's and 4 allow for various combinations.

Similarly, in the fifth sample, [1,2,8,3] covers a range of sums.

It seems like including a combination of powers of 2 and some specific numbers can help cover the required sums while excluding k.

Wait, powers of 2 can generate any sum, but in this problem, I need to exclude k.

Perhaps I can start with a set of powers of 2 and adjust it to make k unachievable.

Let me consider the binary representation of k.

Since powers of 2 can represent any number in binary, if I have all powers of 2 up to the highest power needed to represent n, I can generate any sum from 1 to n.

But I need to make k unachievable.

So, perhaps I can exclude some elements or add extra elements in a way that k becomes unachievable.

Wait, but if I have all powers of 2, I can generate any sum from 1 to n.

So, to make k unachievable, I need to remove or modify some elements so that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can still be formed.

But this seems tricky because removing any power of 2 would make certain sums unachievable.

Alternatively, maybe I can include extra elements to block only k while keeping others achievable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This means that the subset sum problem for this set should cover all targets except k.

This is similar to the subset sum problem with some constraints.

I recall that the subset sum problem is NP-complete, but since n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with m up to 25, I need an efficient way to construct such a set.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that m is at most 25, which means I can choose up to 25 numbers, each up to 10^9.

Given that, the total number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, which is way more than n=10^6, so it's feasible.

But I need a systematic way to choose these 25 numbers such that all sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

One possible approach is to start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to make k unachievable.

For example, starting with powers of 2 up to n.

Wait, but with powers of 2, I can generate any sum from 1 to n.

So, to make k unachievable, I need to modify this set.

One way to do that is to remove some elements that are necessary to form k and add other elements that allow forming all other sums.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I include k itself in the sequence. Then, the subsequence consisting of just k would sum to k, which is not allowed. So, I need to ensure that k is not present in the sequence, and also that no combination of elements sums to k.

Wait, the problem allows a_i to be zero, but it says non-negative integers. So, zero is allowed.

But including k in the sequence would allow the subsequence [k] to sum to k, which is not allowed.

So, k should not be in the sequence, and no combination of elements should sum to k.

Wait, but the problem allows a_i to be zero, so if I include zero, it doesn't affect the sums.

But including zero doesn't help in generating new sums, except that it can be included in subsets without changing the sum.

So, perhaps I should avoid including zero to keep the sequence minimal.

Back to the problem.

I need to construct a sequence where:

- No subsequence sums to k.

- All other sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable.

Given that m ≤ 25, and a_i can be up to 10^9, I have flexibility in choosing the values.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to have a specific method for constructing the sequence.

Let's analyze the given program to understand its approach.

The program reads t, the number of test cases, and for each test case, reads n and k.

Then, it calculates i such that 1 << i + 1 <= k.

Wait, 1 << i is 2^i.

So, it's finding the largest i such that 2^(i+1) <= k.

Then, it sets ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]

And then appends 1 << j for j from 0 to 19, excluding j = i.

Finally, it prints the length of ans (which is 3 + 20 = 23) and the elements of ans.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, sometimes m is 7, sometimes 4, sometimes 5, but here m is always 23.

Wait, in the sample inputs, m varies, but in the program, m is always 23.

Wait, but the problem allows m up to 25, so 23 is acceptable.

But in the sample inputs, m is sometimes 7, sometimes 4, sometimes 5, sometimes 7 again.

But in the program, m is always 23.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back, the program defines ans with 3 elements initially, then appends 1 << j for j in range(20), so that's 3 + 20 = 23 elements.

But in the sample inputs, m is up to 7, but the program outputs m=23.

Is m=23 acceptable? Yes, since m <= 25.

But perhaps there's a better way to minimize m, but the problem only requires m <= 25.

So, as long as m <= 25, it's acceptable.

Now, let's see what the program is doing.

It finds i such that 2^(i+1) <= k.

Then, it sets ans = [k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i], and then appends 2^j for j from 0 to 19, excluding j = i.

So, it's excluding one particular power of 2.

The idea seems to be to include powers of 2, but exclude the one that would allow forming k.

But let's verify this.

Take the first sample input: n=2, k=2.

Here, k=2.

Calculate i:

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <= 2.

2^(i+1) <= 2.

For i=0: 2^1 = 2 <=2, so i=0.

Then, ans = [2 - 2^0, 2 +1, 2 +1 +2^0] = [1,3,4].

Then, append 2^j for j from 0 to 19, excluding j=0.

So, append 2^1 to 2^19.

But in the sample input, the output is m=1 and sequence [1], but the program would output m=23 with [1,3,4,2,4,8,16,...].

Which doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says to assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

But in this case, the program's output doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, maybe I misread the program.

Looking back, the program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for tc in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

i = 0

while 1 << i + 1 <= k:

i = i + 1

ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]

for j in range(20):

if j != i:

ans.append(1 << j)

print(len(ans))

print(*ans)



In the first sample input, n=2, k=2.

Calculate i:

Find largest i such that 2^(i+1) <=2.

2^(i+1) <=2.

For i=0: 2^1=2 <=2.

For i=1: 2^2=4 >2.

So, i=0.

Then, ans = [2 -1, 2+1, 2+1+1] = [1,3,4].

Then, append 2^j for j from 0 to 19, excluding j=0.

So, append 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ..., up to 2^19.

But in the sample output, m=1 and sequence [1].

Which is different from what the program outputs.

So, perhaps the program is not correct.

Wait, but maybe the program is correct, and the sample output is just one possible correct answer, and there are multiple possible solutions.

In the first sample, [1] is a valid sequence because:

- No subsequence sums to 2.

- There is a subsequence that sums to 1.

Which satisfies the conditions.

But the program's output is m=23 with sequence [1,3,4,2,4,8,...].

In this sequence:

- Subsequence [1] sums to 1.

- Subsequence [3] sums to 3, which is greater than n=2, so it's okay.

- Subsequence [1,3] sums to 4, which is also greater than n=2.

- And so on.

So, in this case, there is no subsequence that sums to 2, and there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

So, it satisfies the conditions.

But it's not minimal, but the problem doesn't require minimality, only m <=25.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Let's check another sample input.

Second sample input: n=6, k=1.

Sample output: m=5, sequence [2,3,4,5,6].

In this sequence:

- No subsequence sums to 1, since all elements are >=2.

- Subsequences can sum to 2,3,4,5,6.

Which matches the requirements.

Now, according to the program:

n=6, k=1.

Calculate i:

Find largest i such that 2^(i+1) <=1.

2^(i+1) <=1.

For i=0: 2^1=2 >1.

So, i=-1? But i starts from 0.

Wait, the while loop continues as long as 1<<(i+1)<=k.

Initially, i=0.

1<<(0+1)=2 <=1? No.

So, i remains 0.

Then, ans=[1-1,1+1,1+1+1]=[0,2,3].

Then, append 2^j for j from 0 to19, excluding j=i=0.

So, append 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ..., up to 2^19.

So, ans=[0,2,3,2,4,8,16,... up to 2^19].

But in the sample output, m=5 and sequence [2,3,4,5,6].

Which is different from what the program outputs.

But in the program's output, m=23, and sequence includes 0,2,3, and powers of 2 from 2 up to 2^19.

In this sequence:

- No subsequence sums to 1, since the smallest element is 0, and subsequences can sum to 0,2,3,4,5,6,... up to large numbers.

But in the problem, we need to ensure that there is no subsequence summing to k=1, and that all v from 1 to n=6, except k=1, can be obtained.

So, in the program's output, we have 0 in the sequence.

But the problem allows 0, but in this case, subsequences can sum to 0, which is not in the range 1 to n.

But since 0 is allowed, and it doesn't interfere with the sums from 1 to 6, it might still be acceptable.

However, in the sample output, m=5 and sequence [2,3,4,5,6], which is simpler and achieves the goal.

So, perhaps the program is correct, but not optimal.

Let's check if the program's output satisfies the conditions.

Sequence: [0,2,3,2,4,8,16,...]

Sum to 1: Not possible, since the smallest positive number is 2.

Sum to 2: [2]

Sum to 3: [3]

Sum to 4: [4]

Sum to 5: [2,3]

Sum to 6: [2,4]

So, all sums from 2 to6 are achievable, and sum to1 is not achievable.

Hence, it satisfies the conditions.

Similarly, for n=8, k=8.

Sample output: m=7, sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

In this sequence:

- No subsequence sums to8, since the maximum sum is7.

- Subsequences can sum to1 through7.

Which is correct.

According to the program:

n=8, k=8.

Calculate i:

Find largest i such that2^(i+1)<=8.

2^(i+1)<=8.

i=0:2<=8

i=1:4<=8

i=2:8<=8

i=3:16>8

So, i=2.

Then, ans=[8-4,8+1,8+1+4]=[4,9,13]

Then, append 2^j for j from0 to19, excluding j=2.

So, append 1,2,8,16,... up to2^19.

So, ans=[4,9,13,1,2,8,16,...]

In this sequence:

- No subsequence sums to8.

Because:

- 1,2,4,8,16,... are present.

But 8 is present, but in the program's sequence, 8 is included.

Wait, but if 8 is included, then the subsequence [8] sums to8, which is not allowed.

Wait, this seems to be a problem.

Wait, in the program, ans includes k+1=9 and k+1+(1<<i)=13, and k-(1<<i)=4, and then appends all 2^j except for j=i=2, which is 4.

Wait, but 4 is still included in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify if the sum8 can be achieved in this sequence.

Sequence: [4,9,13,1,2,8,16,...]

Wait, 8 is present, so [8] sums to8, which is not allowed.

But in the problem, the sequence should not have any subsequence summing to k=8.

So, this seems to be invalid.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back, the program sets ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)], and then appends 1 << j for j from0 to19, excluding j=i.

So, in this case, for n=8, k=8, i=2.

ans = [8-4,8+1,8+1+4]=[4,9,13]

Then, append 1<<j for j from0 to19, excluding j=2.

So, append 1,2,8,16,...

So, sequence is [4,9,13,1,2,8,16,...]

In this sequence, [8] sums to8, which is not allowed.

So, this seems to be incorrect.

But in the sample input where n=8, k=8, the output is m=7 with seven 1's, which correctly avoids sum8.

So, perhaps the program is flawed.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to adjust the program to avoid including8.

Wait, in the program, it includes k+1=9 and k+1+(1<<i)=13, which are greater than n=8, so they don't interfere with sums up to8.

But it also includes 1<<j for j !=i, which includes 8.

So, [8] sums to8, which is not allowed.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
