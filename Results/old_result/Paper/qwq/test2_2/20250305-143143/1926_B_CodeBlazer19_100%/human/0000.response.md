Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square drawn with '1's. I need to determine which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), where each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, and these '1's are centered in one column.

- So, for k=2, the first row has 1 '1', and the second row has 3 '1's, all centered in the same column.

- There's also an "upside-down" triangle, which I assume means the triangle can be flipped, but it's still a triangle.

- The problem shows examples of triangles and non-triangles.

For a square:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), each with k '1's, and these '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

- So, it's a block of '1's forming a square shape.

Given that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and it's guaranteed that the shape is larger than 1 '1', I need to classify the shape as either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

Looking at the provided code:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = 0

        b = ''

        for j in range(n):

            s = input()

            if s.count('1') == 1:

                a = 'TRIANGLE'

            elif s.count('1') > 1:

                b = 'SQUARE'

        if a != 0:

            print(a)

        else:

            print(b)

```

I need to determine if this code correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the grid provided.

Let's analyze the code step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. It reads n, the size of the grid.

b. Initializes variables a to 0 and b to an empty string.

c. Reads each of the n rows of the grid.

d. For each row, counts the number of '1's.

i. If a row has exactly one '1', it sets a to 'TRIANGLE'.

ii. If a row has more than one '1', it sets b to 'SQUARE'.

e. After reading all rows, it checks if a is not 0, and if so, prints 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, prints b, which could be 'SQUARE' or an empty string.

Wait, but according to the problem, each grid has exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and it's guaranteed that the shape is larger than one '1'. So, in every test case, there should be either a square or a triangle, and the code should always print either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

Looking back at the code, if a is set to 'TRIANGLE' in any row that has exactly one '1', and b is set to 'SQUARE' in any row that has more than one '1', then the logic seems straightforward. However, this might not correctly distinguish between squares and triangles.

Let's consider some examples to verify this logic.

Example 1:

Input:

6

3

000

011

011

Output:

SQUARE

In this 3x3 grid:

Row 1: 000 → 0 '1's

Row 2: 011 → 2 '1's

Row 3: 011 → 2 '1's

According to the code:

- Row 1: 0 '1's → skip

- Row 2: 2 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 3: 2 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a is still 0, print 'SQUARE'

This matches the expected output.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0000

0000

0100

1110

Output:

TRIANGLE

In this 4x4 grid:

Row 1: 0000 → 0 '1's

Row 2: 0000 → 0 '1's

Row 3: 0100 → 1 '1'

Row 4: 1110 → 3 '1's

According to the code:

- Row 1: 0 '1's → skip

- Row 2: 0 '1's → skip

- Row 3: 1 '1' → set a = 'TRIANGLE'

- Row 4: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a is set to 'TRIANGLE', print 'TRIANGLE'

This matches the expected output.

Example 3:

Input:

2

11

11

Output:

SQUARE

In this 2x2 grid:

Row 1: 11 → 2 '1's

Row 2: 11 → 2 '1's

According to the code:

- Row 1: 2 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 2: 2 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a is still 0, print 'SQUARE'

This matches the expected output.

Example 4:

Input:

5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

Output:

TRIANGLE

In this 5x5 grid:

Row 1: 00111 → 3 '1's

Row 2: 00010 → 1 '1'

Row 3: 00000 → 0 '1's

Row 4: 00000 → 0 '1's

Row 5: 00000 → 0 '1's

According to the code:

- Row 1: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 2: 1 '1' → set a = 'TRIANGLE'

- Rows 3-5: 0 '1's → skip

- Since a is set to 'TRIANGLE', print 'TRIANGLE'

This matches the expected output.

Example 5:

Input:

10

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0111111100

0011111000

0001110000

0000100000

Output:

TRIANGLE

In this 10x10 grid:

Rows 1-5: all 0's → skip

Row 6: 1111111110 → 9 '1's

Row 7: 0111111100 → 7 '1's

Row 8: 0011111000 → 5 '1's

Row 9: 0001110000 → 3 '1's

Row 10: 0000100000 → 1 '1'

According to the code:

- Rows 1-5: 0 '1's → skip

- Row 6: 9 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 7: 7 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 8: 5 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 9: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 10: 1 '1' → set a = 'TRIANGLE'

- Since a is set to 'TRIANGLE', print 'TRIANGLE'

This matches the expected output.

Example 6:

Input:

3

111

111

111

Output:

SQUARE

In this 3x3 grid:

Row 1: 111 → 3 '1's

Row 2: 111 → 3 '1's

Row 3: 111 → 3 '1's

According to the code:

- Row 1: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 2: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 3: 3 '1's → set b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a is still 0, print 'SQUARE'

This matches the expected output.

From these examples, it seems like the code is correctly identifying the shapes based on the number of '1's in each row. However, I need to ensure that this logic holds in general.

Let's think about the properties of squares and triangles in this context.

For a square:

- Each row has exactly k '1's, where k is the size of the square.

- All rows have the same number of '1's.

For a triangle:

- The number of '1's in each row varies according to the row number, specifically 2*i - 1 for some i.

- There should be at least one row with exactly one '1'.

Given that, the code checks if any row has exactly one '1', it sets a to 'TRIANGLE'. If any row has more than one '1', it sets b to 'SQUARE'. Then, if a is set (i.e., there is at least one row with exactly one '1'), it prints 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

This seems to capture the distinction because a triangle must have at least one row with exactly one '1', while a square will have all rows with the same number of '1's, which is greater than one.

However, I should consider if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Edge Case 1:

A square with k=2:

Rows:

01

11

Here, both rows have two '1's, so the code should set b to 'SQUARE' and print 'SQUARE', which is correct.

Edge Case 2:

A triangle with k=2:

Rows:

1

11

Here, one row has one '1' and another has two '1's. According to the code, it sets a to 'TRIANGLE' and b to 'SQUARE', but since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE', which is correct.

Edge Case 3:

A triangle with k=3:

Rows:

1

11

111

The code sets a to 'TRIANGLE' and b to 'SQUARE', and prints 'TRIANGLE', which is correct.

Edge Case 4:

A square with k=3:

Rows:

111

111

111

The code sets b to 'SQUARE' and prints 'SQUARE', which is correct.

Edge Case 5:

A triangle with rows having increasing odd numbers of '1's:

Rows:

1

11

111

1111

The code sets a to 'TRIANGLE' and b to 'SQUARE', and prints 'TRIANGLE', which is correct.

Edge Case 6:

A square with k=1 is invalid, as k > 1 is guaranteed.

Edge Case 7:

A triangle with only one row is invalid, as k > 1 is guaranteed.

Given that, the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.

Another consideration is that the problem mentions that the grid contains exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and that shape contains all the '1's in the grid. So, there are no mixed shapes or extra '1's outside the shape.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the examples, I conclude that the provided code correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
