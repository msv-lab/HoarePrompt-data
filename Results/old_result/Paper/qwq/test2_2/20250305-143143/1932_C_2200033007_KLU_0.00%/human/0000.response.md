Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of commands, where each command is either 'L' or 'R'. For each command in the string, I need to output the remainder of the product of all elements in the array when divided by `m`, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This process repeats for all `n` commands, and finally, the array will be empty.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. For each step:

1. Calculate the product of all elements in the current array, take modulo `m`, and output the result.

2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if it's 'R'.

3. Repeat this process until the array is empty.

Given that there are multiple test cases, and the total sum of `n` across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, efficiency is crucial. So, I need an algorithm that can handle this within reasonable time limits.

Let me think about how to compute the product modulo `m` efficiently. Calculating the product of all elements in the array for each command would be too slow because it would be O(n^2), which is not acceptable for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo `m` at each step without recalculating it from scratch every time.

One idea is to compute the product of all elements in the array initially, then, for each step, divide the product by the element being removed and take modulo `m` again. However, division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward, especially since `m` could be any positive integer, not necessarily prime.

Wait, in modular arithmetic, division by a number `a` is equivalent to multiplying by the modular inverse of `a` modulo `m`, provided that `a` and `m` are coprime. But in this problem, `a` and `m` may not be coprime, so I can't always compute the modular inverse.

Hmm, that approach might not work directly. I need another way.

Let me consider the sequence of removals. Since the removals are specified by the string `s`, I can determine in advance the order in which elements are removed.

For example, if `s` is "LRRL", then:

- First, remove the leftmost element (index 0)

- Then, remove the rightmost element (index 3)

- Then, remove the rightmost element (index 2)

- Finally, remove the leftmost element (index 1)

Wait, no. After the first removal, the array changes, so indices shift.

Actually, it's better to think in terms of which elements are still in the array at each step.

Perhaps I can determine, for each element, how many steps it remains in the array before it gets removed.

Then, for each step, the product would be the product of elements that have not been removed yet, modulo `m`.

But again, calculating this directly seems inefficient.

Another approach: process the string `s` to know the order in which elements are removed, and then compute the product of the remaining elements at each step.

But this still seems too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the prefix and suffix products, and use them to calculate the product of the remaining array at each step.

Let me think about this.

If I compute the prefix product P_left[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i], and P_right[i] = a[n-1] * a[n-2] * ... * a[i], then at each step, depending on whether I'm removing from the left or the right, I can express the current product as P_left[some_index] * P_right[some_index].

But I need to handle the overlapping parts correctly, and also take modulo `m` at each step.

This seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it will work efficiently.

Let me consider another angle.

Since the operations are either removing from the left or the right, the remaining array at each step is a subarray that is contiguous, but it's not necessarily a prefix or a suffix in a straightforward way.

Perhaps I can simulate the process using two pointers, one for the left and one for the right, and keep track of the current product.

But again, updating the product at each step would require dividing by the removed element, which, as I thought earlier, is problematic due to potential lack of modular inverses.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product modulo `m` in a way that avoids division.

Is there a way to represent the product of the remaining elements without dividing?

One idea is to factorize the product and keep track of the exponents of each prime factor, but that seems too slow and complicated for this problem.

Let me consider the example provided to see if I can find a pattern.

In the first example:

n=4, m=6

a = [3,1,4,2]

s = "LRRL"

Steps:

1. Product: 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 mod 6 = 0

   Remove leftmost element (3), array becomes [1,4,2]

2. Product: 1*4*2 = 8, 8 mod 6 = 2

   Remove rightmost element (2), array becomes [1,4]

3. Product: 1*4 = 4, 4 mod 6 = 4

   Remove rightmost element (4), array becomes [1]

4. Product: 1, 1 mod 6 = 1

   Remove leftmost element, array becomes empty

So the output is: 0 2 4 1

Looking at this, I wonder if there's a way to compute these products efficiently without redoing everything from scratch each time.

Another idea: compute the product of all elements, then for each step, divide by the element being removed, and take modulo `m`.

But as I thought earlier, division in modular arithmetic is tricky when `m` is not prime.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product modulo `m` incrementally, keeping track of the product so far, and updating it by dividing by the removed element.

But again, division is an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each step, multiply by the modular inverse of the removed element.

But, as I mentioned, modular inverses only exist if the element and `m` are coprime, which may not be the case here.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Since the operations are either removing from the left or the right, perhaps I can process the array from both ends, keeping track of the product of the remaining elements.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the product of all possible subarrays where elements are removed from the left and/or right, but that seems too broad.

Another idea: process the removals in reverse order.

That is, start from the last removal and work backwards, adding elements to the array and updating the product accordingly.

But that might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can collect all the elements that are removed, in the order they are removed, and then for each step, compute the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But that still seems inefficient.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n can be up to 2*10^5, and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an O(n) solution per test case, or at least O(n) total time across all test cases.

I need to find a way to compute the product modulo m efficiently without redundant calculations.

Another thought: since we're dealing with product and modulo, perhaps I can use logarithms or some other mathematical transformation to simplify the calculations, but I don't see an immediate way to apply that here.

Wait, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of prime factors, but again, with large n, factoring each number would be too slow.

Let me consider the properties of modulo operation.

I know that (a * b) mod m = [(a mod m) * (b mod m)] mod m

So, I can compute the product modulo m by iteratively multiplying each element modulo m.

But again, this needs to be done efficiently for each step.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, then for each step, divide by the removed element and take modulo m.

But division is problematic when m is not prime.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of modular inverses for the entire product.

Wait, no, that might not help directly.

Let me think about the example again.

In the first step, product is 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 mod 6 = 0

Then remove 3 (left), so array is [1,4,2], product is 1*4*2=8, 8 mod 6=2

Then remove 2 (right), array is [1,4], product=4, 4 mod 6=4

Then remove 4 (right), array is [1], product=1, 1 mod 6=1

Then remove 1 (left), array is empty.

So, the outputs are 0,2,4,1

Looking at this, I notice that once the product becomes 0 modulo m, it can stay 0 or change depending on the removed elements.

In this case, after the first step, the product is 0 mod 6.

Then, removing 3, which is divisible by 3, and m=6 is also divisible by 3, so the product without 3 is 1*4*2=8, which is 2 mod 6.

Then, removing 2, which is divisible by 2, and m=6 is also divisible by 2, so the product without 2 is 1*4=4, which is 4 mod 6.

Then, removing 4, which is divisible by 2, m=6 is divisible by 2, so product without 4 is 1, which is 1 mod 6.

So, it seems like the modular arithmetic is affecting the results based on the common factors between the removed elements and m.

But I still need a general approach that works for any n, m, a, and s.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I simulate the process step by step, keeping track of the current product modulo m, and updating it as I remove elements.

But again, removing an element requires me to divide the product by that element, which is problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can keep the product modulo m * some multiple of m, such that when I divide by the removed element, I can adjust accordingly.

But this seems too vague and error-prone.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Precompute the product of all elements in the array modulo m.

2. For each step:

a. Output the current product modulo m.

b. Remove the specified element (leftmost or rightmost based on the command).

c. Update the product accordingly.

The challenge is in step 2c: updating the product after removal.

Since direct division is problematic, maybe I can keep track of the product of the removed elements and adjust the product accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a list of removed elements and their product, and then compute the current product as (original product) / (product of removed elements), but again, division is tricky.

Another idea: since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can use prefix and suffix products to compute the product of the remaining elements.

For example, if I know the product of the first k elements and the product of the last l elements, and the total product is their combination based on which elements are removed, maybe I can use that.

But this seems complicated.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have two arrays:

- P_left[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i]

- P_right[j] = a[n-1] * a[n-2] * ... * a[j]

Then, for a given step, if I know how many elements have been removed from the left and right, I can compute the product of the remaining elements as P_left[left_removed - 1] * P_right[right_removed - 1], adjusted for overlapping elements.

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the number of 'L' and 'R' commands up to each step and use that to determine which elements are still in the array.

But I'm getting stuck on the details.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the results for all test cases together, so I can process each test case independently.

I need to find a way to make this efficient.

Another angle: since m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m at each step in a way that avoids division.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that if m is small (up to 10^4), I can handle the product modulo m efficiently, even if n is up to 2*10^5.

But I still need to handle the removal of elements efficiently.

Let me think about the sequence of removals.

If I process the string s from left to right, and simulate the removals, it's equivalent to dequeuing elements from either the front or the back.

So, perhaps I can use a deque to represent the array and remove elements from the left or right as specified.

But computing the product of the deque at each step would still be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need something smarter.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then maintain a list of removed elements.

At each step, I remove an element and divide the current product by that element, but again, division is problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can maintain a product of all elements except those removed, but I still need to handle the division modulo m.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that m is small, and a[i] are up to 10^4, so their product can be very large, but since we're taking modulo m, I can handle it.

But the main issue is the division.

I recall that if m is not prime, I can still compute the modular inverse of a number if it's coprime with m.

But in general, if a and m are not coprime, then a doesn't have an inverse modulo m.

So, I need a way to handle cases where a and m are not coprime.

Wait, maybe I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime factor separately, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results.

But this seems too complicated for this problem, and it might not lead to an efficient solution.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I process the removals in reverse order.

That is, start with an empty array, and add elements according to the reverse of the string s.

For example, if s is "LRRL", then reversing s gives "LRR L".

Wait, but s is a string of 'L' and 'R', so reversing it would mean adding elements to the opposite ends.

This might not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can process the array from both ends, keeping track of the product of the remaining elements.

But I'm still stuck on how to implement this efficiently.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4

4 6

3 1 4 2

LRRL

5 1

1 1 1 1 1

LLLLL

6 8

1 2 3 4 5 6

RLLLRR

1 10000

10000

R

Sample Output:

0 2 4 1

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 4 4 4

0

Looking at the first test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[3,1,4,2]

s=LRRL

Output:0 2 4 1

As explained in the problem statement.

Second test case:

n=5, m=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

s=LLLLL

Output:0 0 0 0 0

Since any product modulo 1 is 0.

Third test case:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s=RLLLRR

Output:0 0 0 4 4 4

Fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000

a=[10000]

s=R

Output:0

Because 10000 mod 10000 = 0

Looking at these, I notice that when m divides the product, the output is 0.

But I need a general way to compute the product modulo m at each step efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product of all elements, then for each removal, divide the product by the removed element, and take modulo m.

But again, division is problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, then for each step, divide by the product of the removed elements up to that point.

But again, division is an issue.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, and n is up to 2*10^5.

So, precomputing inverse elements might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, then for each removed element, compute its inverse modulo m (if it exists), and multiply the product by that inverse.

But as I said earlier, inverses only exist if the element is coprime with m.

If the element and m are not coprime, then the inverse doesn't exist.

So, this approach won't work in general.

I need another way.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, if m is not prime, division is not always possible.

Therefore, I need to find a way to compute the product without dividing.

Is there a way to represent the product of the remaining elements without dividing?

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining elements by multiplying and dividing by the removed elements in a way that avoids division by non-invertible elements.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: since m can be factored into its prime factors, perhaps I can factor the product and handle each prime factor separately.

But this would be too slow for large n.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I precompute the product of all elements modulo m.

Then, for each step, I remove an element and update the product by dividing by that element, but only if the element and m are coprime, i.e., gcd(a_i, m) = 1.

If gcd(a_i, m) != 1, then I need to handle it differently.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the product divided by the product of the removed elements that are coprime with m, and handle the non-coprime elements separately.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, and total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Another idea: since m is small, I can compute the product modulo m at each step, but I need to find a way to update the product efficiently when removing elements.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if m has small prime factors, I can handle each prime power separately and then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved for this problem.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, and total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can compute the product of all elements modulo m, and then for each removal, divide the product by the removed element, taking care to handle the division correctly.

But again, division is problematic when the element and m are not coprime.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element, but only if the removed element divides the current product.

But this is still unclear.

Let me think about how division works in modular arithmetic.

If I have p = product of all elements modulo m, and I want to remove an element a_i, then I need to compute p / a_i modulo m.

If a_i and m are coprime, then I can compute p * inv(a_i) modulo m, where inv(a_i) is the modular inverse of a_i modulo m.

If a_i and m are not coprime, then a_i doesn't have an inverse modulo m.

In this case, I need another way to handle the division.

Wait, perhaps I can factor m and a_i into their prime factors and handle each prime power separately.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that m can be factored into m = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pt^kt, where pi are distinct primes.

Then, for each prime power pi^ki, I can compute the product modulo pi^ki, and handle the removals accordingly.

Finally, I can combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to get the result modulo m.

But this would require factoring m and handling each prime power separately, which might be too slow for the constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, so m has at most a certain number of distinct prime factors.

For example, 10^4 is 10000, which has prime factors 2 and 5.

So, m can have up to, say, 5 distinct prime factors.

Wait, 10000 is 2^4 * 5^4, so only two distinct prime factors.

In general, m up to 10^4 will have a small number of distinct prime factors.

Maybe I can exploit this.

If m is a product of distinct primes, then I can compute the product modulo each prime and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine them.

But m can have repeated prime factors, like 2^4 in 10000, so I need to handle prime powers.

This is getting too complicated for the time constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, and total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, perhaps I can accept that my solution will have O(n) time per test case and proceed accordingly.

Given that, I need to implement the process as described, but in an efficient manner.

Wait, maybe I can simulate the process using a deque, removing elements from the left or right as specified, and at each step, computing the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

But computing the product of the remaining elements at each step would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Another idea: precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element, but handle the division carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removed element, divide the product by that element, but only if the element divides the product.

But this is still unclear.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, division by a number a is equivalent to multiplying by its inverse, provided that a and m are coprime.

If a and m are not coprime, then a doesn't have an inverse modulo m.

In this case, I need to handle it differently.

Perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removed element a_i:

- If a_i and m are coprime, divide the product by a_i by multiplying with the inverse of a_i modulo m.

- If a_i and m are not coprime, then I need to remove the common factors from the product and m accordingly.

But this seems too involved and error-prone.

Let me consider that m is small, and precompute some values related to m and the elements.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

I need to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m, at the beginning of each command.

Then, remove the specified element (leftmost or rightmost) based on the command.

I need to do this for each of the n commands in order.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, with total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

I need to find a way to compute the product modulo m efficiently at each step without redundant calculations.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element, but handle the division in a way that avoids computing inverses.

Let me consider that if I keep track of the product divided by the removed elements, I can compute the current product as the original product divided by the product of removed elements.

But again, division is problematic.

Another idea: since m is small, I can compute the product modulo m * k, where k is a multiple of m, but I'm not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in the problem, the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, so perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining subarray in some efficient way.

But I don't see a straightforward way to do that.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, determine which prefix and suffix products to multiply based on the sequence of removals.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me consider that the sequence of removals defines an order in which elements are removed.

So, if I know the order in which elements are removed, I can determine which elements are still in the array at each step.

Then, for each step, I can compute the product of the elements that have not been removed yet.

But this still seems too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

Wait, perhaps I can process the removals in reverse order.

That is, start from the end, when the array is empty, and add elements back according to the reverse of the string s.

Then, at each step, I can compute the product of the current array and output it at the end.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can collect all the removals and sort them in reverse order, but I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the results for all test cases together, so I can process each test case independently.

I need to find a way to make this efficient.

Another angle: since the operations are either removing from the left or the right, perhaps I can use two pointers to keep track of the current subarray and compute its product modulo m efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all possible subarrays where elements are removed from the left and/or right, but that seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the product of all elements, and I remove elements one by one from either end.

At each step, I need to divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But division is problematic when the removed element and m are not coprime.

Wait, perhaps I can handle the division by removing the common factors between the removed element and m.

For example, if a_i and m share a common factor d, then I can divide both the product and m by d, and adjust accordingly.

But this seems too involved and error-prone.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and a[i] are up to 10^4, so their product can be large, but since we're taking modulo m, it's manageable.

But the division issue remains.

I need to find a way to handle division in modular arithmetic when the divisor and m are not coprime.

This is a non-trivial problem.

Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that in the problem, the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, so the remaining array is always a subarray from some l to some r.

So, perhaps I can precompute the product of all possible subarrays and store them modulo m.

But with n up to 2*10^5, precomputing all subarrays is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix products and suffix products, and then for each step, based on which elements are removed, multiply the appropriate prefix and suffix products to get the product of the remaining array.

But I need to handle overlapping parts correctly, and it's getting complicated.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, so perhaps I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But implementing this efficiently within the time constraints seems too involved.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that in the problem, the operations are either removing from the left or the right, so perhaps I can process the removals in a way that allows me to update the product efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining elements by multiplying and dividing by the removed elements in a way that avoids division.

But I'm back to the same issue.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, if m is not prime, division is tricky, but perhaps I can work with exponents of the prime factors of m.

For example, factor m into its prime factors, and for each prime power, compute the exponents in the product and in the removed elements, then combine them to get the result modulo that prime power.

Finally, use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results for all prime powers.

But this seems too time-consuming, both in terms of implementation time and runtime.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, and total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

Another idea: precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element, but handle the division carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removed element a_i:

- If a_i and m are coprime, divide the product by a_i using the modular inverse.

- If a_i and m are not coprime, then set the product to 0, since m divides the product.

But this might not always be correct, because even if a_i and m share a common factor, it doesn't necessarily mean that m divides the product after removing a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the exponents of each prime factor in m for both the product and the removed elements.

Then, for each step, subtract the exponents of the removed element's prime factors from the product's prime factors, and compute the product modulo m accordingly.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m is small, and precompute some values related to m and the elements.

Suppose I have the product p = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[n-1] mod m.

Then, after removing an element a_i, the new product would be p / a_i mod m, if a_i and m are coprime.

If a_i and m are not coprime, then p / a_i mod m is not defined.

In this case, perhaps p / a_i is 0 modulo m/gcd(a_i, m).

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, and total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, perhaps I can accept that my solution will have O(n) time per test case and proceed accordingly.

Given that, I need to implement the process as described, but in an efficient manner.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the process using a deque, removing elements from the left or right as specified, and at each step, compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

But computing the product at each step would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Another idea: precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide the product by the removed element, but handle the division carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removed element a_i:

- If a_i and m are coprime, divide the product by a_i using the modular inverse.

- If a_i and m are not coprime, then set the product to 0, since m divides the product.

But this might not always be correct, because even if a_i and m share a common factor, it doesn't necessarily mean that m divides the product after removing a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the exponents of each prime factor in m for both the product and the removed elements.

Then, for each step, subtract the exponents of the removed element's prime factors from the product's prime factors, and compute the product modulo m accordingly.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m is small, and precompute some values related to m and the elements.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

I need to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m, at the beginning of each command.

Then, remove the specified element (leftmost or rightmost) based on the command.

I need to do this for each of the n commands in order.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, with total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

I need to find a way to compute the product modulo m efficiently at each step without redundant calculations.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide the product by the removed element, but only if the removed element divides the product.

But this is still unclear.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, division by a number a is equivalent to multiplying by its inverse, provided that a and m are coprime.

If a and m are not coprime, then a doesn't have an inverse modulo m.

In this case, I need to handle it differently.

Perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removed element a_i:

- If a_i and m are coprime, divide the product by a_i by multiplying with the inverse of a_i modulo m.

- If a_i and m are not coprime, then I need to remove the common factors from the product and m accordingly.

But this seems too involved and error-prone.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, which has at most a certain number of distinct prime factors.

For example, 10000 = 2^4 * 5^4, which has only two distinct prime factors.

In general, m up to 10^4 will have a small number of distinct prime factors.

Maybe I can factor m into its prime powers and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But implementing this efficiently within the time constraints seems too involved.
