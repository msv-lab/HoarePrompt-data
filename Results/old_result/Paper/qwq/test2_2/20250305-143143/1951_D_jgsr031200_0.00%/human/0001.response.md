Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Alice will always buy as many jewels as possible at each stall, given her current coins. So, the order of the stalls matters because she spends her coins progressively.

Let me think about some examples to get a better grasp.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, with n=7 coins and k=3 jewels, Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11 coins per jewel. Alice buys 3 jewels at the first stall (7//2=3 coins, spending 6 coins, leaving 1 coin), and since 1 coin is not enough to buy any jewel at the remaining stalls, she stops after buying 3 jewels. That matches k=3.

In the third test case, n=255 coins and k=8 jewels. Bob sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Alice buys 1 jewel at each stall, spending 128, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, then 1 coin, totaling 255 coins and buying exactly 8 jewels.

Now, in the second test case, n=6 coins and k=4 jewels. The output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

I need to find a general approach to determine if it's possible for any given n and k, and if so, provide a setup of at most 60 stalls with their prices.

Let me consider some basic cases.

Case 1: n = k

If n equals k, Alice needs to buy exactly k jewels. To achieve this, Bob can set up a single stall with price 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy k jewels, spending k coins, which matches n=k.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=7 and k=3, they set up multiple stalls with higher prices. So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

Case 2: n < k

If n is less than k, Alice cannot buy k jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. Each jewel costs at least 1 coin, so if n < k, it's impossible. So, in this case, the answer should be "NO".

Case 3: n > k

This is the general case where n > k, and I need to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

I need to think about how Alice's buying behavior affects the total number of jewels she buys.

Let's think about the minimal number of stalls required. Perhaps there's a way to minimize the number of stalls, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so I don't need to worry about minimizing the number of stalls, just ensuring that the total number of jewels bought is exactly k.

One approach could be to set up stalls with decreasing prices, so Alice buys more jewels at lower-priced stalls.

Wait, but in the first example, they used increasing prices from 2 to 11.

Wait, no, in the first example, they used prices from 2 to 11, which are increasing, but Alice buys all her jewels at the first stall because it's the cheapest one.

Wait, no, actually, Alice buys at each stall in order, regardless of the price.

Wait, no, re-reading the problem: "Alice buys greedily: she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall."

So, she buys at each stall in sequence, spending as many jewels as possible at each stall based on her remaining coins.

So, in the first example, with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, Alice buys 3 jewels at the first stall (7//2=3 jewels, spending 6 coins, left with 1 coin), which is not enough to buy any jewels at the remaining stalls, so she stops with 3 jewels.

In the third example, with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, she buys 1 jewel at each stall, spending 128, then 64, then 32, etc., until she has spent all 255 coins and bought 8 jewels.

So, the key is to set up stalls in such a way that the total number of jewels bought is exactly k.

I need to find a way to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

I need to think about how to distribute the prices to control the number of jewels Alice buys.

One idea is to set up stalls with prices that force Alice to buy a specific number of jewels at each stall.

For example, if I set up a stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n/p) jewels at that stall, spending floor(n/p)*p coins, and then proceed to the next stall with the remaining coins.

I need to choose p such that the total number of jewels bought across all stalls is exactly k.

This seems like a problem that can be approached by trying to maximize or minimize the number of jewels bought, but I need an exact count.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set up a single stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n/p) jewels.

To get exactly k jewels, I need floor(n/p) = k.

But this might not always be possible because p must be an integer between 1 and 10^18.

Wait, but if I set p = floor(n/k), then floor(n/p) = k, provided that p divides n appropriately.

Wait, but floor(n/p) = k implies that k <= n/p < k+1, which means n/(k+1) < p <= n/k.

So, p needs to be in the range (n/(k+1), n/k].

If n is not divisible by k+1, then n/(k+1) is not an integer, but p must be an integer.

So, if there exists an integer p in (n/(k+1), n/k], then setting a single stall with that p will make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But, this might not always be possible because p needs to be an integer within the specified range.

For example, in the first test case, n=7, k=3.

n/k = 7/3 â‰ˆ 2.333, n/(k+1) = 7/4 = 1.75.

So, p needs to be in (1.75, 2.333]. The only integer p in this range is p=2.

Indeed, with p=2, floor(7/2)=3 jewels, which matches k=3.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4.

n/k = 6/4 = 1.5, n/(k+1)=6/5=1.2.

So, p needs to be in (1.2, 1.5]. The only integer p in this range is p=1.

But with p=1, floor(6/1)=6 jewels, which is more than k=4. So, it's not possible with a single stall.

Therefore, sometimes a single stall is not enough.

So, perhaps I need to set up multiple stalls to control the number of jewels bought at each stall.

Let me think recursively.

Suppose I set up one stall with price p1, Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels, spends floor(n/p1)*p1 coins, and proceeds with the remaining coins.

Then, at the second stall with price p2, she buys floor(remaining/p2) jewels, and so on.

I need the sum of jewels bought at each stall to be exactly k.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of the total number of jewels bought being equal to k.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so I don't need to minimize the number of stalls, just ensure that with some number of stalls <=60, Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy at least k jewels, and then adjust the setup to make it exactly k.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels by controlling the prices and the number of stalls.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set up s stalls, with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Then, the total jewels bought is sum over i=1 to s of floor(ni/pi), where ni is the remaining coins before stall i.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider specific strategies for setting up the stalls.

One strategy could be to set up stalls with decreasing prices, so that Alice buys more jewels at lower-priced stalls.

Alternatively, setting up stalls with increasing prices might limit the number of jewels bought at each stall.

Looking back at the sample inputs, in the first test case, they used increasing prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought all her jewels at the first stall.

In the third test case, they used decreasing prices from 128 down to 1, and Alice bought one jewel at each stall.

So, the order of stalls affects the number of jewels bought.

Wait, but the problem states that Alice goes to stall 1, then stall 2, and so on, in order.

So, the order of the stalls matters.

Perhaps I can set up stalls with prices that force Alice to buy a specific number of jewels at each stall.

For example, if I set up a stall with a high price, Alice might buy only one jewel there, and then proceed to the next stall.

Alternatively, with a lower price, she might buy multiple jewels at that stall and not have enough coins left for subsequent stalls.

So, by carefully choosing the prices, I can control how many jewels Alice buys at each stall.

I need to find a setup where the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Let me consider a binary representation approach.

Suppose I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2.

For example, in the third test case, they used prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which are powers of 2.

With these prices, Alice buys one jewel at each stall, since each price is greater than the sum of all lower prices.

Wait, in that case, since each price is higher than the sum of all lower prices, Alice can only buy one jewel at each stall, as the remaining coins after buying one jewel are less than the price of the next stall.

Wait, no, in the third test case, the prices are 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Alice starts with 255 coins.

At the first stall (128), she buys 1 jewel, spends 128 coins, left with 127 coins.

At the second stall (64), she buys 1 jewel, spends 64 coins, left with 63 coins.

At the third stall (32), buys 1 jewel, spends 32 coins, left with 31 coins.

And so on, until she buys 1 jewel at each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This works because each price is higher than the sum of all lower prices, so she can only buy one jewel at each stall.

So, if I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, up to n, Alice will buy one jewel at each stall, as long as her remaining coins are greater than or equal to the price of the stall.

This seems like a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels by setting up k stalls with distinct powers of 2, up to n.

But, in the first test case, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought 3 jewels.

So, it's not necessary to use powers of 2; other price setups can also achieve the desired k jewels.

But using powers of 2 seems like a straightforward way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, provided that n is at least the sum of the first k powers of 2.

Wait, in the third test case, n=255, which is exactly the sum of 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255.

So, in that case, Alice buys one jewel at each of the 8 stalls, spending all her coins.

But what if n is larger than the sum of the first k powers of 2?

For example, if n=256 and k=8, then setting up stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 would make Alice buy one jewel at each stall, spending 255 coins, and leaving her with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy another jewel at any stall.

So, she still buys exactly 8 jewels.

Similarly, if n=257 and k=8, the same setup would still make her buy exactly 8 jewels, as the remaining 2 coins are not enough to buy another jewel at any stall.

So, using powers of 2 seems like a reliable way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, as long as n is at least the sum of the first k powers of 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, which seems excessive.

Alternatively, could I have used fewer stalls?

For example, with n=7 and k=3, if I set up a single stall with p=2, Alice buys 3 jewels, spending 6 coins, left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

So, in this case, a single stall with p=2 achieves the goal.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=255 and k=8, using 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 achieves the goal.

So, perhaps in general, if I can find a price p such that floor(n/p)=k, then setting a single stall with that p would suffice.

But, as seen in the second test case, n=6 and k=4, there is no such p that floor(6/p)=4.

Because p needs to be in (6/5, 6/4] = (1.2, 1.5], and the only integer p in that range is p=1.

But floor(6/1)=6, which is greater than 4, so it's not possible with a single stall.

In such cases, perhaps setting up multiple stalls can help.

Let me try to set up multiple stalls for n=6 and k=4.

Suppose I set up two stalls with prices p1 and p2.

At the first stall, Alice buys floor(6/p1) jewels, spends floor(6/p1)*p1 coins, then proceeds to the second stall with the remaining coins.

At the second stall, she buys floor(remaining/p2) jewels.

I need the sum of jewels bought at both stalls to be exactly 4.

Let me try p1=2 and p2=1.

At stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not enough.

Try p1=1 and p2=2.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Still not good.

Try p1=1.5 and p2=1.

But p must be integers, so p1=1 and p2=1.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, still more than 4.

Try p1=2 and p2=3.

At stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

Still not good.

Try p1=3 and p2=2.

At stall 1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 2, less than 4.

No good.

Try p1=1 and p2=2.

Same as before: 6 jewels.

Try p1=1 and p2=3.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, still more than 4.

Try p1=2 and p2=4.

At stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

Still not good.

Try p1=1 and p2=4.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1 and p2=5.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, still more than 4.

This is getting frustrating. It seems like no matter how I set up two stalls, I can't get exactly 4 jewels.

What if I set up three stalls?

Let's try p1=1, p2=2, p3=3.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, still more than 4.

Try p1=2, p2=3, p3=4.

At stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2=3, p3=5.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, more than 4.

Still not good.

Wait, maybe I need to set up stalls with higher prices so that Alice buys fewer jewels at each stall.

Try p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

At stall 1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 2, less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=2, p2=4, p3=6.

At stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

Still not good.

Try p1=1, p2=2, p3=6.

At stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 2: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

At stall 3: 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 6, more than 4.

Not good.

It seems like no matter how I set up the stalls, I can't make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=6 coins and k=4 jewels.

Therefore, it's impossible, which matches the sample output of "NO" for that test case.

So, in some cases, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, even with multiple stalls.

Now, I need a general approach to determine when it's possible and how to set up the stalls accordingly.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal number of jewels: If Bob sets up a single stall with p=1, Alice will buy floor(n/1)=n jewels.

Maximal number of jewels: If Bob sets up stalls with p increasing, such that Alice buys only one jewel at each stall, up to k stalls.

But, in practice, the maximal number of jewels Alice can buy is limited by the number of stalls and the prices set.

Given that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, the maximal k is 60, assuming Alice has at least p coins for each stall, where p is the price at each stall.

Wait, but in the problem, k can be up to 10^18, which is much larger than 60. But Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls.

So, I need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels with at most 60 stalls.

I need to find a way to control the number of jewels bought at each stall to sum up to k.

This seems tricky because k can be up to 10^18, but with only 60 stalls, each stall can contribute up to floor(n/p) jewels.

I need to find a way to partition k into at most 60 parts, where each part is the number of jewels bought at a stall, and the sum is exactly k.

But, the number of jewels bought at each stall depends on the price set and the remaining coins Alice has when she reaches that stall.

This seems too interdependent to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to make Alice buy a certain number of jewels at each stall, regardless of the remaining coins.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me try to model this mathematically.

Let s be the number of stalls, with s <= 60.

Let p1, p2, ..., ps be the prices set for each stall.

Let c0 = n be the initial number of coins.

After stall i, the remaining coins ci+1 = ci - (floor(ci/pi) * pi)

The number of jewels bought at stall i is floor(ci/pi)

So, the total number of jewels bought is sum from i=1 to s of floor(ci/pi)

This is a recursive definition because ci depends on ci-1.

This seems too complicated to solve directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to set the prices such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Let me consider the case where Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum of floor(ci/pi) for i from 1 to s equals k, where ci is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy with s stalls.

Minimal k: s stalls with p=1, Alice buys n jewels at the first stall, and 0 at the remaining stalls, so minimal k is 1 if n >=1, else 0.

Wait, no, if p=1 for all stalls, Alice can buy up to n jewels, but she might buy fewer if n is distributed across multiple stalls.

Wait, no, if p=1 for all stalls, Alice will buy as many jewels as possible at the first stall, spending n coins and buying n jewels, and not proceeding to other stalls.

So, in this case, k=n.

If I set p1=1, p2=2, ..., ps=s, Alice will buy floor(n/p1) at the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) at the second stall, and so on.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy a certain number of jewels.

If I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, I need to ensure that the sum of floor(ci/pi) equals k.

This seems too vague to handle directly.

Perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of the total coins spent.

Alice spends sum over i of (floor(ci/pi) * pi)

But I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is k.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the number of stalls s, and try to find prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(ci/pi) equals k.

But again, this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that with s stalls, I can control the number of jewels bought at each stall, but it's constrained by the remaining coins.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that floor(n/p) = k when p is in (n/(k+1), n/k].

So, for a single stall, if p is in (n/(k+1), n/k], then floor(n/p) = k.

But in our case, k can be up to 10^18, and s can be up to 60.

Perhaps I can divide k into s parts, k1 + k2 + ... + ks = k, and set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that floor(ci/pi) = ki for each i.

But ci depends on the previous stalls, so it's not independent.

This seems too recursive.

Let me think about the case where s=2.

I need to set p1 and p2 such that floor(n/p1) + floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) = k.

This is still too complex.

Maybe I need to consider that floor(n/p1) <= k, and then adjust p2 based on the remaining coins.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for s=2, floor(n/p1) <= k, and floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) <= k - floor(n/p1)

But I need the sum to be exactly k.

This is getting too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy up to s*k jewels, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy with s stalls.

Minimal k: s=1, floor(n/p1)=k, which requires p1 in (n/(k+1), n/k]

If s=2, perhaps I can set p1 such that floor(n/p1)=k1, and p2 such that floor((n - k1*p1)/p2)=k2, with k1 + k2 =k.

But again, this seems too recursive.

Maybe I need to find a way to partition k into s parts, and set the prices accordingly.

But, given the dependencies between the stalls, this seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy exactly k jewels by setting the prices appropriately.

Given that s can be up to 60, and k can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to set up the stalls.

Let me consider the approach of using binary representation.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices that are powers of 2, up to n.

Then, Alice will buy one jewel at each stall, as long as her remaining coins are greater than or equal to the price of the stall.

In the third test case, this worked perfectly.

So, perhaps in general, if I set up s stalls with prices that are distinct powers of 2, up to n, Alice will buy one jewel at each stall, provided that n is at least the sum of the first s powers of 2.

But in the first test case, n=7 and k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 1+2+4=7, which matches n=7 and k=3.

In this case, setting up 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1 would make Alice buy one jewel at each stall, spending 4, then 2, then 1 coins, totaling 7 coins and buying 3 jewels.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=255 and k=8, using prices from 128 down to 1 (which are 8 powers of 2), Alice buys one at each stall, spending 255 coins and buying 8 jewels.

So, this seems to work when n is equal to the sum of the first k powers of 2.

But what if n is larger than the sum of the first k powers of 2?

For example, n=256 and k=8.

Then, setting up 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 would make Alice buy one at each stall, spending 255 coins, and left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy another jewel at any stall.

So, she buys exactly 8 jewels.

Similarly, if n=257 and k=8, she would still buy 8 jewels, spending 255 coins and left with 2 coins, which is still not enough to buy another jewel at any stall.

So, this approach seems to work for n >= sum of first k powers of 2.

But what if n is less than the sum of first k powers of 2?

For example, n=7 and k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which matches n=7.

Another example: n=6 and k=3.

Sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 1+2+4=7, which is greater than n=6.

In this case, if I set up 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1.

At stall 1 (4): floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 2 coins.

At stall 2 (2): floor(2/2)=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

At stall 3 (1): 0 coins, cannot buy any jewels.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=3.

So, in this case, using powers of 2 doesn't allow me to make Alice buy exactly k=3 jewels.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the prices in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to set up stalls with prices that are not strictly powers of 2.

In the first test case, they used prices from 2 to 11, which are not powers of 2, to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels.

So, perhaps using powers of 2 works only when n is equal to the sum of the first k powers of 2, or n is at least the sum and the excess coins don't allow Alice to buy additional jewels.

But in the case where n is less than the sum of the first k powers of 2, it fails.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if n < sum of first k powers of 2, then it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels using powers of 2.

In the earlier example, n=6 and k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which is greater than n=6, and indeed, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7 and k=3, sum is 7, and it's possible.

But in the second test case, n=6 and k=4, which seems impossible.

Wait, but sum of first 4 powers of 2 is 1+2+4+8=15, which is greater than n=6, and it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

So, perhaps the condition is that if n is less than the sum of the first k powers of 2, then it's impossible.

But in the first test case, n=7 equals the sum of the first 3 powers of 2, which is possible.

Wait, but in the first test case, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, which is more than just the first 3 powers of 2.

So, perhaps there are other ways to make it work even when n is less than the sum of the first k powers of 2, by using different price setups.

But in that specific case, n=7 and k=3, using a single stall with p=2 makes Alice buy 3 jewels, which works.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the desired k jewels.

So, perhaps the powers of 2 approach is just one way, but not the only way.

So, perhaps I need to consider multiple approaches.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I set up s=1 stall with p = floor(n/k).

Then, Alice buys floor(n/p) jewels.

But, floor(n/floor(n/k)) could be k or k+1, depending on n and k.

Wait, let's see.

Let p = floor(n/k)

Then, floor(n/p) is floor(n / floor(n/k))

Now, floor(n/k) <= n/k, so n / floor(n/k) >= k.

So, floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k.

But it could be k or k+1, depending on n and k.

For example, n=7, k=3.

floor(7/3)=2.

Then, floor(7/2)=3, which is more than k=3.

Wait, but in this case, p=2, floor(7/2)=3, which is more than k=3.

So, not exactly k.

Another example: n=6, k=4.

floor(6/4)=1.

floor(6/1)=6, which is more than k=4.

Not good.

Wait, perhaps I need to set p slightly higher than floor(n/k).

In the first example, n=7, k=3.

floor(n/k)=2.

Set p=2, floor(7/2)=3, which is more than k.

Set p=3, floor(7/3)=2, which is less than k.

Set p=2.5, but p must be integer.

So, p=3: floor(7/3)=2, which is less than k=3.

p=2: floor(7/2)=3, which is more than k=3.

So, with a single stall, I can't get exactly k=3.

Similarly, in n=6 and k=4.

p=1: floor(6/1)=6 >4

p=2: floor(6/2)=3 <4

p=1.5: not integer.

So, with a single stall, it's impossible to get exactly k=4.

Hence, I need to set up multiple stalls.

But, as I saw earlier, with multiple stalls, it's still impossible in this case.

So, perhaps in some cases, it's impossible, and in some cases, it's possible.

So, I need to find a general way to determine when it's possible and provide a setup accordingly.

Let me think about the condition for it being possible.

I need to make sure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Given that Alice buys jewels greedily at each stall, spending as many coins as possible, the number of jewels bought at each stall depends on the price set and the remaining coins.

This seems too interdependent to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy exactly k jewels by setting the prices appropriately.

Given that s can be up to 60, and k can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to set up the stalls.

Let me consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy up to s jewels, each at a different stall, by setting high prices.

For example, set p1, p2, ..., ps such that p1 > n, p2 > n, ..., ps > n.

Then, Alice buys 0 jewels at each stall, which is not helpful.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, set p1 = n/k, p2 = n/k, ..., ps = n/k.

But, this might not be precise.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a high price down to 1.

In the first test case, they used increasing prices from 2 to 11, but Alice bought all her jewels at the first stall.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up stalls with prices in decreasing order.

Wait, but the problem states that Alice goes to stall 1, then stall 2, and so on, in order.

So, the order of the stalls matters.

If I set up stalls with decreasing prices, Alice might buy more jewels at the first stall.

If I set up stalls with increasing prices, she might buy fewer jewels at each stall.

Wait, in the first test case, with increasing prices from 2 to 11, she buys all her jewels at the first stall.

In the third test case, with decreasing prices from 128 down to 1, she buys one at each stall.

So, perhaps setting up stalls with decreasing prices is a way to make Alice buy one jewel at each stall.

Let me try this approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 > p2 > ... > ps.

Then, Alice buys one jewel at each stall, as long as her remaining coins are greater than or equal to the price of the stall.

In the third test case, with p1=128, p2=64, ..., ps=1, Alice buys one at each stall, as long as she has enough coins.

This works when n is equal to the sum of the first k prices.

In the first test case, n=7 and k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which matches.

Similarly, if I set up 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1, for n=7, Alice buys 1 at each, totaling 3 jewels.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for n=6 and k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which is greater than n=6, but in reality, with prices 4,2,1, Alice buys 1 at the first stall (spending 4, left with 2), then 1 at the second stall (spending 2, left with 0), and 0 at the third stall, totaling 2 jewels, which is less than k=3.

So, in this case, it's not possible to make Alice buy exactly k=3 jewels.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that n must be at least the sum of the first k prices, but in the third test case, n=255 equals the sum of the first 8 powers of 2.

In the first test case, n=7 equals the sum of the first 3 powers of 2.

In the second test case, n=6 is less than the sum of the first 4 powers of 2 (1+2+4+8=15), hence impossible.

So, perhaps the general condition is that n must be at least the sum of the first k prices.

If I set up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 > p2 > ... > pk, and sum p1 to pk is less than or equal to n, then Alice will buy one at each stall, totaling k jewels.

But in the earlier example with n=6, k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which is greater than n=6, but Alice buys only 2 jewels.

So, this approach doesn't hold in that case.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up stalls with prices that are adjusted based on n and k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 = ceil(n/k).

Then, Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels at the first stall.

Since p1 = ceil(n/k), floor(n/p1) is floor(n / ceil(n/k)).

Now, ceil(n/k) is either n/k (if k divides n) or n/k + 1/k.

So, floor(n / ceil(n/k)) is either k or k-1.

Wait, let's take an example.

n=7, k=3.

ceil(7/3)=3.

floor(7/3)=2.

So, at the first stall, Alice buys 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

Then, at the second stall, with p2=ceil((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/ (k - floor(n/p1))) = ceil((7-6)/1)=1.

Set p2=1.

At the second stall, floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 2 + 1 =3.

This works.

Another example: n=6, k=4.

p1=ceil(6/4)=2.

floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Then, k - floor(n/p1)=1.

Set p2=ceil(0/1)=0, which is invalid.

So, this approach fails here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the prices differently.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me consider that if n >= k, and n >= sum of the first k prices, then it's possible.

But earlier, in n=6, k=3, sum of first 3 powers of 2 is 7, which is greater than n=6, and it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly k=3 jewels.

Wait, but in that case, with prices 4,2,1, Alice buys 2 jewels.

So, perhaps it's only possible when n is at least the sum of the first k prices, and n - sum is less than p_k.

Wait, in the third test case, n=255, sum of first 8 powers of 2 is 255, n - sum=0, which is less than p8=1.

So, it works.

In the first test case
