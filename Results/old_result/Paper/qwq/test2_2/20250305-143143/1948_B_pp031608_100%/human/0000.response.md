Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any number that is two digits or more, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original number. This can be done any number of times.

So, the question is about transforming the array into a sorted sequence by splitting numbers into their digits as needed.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - If I split 67: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   - This is sorted in non-decreasing order.

   - So, the answer is YES.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - Possible splits:

     - Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

     - Split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

     - Split 5: it's less than 10, can't split.

     - This array is not sorted: 1, 2, 2, 8, 5 (8 > 5).

     - Trying different splits:

       - Split 28 first: [12, 2, 8, 5]

       - Split 12: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

       - Still, 2 > 1, but overall not sorted.

     - It seems no matter how I split, I can't get a sorted array.

     - So, the answer is NO.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

   - So, the answer is YES.

From these examples, it seems that splitting numbers can help rearrange the digits to achieve a sorted array, but there are limitations based on the values and positions.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    n = int(input())

    for _ in range(n):

        m = int(input())

        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

        ans = True

        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

                nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

                if nums != sorted(nums):

                    ans = False

                    break

                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

```

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem.

Let's analyze the program step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, `n`.

2. For each test case:

   a. Reads the size of the array, `m`.

   b. Reads the array, `arr`.

   c. Initializes `ans` to `True`.

   d. Iterates from the second last element to the first element (i.e., from `m-1` to `1`):

      i. Checks if the current element is less than the previous element.

      ii. If so, it splits the previous element into its digits and creates a list `nums` consisting of those digits followed by the current element.

      iii. Checks if `nums` is not equal to its sorted version. If so, sets `ans` to `False` and breaks the loop.

      iv. Otherwise, sets the previous element to the first digit of the split element.

   e. Prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

This approach seems to be checking for local sortedness after potential splits, but I'm not entirely sure if it covers all scenarios.

Let me think about how to approach this problem correctly.

First, the problem allows splitting any number >= 10 into its digits any number of times. The goal is to determine if, after any sequence of such splits, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

One way to think about this is to consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each number can be either kept as is (if < 10) or split into digits (if >= 10). The question then becomes whether the sequence of individual digits, after all possible splits, can be arranged in non-decreasing order.

However, since the splits are restricted to replacing a number with its digits in the same order, we can't rearrange the digits beyond their original positions within the array.

Wait, but actually, the splits insert the digits in the same order they appear in the number. So, the relative order of digits from the same number is preserved.

Given that, the problem seems similar to checking if a sequence can be sorted by breaking down certain elements into their components, with the components maintaining their relative order.

To solve this, perhaps we can consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each number is either a single digit or a sequence of digits to be inserted in place.

An idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far. If we encounter a number that is less than the maximum so far, we need to check if splitting it into digits can resolve the issue.

But the provided program seems to be attempting something similar, but I need to verify its logic.

Looking back at the program:

- It iterates from the end to the beginning.

- For each element, if it's less than the previous element, it splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the combined list of those digits and the current element is sorted.

- If not, it sets `ans` to `False`.

- Otherwise, it replaces the previous element with the first digit of the split element and continues.

This seems to be checking a local condition at each step, but I'm not sure if it guarantees the entire array can be sorted.

Let me consider some test cases.

Test case 1:

Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- Start from the end:

  - i=3: arr[3]=67, arr[2]=45; 67 > 45, no issue.

  - i=2: arr[2]=45, arr[1]=3; 45 > 3, need to split arr[1]=3 (which is <10, can't split). So, it should set ans=False.

But according to the example, it's possible to split 12 into [1,2], making the array [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

But according to the program's logic, it starts from the end and checks arr[i] < arr[i-1]. In this case, arr[2]=45 > arr[1]=3, but since arr[1]=3 <10, can't split. So, it seems the program would incorrectly set ans=False, but the correct answer is YES.

This suggests a problem with the program's logic.

Wait, maybe I misread the program.

Looking again:

- It iterates from m-1 to 0:

  - If arr[i] < arr[i-1]:

    - Split arr[i-1] into digits and append arr[i] to get nums.

    - Check if nums is sorted.

    - If not, set ans=False.

    - If yes, set arr[i-1] to the first digit of the split element.

In the above example:

- i=2: arr[2]=45 > arr[1]=3, so split arr[1]=3 (can't split since <10), but the program only splits arr[i-1] if it's >=10.

Wait, arr[i-1] is arr[1]=3, which is <10, so it doesn't split it. So, it would set ans=False.

But in reality, we need to split arr[0]=12 to [1,2], then the array becomes [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, the program doesn't consider splitting elements before the pair that's out of order.

Hence, the program's logic is flawed because it only considers splitting the element before the one that's out of order, but in some cases, like this one, you need to split earlier elements to fix the order.

Another test case:

Input: [12, 28, 5]

- According to the program:

  - i=2: arr[2]=5 < arr[1]=28

    - Split arr[1]=28 into [2,8], plus arr[2]=5, so nums=[2,8,5]

    - Check if [2,8,5] is sorted: it's not, since 8 > 5

    - Set ans=False

  - So, program outputs NO, which matches the correct answer.

But in the first test case, it incorrectly outputs NO while it should output YES.

So, the program is not correct.

Let me think about a better approach.

One possible correct approach is to consider the array as a sequence of digits, where each number is either a single digit or a sequence of digits (if >=10), and we need to check if this sequence can be sorted.

To do this, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far. If we encounter a digit that is less than the maximum, we need to check if splitting the previous number can resolve the issue.

However, this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to realize that splitting a number into its digits effectively allows us to treat it as if it were those digits in sequence. So, we can think of the array as being composed of digits, and we need to check if these digits can be arranged in non-decreasing order without rearranging their positions beyond the splits.

Wait, but splits are restricted to replacing a number with its digits in the same order.

This seems similar to merging or inserting elements.

Maybe a better way is to consider all possible splits and see if any of those configurations result in a sorted array.

But that could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 50 and each number up to 99, which might lead to a large number of possible splits.

However, since n is small (n <= 50), an exponential approach might still be feasible, but probably not necessary.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum value that the previous position can have after any possible splits.

I start from the beginning.

Initialize min_prev to -infinity.

For each element:

- If the element is less than min_prev, it's impossible.

- Else, split the element into its digits.

- For each digit, ensure that it's >= min_prev.

- Update min_prev to the last digit of the current element.

Wait, perhaps that can work.

Let's try with the first test case: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- Initialize min_prev = -inf

- First element: 12

  - Digits: [1,2]

  - Ensure 1 >= -inf, 2 >=1

  - Update min_prev to 2

- Second element: 3

  - Digits: [3]

  - Ensure 3 >=2

  - Update min_prev to 3

- Third element: 45

  - Digits: [4,5]

  - Ensure 4 >=3, 5>=4

  - Update min_prev to 5

- Fourth element: 67

  - Digits: [6,7]

  - Ensure 6 >=5, 7>=6

  - Update min_prev to 7

- The array can be sorted.

In the second test case: [12, 28, 5]

- Initialize min_prev = -inf

- First element: 12

  - Digits: [1,2]

  - Ensure 1 >= -inf, 2>=1

  - Update min_prev to 2

- Second element: 28

  - Digits: [2,8]

  - Ensure 2 >=2, 8>=2

  - Update min_prev to 8

- Third element: 5

  - Digits: [5]

  - Ensure 5 >=8: False

- Can't be sorted.

In the third test case: [0,0]

- Initialize min_prev = -inf

- First element: 0

  - Digits: [0]

  - Ensure 0 >= -inf

  - Update min_prev to 0

- Second element: 0

  - Digits: [0]

  - Ensure 0 >=0

  - Update min_prev to 0

- Can be sorted.

This seems to work.

So, the correct approach is to iterate through the array, split each number into its digits, and ensure that each digit is greater than or equal to the minimum value required so far.

If at any point a digit is less than the minimum required, it's impossible.

Otherwise, update the minimum required to the last digit of the current element.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it doesn't implement this logic.

Instead, it starts from the end and checks if splitting the previous element can fix local descending orders.

This approach has flaws, as seen in the first test case, where it incorrectly determines that the array can't be sorted.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
