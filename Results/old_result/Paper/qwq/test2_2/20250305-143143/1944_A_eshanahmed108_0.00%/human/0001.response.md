Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? Each pair of islands has a direct connection.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. But Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. So, Dominater wants to make it so that Everule can access as few islands as possible.

My task is to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can still visit, given that Dominater destroys bridges in the best possible way to minimize that number.

First, I need to understand what "destroying bridges optimally" means in this context. Since Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, the optimal strategy would be to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1.

In graph terms, I need to make the component containing island 1 as small as possible by removing at most k edges.

Wait, but in this problem, the graph is initially complete, meaning island 1 is directly connected to all other islands via bridges. So, if Dominater destroys some bridges connected to island 1, he can isolate island 1 from some other islands.

Let me think about it step by step.

Initially, island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands. If Dominater destroys some of these bridges, he can make some islands unreachable from island 1.

But it's not just about destroying bridges connected to island 1. Dominater could also destroy bridges between other islands, but that might not necessarily isolate island 1 from others.

Wait, but in a complete graph, even if Dominater destroys bridges between other islands, as long as there's a path through those islands to reach island 1, Everule can still reach them.

So, the most effective way for Dominater to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach is to directly disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying the bridges directly connected to island 1.

In other words, the bridges that directly connect island 1 to other islands are the most critical. If Dominater destroys those, he可以直接隔离那些岛屿，使Everule无法直接到达它们。

所以，假设Dominater可以破坏k座桥，他应该优先破坏那些连接岛1和其他岛的桥，以尽可能多地隔离其他岛。

具体来说，岛1最初有n-1条桥连接到其他n-1个岛。如果Dominater破坏了k条桥，那么岛1还将剩下n-1-k条桥连接到其他岛。

但是，即使一些桥被破坏，其他岛之间仍然可能通过其他的桥相连，从而间接地与岛1相连。

不过，在完全图中，即使岛1与某些岛的直接桥被破坏，只要那些岛之间还有桥相连，它们可能仍然通过其他岛与岛1相连。

但是，如果Dominater破坏足够的桥，他可以创建一些分离的组件，其中一些组件不包含岛1。

为了最小化Everule可以访问的岛的数量，Dominater需要最大化隔离的岛的数量，也就是说，他需要尝试将岛1与尽可能多的其他岛分离。

让我考虑一下具体的策略。

假设n=4，k=1。

根据问题的示例，当n=4，k=1时，输出是4，意味着即使破坏了一座桥，Everule仍然可以访问所有岛。

这是因为，在完全图中，即使破坏了一座桥，仍然存在替代路径。

具体来说，假设岛1与岛2、岛3、岛4都有直接桥。

如果Dominater破坏了岛1与岛2之间的桥，Everule仍然可以通过岛1->岛3->岛2到达岛2。

因此，即使破坏了一座桥，所有岛仍然连通。

另一方面，如果n=2，k=1，那么破坏唯一的桥后，Everule只能停留在岛1。

所以，似乎有一个阈值，当破坏的桥数量达到一定程度时，岛1与其它岛的连接会被完全切断。

让我试着找出这个阈值。

在完全图中，岛1与其它n-1个岛各有直接桥。

如果Dominater破坏了n-1条桥，那么岛1与所有其它岛的直接连接都被切断。

但是，其它岛之间仍然互相连接，所以它们之间仍然有路径，只是没有路径连接到岛1。

因此，岛1成为一个孤立的岛，Everule只能访问岛1。

所以，当k >= n-1时，Dominater可以切断岛1与所有其它岛的连接，Everule只能访问岛1。

而当k < n-1时，岛1仍然与至少一些其它岛相连，且由于图是完全连通的，通过那些未被破坏的桥，Everule可以访问到所有未被隔离的岛。

但是，在完全图中，即使岛1与某些岛的直接桥被破坏，只要那些岛之间还有桥相连，它们仍然可以通过其它路径到达岛1。

 wait, actually, in a complete graph, even if you remove some edges connected to island 1, the other islands are still fully connected among themselves, so there will always be a path from any island to island 1 through some other islands, unless k is large enough to disconnect island 1 completely.

Wait, but that seems contradictory to the example given.

In the third test case, n=4, k=1, the output is 4, meaning that Everule can still visit all islands despite one bridge being destroyed.

But according to my earlier thought, if k >= n-1, which for n=4 is k>=3, Dominater can isolate island 1.

But in the example, k=1, which is less than n-1=3, so island 1 is still connected to at least some other islands, and through them, to all islands.

So, in this case, even after destroying one bridge, the graph remains connected, and Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10.

For n=5, the total number of bridges is 10 (5*4/2=10).

So, k=10 means Dominater can destroy all bridges.

Therefore, island 1 is completely isolated, and Everule can only visit island 1.

In another test case, n=5, k=3.

Total bridges are 10, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges.

Even after destroying 3 bridges, there are still 7 bridges left, which should keep the graph connected, meaning Everule can visit all 5 islands.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 5, which matches this.

In the last test case, n=4, k=4.

Total bridges are 6 (4*3/2=6).

Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

After destroying 4 bridges, there are 2 bridges left.

Is it possible to disconnect island 1 completely by destroying 4 bridges?

Let's see: island 1 is connected to 3 other islands, so to completely isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all 3 bridges connected to island 1.

If Dominater destroys 3 bridges connected to island 1, island 1 is isolated.

If Dominater destroys 4 bridges, he can destroy the 3 bridges connected to island 1 and one more bridge.

So, island 1 is still isolated, and the other islands may or may not be connected among themselves.

But since the problem asks for the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, which is island 1 itself in this case.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, from these observations, it seems that:

- If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can only visit island 1.

- If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still visit all islands.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4, k=1, which is less than n-1=3, and Everule can visit all 4 islands.

In the second test case, n=2, k=1, which is equal to n-1=1, and Everule can only visit island 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier point, if k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

In the second test case, n=2, k=1, which is k >= n-1=1, so output is 1.

In the first test case, n=2, k=0, which is k < n-1=1, so Everule can visit both islands, which is 2.

So, it seems my earlier hypothesis is correct.

Hence, the general rule is:

- If k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

- If k < n-1, Everule can visit all n islands.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is k >= n-1=4, but n-1=4 < k=10, but total bridges are 10, and destroying 10 bridges isolates island 1.

But according to my rule, if k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

But in this case, k=10 >= n-1=4, so output is 1, which matches.

Another test case, n=5, k=3, which is k < n-1=4, so Everule can visit all 5 islands.

Wait, but n-1 for n=5 is 4, and k=3 < 4, so output should be 5, which matches.

Similarly, n=4, k=4, which is k >= n-1=3, so output is 1, which matches.

Wait, but n=4, k=1, which is k < n-1=3, so output is 4.

n=2, k=0, which is k < n-1=1, so output is 2.

n=2, k=1, which is k >= n-1=1, so output is 1.

So, it seems consistent.

Hence, the rule is:

- If k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

- If k < n-1, Everule can visit all n islands.

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me think about a larger n.

Suppose n=100, k=99.

According to the rule, if k >= n-1=99, Everule can only visit island 1.

Indeed, Dominater can destroy all 99 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it completely.

Similarly, if k=98 < 99, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can still visit all islands.

Seems correct.

Another way to think about it is:

The number of bridges connected to island 1 is n-1.

If Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, island 1 is isolated.

If he destroys fewer than n-1 bridges, there is still at least one path from island 1 to the rest of the graph.

In a complete graph, even if some bridges are destroyed, as long as island 1 is connected to at least one other island, it can reach all other islands through paths via those connected islands.

Because the graph remains fully connected unless island 1 is completely isolated.

Hence, the minimal number of islands Everule can visit is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, if k < n-1

This seems to be the general rule.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

Let's analyze this.

The condition is print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Wait, if n - k <=1, then print n, else print 1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

- If k >= n-1, print 1

- If k < n-1, print n

Which is equivalent to:

- If k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1

- If k < n-1, Everule can visit all n islands

Now, let's see what the code is doing.

It's printing n if n - k <=1, else 1.

Wait, n - k <=1 is the same as k >= n -1.

Because n - k <=1 => -k <=1 - n => k >= n -1.

Yes, so it's equivalent to:

- If k >= n -1, print n

- Else, print 1

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

- If k >= n -1, print 1

- Else, print n

So, it seems like there's a mistake in the code.

It's printing n when k >= n-1, but according to the reasoning, it should print 1 in that case.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me check with the example.

First test case: n=2, k=0

According to the code: n - k =2 -0=2 <=1? No, so print 1, but according to the problem, it should be 2.

Wait, according to the problem, when n=2, k=0, output should be 2.

But according to the code, n - k =2 -0=2 <=1? No, so print 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, when k < n-1, which is k=0 <1, should print n=2, which is correct.

But the code prints 1 in this case.

So, the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo.

Let me check another test case.

Second test case: n=2, k=1

According to the code: n - k=1 <=1, so print n=2, but according to the problem, it should be 1.

Wait, the problem says output is 1 for n=2, k=1.

So, the code is printing 2, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

It should be print 1 when k >= n-1, and n when k < n-1.

But the code is doing the opposite.

So, the correct code should be:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

Or, equivalently:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

But in the given code, it's print(n if n - k <=1 else 1), which is equivalent to print(n if k >= n-1 else 1), which is the opposite of what it should be.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the person who wrote the code thought that n - k <=1 means that k >= n-1, which is correct, but then they should print 1 in that case, not n.

Wait, no, according to the code, it's printing n when k >= n-1, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

So, the correctness is False.

But let me check all test cases to be sure.

Third test case: n=4, k=1

According to the code: n - k=3 <=1? No, so print 1, but according to the problem, output is 4.

Hence, incorrect.

Fourth test case: n=5, k=10

n - k=5 -10=-5 <=1, so print n=5, but according to the problem, output is 1.

Hence, incorrect.

Fifth test case: n=5, k=3

n - k=2 <=1? No, so print 1, but according to the problem, output is 5.

Hence, incorrect.

Sixth test case: n=4, k=4

n - k=0 <=1, so print n=4, but according to the problem, output is 1.

Hence, incorrect.

So, in all test cases, the code gives wrong answers.

Hence, the correctness is False.

Wait, but perhaps I misread the code.

Let me look again.

The code is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which, as I thought, is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to the correct logic, it should be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Which is equivalent to:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Now, n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1, as I thought earlier.

Hence, the code should be:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

But the code is printing n when k >= n-1, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
