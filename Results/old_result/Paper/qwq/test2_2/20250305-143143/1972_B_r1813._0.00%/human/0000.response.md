Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up (U) or facing down (D). Alice and Bob take turns playing the game, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player has to choose a coin that's facing up, remove it, and flip the two coins that are adjacent to it. There are some special cases mentioned: if only two coins are left, removing one doesn't flip the other since it would be flipped twice, and if only one coin is left, removing it doesn't flip any coins. The game continues until a player can't make a move because there are no facing-up coins left, and that player loses.

My task is to determine, for given configurations of coins, whether Alice will win the game if both players play optimally. The game is guaranteed to end in a finite number of operations, and one player will win.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

1. **Game Setup:**

   - Coins are in a circle, so each coin has two neighbors.

   - Each coin is either U (up) or D (down).

2. **Moves:**

   - A player must choose a U coin, remove it, and flip the two adjacent coins.

   - If only two coins are left, removing one doesn't flip the other.

   - If only one coin is left, removing it doesn't flip any coins.

3. **Winning Condition:**

   - The player who is unable to make a move (no U coins left) loses.

Given that both players play optimally, I need to determine if Alice can force a win, regardless of Bob's play.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game's mechanics and determine a winning strategy for Alice. The key observation is that the game can be modeled as a variant of the Nim game, where the number of "U" coins plays a crucial role in determining the winner.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins' states.

2. **Counting "U" Coins:**
   - Count the number of "U" (up) coins in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice wins ("YES").
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob wins ("NO").

This approach leverages the game's properties, where the parity of the number of "U" coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine who will win the game between Alice and Bob based on the given rules and optimal play.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of coins and their initial states represented as a string of 'U's and 'D's.

2. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game involves removing a 'U' coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game continues until no 'U' coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob wins.

### Solution Code

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input data at once and split it into a list for easy access.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - Count the number of 'U' coins in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins, so append "YES" to the results list.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, so append "NO" to the results list.

4. **Output the Results:**
   - Print each result corresponding to the test cases.

This approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently for each test case by leveraging the parity of the count of 'U' coins, which determines the winner in this game scenario.

   - The game continues until no 'U' coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob wins.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input data at once and split it into a list for easy access.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - Count the number of 'U' coins in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins, so append "YES" to the results list.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, so append "NO" to the results list.

4. **Output the Results:**
   - Print each result corresponding to the test cases.

This approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently for each test case by leveraging the parity of the count of 'U' coins, which determines the winner in this game scenario.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine who will win the game between Alice and Bob based on the given rules and optimal play.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of coins and their initial states represented as a string of 'U's and 'D's.

2. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game involves removing a 'U' coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game continues until no 'U' coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
