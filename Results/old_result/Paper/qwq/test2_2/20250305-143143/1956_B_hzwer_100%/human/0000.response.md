Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine secondarily.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

Each player has n cards, and there are 2n turns. Since there are only two cards for each number, once both are played, that number can't give any more points.

The key here is that Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, in that order.

I need to find out how many points I can guarantee to get, assuming Nene is playing against me in the best possible way.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

The sequence of moves is described, and it results in me getting 1 point and Nene getting 3 points.

The claim is that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

Let me try to see why.

In the first move, I play one of my 1's. Nene then plays a 4. In the third move, I play the other 1, getting a point because there's already a 1 on the table. Nene then plays the other 4, getting a point. Then I play 2, Nene plays 2, getting a point. Then I play 3, Nene plays 3, getting a point.

So, I got 1 point, and Nene got 3 points.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's try a different sequence.

Suppose I play 2 first. Nene plays 4. Then I play 1, no point. Nene plays 4, getting a point. Then I play 1, getting a point. Nene plays 3, no point. I play 3, getting a point.

Wait, in this sequence, I got 2 points: one from playing the second 1 and one from playing the second 3.

But according to the problem, it's said that I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene can prevent me from getting 2 points.

Let me think again.

Wait, in the second sequence I just thought of, Nene let me get 2 points, but the problem says that with optimal play, I can only get 1 point.

So, perhaps Nene can play differently to prevent that.

If I play 2 first, Nene could play 4. Then I play 1, no point. Nene plays 4, getting a point. Then I play 1, getting a point. Nene plays 3, no point. I play 3, getting a point.

So, in this case, I got 2 points.

But maybe Nene can play differently to prevent that.

If Nene, when I play 2, plays 3 instead of 4.

Then, sequence:

Me: play 2

Nene: play 3

Me: play 1

Nene: play 4

Me: play 1, get 1 point

Nene: play 4, get 1 point

So, in this case, I only get 1 point.

So, if Nene plays 3 instead of 4 in the first turn, she can prevent me from getting two points.

So, Nene, being smart, would choose to play 3 first to prevent me from getting two points.

Hence, the optimal play allows me only 1 point.

So, the answer is 1.

In the second test case, the answer is 2.

Looking at the input:

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

So, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards would be the remaining ones: assuming n=8, numbers from 1 to 8, each appearing twice. So, Nene has the other instances of these numbers.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3, and Nene has 2,3,4,4. So, it's consistent.

So, for n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, so Nene has the other instances: 1,2,4,5,7,8, plus whatever is missing.

Wait, but in this case, numbers 1 through 8 each appear twice in total.

So, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene has the other instances: 1,2,4,5,7,8

Wait, but 8 appears twice in my hand, so Nene has only one 8, and similarly for 5.

Wait, no, I have two 8's and two 5's, so Nene has one of each of them.

Wait, no, I have two 8's and two 5's, so Nene has one 8 and one 5, and the rest are single.

Wait, but in the input, it's guaranteed that each number appears at most twice in my hand.

Wait, the problem says: "each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,â€¦,an at most 2 times."

Wait, no, n is the number of cards each gets, so in this case, n=8, and a1 to an are the cards I have, each number from 1 to 8 appears at most twice in my hand.

So, in this case, I have two 8's and two 5's, and Nene has one of each of them.

Wait, but in the input, n=8, and a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

So, Nene has the other instances: 1,2,4,5,7,8

Wait, but 8 and 5 are already two in my hand, so Nene has only one of each.

So, Nene has: 1,2,4,5,7,8

Wait, but n=8, so there should be 8 cards for Nene.

Wait, no, wait, total cards are 2n, n=8, so 16 cards, divided equally, 8 each.

So, if I have two 8's and two 5's, then Nene has one 8 and one 5, and the rest are single instances.

Wait, but in n=8, numbers from 1 to 8, each appears twice.

So, my hand: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's hand: 1,2,4,5,7,8

Wait, that's only 6 cards, but n=8, she should have 8 cards.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my counting.

Wait, no, in n=4, I have 4 cards, Nene has 4 cards.

In n=8, I have 8 cards, Nene has 8 cards.

So, in this case, my hand: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, numbers 1,2,4,5,7,8 are present in my hand, with 8 and 5 appearing twice.

So, Nene's hand should have one of each of these numbers, except for 8 and 5, which I have two copies.

Wait, no.

Wait, total of each number is two.

So, if I have two 8's, then Nene has zero 8's.

Wait, no, wait, if I have two 8's, then Nene has none.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, I have two 1's, so Nene has none.

Wait, no, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has two 4's.

Wait, hold on, in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3, and Nene has 2,3,4,4.

Wait, so for number 1, I have two, Nene has none.

For number 2, I have one, Nene has one.

For number 3, I have one, Nene has one.

For number 4, Nene has two, I have none.

So, in general, for each number, if I have two, Nene has none; if I have one, Nene has one; if I have none, Nene has two.

Wait, but in n=8 case, my hand is 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, for numbers:

1: I have one, Nene has one.

2: I have one, Nene has one.

4: I have one, Nene has one.

5: I have two, Nene has none.

7: I have one, Nene has one.

8: I have two, Nene has none.

So, Nene has cards: 1,2,4,7

Wait, but n=8, so Nene should have 8 cards.

Wait, according to this, Nene has only 4 cards, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, no, in n=4, I have 4 cards, Nene has 4 cards.

In n=8, I have 8 cards, Nene has 8 cards.

So, in this case, my hand: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, numbers 1,2,4,7 appear once in my hand, so Nene has one of each.

Numbers 5 and 8 appear twice in my hand, so Nene has none.

But n=8, so there are numbers from 1 to 8.

So, for numbers 1,2,4,7: I have one, Nene has one.

For numbers 5 and 8: I have two, Nene has none.

What about numbers 3 and 6? They are missing from my hand.

So, for numbers 3 and 6: I have zero, Nene has two.

So, Nene's hand is: 1,2,4,7 (from numbers with one in my hand) plus two 3's and two 6's (from numbers with none in my hand).

So, Nene's hand: 1,2,4,7,3,3,6,6

Yes, that's 8 cards.

Ok, now I see.

So, in general, for each number from 1 to n:

- If I have two, Nene has none.

- If I have one, Nene has one.

- If I have none, Nene has two.

Ok, now, back to the problem.

I need to find the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, Nene is trying to maximize her own points, and among the options that maximize her points, she chooses the one that minimizes my points.

I need to find, given my hand, what is the maximum points I can get.

Looking at the program provided:

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Reads n

- Reads a list of n integers a1 to an

- Counts the frequency of each number in my hand

- Computes the sum of (x - 1) for each frequency x that is greater than zero.

Wait, no, it's sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt.

So, for each number, it adds x - 1 to the answer if x > 1, else 0.

So, it's summing up the number of duplicates I have in my hand.

In the first test case, n=4, my hand: 1,1,2,3

So, frequencies: 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0

So, max(0,2-1)=1, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,0-1)=0

Sum is 1, which matches the sample output of 1.

In the second test case, n=8, my hand:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Frequencies:7:1,4:1,1:1,2:1,8:2,5:2

So, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,2-1)=1, max(0,2-1)=1

Sum is 2, which matches the sample output of 2.

So, it seems that the program is counting the number of pairs I have in my hand, i.e., for each number that appears twice in my hand, I can get one point.

But, is this the correct approach?

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, which according to this, gives me one point, which matches the sample.

In the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, so I get two points, which matches the sample.

But, is this always correct?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=3, my hand:1,2,3, Nene's hand:1,2,3

So, frequencies:1:1,2:1,3:1

According to the program, sum of max(0,1-1)=0 for each, total 0, which matches the sample output of 0.

Is this correct?

In this case, possible sequence:

Me: play 1, Nene: play 1, no point for her, place 1.

Me: play 2, Nene: play 2, no point for her, place 2.

Me: play 3, Nene: play 3, no point for her, place 3.

So, I get 0 points, which matches.

Another sequence:

Me: play 2, Nene: play 1, me: play 3, Nene: play 2, me: play 1, Nene: play 3.

In this case, still, I get 0 points.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=1, my hand:1, Nene's hand:1

Frequencies:1:1

Sum of max(0,1-1)=0, which matches the sample output of 0.

Seems correct.

But, is there a case where this logic fails?

Let me think about a case where I have one pair and some singles.

Suppose n=5, my hand:1,1,2,3,4

Nene's hand:2,3,4,5,5

Frequencies:1:2,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:0

According to the program, sum of max(0,2-1)=1, and others are 0, so total 1 point.

Is this correct?

Possible sequence:

Me: play 1, Nene: play 5, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 5, get 1 point, me: play 2, Nene: play 2, me: play 3, Nene: play 3, me: play 4, Nene: play 4.

So, I get 1 point, which matches.

Another sequence:

Me: play 2, Nene: play 5, me: play 1, Nene: play 5, get 1 point, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 3, me: play 3, Nene: play 4, me: play 4.

So, I get 1 point again.

Seems like I can't get more than one point.

So, in this case, the program would output 1, which is correct.

Wait, but suppose Nene plays differently.

If Nene wants to minimize my score, she might play in a way that prevents me from getting points.

But in this case, since I have only one pair, and Nene has a pair of 5's, she can't prevent me from getting that one point.

Because whenever I play the second 1, there's already a 1 on the table, so I get a point.

So, seems correct.

Let me think about a more complex case.

n=6, my hand:1,1,2,3,4,4

Nene's hand:2,3,5,5,6,6

Frequencies:1:2,2:1,3:1,4:2,5:0,6:0

Sum of max(0,2-1)=1 for 1's, max(0,2-1)=1 for 4's, total 2 points.

Is this correct?

Possible sequence:

Me: play 1, Nene: play 2, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 3, me: play 4, Nene: play 5, me: play 4, get 1 point, Nene: play 6, me: play 5, Nene: play 6.

So, I get 2 points.

Another sequence:

Me: play 4, Nene: play 2, me: play 4, get 1 point, Nene: play 5, me: play 1, Nene: play 3, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 6, me: play 5, Nene: play 6.

Again, I get 2 points.

Seems like I can get 2 points.

But can Nene prevent this?

If Nene plays optimally to minimize my points, perhaps she can interfere.

But in this case, it seems not.

So, the program's approach seems correct.

But, is there a case where having multiple pairs allows me to get more points than just the number of pairs I have?

Let me think about n=3, my hand:1,1,2, Nene's hand:2,3,3

Frequencies:1:2,2:1,3:0

Sum of max(0,2-1)=1, max(0,1-1)=0, max(0,0-1)=0, total 1 point.

Is this correct?

Possible sequence:

Me: play 1, Nene: play 2, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 3, me: play 2, Nene: play 3, get 1 point.

So, I get 1 point, which matches.

Another sequence:

Me: play 2, Nene: play 3, me: play 1, Nene: play 3, get 1 point, me: play 1, get 1 point.

Wait, in this sequence, I get 1 point from playing the second 1, and Nene gets 1 point from playing the second 3.

But according to the program, I should get 1 point, which matches.

So, seems correct.

Wait, but in this sequence, I got 1 point, but in the second sequence, I got 1 point again.

Seems consistent.

Alright, perhaps the program is correct.

But, to be thorough, let's think about a case where I have multiple pairs.

n=4, my hand:1,1,2,2

Nene's hand:3,3,4,4

Frequencies:1:2,2:2,3:0,4:0

Sum of max(0,2-1)=1 for each pair, total 2 points.

Is this correct?

Possible sequence:

Me: play 1, Nene: play 3, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 3, get 1 point, me: play 2, Nene: play 4, me: play 2, get 1 point, Nene: play 4, get 1 point.

So, I get 2 points, which matches.

Another sequence:

Me: play 2, Nene: play 3, me: play 2, get 1 point, Nene: play 3, get 1 point, me: play 1, Nene: play 4, me: play 1, get 1 point, Nene: play 4, get 1 point.

Again, I get 2 points.

Seems correct.

But can Nene prevent this?

If Nene plays optimally, she can't prevent me from getting these points because the pairs are in my hand.

Wait, but what if Nene has pairs and I have singles?

For example, n=3, my hand:1,2,3, Nene's hand:1,2,3

Frequencies:1:1,2:1,3:1

Sum of max(0,1-1)=0 for each, total 0 points.

Which matches the earlier example where I get 0 points.

Seems correct.

Another case: n=5, my hand:1,1,2,3,4, Nene's hand:2,3,4,5,5

Frequencies:1:2,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:0

Sum of max(0,2-1)=1, others are 0, total 1 point.

Which matches the earlier example.

So, it seems that the number of points I can guarantee is equal to the number of pairs I have in my hand.

But, is there a scenario where I can get more points than the number of pairs I have?

Or fewer?

From the examples above, it seems that I can get exactly the number of points equal to the number of pairs I have.

Because for each pair, I can play the first card, and then the second card to get a point.

Nene can't prevent this because she doesn't have that card to play before me.

Unless, perhaps, she plays a card that I have a pair of, but in that case, she would be wasting her move.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seems that I can always get one point per pair.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can achieve in a card game where we and our opponent, Nene, take turns playing cards with specific scoring rules.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We are given a deck of `2n` cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - We and Nene each receive `n` cards.
   - We take turns playing one card at a time, and points are awarded if a card played matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize ours.

2. **Insight**:
   - The key is to maximize our points by strategically playing pairs of cards we hold.
   - For each pair of cards we hold, we can ensure one point by playing the second card of the pair after the first has been played (either by us or Nene).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Count the frequency of each card in our hand.
   - For each card that appears more than once in our hand, we can score one point per pair.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` and the list of cards we hold.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - Use a list `cnt` to count occurrences of each card in our hand.

3. **Calculating Points**:
   - For each card that appears more than once in our hand, add `(x - 1)` to the answer, where `x` is the frequency of the card.
   - This ensures that for each pair of identical cards, we score one point.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the computed points for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize our points by leveraging the pairs we hold, while considering Nene's optimal play to counter our strategy.
