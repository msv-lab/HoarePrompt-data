Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket. I can buy up to m tickets per day, and there's this rule that if I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all the subsequent days.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets across these n days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's going on here. The number of test cases is t, and for each test case, I have n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers representing the price per ticket on each day.

The constraints are:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

- For each test case:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5

- 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9

- 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^9)

- 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

And the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5.

So, it's clear that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n log n) time per test case at worst, considering the constraints.

Let me try to wrap my head around the problem.

I have to buy k tickets, with a daily limit of m tickets per day. Each day has a certain base price per ticket, and each ticket I buy on a day increases the base price for all subsequent days by x, where x is the number of tickets bought on that day.

So, the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all days j before i.

I need to decide how many tickets to buy on each day to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like an optimization problem, possibly solvable with greedy algorithms.

Let me think about it step by step.

Option 1: Buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days.

But wait, there's a twist because buying tickets on earlier days increases the price for later days.

So, if I buy a lot on a cheap day, it might make future days more expensive, which could outweigh the initial savings.

Option 2: Buy tickets on the days where the price increase doesn't outweigh the savings.

Hmm, that's a bit vague. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider sorting the days by their base prices.

If I could arrange to buy tickets on the days with the lowest base prices, that would be ideal, but I have to account for the price increases on subsequent days.

Wait a minute, what if I sort the days in increasing order of their base prices and then buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints?

Let me see.

Suppose I sort the days so that I have the days with the lowest a_i first.

Now, if I buy x tickets on the first day, the price per ticket is a_1, and then for all subsequent days, the price increases by x.

Then, for the second day, the price is a_2 + x, and so on.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm fixing the number of tickets bought on the first day and then proceeding to the next days.

This seems complicated because the number of tickets I can buy on each day is limited by m, and I have to ensure that the total is exactly k.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Another approach: since the price increases by x for all subsequent days, where x is the number of tickets bought on a particular day, perhaps I should minimize the impact of x on future days.

That is, buy fewer tickets on days with higher base prices to avoid increasing the prices for days with lower base prices.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because I want to buy on the cheapest days.

Let me try to think in terms of greedy choices.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of their base prices.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

But, each time I buy tickets on a day, it increases the base price for the remaining days.

So, there's a trade-off between buying on a cheap day and making future days more expensive.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to find a way to balance this trade-off.

Let me consider the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

One optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1

- Buy 0 on day 2

- Buy 1 on day 3 for 4

- Buy 2 on day 4 for 6 each, total 12

Total cost: 4 + 12 = 16

But in the explanation, it's 10, which is better.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Looking back, in the first test case, the optimal is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 6 each, total 12

Total cost: 4 + 12 = 16

But in the explanation, it's 10, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternative approach:

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 4 each, total 8; prices for day 3 become 6, day 2 becomes 8, day 1 becomes 10

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost 6

Total cost: 8 + 6 = 14

Still not 10.

Wait, maybe:

- Buy 1 on day 4: cost 2, prices for day 3 become 3, day 2 becomes 5, day 1 becomes 7

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 6

Total: 2 + 6 = 8

Closer, but still not 10.

Wait, maybe I need to consider buying on different days.

Wait, perhaps the optimal is:

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost 4, prices for day 4 become 3

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 6

Total: 4 + 6 = 10

Yes, that matches the sample.

So, in this case, buying on the later cheap days first can be better.

This suggests that buying on the days with the lowest base prices last might be advantageous because you can minimize the number of tickets bought at higher prices.

So, perhaps sorting the days in decreasing order of base prices and buying as many tickets as possible on the days with higher base prices first, leaving the cheaper days for last, could be a good strategy.

Wait, but in this example, buying on day 3 first and then on day 4 worked better.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can model this as assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increases.

Another idea: since buying on earlier days affects the prices of later days, maybe I can think in terms of cumulative effects.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of base prices and buy as few tickets as possible on earlier days to minimize the impact on future days.

Wait, but in the sample input, buying on day 3 and day 4 worked better.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of their base prices.

Then, I can try to buy tickets starting from the cheapest days, but considering the cumulative increase in prices due to previous purchases.

But it's getting messy.

Let me consider the total cost formula.

Let me denote x_i as the number of tickets bought on day i.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

And the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

Also, sum_{i=1}^n x_i = k

And 0 ≤ x_i ≤ m for each i

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

This looks complicated to solve directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to rearrange this formula to make it easier to compute.

Let me expand the total cost:

Total cost = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

= sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

= sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_i * x_j

This seems even more complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the impact of buying one ticket on a particular day.

If I buy one ticket on day i, its cost is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, the cost of buying one ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

Therefore, the cost of buying x_i tickets on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This is the same as in the earlier expression.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can also be expressed as the sum over all pairs of tickets and days, with the appropriate multipliers.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of cumulative sums.

Let me define s_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j, which is the total tickets bought up to day i.

Then, x_i = s_i - s_{i-1}, with s_0 = 0.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Because sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j = s_{i-1}

So, total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

But x_i = s_i - s_{i-1}, so sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can think of s_i as the cumulative tickets bought up to day i, and then the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Then, total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

But x_i * s_{i-1} = (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1} = s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2

So, sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This still seems messy.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the total cost is equal to sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i plus the sum over all pairs of tickets bought on different days up to that day.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Maybe I can think about the problem in terms of prefix sums.

Let me define s = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j, which is the total tickets bought before day i.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s)

So, total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s

But s = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j, so sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j = sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_i * x_j

This seems similar to what I had before.

This doesn't seem helpful immediately.

Maybe I need to consider the total cost in terms of the overall sum.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the total cost as sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i plus some function of the cumulative tickets bought.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider dynamic programming.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][s] as the minimum cost to buy s tickets in the first i days.

Then, dp[i][s] = min over x (0 ≤ x ≤ min(m, s)) of (x * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j) + dp[i-1][s - x])

But this seems too slow because n and k can be up to 1e5 and 1e9 respectively.

I need a more efficient approach.

Dynamic programming is probably not feasible here due to time constraints.

Let me think of another way.

Maybe I can sort the days in some specific order and decide how many tickets to buy on each day greedily.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n log n) solution at most.

Another idea: since the price per ticket on a day is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days, perhaps I can find a way to calculate the total cost based on the cumulative number of tickets bought.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the formula.

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j, which is the cumulative tickets bought up to day i.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Because s_{i-1} = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

So, total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

But x_i = s_i - s_{i-1}, so sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost as sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This still doesn't seem helpful.

Maybe I need to consider a different perspective.

Let me consider that the total cost is equal to the sum of the base prices times the number of tickets bought on each day, plus the sum of the number of tickets bought on each day times the sum of the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

Wait, that sounds like sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

Which is what I had before.

This seems to be leading me in circles.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into selecting a subset of days and buying a certain number of tickets on those days, with the constraint that the total number of tickets bought is exactly k, and each day can contribute up to m tickets.

Moreover, the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

This seems similar to assigning tickets to days, where the cost of each ticket depends on the day it's bought and the number of tickets bought on previous days.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to think about the problem in terms of priority queues or some sorted structure.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy tickets starting from the cheapest days, but adjust for the price increases due to previous purchases.

But I'm back to where I started.

Let me look at the second test case.

n=4, m=2, k=8

a = [8,6,4,2]

In this case, I have to buy 8 tickets, with a maximum of 2 per day.

So, I have to buy exactly 2 tickets on each of the 4 days.

The prices would be:

- Day 1: a_1 = 8, buy 2 tickets, cost = 2*8 = 16; prices for day 2 onwards increase by 2.

- Day 2: a_2 = 6 + 2 = 8, buy 2 tickets, cost = 2*8 = 16; prices for day 3 onwards increase by 4.

- Day 3: a_3 = 4 + 4 = 8, buy 2 tickets, cost = 2*8 = 16; prices for day 4 onwards increase by 6.

- Day 4: a_4 = 2 + 6 = 8, buy 2 tickets, cost = 2*8 = 16.

Total cost: 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64.

This matches the sample output.

So, in this case, buying the maximum allowed each day on the original cheapest days still results in the minimum cost because the price increases are the same regardless of the order.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on the cheaper days last seemed better.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

If I buy 0 on day 1, then prices for day 2 onwards are [6,4,2]

Buy 0 on day 2, prices for day 3 onwards are [4,2]

Buy 1 on day 3, cost = 4, prices for day 4 become [3]

Buy 2 on day 4, cost = 2 * 3 = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

Alternatively, if I buy 2 on day 4 and 1 on day 3:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total: 4 + 6 = 10

Same as the sample.

Wait, but earlier I thought of buying 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, which also gives 10.

So, in this case, it doesn't matter the order as long as the total tickets bought is k and within daily limits.

Wait, but in the second test case, buying 2 on each day gives 64, which is higher than 10.

Wait, no, in the first test case, k=3, in the second test case, k=8, which requires buying 2 on each day.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is achieved by distributing the purchases in a way that minimizes the sum of (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j) * x_i.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think of a general strategy.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

But, since buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, there's a trade-off.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the total cost if I buy a certain number of tickets on each day in the sorted order.

Let me consider that I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, assign the maximum possible tickets to the cheapest days, but adjust for the price increases on subsequent days.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m for each i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

Which is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_i * x_j

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider the problem as assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i costs a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

So, the cost of a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should assign tickets to days in a way that minimizes the sum of these costs.

This sounds like assigning the earliest tickets to the days with the lowest a_i plus their position in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days based on a_i and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and assign as many tickets as possible to the cheapest days, considering the price increases.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider that the cost of a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I sort the days in increasing order of a_i, and assign tickets starting from the cheapest days, the number of tickets bought on previous days would be higher for cheaper days, which might not be optimal.

Wait, maybe I should sort the days in decreasing order of a_i.

Then, assign tickets to the most expensive days first, so that the price increases are minimized for the cheaper days.

Wait, but in the first test case, a = [8,6,4,2], sorted in decreasing order is [8,6,4,2].

If I buy on the most expensive days first, I might be increasing the prices for cheaper days.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, let's try sorting in decreasing order and see.

Suppose I sort the days in decreasing order of a_i.

So, for the first test case, sorted a = [8,6,4,2]

Then, buy as many as possible on the first day, which is day 1: buy m=2 tickets at a_i=8, cost=16; prices for remaining days increase by 2.

So, day 2: a_2=6+2=8, buy 2 tickets, cost=16; day 3: a_3=4+4=8, buy 1 ticket, cost=8; total cost=16+16+8=40, which is higher than the sample's 10.

So, that's not optimal.

Wait, perhaps sorting in increasing order of a_i is better.

For the first test case, sorted a = [2,4,6,8]

Buy as many as possible on the cheapest day first.

Buy 2 tickets on day 4 at a_i=2, cost=4; prices for remaining days increase by 2.

So, day 3: a_3=4+2=6, buy 1 ticket, cost=6; total cost=4+6=10, which matches the sample.

Okay, that seems promising.

Let me try this approach in the second test case.

n=4, m=2, k=8

a = [8,6,4,2], sorted in increasing order: [2,4,6,8]

Buy 2 tickets on day 4 at a_i=2, cost=4; prices for remaining days increase by 2.

So, day 3: a_3=4+2=6, buy 2 tickets, cost=12; day 2: a_2=6+4=10, buy 2 tickets, cost=20; day 1: a_1=8+6=14, buy 2 tickets, cost=28; total cost=4+12+20+28=64, which matches the sample.

So, in both samples, sorting in increasing order of a_i and buying as many as possible on the cheapest days first seems to work.

Let me see if this always holds.

Suppose I have n=2, m=1, k=2

a = [1, 2]

Sort a in increasing order: [1,2]

Buy 1 ticket on day 2 at a_i=1, cost=1; prices for day 1 increase by 1.

Then, day 1: a_1=1+1=2, buy 1 ticket, cost=2; total cost=3.

Alternatively, buy 1 ticket on day 1 at a_i=1, cost=1; prices for day 2 increase by 1.

Then, day 2: a_2=2+1=3, buy 1 ticket, cost=3; total cost=4.

So, buying on the cheapest days first gives a better cost.

Another example: n=3, m=1, k=3

a = [1,2,3]

Sort in increasing order: [1,2,3]

Buy 1 ticket on day 3 at a_i=1, cost=1; prices for day 2 and 1 increase by 1.

Then, day 2: a_2=2+1=3, buy 1 ticket, cost=3; day 1: a_1=1+1=2, buy 1 ticket, cost=2; total cost=6.

Alternatively, sort in increasing order and buy on day 3, then day 2, then day 1, total cost=6.

Is there a better way? Suppose I buy on day 2 first.

Buy 1 ticket on day 2 at a_i=2, cost=2; prices for day 1 increase by 1.

Then, day 3: a_3=1+1=2, buy 1 ticket, cost=2; day 1: a_1=1+1=2, buy 1 ticket, cost=2; total cost=6.

Same total cost.

So, in this case, it's the same.

Another example: n=3, m=2, k=3

a = [1,2,3]

Sort in increasing order: [1,2,3]

Buy 2 tickets on day 3 at a_i=1, cost=2; prices for day 2 and 1 increase by 2.

Then, day 2: a_2=2+2=4, buy 1 ticket, cost=4; total cost=6.

Alternatively, buy 1 ticket on day 3 at a_i=1, cost=1; prices for day 2 and 1 increase by 1.

Then, day 2: a_2=2+1=3, buy 1 ticket, cost=3; day 1: a_1=1+1=2, buy 1 ticket, cost=2; total cost=6.

Same total cost.

So, in these cases, it seems that sorting in increasing order of a_i and buying on the cheapest days last gives the same result as other strategies.

But in the first test case, it gave a better result than buying on more expensive days first.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days last.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on day 3 and day 4 gave the same total cost as buying on day 4 and day 3.

So, perhaps the order doesn't matter as long as you buy on the cheapest days.

Wait, perhaps the key is to buy on the days with the lowest a_i, regardless of the order, but considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

This is still confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize this.

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j, with s_0 = 0.

Then, the cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

But x_i = s_i - s_{i-1}, so sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost in terms of s_n = k.

This might not help directly.

Maybe I need to consider that the total cost is equal to sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i plus the sum of x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that the sum_{i=1}^n x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j can be expressed in terms of the square of s_i or something similar.

Wait, sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

Since s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i is not correct; s_{i} = s_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

Actually, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

So, sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (s_i - x_i) = sum_{i=1}^n (x_i * s_i - x_i^2)

This seems even more complicated.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach altogether.

Let me think about the problem in terms of assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

So, the total cost is sum over all tickets of (a_{d} + p), where d is the day the ticket is assigned to, and p is the number of tickets assigned to days before d.

To minimize this, I need to assign tickets to days in a way that minimizes the sum of a_d plus the position of the ticket.

This sounds similar to assigning tasks to machines with processing costs and setup costs.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning a priority to the days based on their base prices and then assigning tickets accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on previous days, perhaps I can calculate the cost per ticket on each day based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, but the number of tickets bought on previous days affects the price on subsequent days.

This seems too interdependent.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum of a_i * x_i plus sum of x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

Which is sum_{i=1}^n a_i * x_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

This can be rewritten as sum_{i=1}^n a_i * x_i + sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} x_i * x_j

This seems like a quadratic form, but I'm not sure how to minimize it under the constraints.

Maybe I need to consider Lagrange multipliers or some optimization technique, but that's probably overkill for this problem.

Given the time constraints, I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is achieved by buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

So, perhaps sorting the days in increasing order of a_i and buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days last is the way to go.

In other words, assign the tickets to the days with the lowest a_i first, considering that buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on day 3 and day 4 gave the minimal cost.

Day 3 and day 4 have a_i=4 and 2, which are the lowest.

So, perhaps sorting in increasing order of a_i and buying on the days with the lowest a_i first, in that order.

Wait, but in the second test case, buying on all days in order of increasing a_i also worked.

Maybe the general strategy is to sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy as many tickets as possible on each day in that order, starting from the cheapest day.

But in the first test case, buying on day 4 first (a_i=2) and then on day 3 (a_i=4) gave the minimal cost.

Wait, but in that case, buying on day 4 first increases the prices for day 3.

But in the first test case, when buying on day 4 first:

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost = 2 * 2 = 4; prices for day 3 increase by 2 to a_3=4+2=6

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost = 6 * 1 = 6

- Total cost = 10

Alternatively, buying on day 3 first:

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost = 4 * 1 = 4; prices for day 4 increase by 1 to a_4=2+1=3

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost = 3 * 2 = 6

- Total cost = 10

Same total cost.

So, the order doesn't matter in this case.

Perhaps, in general, sorting the days in increasing order of a_i and buying as many tickets as possible on each day in that order gives the minimal cost.

Let me test this with another example.

Suppose n=3, m=1, k=3

a = [1,2,3]

Sort in increasing order: [1,2,3]

Option 1: Buy on day 3 first.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost=1; prices for day 2 and 1 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 2: cost=2+1=3; prices for day 1 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 1: cost=1+1+1=3; total cost=1+3+3=7.

Option 2: Buy on day 1 first.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 1: cost=1; prices for day 2 and 3 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 2: cost=2+1=3; prices for day 3 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost=3+1+1=5; total cost=1+3+5=9.

So, buying on the cheapest days last gives a better total cost.

Another option: Buy on day 2 first.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 2: cost=2; prices for day 1 and 3 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost=3+1=4; prices for day 1 increase by 1.

- Buy 1 ticket on day 1: cost=1+1+1=3; total cost=2+4+3=9.

So, buying on the cheapest days last gives the minimal cost.

Therefore, the strategy seems to be to sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy tickets starting from the cheapest days last.

In other words, sort the days in increasing order of a_i and assign tickets to days starting from the lowest a_i, which would be the last in the sorted list.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on day 4 (a_i=2) and day 3 (a_i=4) worked.

Similarly, in the third test case, buying on day 3 (a_i=1), day 2 (a_i=10), day 1 (a_i=10000), etc.

Wait, in the third test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a = [10000,1,100,10,1000]

Sort in increasing order: [1,10,100,1000,10000]

Buy 1 ticket on the cheapest day, which is day 2 (a_i=1), cost=1.

Total cost=1.

This seems correct.

Another example:

n=3, m=1, k=3

a = [1,2,3]

Sort in increasing order: [1,2,3]

Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost=1; prices for day 2 and 1 increase by 1.

Buy 1 ticket on day 2: cost=2+1=3; prices for day 1 increase by 1.

Buy 1 ticket on day 1: cost=1+1+1=3; total cost=1+3+3=7.

This is better than buying on more expensive days first.

So, the strategy seems to be to sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy tickets starting from the cheapest days last, i.e., assign tickets to the days with the lowest a_i first, in that order.

In terms of implementation, this means sorting the list of a_i in increasing order and then buying tickets starting from the end of the sorted list.

Now, considering that we have to buy exactly k tickets, and each day we can buy up to m tickets, we need to iterate through the sorted list from the end and buy as many tickets as possible up to m on each day until we've bought k tickets.

Let me try to formalize this:

1. Sort the list a in increasing order.

2. Initialize total cost c = 0 and a variable t to keep track of the total number of tickets bought so far, starting from 0.

3. Iterate over the sorted list from the end to the beginning.

4. For each day, calculate the number of tickets to buy: s = min(m, k - t)

5. Add to the total cost: c += s * (a[i] + t)

6. Update the total number of tickets: t += s

7. Proceed to the next day until t reaches k.

This seems to align with the sample inputs and outputs.

Let me test this with the first test case.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

Start from the end:

- Day 4 (a_i=8): buy s = min(2,3-0)=2 tickets, cost=2*(8+0)=16; t=2

- Day 3 (a_i=6): buy s = min(2,3-2)=1 ticket, cost=1*(6+2)=8; t=3

- Total cost=16+8=24

Wait, but in the sample, it's 10.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding.

Wait, in the sample, it's 10, but according to this approach, it's giving 24, which is higher than the sample's 10.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the way I calculate the price increases.

Wait, in the first iteration, buying 2 tickets on day 4 at a_i=8, cost=16, and t=2.

Then, buying 1 ticket on day 3 at a_i=6 + t=2, so 6+2=8, cost=8.

Total cost=16+8=24.

But in the sample explanation, it's 10.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the price increases are cumulative.

Wait, in the sample explanation, they bought 1 ticket on day 3 at 4 and 2 tickets on day 4 at 6, totaling 10.

But according to my approach, it's 24.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the days in decreasing order of a_i.

Let me try that.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Sort in decreasing order: [8,6,4,2]

Start from the end:

- Day 4 (a_i=2): buy s = min(2,3-0)=2 tickets, cost=2*(2+0)=4; t=2

- Day 3 (a_i=4): buy s = min(2,3-2)=1 ticket, cost=1*(4+2)=6; t=3

- Total cost=4+6=10, which matches the sample.

Ah, so sorting in decreasing order and buying from the cheapest days last gives the correct result.

Wait, but in my earlier example, n=3, m=1, k=3 with a=[1,2,3], sorting in decreasing order [3,2,1], buying on day 3 (a_i=1): cost=1*1=1; t=1

Then day 2 (a_i=2): cost=1*(2+1)=3; t=2

Then day 1 (a_i=3): cost=1*(3+2)=5; t=3

Total cost=1+3+5=9, which is higher than the other option of 7.

So, in this case, sorting in decreasing order doesn't give the minimal cost.

Wait, but according to the sample, sorting in decreasing order works, but in this example, it doesn't.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort in increasing order and buy from the cheapest days last.

Wait, in the first test case, sorting in decreasing order worked, but in my example, it didn't.

So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, in the first test case, sorting in decreasing order and buying on the cheapest days last gave the correct minimal cost.

In my example, n=3, m=1, k=3, a=[1,2,3], sorting in decreasing order [3,2,1], buying on day 3 (a_i=1): cost=1, then day 2 (a_i=2): cost=3, day 1 (a_i=3): cost=5, total=9.

But if I sort in increasing order [1,2,3], buy on day 3 (a_i=3): cost=3, day 2 (a_i=2): cost=2+1=3, day 1 (a_i=1): cost=1+1+1=3, total=9.

Wait, same total.
