Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up (U) or down (D). Alice and Bob take turns playing the game, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player has to choose a coin that's facing up, remove it, and flip the two coins adjacent to it. There are some special cases when there are only one or two coins left, but I get the general idea.

The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally. It's guaranteed that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one player will lose when there are no facing-up coins left to choose.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

1. **Game Setup:**

- Coins are in a circle, so each coin has two neighbors.

- Each coin is either U (up) or D (down).

2. **Moves:**

- Choose a coin that is U.

- Remove that coin.

- Flip the two neighboring coins:

- If a neighbor is U, it becomes D, and vice versa.

- Special cases:

- If only two coins are left, choosing one removes it, and the other isn't flipped because it would be flipped twice (once for each neighbor, but since one neighbor is removed, it's only flipped once).

- If only one coin is left, and it's U, the player removes it, and the next player loses because there are no U coins left.

- If only one coin is left and it's D, the current player loses because there are no U coins to choose.

3. **Winning Condition:**

- The player who is unable to make a move loses. That is, if a player's turn comes and there are no U coins left, that player loses.

Given that, I need to find out who wins if both play optimally.

Looking at the provided program, it seems quite straightforward but I need to verify if it's correct.

The program reads input, processes each test case, and for each test case, it counts the number of 'U' coins. If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins), else 'NO' (Bob wins).

Wait a minute, is the winner determined solely by the parity of the number of 'U' coins initially? That seems too simple. Let me think about it.

First, consider the base cases:

- If there are 0 U coins initially:

- Alice cannot make a move, so she loses. (Bob wins)

- If there is 1 U coin:

- Alice removes it, no flips needed (since it's the last coin). Bob has no U coins to choose, so Bob loses. (Alice wins)

- If there are 2 U coins:

- Alice chooses one, removes it, and flips the neighboring coins.

- Since it's a circle, the neighbors are the other U coin and another coin.

- Wait, in a circle of 2 coins, both are neighbors to each other.

- So, choosing one U, removing it, and flipping the other U coin to D.

- Now, only one D coin is left. Bob has no U coins to choose, so Bob loses. (Alice wins)

- Wait, but according to the program, if the number of U is even, Bob wins. But in this case, with 2 U coins, Alice wins according to this reasoning.

Hmm, contradiction here. The program says if the number of U is even, it's 'NO' (Bob wins), but in this case, Alice wins.

Let me check another case.

- n=3, s=U U U

- Alice chooses one U, removes it, and flips the neighboring U coins to D.

- Now, s becomes D D.

- Bob chooses one U, but there are no U coins left. Wait, s is D D, both are D. So Alice wins.

Wait, but initially, there were 3 U coins (odd), according to the program, Alice should win, which matches this case.

But earlier, with n=2, s=U U, Alice wins, but according to the program, it should be 'NO' (Bob wins), which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted or misapplied the rules.

Let me try to simulate the game for n=2, s=U U.

- Alice chooses one U, removes it, and flips the neighboring coins.

- In a circle of 2 coins, each coin's neighbors are the other coin.

- So, removing one U and flipping the other U to D.

- Now, only one D coin is left.

- Bob has no U coins to choose, so he loses. Alice wins.

But according to the program, for even number of U coins, it should return 'NO' (Bob wins), which is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe the program is actually checking something else.

Let me look back at the program.

The program counts the number of U coins, and if it's odd, returns 'YES', else 'NO'.

But in the n=2, s=U U case, Alice wins, but the number of U is even, so it should return 'NO', but that's incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Another example from the input:

Input:

3

5

UUDUD

5

UDDUD

2

UU

Output:

YES

NO

NO

In the first test case, n=5, s=U U D U D

According to the program, number of U is 3 (odd), so 'YES' (Alice wins), which matches the example.

Second test case, n=5, s=U D D U D

Number of U is 2 (even), so 'NO' (Bob wins), but according to the example output, it's 'NO', but is that correct?

Wait, I need to think about whether Alice can win in this case.

Let me simulate it.

n=5, s=U D D U D

Alice's options:

- Choose the first U (index 0):

- Remove it, flip neighbors: index 4 and index 1.

- s[4]=D becomes U, s[1]=D becomes U.

- New s: D U U D D

- Bob's turn:

- Choose any U, say index 1:

- Remove it, flip neighbors: index 0 (D becomes D) and index 2 (U becomes D).

- New s: D D D D

- Bob removes one U, but in this case, after flipping, all coins are D.

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

- So, in this path, Alice loses.

- Alternatively, Alice could choose the fourth U (index 3):

- Remove it, flip neighbors: index 2 (D becomes U) and index 4 (D becomes U).

- New s: U U D U D

- Bob's turn:

- Choose any U, say index 0:

- Remove it, flip neighbors: index 4 (U becomes D) and index 1 (U becomes D).

- New s: D D D D

- Again, Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

So, in both possible moves, Alice loses. Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Third test case, n=2, s=U U

As I simulated earlier, Alice wins, but according to the program, number of U is even, so 'NO' (Bob wins), which is incorrect based on earlier reasoning.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 'NO', but according to my simulation, Alice wins.

So, there must be something wrong with my simulation.

Let me think again.

n=2, s=U U

Alice chooses one U, removes it, and flips the neighboring coin, which is the other U to D.

So, new s=U D

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says if there are only two coins left, choosing one removes it, and the other won't be flipped.

Wait, there seems to be a special case here.

In the problem description:

- If before the operation, there are only two coins left, then one is removed, and the other won't be flipped, even though it would be flipped twice.

Wait, in my earlier simulation, I considered that flipping twice means no change, but according to the problem, if there are only two coins, choosing one removes it, and the other isn't flipped.

So, in n=2, s=U U:

- Alice chooses one U, removes it, and the other U isn't flipped.

- So, s becomes U.

- Now, Bob's turn: chooses U, removes it, no flips needed (since it's the last coin).

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

Wait, in this case, Alice chooses a U, removes it, and the other U remains as is.

Then Bob chooses the remaining U, removes it, and Alice loses.

So, Alice loses, hence 'NO' is correct.

Earlier, I misinterpreted the special case rule.

So, in this specific case, the program outputs correctly, because with n=2 and s=U U, Alice loses, and the program returns 'NO' since the number of U is even.

But earlier, I thought that Alice would win in this case, but actually, she loses.

So, perhaps the program is correct after all.

Wait, but in my initial analysis, I thought that for even number of U, Bob wins, and for odd, Alice wins.

But in the simulation above, for n=2 (even), Alice loses, which matches the program's output.

Let me try another test case.

n=3, s=U U U

- Alice chooses one U, removes it, and flips the neighboring U coins to D.

- New s: D D U

- Bob chooses the remaining U, removes it, and flips the neighboring D coins to U.

- New s: U U

- Alice's turn: chooses one U, removes it, and the other U remains (special case).

- New s: U

- Bob chooses the last U, removes it, and Alice has no U to choose.

- Alice loses.

Wait, in this case, with n=3 (odd), Alice loses, but according to the program, it should return 'YES' (Alice wins), which contradicts my simulation.

Wait, perhaps my simulation is wrong.

Let me try simulating again.

n=3, s=U U U

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D U U

- Bob chooses coin 1, removes it, and flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D U

- Alice chooses coin 2, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 0.

- s becomes D D D

- Bob has no U to choose, so he loses. Alice wins.

Wait, in this path, Alice wins.

Another path:

n=3, s=U U U

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D U U

- Bob chooses coin 1, removes it, and flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D U

- Alice chooses coin 2, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 0.

- s becomes D D D

- Bob has no U to choose, so he loses. Alice wins.

Another path:

- Alice chooses coin 1, removes it, and flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes D U U

- Same as above.

Seems like Alice can win in all paths when n=3 and number of U is odd.

Wait, but according to the program, for odd number of U, it returns 'YES', which matches this simulation.

But earlier, for n=2 and even U, it returns 'NO', which also matches the corrected simulation where Alice loses.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in my initial analysis, I thought that for even U, Alice could still win in some cases, but according to the simulations, that's not the case.

Let me try another test case.

n=4, s=U U U U

Number of U is even (4), so program returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

Let's simulate:

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D U U D

- Bob chooses coin 1, removes it, and flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D U D

- Alice chooses coin 2, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes U U D D

- Bob chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D U D D

- Alice chooses coin 1, removes it, and flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D D D

- Bob chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D D D D

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

So, in this path, Alice loses.

Another path:

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D U U D

- Bob chooses coin 2, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D D D D

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

Seems like Alice always loses in this configuration, which matches the program's output of 'NO'.

Another test case:

n=1, s=U

Number of U is odd (1), program returns 'YES'.

- Alice chooses the only U, removes it, Bob has no U to choose, so Bob loses. Alice wins.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=1, s=D

Number of U is 0 (even), program returns 'NO'.

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses immediately. Bob wins.

Correct.

Seems like the program is correct in these cases.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for even number of U, Alice could still win in some cases, but according to the simulations, she doesn't.

Is there a general rule here? Is the winner determined solely by the parity of the number of U coins?

Looking at the game mechanics, it seems that the game is similar to Nim games or other impartial games where the Grundy number or mex can be calculated based on the number of U coins.

But in this specific problem, it seems that the parity of the number of U coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.

From the simulations above:

- If the number of U is odd, Alice wins.

- If the number of U is even, Bob wins.

So, the program seems to be correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a few more cases.

n=6, s=U U D U D U

Number of U is 4 (even), program returns 'NO'.

Simulate:

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, flips coins 1 and 5.

- s becomes D U D U D D

- Bob chooses coin 1, removes it, flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D D U D D

- Alice chooses coin 3, removes it, flips coins 2 and 4.

- s becomes U D U D D D

- Bob chooses coin 2, removes it, flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D D D D D D

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

Another path:

- Alice chooses coin 3, removes it, flips coins 2 and 4.

- s becomes U U D D D U

- Bob chooses coin 0, removes it, flips coins 1 and 5.

- s becomes D U D D D D

- Alice chooses coin 1, removes it, flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D D D D D

- Bob chooses coin 4, removes it, flips coins 3 and 5.

- s becomes U D D D D D

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

Seems consistent.

Another test case:

n=3, s=U D U

Number of U is 2 (even), program returns 'NO'.

Simulate:

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D D D

- Bob has no U to choose, so he loses. Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the program, it should be 'NO' (Bob wins), but in this simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect after all.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation for n=3 with s=U U U, Alice wins when number of U is odd, which matches the program's output of 'YES'.

But in this case, n=3, s=U D U, number of U is 2 (even), program says 'NO', but in simulation, Alice wins.

So, contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps my earlier simulation is wrong.

Let me simulate again.

n=3, s=U D U

- Alice chooses coin 0, removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D D D

- Bob has no U to choose, so he loses. Alice wins.

But number of U is even (2), which should be 'NO' according to the program, but in this simulation, Alice wins, which should be 'YES'.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps the program is not solely based on the parity of U.

Maybe there's more to it.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the program is incorrect.

In the example given in the problem:

Input:

3

5

UUDUD

5

UDDUD

2

UU

Output:

YES

NO

NO

In the first test case, n=5, s=U U D U D, number of U is 3 (odd), output 'YES'.

Second test case, n=5, s=U D D U D, number of U is 2 (even), output 'NO'.

Third test case, n=2, s=U U, number of U is 2 (even), output 'NO'.

In my simulation for n=3, s=U D U, number of U is 2 (even), but Alice wins, which contradicts the program's output of 'NO'.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=5 with 2 U's, output is 'NO', which matches the program, but in my simulation for n=3 with 2 U's, Alice wins, which should be 'YES'.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's something wrong with my simulation.

Let me check the problem statement again.

"In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there are no facing-up coins, the player loses."

In the case of n=3, s=U D U:

- Alice chooses coin 0 (U), removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- Coin 1 is D, flips to U; coin 2 is U, flips to D.

- So, s becomes D U D

- Wait, but in the problem statement, it says if there are only two coins left, choosing one removes it, and the other won't be flipped.

But in this case, after Alice's move, there are still 2 coins left: D and D.

Wait, s becomes D D after Alice's move.

Wait, no, s has 3 coins initially: positions 0,1,2.

After removing coin 0, s has coins 1 and 2 left: U and D.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, in a circle of 3 coins:

- Choosing coin 0 removes it, and flips coins 1 and 2.

- So, s[1] D flips to U, s[2] U flips to D.

- So, remaining coins are s[1]=U and s[2]=D.

- So, s becomes U D.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I thought s becomes D D, but that's incorrect.

Let me correct that.

n=3, s=U D U

- Alice chooses coin 0 (U), removes it, flips coins 1 and 2.

- s[1]=D flips to U, s[2]=U flips to D.

- So, s becomes U D.

- Bob's turn: chooses coin 0 (U), removes it, flips coins 1 and (assuming circularly) coin 2 (which is D, but since coin 0 is removed, perhaps it's not flipped twice).

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that if there are only two coins left, choosing one removes it, and the other won't be flipped.

In this case, after Alice's move, there are two coins left: U and D.

Bob chooses the U, removes it, and the other D isn't flipped.

So, s becomes D.

Alice's turn: no U to choose, so she loses.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

So, in this case, even though the number of U is even, Alice loses, which matches the program's output.

Earlier, I miscounted the remaining coins after Alice's move.

So, the program seems correct in this case.

Another test case:

n=4, s=U U D D

Number of U is 2 (even), program returns 'NO'.

Simulate:

- Alice chooses coin 0 (U), removes it, flips coins 1 and 3.

- s becomes D U D D

- Bob chooses coin 1 (U), removes it, flips coins 0 and 2.

- s becomes U D D D

- Alice has no U to choose, so she loses.

- 'NO' is correct.

Another test case:

n=3, s=U U D

Number of U is 2 (even), program returns 'NO'.

Simulate:

- Alice chooses coin 0 (U), removes it, flips coins 1 and 2.

- s becomes D D D

- Bob has no U to choose, so he loses. Alice wins. 'YES' should be returned, but program returns 'NO'.

Wait, this contradicts the program's output.

Wait, according to the program, for even number of U, it returns 'NO', but in this simulation, Alice wins.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but earlier in n=3, s=U D U, Alice loses, which matches 'NO'.

But in n=3, s=U U D, Alice wins, which contradicts the program's 'NO'.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it than just the parity of U.

Maybe the arrangement of U and D matters.

In n=3, s=U D U (even U, Alice loses)

n=3, s=U U D (even U, Alice wins)

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the arrangement.

Hence, the program is flawed.

It should consider not just the number of U, but their positions.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
