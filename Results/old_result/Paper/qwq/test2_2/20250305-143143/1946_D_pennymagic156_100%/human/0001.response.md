Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked.

We have an array of numbers, and we need to divide it into segments such that certain conditions are met. Specifically, we need to maximize the number of segments k, where each segment's XOR value, when OR'ed together, is less than or equal to a given number x.

First, let's break down the conditions:

1. The first segment must start at index 1.

2. The last segment must end at index n.

3. Each segment must be continuous, meaning l_i <= r_i, and the next segment starts right after the previous one ends, i.e., r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}.

4. The bitwise OR of the XOR values of all segments should be <= x.

Our goal is to maximize k, the number of such segments, or return -1 if it's not possible.

Given the constraints, with t <= 10^4 test cases and n <= 10^5 per test case, and the sum of n across all test cases <= 10^5, we need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let's think about how to approach this.

First, XOR is associative and commutative, which means the XOR of a segment from l to r can be computed efficiently if we precompute prefix XORs.

Let's define prefix XOR array, where prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i].

Then, XOR of segment [l, r] is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Similarly, OR is also associative, so the OR of multiple XOR values can be computed by taking the OR of each segment's XOR.

Our condition is that the OR of all segment XORs should be <= x.

We need to maximize the number of segments k, under this constraint.

One way to approach this is to try to make as many segments as possible, each with an XOR value that, when OR'ed with the previous ones, doesn't exceed x.

But directly implementing this might be too slow for large n and t.

We need a smarter way.

Let's consider the properties of XOR and OR.

XOR flips bits based on parity, while OR sets bits if they are set in any of the operands.

Given that, perhaps we can look at each bit position independently.

Since XOR and OR are bitwise operations, analyzing each bit separately might simplify the problem.

Let's consider each bit from 0 to 29 (since a_i < 2^30).

For each bit, we can analyze how it behaves in the XOR and OR operations across segments.

Our goal is to maximize k such that the OR of all segment XORs is <= x.

This means that for each bit position, the OR of that bit across all segment XORs should not exceed the corresponding bit in x.

In other words, for each bit j, if the jth bit in x is 0, then the jth bit in the OR of all segment XORs must be 0, meaning that for this bit, in all segments, the XOR of the segment must have the jth bit as 0.

If the jth bit in x is 1, then for that bit, the OR of all segment XORs can be either 0 or 1.

So, for bits where x has a 0, we need to ensure that in all segments, the XOR for that bit is 0.

For bits where x has a 1, we have more flexibility.

This seems like we can process each bit independently and combine the results.

Let me think about how to maximize k under these constraints.

One idea is to iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and make decisions based on whether the bit in x is 0 or 1.

Let me outline a step-by-step approach:

1. Precompute the prefix XOR array for the array a.

2. For each bit position from 31 to 0 (since a_i < 2^30, we have 30 bits):

a. Check the bit in x.

b. If the bit in x is 0, then we need to ensure that for all segments, the XOR of the segment does not have this bit set.

c. If the bit in x is 1, we have more flexibility.

3. For bits where x has a 0, we need to make sure that in all segments, the XOR for that bit is 0.

This implies that within each segment, the number of times this bit is set in the elements of the segment must be even, so that the XOR is 0.

4. For bits where x has a 1, we can have segments where the XOR for that bit is either 0 or 1.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let's consider that the OR of the XORs must be <= x.

This is equivalent to saying that for each bit j, the OR of the jth bits of all segment XORs is <= the jth bit of x.

In other words, for each bit j where x[j] = 0, the jth bit in all segment XORs must be 0.

For bits where x[j] = 1, the jth bit in segment XORs can be either 0 or 1.

So, for bits where x[j] = 0, we need to ensure that in all segments, the XOR of the segment for that bit is 0.

For bits where x[j] = 1, we have no restriction on that bit for the segments.

Our goal is to maximize k, the number of segments, under these constraints.

This seems tricky because we have to consider multiple bits simultaneously.

Perhaps we can process the bits in order, starting from the most significant bit, and make decisions based on whether the bit in x is 0 or 1.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Iterate through the bits from 29 to 0 (since a_i < 2^30).

- For each bit, check if it's set in x.

- If the bit is not set in x (x[j] = 0), then we need to ensure that for all segments, the XOR of the segment for that bit is 0.

- If the bit is set in x (x[j] = 1), we have more flexibility.

Wait, but we need to maximize k, the number of segments.

So perhaps we can try to split the array into as many segments as possible, while ensuring that for bits where x[j] = 0, the XOR of each segment for that bit is 0.

For bits where x[j] = 1, we can have segments where the XOR for that bit is either 0 or 1.

But OR'ing all these together should still satisfy the condition.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k, the number of segments, and try to see if it's possible to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <= x.

Then, I can binary search on k to find the maximum k that satisfies this condition.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, this approach would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and OR.

Since OR is a monotonic operation, adding more segments can only increase the OR value or keep it the same.

Wait, no. Actually, adding more segments can decrease the OR value because OR'ing more values can set more bits to 1.

Wait, no. OR'ing more values can only set more bits to 1, or keep them the same.

So, if I have k segments, and I split one of the segments into two, the new OR can only be greater than or equal to the previous OR.

Wait, actually, OR'ing more values can set more bits to 1, so the OR can only increase or stay the same when adding more segments.

Therefore, to minimize the OR, I should use as few segments as possible.

But our goal is to maximize k, the number of segments, while keeping the OR <= x.

This seems conflicting.

Wait, but in the problem, we need to maximize k such that the OR of the segment XORs is <= x.

Given that OR can only increase or stay the same when adding segments, this means that as k increases, the OR can only increase or stay the same.

Therefore, there must be a maximum k where adding another segment would make the OR exceed x.

So, I can binary search on k, the number of segments, and check if it's possible to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <= x.

But with t=1e4 and n=1e5, this might be too slow if each check is O(n).

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, maybe I can precompute something to make this faster.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the overall XOR of the entire array and see how it relates to x.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the following:

- Compute the prefix XOR array, where prefix[i] is the XOR of a[1] to a[i].

- Then, the XOR of segment [l, r] is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

- The OR of all segment XORs should be <= x.

I need to maximize k, the number of segments.

Let me consider that if I have k segments, the OR of their XORs should be <= x.

I need to find the maximum k such that this condition holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as partitioning the array into k segments where the OR of their XORs is <= x.

This sounds similar to some optimization problems, but I need a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the extreme cases:

- If k=1, then the OR is just the XOR of the entire array, which is prefix[n].

- If k=2, then the OR is prefix[r1] XOR prefix[l2-1], where l2 = r1 + 2, since r1 +1 = l2.

Wait, no, l2 = r1 +1.

Wait, in the problem, r_i +1 = l_{i+1}.

So, for k=2, segments are [1, r1] and [r1+1, n].

Wait, no, more generally, for k segments, the segments are [l1, r1], [l2, r2], ..., [lk, rk], with l1=1, rk=n, and r_i +1 = l_{i+1}.

So, it's a partition of the array into k consecutive segments.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says l_i <= r_i for all i from 1 to k, and r_i +1 = l_{i+1} for all i from 1 to k-1.

So, it's a partition of the array into k consecutive segments, starting at 1 and ending at n.

So, it's like splitting the array into k parts where each part is a continuous segment, starting from the beginning to the end.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3, k=2, segments [1,1] and [2,3], which fits.

So, it's a partition into k consecutive segments.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the XOR for each possible segment and then try to choose k segments that satisfy the OR condition.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Iterate through the array and try to maximize k by making segments as small as possible, but only if they satisfy the OR condition.

- Start with k=1, which is the entire array, and check if its XOR is <=x.

- If yes, try to split it into two segments and check if both segments' XOR OR'ed is <=x.

- Continue splitting until the condition is no longer satisfied.

But this seems too slow for large n and t.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the properties of OR and XOR.

Since OR is idempotent and associative, maybe I can consider the bits independently.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the bits from the most significant to the least significant and make decisions based on whether the bit is set in x or not.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have the entire array, and I want to split it into k segments.

I can try to split it into two segments: [1, r1] and [r1+1, n].

Then, the OR of their XORs should be <=x.

I can try to find the maximum k for each possible r1.

But this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position, and j is the current OR value.

But with j up to 2^30, that's not feasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that OR is a monotonic operation, meaning that adding more segments can only increase the OR or keep it the same.

Therefore, to maximize k, I should try to make segments as small as possible, but ensure that the OR condition holds.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=3, x=1, and a=[1,2,3], splitting into [1,1] and [2,3] gives OR of (1) | (2^3=1) = 1, which is <=x=1.

If I try to split into three segments: [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], their XORs are 1, 2, 3, and OR is 1|2|3=3, which is >1, so it's invalid.

Hence, k=2 is the maximum.

So, in this case, making smaller segments doesn't help because the OR increases.

In the second test case, n=2, x=2, a=[1,1].

Splitting into [1,1] and [2,2], OR is 1|1=1 <=2, so k=2.

In the third test case, n=2, x=2, a=[1,3].

Splitting into [1,1] and [2,2], OR is 1|3=3 >2, so only k=1 is possible.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1, which is acceptable.

Wait, in the third test case, it's allowed to have k=1, which is the entire array's XOR is 1^3=2, and 2<=2, so k=1 is acceptable.

But splitting into two segments is not allowed because 1|3=3>2.

Hence, the maximum k is 1.

In the fourth test case, n=2, x=3, a=[0,0].

Splitting into [1,1] and [2,2], OR is 0|0=0 <=3, so k=2.

In the fifth test case, n=3, x=2, a=[0,0,1].

Splitting into [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], OR is 0|0|1=1 <=2, so k=3.

In the sixth test case, n=4, x=2, a=[1,3,3,7].

Let's see:

- Entire array XOR is 1^3^3^7=1^0^7=1^7=6, which is >2, so k=1 is invalid.

- Split into [1,2] and [3,4]: XORs are 1^3=2 and 3^7=4, OR is 2|4=6 >2.

- Split into [1,1], [2,4]: XORs are 1 and 3^3^7=0^7=7, OR is 1|7=7 >2.

- Split into [1,3] and [4,4]: XORs are 1^3^3=1^0=1 and 7, OR is 1|7=7 >2.

- So, no way to split into k>=1, but in the sample output, it's -1, meaning no such k exists.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, x=2, a=[1,3,3,7], the output is -1, meaning no valid k.

In the seventh test case, n=2, x=2, a=[2,3], OR is 2|3=3 >2, so only k=1 is possible, which is XOR=2^3=1 <=2, so k=1.

In the eighth test case, n=5, x=0, a=[0,1,2,2,1], OR must be 0.

So, the entire array's XOR is 0^1^2^2^1=0, which is <=0, so k=1 is acceptable.

But perhaps larger k is possible.

Let's try k=2: [1,3] and [4,5], XORs are 0^1^2=3 and 2^1=3, OR is 3|3=3 >0.

Not acceptable.

k=1 is the only option, which matches OR=0<=0.

Hence, output is 1.

So, in this case, k=1 is acceptable.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2, which means k=2 is acceptable.

Wait, but according to my calculation, k=2 gives OR=3|3=3 >0, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, a=[0,1,2,2,1], for k=2:

- [1,2] and [3,5], XORs are 0^1=1 and 2^2^1=1, OR is 1|1=1 <=0? No, 1>0.

- [1,1] and [2,5], XORs are 0 and 1^2^2^1=0, OR is 0|0=0 <=0.

Ah, so k=2 is acceptable with segments [1,1] and [2,5], OR=0|0=0 <=0.

Hence, k=2 is acceptable.

So, in this case, k=2 is better than k=1.

Therefore, in the sample input, for the last test case, the output is 2.

So, I need to maximize k.

Given this, I need a way to find the maximum k for each test case.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently.

One idea is to use the properties of XOR and OR to find the maximum k.

Given that OR is monotonic when adding more segments, I need to find the maximum k where the OR of the XORs of the segments is <=x.

I can try to split the array into as many segments as possible while maintaining this condition.

Let me consider processing the array and trying to split it into segments where each segment's XOR contributes minimally to the OR.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Compute the prefix XOR array.

- Then, for a given k, find if there exists a way to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <=x.

- To maximize k, I can iterate and try to make segments as small as possible, whenever possible.

But I need to ensure that the OR condition holds.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and try to make segments where each segment's XOR is as small as possible in terms of bits set.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the bits one by one, starting from the most significant bit.

For each bit, if the corresponding bit in x is 0, then in all segments, the XOR for that bit must be 0.

If the bit in x is 1, then the XOR for that bit in the segments can be either 0 or 1.

I can process the bits from high to low, and for each bit where x has a 0, I need to ensure that in all segments, the XOR for that bit is 0.

For bits where x has a 1, I have more flexibility.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have a bit position b.

If x & (1 << b) == 0, then for all segments, the XOR of that bit must be 0.

Else, it can be 0 or 1.

So, for bits where x has a 0, I need to make sure that in all segments, the XOR of that bit is 0.

This means that within each segment, the number of times that bit is set in the elements of the segment must be even, so that the XOR is 0.

For bits where x has a 1, I can have segments where the XOR for that bit is either 0 or 1.

My goal is to maximize k, the number of segments, under the constraints for the bits where x has a 0.

Wait, perhaps I can process the bits where x has a 0 first, and then handle the bits where x has a 1.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, consider the bits where x has a 0.

For these bits, in all segments, the XOR must be 0.

This means that for each such bit, in every segment, the number of times it is set in the segment must be even.

To satisfy this for multiple bits simultaneously, I need to find a way to split the array into segments where, for all these bits, the number of times they are set in each segment is even.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can handle one bit at a time.

Wait, actually, since XOR is involved, I can consider the constraints for each bit independently and then combine them.

Wait, but XOR is over multiple bits, so perhaps that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of constraints for each bit where x has a 0.

For each such bit, I need to ensure that in every segment, the XOR of that bit is 0.

This is equivalent to saying that in each segment, the number of times that bit is set is even.

Given that, I can model this as needing to split the array into segments where, for each bit with x[b] = 0, the number of times that bit is set in each segment is even.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Let me consider an alternative approach.

Suppose I fix the number of segments k, and try to find if it's possible to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <=x.

Then, I can binary search on k to find the maximum k that satisfies this condition.

But with t=1e4 and n=1e5, this might be too slow unless each check is O(1) or O(log n).

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the OR of the XORs is equal to the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments.

Let me denote s1 = XOR of segment 1, s2 = XOR of segment 2, ..., sk = XOR of segment k.

Then, s1 | s2 | ... | sk <= x.

I need to maximize k such that this condition holds.

Let me consider that s1 | s2 | ... | sk <= x is equivalent to saying that for each bit b where x does not have that bit set, none of the s1 to sk have that bit set.

In other words, for each bit b with x & (1<<b) == 0, for all segments, s_i & (1<<b) == 0.

For bits where x & (1<<b) == 1, there is no restriction on s_i & (1<<b).

So, for bits where x has a 0, I need all s_i to have 0 in that bit.

For bits where x has a 1, s_i can have either 0 or 1 in that bit.

My goal is to maximize k under these constraints.

Let me consider processing the bits where x has a 0, because those are the restrictive bits.

For each such bit, I need to ensure that in all segments, the XOR for that bit is 0.

This means that within each segment, the number of times that bit is set in the elements of the segment must be even.

To satisfy this for multiple bits simultaneously, I need to find a way to split the array into segments where, for all these bits, the number of times they are set in each segment is even.

This sounds like I need to group the array in such a way that for these bits, the parity is even within each segment.

Let me consider that the constraints for different bits are independent, so I can process them one by one and take the intersection of the possible splits.

But this seems too slow for large n and t.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for bits where x has a 0, I need to make sure that in all segments, the XOR for that bit is 0.

This is equivalent to saying that in each segment, the number of times that bit is set is even.

This can be modeled using the concept of runs or parity changes.

Let me consider that for a given bit b, I can keep track of the cumulative XOR up to each position for that bit.

Then, to have the XOR in a segment [l, r] equal to 0 for bit b, the cumulative XOR up to r should be equal to the cumulative XOR up to l-1 for that bit.

So, for bit b, I can compute the prefix XOR array for that bit.

Then, for segments [l, r], the XOR for bit b is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

To have this equal to 0, prefix[r] should be equal to prefix[l-1].

Therefore, for bit b, to have all segment XORs equal to 0, the prefix XOR for bit b should be constant within each segment.

In other words, within each segment, the prefix XOR for bit b shouldn't change.

Wait, but prefix XOR for bit b is a single bit.

Wait, prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] = 0 implies prefix[r] = prefix[l-1].

So, for bit b, within a segment, prefix[r] should be equal to prefix[l-1].

But prefix[r] for bit b is the XOR of a[1] to a[r] for bit b.

So, for a segment [l, r], prefix[r] = prefix[l-1].

This means that the XOR from l to r for bit b is 0.

So, within each segment, for bit b, the XOR should be 0.

Given that, to maximize k, I need to split the array into segments where, for each bit b with x[b] = 0, the XOR within the segment for bit b is 0.

This needs to hold for all such bits simultaneously.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for multiple bits, I need to ensure that their combined XOR within each segment satisfies the condition for all bits where x[b] = 0.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the combined prefix XOR for all bits where x[b] = 0.

Let me denote B as the set of bits where x[b] = 0.

Then, for each segment, the XOR of a[l] to a[r] for all bits in B should be 0.

Wait, more precisely, for each bit b in B, the XOR of a[l] to a[r] for bit b should be 0.

This is equivalent to saying that the combined XOR for all bits in B should be 0.

But since XOR is independent for each bit, I can treat them separately.

Wait, but I need to combine them because I need all these conditions to hold simultaneously.

Let me consider that for each bit b in B, I can compute the prefix XOR for that bit.

Then, for a segment [l, r], the XOR for bit b is prefix[r][b] XOR prefix[l-1][b].

To have this equal to 0 for all b in B, prefix[r][b] must equal prefix[l-1][b] for all b in B.

This means that the combination of prefix[r][b] for b in B should be equal to prefix[l-1][b] for b in B.

So, for all b in B, prefix[r][b] == prefix[l-1][b].

This is equivalent to saying that the bits in B of prefix[r] are equal to the bits in B of prefix[l-1].

Hence, within each segment, the prefix[r] and prefix[l-1] should have the same values for bits in B.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Let me consider that B is the set of bits where x[b] = 0.

Let me define mask = x, which is the bits that are allowed to be set in the OR.

Then, for bits not in mask (i.e., bits where x[b] = 0), I need to ensure that in all segments, the XOR for those bits is 0.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the bits where x[b] = 0 as constraints that need to be satisfied.

Let me consider that the OR of all segment XORs should be <= x.

This is equivalent to saying that for each bit b not in x (i.e., x[b] = 0), none of the segment XORs have that bit set.

In other words, for bits b where x[b] = 0, in all segments, s_i[b] = 0.

For bits b where x[b] = 1, s_i[b] can be 0 or 1.

Hence, for bits b where x[b] = 0, in all segments, the XOR of a[l] to a[r] for bit b must be 0.

For bits b where x[b] =
