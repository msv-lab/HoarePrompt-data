Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, the task is to create a checkerboard pattern based on an integer n. The size of the checkerboard is 2n by 2n, and it's made up of 2x2 squares that alternate between '# ' and '. ', with the top-left cell being '# '.

First, I need to understand what a checkerboard pattern is. A checkerboard is a grid where adjacent squares have different symbols, like a chessboard. In this case, it's made up of 2x2 blocks instead of single cells, which makes it a bit different from a standard checkerboard.

So, for n=1, the grid is 2x2, and it should be all '# ' since it's the top-left block. For n=2, it's 4x4, and it should have two 2x2 blocks of '# ' followed by two 2x2 blocks of '. ', and so on, alternating in rows and columns.

Looking at the example provided:

- For n=1:

  ##

  ##

- For n=2:

  ##..

  ##..

  ..##

  ..##

- For n=3:

  ##..##

  ##..##

  ..##..

  ..##..

  ##..##

  ##..##

- For n=4:

  ##..##..

  ##..##..

  ..##..##

  ..##..##

  ##..##..

  ##..##..

  ..##..##

  ..##..##

I need to reproduce this pattern for any given n between 1 and 20.

Now, the program provided seems to handle specific cases for n=1 to n=4 and prints the corresponding patterns directly. For n beyond 4, it prints "No esta en el rango," which means "Not in the range." But according to the problem, n can be from 1 to 20, so this is a problem because it only handles up to n=4.

Moreover, the problem mentions that there are t test cases, each with its own n. The program reads t and then reads t values of n, which is correct. However, the way it handles the output for each n is by hardcoding the patterns for n=1 to n=4, which is not scalable or general.

A correct solution should generate the pattern dynamically based on the value of n, rather than hardcoding it for specific n values.

Let me think about how to generate the pattern for any n.

Given that the grid is 2n x 2n, and each 2x2 block alternates between '# ' and '. ', starting with '# ' in the top-left corner.

So, for each 2x2 block, depending on its position, it should be either all '# ' or all '. '.

To determine whether a block should be '# ' or '. ', I can use the indices of the block's row and column.

Let's denote the block's row index as i (from 0 to n-1) and column index as j (from 0 to n-1). If i + j is even, the block should be '# ', otherwise, it should be '. '.

Then, for each block, I can print two rows of two characters each, either '# ' or '. ', repeated appropriately.

Wait, actually, since each block is 2x2, and the entire grid is 2n x 2n, I need to iterate over the rows and columns of the grid, not just the blocks.

Alternatively, I can iterate over the blocks and print their content based on whether the block should be '# ' or '. '.

Let me try to think of a better way.

First, I need to generate 2n rows, each consisting of 2n characters.

But since the blocks are 2x2, I can think in terms of these blocks.

For example, for n=1, there is one block, which is '# '.

For n=2, there are four blocks: top-left is '# ', top-right is '. ', bottom-left is '. ', bottom-right is '# '.

Wait, looking at the example for n=2:

##..

##..

..##

..##

So, the top-left 2x2 block is '# ', the top-right is '. ', bottom-left is '. ', bottom-right is '# '.

Similarly, for n=3, it's a 6x6 grid, with a 3x3 grid of 2x2 blocks, alternating in a checkerboard pattern.

So, in general, for any n, I have a n x n grid of 2x2 blocks, and each block is either '# ' or '. ' based on its position.

To determine whether a block should be '# ' or '. ', I can use the sum of its row and column indices. If the sum is even, it's '# ', otherwise, it's '. '.

Wait, no. In the example for n=2:

- Block (0,0): '# '

- Block (0,1): '. '

- Block (1,0): '. '

- Block (0,1): '# '

So, it's alternating based on the sum of i and j. If i + j is even, it's '# ', else it's '. '.

Wait, for block (0,0): 0 + 0 = 0, which is even -> '# '

Block (0,1): 0 + 1 = 1, which is odd -> '. '

Block (1,0): 1 + 0 = 1, odd -> '. '

Block (1,1): 1 + 1 = 2, even -> '# '

That matches the example.

So, for each block at position (i,j), if i + j is even, print '# ' in all four positions of the block; else, print '. '.

Now, to implement this, I need to iterate over each row and column of the grid.

But since each block is 2x2, I can iterate over the blocks first, and for each block, print two rows of two characters each.

In code, that would look like:

for each block row i from 0 to n-1:

for each block column j from 0 to n-1:

if i + j is even:

print '##' followed by '##'

else:

print '..' followed by '..'

But wait, in the example for n=2:

##.. ##..

##.. ##..

..## ..##

..## ..##

So, it's not exactly '##' followed by '##' for even blocks, because in the example, the top-right block is '..' but it's printed across multiple rows.

I think I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, I can iterate over each row and column of the grid directly, determining whether each 2x2 block should be '# ' or '. ' based on their positions.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate over each row y from 0 to 2n - 1, and within each row, iterate over each column x from 0 to 2n - 1, and determine whether the cell (y,x) should be '# ' or '. ' based on some condition.

Looking at the pattern, within each 2x2 block, all cells are the same. So, to determine which 2x2 block a cell belongs to, I can use floor division of y and x by 2.

So, block_row = y // 2

block_col = x // 2

Then, if block_row + block_col is even, the cell should be '# ', else '. '.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, in code, it would be:

for y in range(2*n):

for x in range(2*n):

if (y//2 + x//2) % 2 == 0:

print('# ', end='')

else:

print('. ', end='')

But looking at the example output, it seems that within each 2x2 block, all cells are the same, but the symbols are '# ' and '. ', with the top-left being '# '.

Wait, but in the example for n=1:

##

##

Which is 2x2 grid with all '# ', which matches the condition since (0//2 + 0//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(0//2 + 1//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(1//2 + 0//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(1//2 + 1//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

Which is correct for n=1.

For n=2:

##..

##..

..##

..##

So, for y=0, x=0 to x=3:

(0//2 + 0//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(0//2 + 1//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(0//2 + 2//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

(0//2 + 3//2) % 2 == 0 -> '# '

But in the example, it's ##.., which suggests that x//2 for x=0 and x=1 is 0, and for x=2 and x=3 is 1.

So, for y=0 (block_row=0), x=0 and x=1 (block_col=0): 0 + 0 = 0, even -> '# '

x=2 and x=3 (block_col=1): 0 + 1 = 1, odd -> '. '

Which matches the first row: ##..

Similarly, y=1 (block_row=0), same as above.

y=2 (block_row=1), x=0 and x=1 (block_col=0): 1 + 0 = 1, odd -> '. '

x=2 and x=3 (block_col=1): 1 + 1 = 2, even -> '# '

Which matches the third and fourth rows: ..## and ..##

So, the condition seems correct.

Therefore, the general approach is:

- For each row y from 0 to 2n - 1:

- For each column x from 0 to 2n - 1:

- block_row = y // 2

- block_col = x // 2

- if (block_row + block_col) % 2 == 0:

- print '# ', else print '. '

- print a newline after each row

Additionally, since there are multiple test cases, I need to repeat this process for each test case, without empty lines between them.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it only handles n from 1 to 4 by hardcoding the output, and for n beyond 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". This is incorrect because n can be up to 20, and we need to handle any n in that range dynamically.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible values of n as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
