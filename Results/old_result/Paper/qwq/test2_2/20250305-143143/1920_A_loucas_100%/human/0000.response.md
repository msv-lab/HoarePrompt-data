Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite.

First, I need to understand the input format. Each test case starts with an integer n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the value associated with that constraint.

The problem also mentions that no two constraints are the exact same, meaning all pairs (a, x) are distinct.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Step 1: Parse the input.

I need to read the number of test cases, t, and then for each test case, read n and the n constraints.

Step 2: Categorize the constraints.

I should separate the constraints into three categories based on a:

- Type 1: k >= x

- Type 2: k <= x

- Type 3: k != x

Step 3: Determine the range of k.

Since there are constraints of type 1 and type 2, which define lower and upper bounds for k, I can find the overall range of k by taking the maximum of all lower bounds (from type 1 constraints) and the minimum of all upper bounds (from type 2 constraints).

So, the possible k values are between max_lower and min_upper, inclusive.

Step 4: Account for the type 3 constraints.

Type 3 constraints exclude specific values of k. So, from the range determined in step 3, I need to subtract the number of k values that are excluded by the type 3 constraints.

But I have to make sure that the excluded values are within the range defined by type 1 and type 2 constraints.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible k values.

The total number of integers k that satisfy all constraints would be the number of integers in the range [max_lower, min_upper], minus the number of integers in that range that are excluded by type 3 constraints.

Let me formalize this.

Let L be the maximum of all x where a=1 (type 1 constraints).

Let U be the minimum of all x where a=2 (type 2 constraints).

Then, the initial number of possible k values is U - L + 1, provided that U >= L. If U < L, then there are no possible k values.

Then, for each type 3 constraint k != x, if x is within the range [L, U], I need to subtract 1 from the total count.

But I need to ensure that no two constraints are the same, so no duplicate exclusions.

Also, since it's guaranteed that the answer is finite, I don't have to worry about infinite ranges.

Let me look at the example to verify my approach.

Example 1:

Input:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4.

Constraints:

- k >= 3

- k <= 10

- k != 1

- k != 5

So, L = max of 3 = 3

U = min of 10 = 10

Initial count: 10 - 3 + 1 = 8

Exclusions: k !=1 (but 1 is less than L, so not in range) and k !=5 (which is within [3,10]), so subtract 1.

Total: 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

2

1 5

2 4

n=2

Constraints:

- k >=5

- k <=4

L = max(5) =5

U = min(4) =4

Initial count: 4 -5 +1 = 0 (since 4 < 5)

Total: 0, matches sample output.

Another sample:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

n=10

Constraints:

- k !=6

- k !=7

- k >=2

- k >=7

- k !=100

- k !=44

- k <=100

- k <=98

- k >=3

- k !=99

So, L = max(2,7,3) =7

U = min(100,98)=98

Initial count: 98 -7 +1 =92

Exclusions: k !=6 (but 6 < L), k !=7 (within [7,98]), k !=100 (outside [7,98]), k !=44 (within [7,98]), k !=99 (outside [7,98])

So, exclusions within range: 7 and 44.

Total exclusions: 2

Total k: 92 -2 =90, matches sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Program code:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

num = min(less) - max(big) + 1

if num < 1:

print(0)

continue

for i in no:

if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

num -= 1

print(num)

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, loop.

2. For each test case, it initializes lists less, big, no for constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3 respectively.

3. It reads n, the number of constraints.

4. It reads n lines of constraints, splitting into x and a.

5. Based on x, it appends a to the corresponding list:

- x=1: big.append(a)

- x=2: less.append(a)

- x=3: no.append(a)

6. It calculates num = min(less) - max(big) + 1

- This corresponds to the initial count of possible k values in the range [max(big), min(less)]

7. If num < 1, it prints 0, since no k values satisfy the constraints.

8. Otherwise, it iterates through the type 3 constraints (no list) and for each i in no, if i is within the range [max(big), min(less)], it subtracts 1 from num.

9. Finally, it prints num.

This seems to match my earlier reasoning.

Let me check with the first sample input:

n=4

Constraints:

1 3 -> big=[3]

2 10 -> less=[10]

3 1 -> no=[1]

3 5 -> no=[1,5]

Then, num = min(less)=10 - max(big)=3 +1 =8

Since num >=1, proceed.

Check exclusions:

i=1: 1 <=10 and 1 >=3? 1 >=3 is False, so skip.

i=5: 5 <=10 and 5 >=3, so num -=1 -> num=7

Print 7.

Matches sample output.

Good.

Second sample:

n=2

1 5 -> big=[5]

2 4 -> less=[4]

no=[]

num =4 -5 +1=0

Print 0.

Matches sample output.

Third sample:

n=10

big=[2,7,3]

less=[100,98]

no=[6,7,100,44,99]

num = min(less)=98 - max(big)=7 +1=92

Exclusions:

6: 6 <=98 and 6 >=7? 6 >=7 is False, skip.

7: 7 <=98 and 7 >=7, num -=1 ->91

100:100 <=98 and 100 >=7? 100 <=98 is False, skip.

44:44 <=98 and 44 >=7, num -=1 ->90

99:99 <=98 and 99 >=7? 99 <=98 is False, skip.

Print 90.

Matches sample output.

Seems correct.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

t=1

n=2

1 1

2 1

So, L=1, U=1

num=1-1+1=1

No type 3 constraints, so answer is 1.

Edge Case 2:

t=1

n=3

1 1

2 1

3 1

L=1, U=1, num=1

Exclusion: 1 is within [1,1], so num -=1 ->0

Answer is 0.

Edge Case 3:

t=1

n=3

1 1

2 3

3 2

L=1, U=3, num=3

Exclusion: 2 is within [1,3], num -=1 ->2

Possible k:1 and 3

Seems correct.

Edge Case 4:

t=1

n=4

1 1

2 10

3 5

3 5 -> but wait, constraints are unique, so this can't happen.

Wait, the problem says no two constraints are the same, so no duplicate (a,x) pairs.

So, two 3 5 constraints aren't allowed.

Hence, in practice, no duplicates.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=2

1 1

2 1

no type 3

num=1-1+1=1

Answer is 1.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=3

1 1

2 2

3 1

L=1, U=2, num=2

Exclusion:1 is within [1,2], num -=1 ->1

Possible k=2

Correct.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=3

1 1

2 1

3 1

L=1, U=1, num=1

Exclusion:1 is within [1,1], num -=1 ->0

Correct, no possible k.

Seems the program handles these cases correctly.

Let me consider if there are multiple type 1 or type 2 constraints.

t=1

n=3

1 2

1 3

2 5

big=[2,3], less=[5]

L=max(2,3)=3

U=min(5)=5

num=5-3+1=3

Possible k:3,4,5

If there are type 3 constraints:

3 4

Then, exclude 4, so num -=1 ->2

Possible k:3,5

Correct.

Seems accurate.

Let me think about large input sizes.

n can be up to 100, and t up to 500.

In terms of time, since operations are O(n), it should be fine.

No performance issues expected.

Also, constraints ensure that no two constraints are the same, so no need to handle duplicates.

Additionally, it's guaranteed that there is at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, so no need to handle cases where L or U are not defined.

I think the program correctly implements the required logic.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correct}}\]
