Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

We need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints together. The problem also guarantees that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite.

First, I need to parse the input correctly. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line has an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line is n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the value associated with that constraint.

Given that all constraints are distinct, I don't have to worry about duplicate constraints.

My goal is to find the number of integers k that satisfy all these constraints for each test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the range of k based on the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

Constraints of type 1: k >= x

Constraints of type 2: k <= x

Constraints of type 3: k != x

Since there is at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, the possible values of k are between the maximum of all "greater than or equal to" values and the minimum of all "less than or equal to" values.

So, find max_big = maximum of all x where a=1

Find min_less = minimum of all x where a=2

Then, the possible k values are k >= max_big and k <= min_less.

Now, among these k values, we need to exclude those k values that are equal to any x where a=3.

So, the total number of possible k values is min_less - max_big + 1, minus the number of x where a=3 and x is within this range.

Wait, but we have to make sure that k is an integer, which it is, since k is specified as an integer.

Let me formalize this:

1. Find the lower bound: maximum of all x where a=1.

2. Find the upper bound: minimum of all x where a=2.

3. The total number of possible k values is upper_bound - lower_bound + 1.

4. Then, subtract the number of x where a=3 and x is within this range.

This should give the final count of k values that satisfy all constraints.

Let me consider some examples to verify this logic.

Take the first example from the problem:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

Output:

7

So, n=4

Constraints:

1. k >= 3

2. k <= 10

3. k != 1

4. k != 5

First, lower_bound = max of [3] = 3

upper_bound = min of [10] = 10

Total possible k without considering k != x: 10 - 3 + 1 = 8

Now, exclude k=1 and k=5.

But k=1 is not in the range 3 to 10, so only exclude k=5.

So, 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

Input:

2

1 5

2 4

Output:

0

Here, n=2

Constraints:

1. k >= 5

2. k <= 4

Possible k: k >= 5 and k <= 4

This is impossible, so 0.

Correct.

Another one:

Input:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Output:

90

Let's compute:

n=10

Constraints:

1. k >= 2

2. k >= 7

3. k <= 100

4. k <= 98

5. k != 6

6. k != 7

7. k != 100

8. k != 44

9. k >= 3

10. k != 99

First, lower_bound = max of [2,7,3] = 7

upper_bound = min of [100,98] = 98

Total possible k: 98 - 7 + 1 = 92

Now, exclude k=6,7,100,44,99

But k=6 is less than lower_bound (7), so not in range.

k=7 is in range, so exclude.

k=100 is greater than upper_bound (98), so not in range.

k=44 is in range, so exclude.

k=99 is greater than upper_bound, so not in range.

So, exclude only k=7 and k=44.

92 - 2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Now, think about edge cases.

Case 1: Only two constraints, one of type 1 and one of type 2, with no type 3 constraints.

For example:

n=2

1 1

2 10

Then, possible k: 1 to 10, total 10.

Since no type 3 constraints, answer is 10.

Case 2: n=3

1 5

2 5

3 5

Possible k: k >=5 and k <=5, so k=5 only.

But k !=5, so no possible k.

Answer: 0

Case 3: n=3

1 1

2 10

3 15

Possible k: k from 1 to 10.

k !=15, but 15 is outside the range, so no exclusion.

Answer: 10

Case 4: n=4

1 1

2 10

3 5

3 7

Possible k: k from 1 to 10, exclude k=5 and k=7.

So, 10 - 2 = 8.

Wait, but if k=5 and k=7 are within the range, yes, exclude them.

Now, look at the program provided.

Let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

num = min(less) - max(big) + 1

if num < 1:

print(0)

continue

for i in no:

if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

num -= 1

print(num)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, then n lines of constraints.

It separates the constraints into three lists: big for type 1 (k >= x), less for type 2 (k <= x), and no for type 3 (k != x).

Then, it calculates num = min(less) - max(big) + 1, which is the total number of possible k without considering type 3 constraints.

If num < 1, it prints 0, which is correct if the range is invalid.

Otherwise, it iterates through the no list and for each x in no, if x is within the range [max(big), min(less)], it subtracts 1 from num.

Finally, it prints num.

This seems to match the logic I described earlier.

Let me verify with the sample inputs.

First sample:

n=4

Constraints:

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, big = [3]

less = [10]

no = [1,5]

num = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8

Then, check no list:

1 is less than 3, so not in range.

5 is between 3 and 10, so num -=1

So, 8 -1 =7, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Second sample:

n=2

1 5

2 4

big = [5]

less = [4]

num = 4 - 5 +1 =0

Since num <1, print 0.

Correct.

Third sample:

n=10

Constraints as per the sample.

big = [2,7,3]

less = [100,98]

no = [6,7,100,44,99]

num = 98 -7 +1 =92

Then, check no list:

6 <7, so not in range.

7 is in range, num -=1

100 >98, so not in range.

44 is in range, num -=1

99 >98, so not in range.

Total subtracted:2, so 92-2=90, matches sample output.

Good.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3

1 1

2 10

3 15

big = [1]

less = [10]

no = [15]

num =10 -1 +1=10

Check no list:

15 >10, so not in range.

So, num remains 10.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=3

1 5

2 5

3 5

big = [5]

less = [5]

no = [5]

num=5-5+1=1

Check no list:

5 is in range, so num -=1

So, 1-1=0

Correct.

Looks like the program handles these cases correctly.

Is there any edge case where it might fail?

Consider n=2

1 1

2 1

So, k >=1 and k<=1, num=1-1+1=1

No type 3 constraints, so answer is 1.

Correct.

Another case:

n=3

1 1

2 10

3 5

As above, correct.

Wait, what if there are multiple type 3 constraints for the same k.

But the problem says that no two constraints are the same, so no two constraints of type 3 with the same x.

Wait, the problem says: "It is guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same."

Given that a and x are both given, and a can be 1,2, or 3, and x is an integer.

So, no two constraints with the same a and x.

But different a and same x are allowed.

For example, 1 5 and 3 5 are allowed, since a is different.

Wait, but in this program, only constraints of a=3 are stored in the no list.

So, in this case, big would have [5] and no would have [5]

Then, num = min(less) - max(big) +1, assuming less has at least one value.

Wait, in this example, less is not provided.

Wait, n=3, constraints:

1 5

3 5

Need another constraint of type 2.

Wait, the problem says at least one of type 1 and one of type 2.

So, n=3, constraints:

1 5

2 10

3 5

Then, big=[5], less=[10], no=[5]

num=10-5+1=6

Then, check no list: 5 is in range, so num -=1

So, 6-1=5, which is correct.

Seems fine.

Another edge case:

n=4

1 1

2 10

3 1

3 10

big=[1]

less=[10]

no=[1,10]

num=10-1+1=10

Check no list:

1 is in range, num -=1

10 is in range, num -=1

So, 10-2=8

Possible k: from 1 to 10, exclude 1 and 10, so k=2 to 9, total 8.

Correct.

Seems correct.

Another case:

n=2

1 1

2 1

num=1-1+1=1

No type 3 constraints, so answer is 1.

k=1 is allowed.

Correct.

Another case:

n=3

1 2

2 4

3 3

num=4-2+1=3

Possible k:2,3,4

Exclude k=3

So, 3-1=2

Correct.

Seems the program handles this correctly.

Is there a case where min(less) < max(big), leading to num <0?

But the problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

So, if there is at least one type 1 and one type 2, and considering that, min(less) could be less than max(big), in which case num would be negative, but the program checks if num <1 and prints 0, which is correct.

For example:

n=2

1 5

2 4

num=4-5+1=0

Print 0, which is correct.

Good.

Another consideration: large numbers.

n=6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

2 900000000

3 900000001

Wait, n=6, but in the sample input, n=6 is different.

Anyway, in this program, it handles large numbers since x can be up to 10^9, and Python can handle large integers.

So, no issue there.

Also, the number of constraints is up to 100 per test case, and up to 500 test cases, which is manageable in Python.

Time constraints should be fine since the operations are straightforward.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all given constraints for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
