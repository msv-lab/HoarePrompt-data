Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in at least one of the first 31 bits.

The task is to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy this condition.

First, I need to understand the condition more clearly. For any two numbers x and y in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, the i-th bit of x should not be equal to the i-th bit of y. Wait, that seems impossible because if x and y are different numbers, there must be at least one bit where they differ. But the condition seems to be stronger than that.

Wait, let's read it again: "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." Hmm, that sounds like for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all 31 bits. That is, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits of x and y should be different.

Wait, that can't be right because if two numbers differ in all 31 bits, that means their XOR would be all 1's in those 31 bits. But that seems too restrictive. Let's see with an example.

Take n=2, a1=0 and a2=1. In binary, 0 is 000...0 and 1 is 000...1. They differ in the least significant bit, so can they be in the same group? Wait, according to the condition, for any pair, their bits should not match in any of the 31 bits. So, 0 and 1 differ in only one bit, so they cannot be in the same group because in the other 30 bits, they match (both are 0). So, they need to be in different groups.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem again: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." So, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i). That means, for every bit position, the bits of x and y are different.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR should have all 31 bits set to 1. Because if x XOR y = all 1's in 31 bits, then they differ in all bit positions.

Wait, but that's only possible if x and y are complements of each other in the first 31 bits. Because if x is some number, y would be x XOR (2^31 - 1), which is the complement of x in the first 31 bits.

So, in each group, you can have at most two numbers: x and its complement in the first 31 bits.

Wait, but the problem says "several groups", and we need to minimize the number of groups.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the maximal number of elements in any subset where no two elements have the same bit in any of the first 31 bits.

Wait, but from the above, it seems that in each group, you can have at most two elements: a number and its complement.

But let's look at the first example:

Input:

9

4

1 4 3 4

Output:

4

So, for n=4, a=[1,4,3,4], the minimal number of groups is 4. That suggests that each number must be in its own group, which makes sense because each pair of numbers has at least one matching bit in the first 31 bits.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, in each group, you can have a number and its complement. Let's check:

For a=1 (001), its complement is (110), which is 6 in binary. Is 6 in the list? No, so 1 is in its own group.

a=4 (100), complement is (011), which is 3. Is 3 in the list? Yes, a=3.

So, 4 and 3 can be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 4 groups, meaning each number is in its own group. So, perhaps there's something wrong with this reasoning.

Wait, let's check the pairs:

1 and 4: 1 is 001, 4 is 100. Comparing first 3 bits: positions 1: 1 vs 0, position 2: 0 vs 0, position 3: 0 vs 1. So, positions 1 and 3 differ, position 2 matches. Since there is at least one matching bit, they cannot be in the same group.

1 and 3: 1 is 001, 3 is 011. Positions 1:1 vs 1, position 2:0 vs 1, position 3:0 vs 0. Positions 1 and 3 match, position 2 differs. So, they cannot be in the same group.

4 and 3: 4 is 100, 3 is 011. Positions 1:0 vs 1, position 2:0 vs 1, position 3:0 vs 1. All positions differ. So, they can be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 4 groups, meaning each number is in its own group. But according to this, 4 and 3 can be in the same group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, the condition is: in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

In the pair 4 and 3, in binary:

4: 100

3: 011

Comparing:

Bit 1: 0 ≠ 1 → good

Bit 2: 0 ≠ 1 → good

Bit 3: 0 ≠ 1 → good

So, they can be in the same group.

But in the pair 4 and another 4:

4 and 4: all bits are equal, so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 3 and 1:

3: 011

1: 001

Bit 1:1 ≠ 1 → bad

Bit 2:0 ≠ 1 → good

Bit 3:0 ≠ 0 → bad

So, they cannot be in the same group.

So, in the input [1,4,3,4], we have:

- 4 and 3 can be together

- another 4 needs to be in its own group

- 1 needs to be in its own group

So, total groups: 3, but the output is 4. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i). So, not only that they differ in all bits, but also that for each bit, their bits are different.

Wait, that seems to be the same as saying that their XOR is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

But in the pair 4 and 3:

4: 100

3: 011

XOR: 111, which is all 1's in the first 3 bits.

Similarly, for 4 and 1:

4: 100

1: 001

XOR: 101, which is not all 1's in the first 3 bits.

So, perhaps the condition is that the XOR of any two numbers in the same group should be equal to (2^31 -1), which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

Wait, but in the pair 4 and 3, their XOR is 7 (111 in 3 bits), which is all 1's in the first 3 bits.

But in the pair 4 and 1, their XOR is 5 (101), which is not all 1's in the first 3 bits.

So, perhaps the condition is that any two numbers in the same group should have XOR equal to (2^31 -1).

But that would mean that each group can have at most two elements: a number and its complement.

But in that case, for [1,4,3,4], 4 and 3 can be in the same group because their XOR is all 1's in the first 3 bits.

But another 4 cannot be in the same group with them, so it needs its own group.

And 1 needs its own group because it cannot be paired with any other number in the list whose XOR is all 1's in the first 3 bits.

Hence, total groups: 3, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement: "any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of graph theory. Imagine each number as a node, and connect two nodes if they can be in the same group, i.e., their bits differ in all 31 positions.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the chromatic number of this graph, which is the minimum number of colors (groups) needed to color the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

But this approach is too slow for n up to 2e5.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way to group the numbers based on their bit patterns.

Let me consider the property that two numbers can be in the same group only if their XOR is equal to (2^31 -1), which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

Wait, but in the earlier example, 4 and 3 have XOR 7, which is 111 in the first 3 bits, but 2^31 -1 would be 111...1 for all 31 bits, not just the first 3 bits.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize this.

Let me denote mask = 2^31 -1, which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

Then, for two numbers x and y, x XOR y == mask means that they differ in all 31 bits.

So, if x and y differ in all 31 bits, they can be in the same group.

Hence, for each number x, its complement is x XOR mask, and they can be in the same group.

So, essentially, the numbers can be paired with their complements, and each pair forms a group.

If a number appears only once, it needs its own group.

If a number appears twice, and its complement doesn't appear, then each instance needs its own group.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,4,3,4], 4 appears twice, and 3 is the complement of 4.

So, 4 and 3 can be in one group, and the second 4 needs its own group, and 1 needs its own group, totaling 2 groups.

But the sample output is 4. So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that in a group, no two numbers have the same bit in any of the 31 bits, meaning their XOR is all 1's.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be equal to (2^31 -1).

In that case, each group can have at most two numbers: a number and its complement.

Then, the minimal number of groups is equal to the ceiling of the total number of pairs (number and its complement) divided by 2, plus the number of unpaired numbers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of union-find or grouping complements together.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each number, if it appears once, and its complement doesn't appear, it needs its own group.

If both a number and its complement appear, they can be in the same group.

If a number appears multiple times, and its complement doesn't appear, each duplicate needs its own group.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a graph where nodes are numbers, and edges connect numbers that can be in the same group.

In this case, two numbers can be in the same group only if they are complements of each other.

So, the graph would have edges only between a number and its complement.

Then, the connected components would be pairs of complements, or single nodes if a number doesn't have its complement.

The number of groups needed would be equal to the number of connected components.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,4,3,4], 4 and 3 are complements, forming one component, and 1 is a single node, and the second 4 is a duplicate, so another single node, totaling 3 components, but the sample output is 4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe duplicates need to be treated as separate nodes.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for each unique number, if its complement is also present, they can be in the same group.

If a number doesn't have its complement present, it needs its own group.

For duplicates, each duplicate needs its own group unless its complement is also duplicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the frequency of each number and its complement.

For each pair of a number and its complement, they can be in the same group.

If a number doesn't have its complement, it needs its own group.

If a number has more instances than its complement, the excess instances need their own groups.

Similarly, if a complement has more instances than the number, the excess complements need their own groups.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as matching as many number-complement pairs as possible, and the remaining unpaired numbers each need their own group.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of pairs that can be formed.

Each pair reduces the group count by one, as two elements can share a group.

Wait, but in this problem, forming pairs is restricted: only a number and its complement can be in the same group.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of pairs formed between a number and its complement.

Each such pair reduces the group count by one, as they share a group.

So, the formula would be:

ans = n - number_of_pairs

where number_of_pairs = sum over all unique numbers of min(freq[a], freq[complement_of_a])

Wait, but in the first example, a=[1,4,3,4]

complement of 1 is (2^31 -1) XOR 1

Wait, but for simplicity, let's assume mask = 2^31 -1

complement of a is mask XOR a

So, complement of 1 is mask XOR 1

complement of 4 is mask XOR 4

complement of 3 is mask XOR 3

But in the first example, a=[1,4,3,4], and output is 4.

According to the above formula:

number_of_pairs = min(freq[1], freq[mask XOR 1]) + min(freq[4], freq[mask XOR 4]) + min(freq[3], freq[mask XOR 3])

But in the first example, probably mask XOR 4 is 3, and mask XOR 3 is 4.

Wait, but in the first example, mask XOR 4 = 3, and mask XOR 3 =4.

So, number_of_pairs = min(1,0) + min(2,1) + min(1,2) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Then, ans = 4 - 2 = 2, but the sample output is 4.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust for the fact that each pair reduces the group count by one, but in reality, it's more nuanced.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a number and its complement are present, they can share a group, but duplicates still need separate groups.

So, for each unique number a, let complement = mask XOR a

Then, the number of pairs that can be formed is min(freq[a], freq[complement])

But in reality, for each pair formed, we reduce the group count by one.

But in the first example, according to this, number_of_pairs = min(1,0) + min(2,1) + min(1,2) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Then, ans = n - number_of_pairs = 4 - 2 = 2, but sample output is 4.

So, my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each pair formed allows two elements to share a group, but any remaining elements need their own groups.

So, in the first example, a=[1,4,3,4]

complement of 1 is mask XOR 1, which is not present (freq=0)

complement of 4 is mask XOR 4 =3, freq=1

complement of 3 is mask XOR 3 =4, freq=2

So, number_of_pairs = min(1,0) + min(2,1) + min(1,2) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Then, total groups = n - number_of_pairs =4 -2=2, but sample output is 4.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when a number and its complement are present, they can be in the same group, but duplicates still need separate groups.

So, for a=[1,4,3,4]

- 1 and its complement are not present, so 1 needs its own group

- 4 and its complement 3 are present, so they can be in one group

- the second 4 doesn't have its complement (since complement 3 is already used), so it needs its own group

- 3 is already paired with the first 4

So, total groups: 1 (for 1) + 1 (for 4 and 3) + 1 (for the second 4) =3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps in the group with 4 and 3, the second 4 cannot be in the same group as 3 because 4 and 4 have the same bits, which violates the condition.

So, 4 and 4 cannot be in the same group because they have matching bits in all positions.

Hence, 4 and 3 can be in one group, but the second 4 needs its own group, and 1 needs its own group, totaling 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing that 4 and 3 can be in the same group only if their XOR is equal to the mask, which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

Wait, in the first example, perhaps the mask is only considering the first 3 bits for simplicity, but in reality, it's 31 bits.

But for the sake of this example, let's assume that 4 and 3 differ in all considered bits, so they can be in the same group.

But the sample output is 4, suggesting that each number must be in its own group, which contradicts the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that in a group, no two numbers share the same bit in any of the first 31 bits.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of set bits.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are different.

That is, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y == mask.

Wait, but in the first example, 4 XOR 3 ==7, which is not equal to 2^31 -1.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that x XOR y should be equal to mask for any two numbers in the same group.

If that's the case, then in a group, you can have at most two numbers: a number and its complement.

In that case, for [1,4,3,4], 4 and 3 can be in one group, but the second 4 cannot be in the same group as 3 because 4 XOR 4 ==0, which is not equal to mask.

Similarly, 1 needs its own group because its complement is not present.

So, total groups: group1={1}, group2={4,3}, group3={4}.

But sample output is 4, so perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, maybe in the group with 4 and 3, you cannot add another 4 because 4 XOR 4 ==0, which is not equal to mask.

Hence, you need another group for the second 4.

So, group1={1}, group2={4,3}, group3={4}, group4={}

But that doesn't make sense because you can't have an empty group.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the maximal number of elements in any subset where no two elements have the same bit in any of the first 31 bits.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for each number, its complement is unique.

So, I can think of the numbers and their complements as pairs.

Then, the problem reduces to grouping these pairs in such a way that no two numbers in the same group share any bit in common.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to graph coloring, where each pair is a node, and edges connect pairs that cannot be in the same group.

But this seems too involved.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the maximal frequency of any number or its complement.

Wait, in the first example, the frequency of 4 is 2, so the minimal number of groups is 2, but sample output is 4.

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each pair of a number and its complement, they can be in the same group, but duplicates need separate groups.

So, for [1,4,3,4]:

- 1 needs its own group

- 4 and 3 can be in one group

- the second 4 needs its own group

So, total groups: 3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the condition is that in a group, no two numbers share any bit in common, not just that their XOR is equal to mask.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of bitwise AND.

If two numbers have a bitwise AND equal to zero, they can be in the same group.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Looking back at the problem, "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

That means, for every bit position, the bits of x and y are different.

That is, x AND y == 0 for all pairs in the group.

Wait, no. If x and y differ in all bits, then x AND y would be zero.

But in the earlier example, 4 and 3 are 100 and 011, their AND is 000, which is zero.

But 4 and 1 are 100 and 001, their AND is 000.

So, according to this, 4 and 1 could be in the same group, but according to the sample output, they can't.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for any two numbers in the group, their AND is zero.

But in reality, it's stronger: for any two numbers, for every bit position, their bits are different.

That is, for any two numbers, their XOR is equal to mask.

So, only pairs where x XOR y == mask can be in the same group.

Hence, each group can contain at most one pair: a number and its complement.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of valid pairs where x XOR y == mask.

Wait, but in the first example, there is one valid pair: 4 and 3.

So, number_of_pairs =1

Then, ans = n - number_of_pairs =4 -1=3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps each group can contain only one pair, and singles need their own groups.

So, in the first example, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}

But sample output is 4, so perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, maybe in group1={4,3}, but 4 and 1 cannot be in the same group because 4 AND 1 ==0, but according to the problem, their bits match in some positions.

Wait, according to the problem, in group1={4,3}, 4 is 100 and 3 is 011.

Comparing:

Bit 1: 0 ≠ 1

Bit 2: 0 ≠ 1

Bit 3: 1 ≠ 0

So, all bits differ, which satisfies the condition.

But 4 and 1: 4 is 100 and 1 is 001.

Comparing:

Bit 1:0 ≠ 0 → bad, both are 0, which matches

Bit 2:0 ≠ 0 → bad

Bit 3:1 ≠ 0 → good

So, in bits 1 and 2, they match, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, totaling 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

So, perhaps I'm missing that the second 4 cannot be in the same group as the first 4 or as the 3, but it needs its own group, and similarly, 1 needs its own group.

But why is the sample output 4? Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that in a group, for any two numbers, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

That is, for any two numbers in the group, their bits must differ in all positions.

So, in group1={4,3}, 4 and 3 differ in all bits, which is fine.

But group2={4,1}, 4 and 1 have bits that match in some positions, which is bad.

So, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, totaling 3 groups.

But sample output is 4, so perhaps 4 and 3 cannot be in the same group because their bits differ in all positions, but maybe there's another constraint.

Wait, perhaps in a group, no two numbers should have the same bit in any position, and also, no number should have all bits different from another number in the group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps in a group, the bits of all numbers should be pairwise different in all positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of graph coloring, where nodes are numbers, and edges connect numbers that cannot be in the same group.

Then, the minimal number of groups is the chromatic number of the graph.

But computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, and n can be up to 2e5, so this approach is not feasible.

Perhaps there is a better way to model this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of maximal matching.

Each number can be paired with its complement, and unpaired numbers need their own groups.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired numbers.

Wait, but in the first example, there is one pair (4,3) and two unpaired numbers (1 and the second 4), so total groups: 1 + 2 =3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second 4 cannot be unpaired; it needs its own group.

So, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, totaling 3 groups.

But sample output is 4, so perhaps there is a misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe in group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, group4={}

But we can't have an empty group.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that in a group, no two numbers share any bit in common, meaning their AND is zero.

But in group1={4,3}, 4 AND 3 =0, which is fine.

Group2={4}, which is fine.

Group3={1}, which is fine.

So, why is the sample output 4?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in a group, no two numbers share any bit in common, and also, no number shares any bit with any other number in the group.

Wait, that seems redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the group, their XOR is equal to mask.

So, in group1={4,3}, 4 XOR 3 ==7, which is not equal to 2^31 -1.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the group, their XOR is equal to mask.

In that case, only pairs where x XOR y == mask can be in the same group.

So, in the first example, 4 and 3 can be in the same group because 4 XOR 3 ==7, which may or may not be equal to mask (depending on mask's value).

Wait, mask is 2^31 -1, which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

In the first example, probably mask is considered to be all 1's in the first 3 bits, which is 7.

So, 4 XOR 3 ==7, which equals mask, so they can be in the same group.

Similarly, 4 XOR 4 ==0, which is not equal to mask, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, totaling 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps in group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, group4={}

But we can't have an empty group.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is that in a group, for any two numbers, their XOR is equal to mask.

In that case, each group can have at most two elements: a number and its complement.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of pairs where x XOR y == mask.

In the first example, number_of_pairs =1 (4 and 3), so ans =4 -1=3, but sample output is 4.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that each number can be in only one group, and each group can have at most one pair.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, totaling 3 groups.

But sample output is 4, so perhaps there is a constraint that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that in a group, no two numbers share any bit in common, meaning that for any two numbers, their AND is zero.

In that case, 4 and 3: 4 AND 3 ==0, so they can be in the same group.

4 and 1:4 AND 1 ==0, so they can be in the same group.

But 3 and 1:3 AND 1 ==1, which is not zero, so they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, that would change things.

So, in this case, group1={4,3}, group2={1}, group3={4}

But 4 and 4:4 AND 4 ==4, which is not zero, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={1}, group3={4}, totaling 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that in a group, for any two numbers, their XOR is equal to mask.

So, only pairs where x XOR y == mask can be in the same group.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={1}, group3={4}

But sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps each group can have only one pair, and singles need their own groups.

Hence, group1={4,3}, group2={4}, group3={1}, group4={}

But we can't have an empty group.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of pairs where x XOR y == mask, and each pair counts as one group, and singles need their own groups.

So, in the first example, number_of_pairs=1 (4 and 3), and number of singles=2 (1 and 4), so total groups=1 +2=3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the pairing is exclusive, meaning that once a number is paired, its complement cannot be paired with another number.

So, in the first example, 4 and 3 are paired, so the second 4 cannot be paired with anything, and 1 cannot be paired, so total groups=1 (for 4 and 3) +1 (for the second 4) +1 (for 1) +1 (for nothing, but can't have empty group), totaling 3 groups.

But sample output is 4.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Perhaps I should look at another example.

Take the second test case:

n=2

a=[0,2147483647]

2147483647 is 2^31 -1, which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

So, 0 and 2147483647: their XOR is 2147483647, which is equal to mask.

Hence, they can be in the same group.

Hence, total groups:1, which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=5

a=[476319172,261956880,2136179468,1671164475,1885526767]

Not sure about their binary representations, but presumably, some can be paired with their complements, and others can't.

The sample output is 3, which suggests that there are two pairs and one single, or something similar.

But I need a general approach.

Perhaps I should consider that the minimal number of groups is equal to the maximum frequency of any number or its complement.

So, for each unique number a, find its complement (mask XOR a), and count the frequency of a and its complement.

Then, for each such pair, the number of groups needed is equal to the frequency of a or its complement, whichever is higher.

Because each pair can be in one group, but if there are duplicates, they need separate groups.

Hence, for each unique a, let complement = mask XOR a

Then, the number of groups needed for a and its complement is max(freq[a], freq[complement])

Then, the total number of groups is the sum over all unique a of max(freq[a], freq[complement])

But in the first example:

a=1, complement=mask XOR 1, freq=0 → max(1,0)=1

a=4, complement=3, freq=1 → max(2,1)=2

a=3, complement=4, freq=2 → already considered with a=4

So, total groups=1 +2=3, which matches the earlier reasoning, but sample output is 4.

Hmm, perhaps I need to divide the unique a into pairs and singles.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the unique a, and for each a that hasn't been paired yet, find its complement.

If the complement is present, then the number of groups needed is max(freq[a], freq[complement]), and mark them as paired.

If the complement is not present, then the number of groups needed is freq[a].

So, in the first example:

a=1, complement=mask XOR 1, freq=0 → no complement, so groups +=1

a=4, complement=3, freq=1 → max(2,1)=2 → groups +=2

a=3 is already paired with a=4

So, total groups=1 +2=3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract the number of pairs from the sum of max(freq[a], freq[complement]).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a set of numbers and their complements.

Each pair of a number and its complement can be placed in one group.

Any unpaired numbers need their own groups.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of unpaired numbers plus the number of pairs.

But in the first example, number of pairs=1 (4 and 3), unpaired numbers=1 (1), and extra group for the second 4.

Wait, but according to this, it should be 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

I'm clearly missing something.

Perhaps the condition is that in a group, no two numbers share any bit in common, not just that their XOR is equal to mask.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of independent sets in a graph where nodes are numbers, and edges connect numbers that cannot be in the same group.

Then, the minimal number of groups is the chromatic number of this graph.

But this is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the key is to realize that two numbers can be in the same group only if their XOR is equal to mask.

Hence, each group can contain at most one pair of a number and its complement.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of pairs where x XOR y == mask.

In the first example, number_of_pairs=1 (4 and 3), so ans=4-1=3, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second 4 cannot be paired with anything, so it needs its own group, making it ans=4-1=3, but sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each number can be paired only once.

So, for a=[1,4,3,4], 4 and 3 can be paired, and the second 4 needs its own group, and 1 needs its own group, totaling 3 groups, but sample output is 4.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps I should look at the code provided and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

times = int(input())

check = 2 ** 31 -1

for _ in range(times):

n = int(input())

data = list(map(int, input().split()))

dic = dict()

ans = n

check = 2 ** 31 -1

for i in data:

s = i ^ check

if s in dic:

dic[s] -=1

ans -=1

if dic[s] ==0:

del dic[s]

elif i in dic:

dic[i] +=1

else:

dic[i] =1

print(ans)

So, it's iterating through the data, and for each number i, it computes s = i ^ check, where check is (2^31 -1).

Then, it checks if s is in the dictionary:

- if s is in the dictionary, it decrements dic[s], and decreases ans by 1, and if dic[s] becomes 0, it deletes it.

- if s is not in the dictionary, it checks if i is in the dictionary:

- if i is in the dictionary, it increments dic[i]

- if i is not in the dictionary, it sets dic[i] =1

Finally, it prints ans.

So, ans starts as n, and is decreased by 1 each time a pair is found.

Hence, ans = n - number_of_pairs

In the first example, number_of_pairs should be 1 (4 and 3), so ans=4-1=3, but sample output is 4.

So, perhaps this code is incorrect.

But according to the sample input and output, for the first test case, the output should be 4, but according to this code, it would output 3, which is different from the sample output.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample output.

Looking back at the sample input and output:
