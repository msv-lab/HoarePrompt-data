Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. The usual price for each bun is a coins. But to attract customers, he's running a promotion where he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the smaller of n or b) and sell the first k buns at a modified price. The price for the i-th bun (where i goes from 1 to k) is (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price a coins each. So, the total profit would be n * a.

If he chooses k = 1, he sells the first bun at b coins and the remaining (n - 1) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (n - 1) * a.

If he chooses k = 2, he sells the first bun at b coins, the second at (b - 1) coins, and the remaining (n - 2) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (b - 1) + (n - 2) * a.

Generalizing this, for any k, the total profit would be the sum of the first k terms of the sequence starting at b and decreasing by 1 each time, plus (n - k) * a.

So, the profit function can be written as:

profit(k) = sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) + (n - k) * a

Simplifying the sum:

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = k * b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k = k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k = k * b - (k^2)/2 - k/2 + k = k * b - (k^2)/2 + k/2

So, profit(k) = k * b - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + (n - k) * a

I can simplify this further:

profit(k) = k * b - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + n * a - k * a = - (k^2)/2 + k * (b - a + 0.5) + n * a

This looks like a quadratic function in terms of k: profit(k) = -0.5 * k^2 + (b - a + 0.5) * k + n * a

Since the coefficient of k^2 is negative (-0.5), this is a downward-opening parabola, meaning it has a maximum value at its vertex.

The maximum value for a quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -0.5, b = (b - a + 0.5), so the vertex is at k = -(b - a + 0.5)/(2 * -0.5) = (b - a + 0.5)

But k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b), inclusive.

So, the optimal k should be the integer closest to (b - a + 0.5), but clamped within the range [0, min(n, b)].

Wait, but b is not necessarily larger than a, and k can't exceed min(n, b).

Let me think differently. Since the profit function is a quadratic in k, and it's concave down, the maximum profit will be at the vertex or at one of the endpoints, depending on the constraints.

But in the code provided, it's using a binary search approach to find the maximum profit. It defines func_1 which calculates the profit for a given k, and func_2 which performs a binary search between low=0 and high=min(n, b) to find the k that maximizes the profit.

Let me look at the func_1 definition:

def func_1(k, n, a, b):

return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

Wait, this seems different from what I derived earlier.

Wait, let's recalculate the sum part.

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = sum from i=1 to k of b - i + 1 = k * b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k = k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k = k * b - (k^2)/2 - k/2 + k = k * b - (k^2)/2 + k/2

But in the code, it's k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

Wait, k * (k - 1) // 2 is equal to (k^2 - k)/2, which is k*(k-1)/2, the sum of first (k-1) integers.

Wait, I think there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = sum from i=1 to k of b - i + 1 = k*b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k*b - (k*(k+1))/2 + k = k*b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k = k*b - (k^2)/2 - k/2 + k = k*b - (k^2)/2 + k/2

But in the code, it's k*b - k*(k-1)//2 + (n - k)*a

k*(k-1)/2 = (k^2 - k)/2

So, k*b - (k^2 - k)/2 + (n - k)*a = k*b - k^2/2 + k/2 + (n - k)*a

Which matches what I derived: profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + k*(b + 0.5) + (n - k)*a

Wait, but in my earlier step, I had profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + k*(b - a + 0.5) + n*a

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying.

Let me recalculate profit(k):

profit(k) = sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) + (n - k)*a

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = k*b - (k*(k+1))/2 + k = k*b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k = k*b - (k^2)/2 - k/2 + k = k*b - (k^2)/2 + k/2

So, profit(k) = k*b - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + (n - k)*a = - (k^2)/2 + k*(b + 0.5) + n*a - k*a = - (k^2)/2 + k*(b - a + 0.5) + n*a

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the code defines func_1 as:

k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

Which simplifies to:

k*b - (k^2 - k)/2 + (n - k)*a = k*b - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + (n - k)*a

Which matches the profit(k) formula I derived.

So, func_1 correctly calculates the profit for a given k.

Now, func_2 performs a binary search between low=0 and high=min(n, b) to find the k that maximizes the profit.

It initializes max_profit to 0 and iterates while low <= high.

In each iteration, it calculates mid = (low + high) // 2

Then computes profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)

And profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)

It updates max_profit with the maximum of itself and profit_mid

Then, if profit_next > profit_mid, it sets low = mid + 1, else high = mid - 1

Finally, it returns max_profit

Let me think about this approach.

Since the profit function is a quadratic in k and concave down, it has a single peak.

Binary search is a good approach to find the maximum efficiently, especially since n, a, b can be up to 1e9, and t can be up to 1e4, so we need an efficient solution.

In each test case, the binary search will run in O(log(min(n, b))), which is acceptable.

Now, let's verify if this approach correctly finds the maximum profit.

Consider the first test case from the example:

4 4 5

So, n=4, a=4, b=5

Possible k values: 0,1,2,3,4 (since min(n,b)=4)

Let's compute profit for each k:

k=0: 0*5 - 0*(0-1)/2 + 4*4 = 0 - 0 + 16 = 16

k=1: 1*5 - 1*0/2 + 3*4 = 5 - 0 + 12 = 17

k=2: 2*5 - 2*1/2 + 2*4 = 10 - 1 + 8 = 17

k=3: 3*5 - 3*2/2 + 1*4 = 15 - 3 + 4 = 16

k=4: 4*5 - 4*3/2 + 0*4 = 20 - 6 + 0 = 14

So, the maximum is 17, which matches the first output in the example.

Second test case:

5 5 9

n=5, a=5, b=9

Possible k from 0 to 5

k=0: 0*9 - 0*(-1)/2 + 5*5 = 0 - 0 + 25 = 25

k=1: 1*9 - 1*0/2 + 4*5 = 9 - 0 + 20 = 29

k=2: 2*9 - 2*1/2 + 3*5 = 18 - 1 + 15 = 32

k=3: 3*9 - 3*2/2 + 2*5 = 27 - 3 + 10 = 34

k=4: 4*9 - 4*3/2 + 1*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35

k=5: 5*9 - 5*4/2 + 0*5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35

So, the maximum is 35, matching the second output.

Third test case:

10 10 5

n=10, a=10, b=5

Possible k from 0 to 5

k=0: 0*5 - 0*(-1)/2 + 10*10 = 0 - 0 + 100 = 100

k=1: 1*5 - 1*0/2 + 9*10 = 5 - 0 + 90 = 95

k=2: 2*5 - 2*1/2 + 8*10 = 10 - 1 + 80 = 89

k=3: 3*5 - 3*2/2 + 7*10 = 15 - 3 + 70 = 82

k=4: 4*5 - 4*3/2 + 6*10 = 20 - 6 + 60 = 74

k=5: 5*5 - 5*4/2 + 5*10 = 25 - 10 + 50 = 65

So, the maximum is 100, matching the third output.

This seems correct.

Now, in the code, func_2 performs a binary search to find the k that maximizes the profit.

It initializes max_profit to 0 and updates it whenever it finds a higher profit.

The binary search adjusts the search range based on whether the profit increases by moving to the next k or not.

This seems like a reasonable approach to find the maximum in a concave down function.

Given that, and the fact that it matches the example outputs, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See the program above}} \]
