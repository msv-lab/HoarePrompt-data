Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. Normally, each bun costs a coins, but he's running a promotion to attract customers. The promotion works like this: he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the smaller of n or b) , and for the first k buns sold, each bun will cost (b - i + 1) coins, where i is the ith bun sold. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price a coins each. So, the total profit would be n * a.

If he chooses k = 1, he sells the first bun at b coins, and the remaining (n - 1) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (n - 1) * a.

If k = 2, the first bun is sold at b coins, the second at (b - 1) coins, and the remaining (n - 2) buns at a coins each. Total profit: b + (b - 1) + (n - 2) * a.

And so on, up to k = min(n, b), where he sells k buns at decreasing prices starting from b down to (b - k + 1), and the remaining (n - k) buns at a coins each.

I need to find the value of k that maximizes the total profit.

Let me think about how to calculate the total profit for a given k.

The sum of the modified prices for the first k buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from b down to (b - k + 1).

The sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic series is given by (k / 2) * (first term + last term). So, sum = (k / 2) * (b + (b - k + 1)) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1).

The sum of the remaining (n - k) buns sold at a coins each is (n - k) * a.

Therefore, the total profit for a given k is: (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a.

I need to maximize this expression with respect to k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

So, the profit function in terms of k is:

profit(k) = (k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a

Simplify this:

profit(k) = (k * (2b - k + 1)) / 2 + n * a - k * a

profit(k) = (2bk - k^2 + k)/2 + n a - a k

profit(k) = (2bk)/2 - k^2/2 + k/2 + n a - a k

profit(k) = b k - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + n a - a k

Combine like terms:

profit(k) = (b - a) k - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + n a

Simplify further:

profit(k) = (b - a + 1/2 - 1/2 k) k + n a

Hmm, maybe it's better to keep it as:

profit(k) = b k - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + n a - a k

Alternatively, group the k terms:

profit(k) = (b - a) k - (k^2)/2 + (k)/2 + n a

profit(k) = [ (b - a) + (1 - k)/2 ] k + n a

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it differently. Since k can be from 0 to min(n, b), and n, a, b can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum profit.

Given that t can be up to 1e4, and n, a, b up to 1e9, I need an O(1) or O(log k) solution per test case.

I notice that the profit function in terms of k is a quadratic function: profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + (b + 0.5) k + n a - a k

So, profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + (b - a + 0.5) k + n a

This is a downward-opening parabola (since the coefficient of k^2 is negative), so the maximum occurs at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola given by f(k) = a k^2 + b k + c is at k = -b/(2a)

Here, a = -1/2, b = (b - a + 0.5), so k = -(b - a + 0.5)/(2 * (-1/2)) = (b - a + 0.5)/1 = b - a + 0.5

So, the optimal k is at k = b - a + 0.5

But k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b).

So, I should round b - a + 0.5 to the nearest integer and check if it's within the valid range.

Wait, but b and a are integers, so b - a + 0.5 would be a float. I can take floor or ceil depending on the decimal part.

But perhaps it's better to use integer operations to avoid floating points, considering the constraints.

Alternatively, since k has to be an integer, I can consider k = floor(b - a + 0.5) or ceil(b - a + 0.5), but need to ensure it's within [0, min(n, b)]

Wait, actually, since k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b), I can compute k = b - a + 0.5 and then take the nearest integer within the bounds.

But to avoid floating points, perhaps I can consider comparing profit at k and k+1 and see which one is higher.

Alternatively, since the profit function is quadratic in k, and the coefficient of k^2 is negative, the function is concave, so I can perform a binary search over k to find the maximum profit.

Given the constraints, binary search over k is feasible since min(n, b) can be up to 1e9, and t is up to 1e4, so total time should be acceptable.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to implement a binary search approach to find the optimal k.

In the code:

def func_1(k, n, a, b):

return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

This matches the profit formula I derived earlier: profit(k) = k * b - (k * (k - 1)) / 2 + (n - k) * a

Which simplifies to the same expression as above.

Then, in func_2:

(low, high) = (0, min(n, b))

max_profit = 0

while low <= high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)

profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)

max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)

if profit_next > profit_mid:

low = mid + 1

else:

high = mid - 1

return max_profit

This is a binary search over k to find the maximum profit.

It starts with low = 0 and high = min(n, b), and iteratively narrows down the range by comparing profit at mid and mid + 1.

If profit at mid + 1 is greater than profit at mid, it means the maximum is to the right, so low = mid + 1

Else, the maximum is to the left, so high = mid - 1

And it keeps track of the maximum profit found during this process.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case:

4 4 5

So, n=4, a=4, b=5

Possible k values: 0 to min(4,5)=4

Compute profit for each k:

k=0: 0*5 - 0*(-1)/2 + 4*4 = 16

k=1:1*5 -1*0/2 +3*4=5+12=17

k=2:2*5 -2*1/2 +2*4=10 -1 +8=17

k=3:3*5 -3*2/2 +1*4=15 -3 +4=16

k=4:4*5 -4*3/2 +0*4=20 -6 +0=14

So, maximum is 17, which matches the first output in the example.

Another test case:

5 5 9

k from 0 to 5

k=0:0*9 -0*(-1)/2 +5*5=25

k=1:1*9 -1*0/2 +4*5=9+20=29

k=2:2*9 -2*1/2 +3*5=18 -1 +15=32

k=3:3*9 -3*2/2 +2*5=27 -3 +10=34

k=4:4*9 -4*3/2 +1*5=36 -6 +5=35

k=5:5*9 -5*4/2 +0*5=45 -10 +0=35

Maximum is 35, matching the second output.

Third test case:

10 10 5

k from 0 to 5

k=0:0*5 -0*(-1)/2 +10*10=100

k=1:1*5 -1*0/2 +9*10=5 +90=95

k=2:2*5 -2*1/2 +8*10=10 -1 +80=89

k=3:3*5 -3*2/2 +7*10=15 -3 +70=82

k=4:4*5 -4*3/2 +6*10=20 -6 +60=74

k=5:5*5 -5*4/2 +5*10=25 -10 +50=65

So, maximum is 100, matching the third output.

Seems correct.

Edge cases:

If n=1, a=1, b=1

k can be 0 or 1

k=0: 0*1 -0*(-1)/2 +1*1=1

k=1:1*1 -1*0/2 +0*1=1

Maximum is 1

Another edge case:

n=1, a=1, b=2

k=0:0*2 -0*(-1)/2 +1*1=1

k=1:1*2 -1*0/2 +0*1=2

Maximum is 2

Seems correct.

Another edge case:

n=0, but n >=1 as per constraints, so n>=1

Wait, in the problem statement, n >=1

So, n=1 is the smallest.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1(k, n, a, b):

return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

This seems correct.

In func_2:

Binary search is used to find the optimal k.

It initializes low=0, high=min(n,b)

max_profit=0

Then, in the loop, it calculates mid, profit at mid, and profit at mid+1

If profit at mid+1 > profit at mid, it sets low=mid+1

Else, high=mid-1

And keeps updating max_profit with the maximum of current max_profit and profit at mid

This is a standard binary search approach for finding the maximum in a unimodal function.

Since the profit function is concave (second derivative is negative), it's unimodal, so binary search is appropriate.

Potential issue: when k = min(n,b), need to ensure that k does not exceed n or b

But in the code, high is set to min(n,b), so k is within bounds.

Another potential issue: when n or b is large (up to 1e9), need to ensure that there's no integer overflow.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no overflow issues.

Another consideration: when k=0, it should be included in the search range.

The code sets low=0, which includes k=0.

Also, in the loop condition, low <= high, so it includes k=0.

Looks good.

Another consideration: in the binary search, when comparing profit at mid and mid+1, need to ensure that mid+1 does not exceed high.

But since high = min(n,b), and mid is floor((low+high)/2), so mid+1 would be within bounds because low <= high.

Wait, but need to ensure that mid+1 does not exceed high.

Wait, in Python, integer division floors, so mid = floor((low + high)/2)

If low + high is even, mid = (low + high)/2

If odd, mid = floor((low + high)/2)

Then, mid +1 could be up to high +1, but in the loop condition, low <= high, and high is set to min(n,b), so mid +1 would be <= high +1

But in the function func_1, k can be up to min(n,b), so it should be fine.

Wait, but if high = min(n,b), and mid = floor((low + high)/2), then mid +1 could be up to high +1, but in the function func_1, k can be up to min(n,b), which is high.

But in the loop, high is set to min(n,b), and k is from low to high.

Wait, but in the binary search, when high = mid -1, it's adjusted to ensure k stays within bounds.

I think it's handled correctly.

Another consideration: in the profit function, k * b - k * (k -1)//2 + (n -k)*a

Need to ensure that k*(k-1)//2 is correctly computed.

In Python, integer division is used with //

So, it should be correct.

Also, need to ensure that (n - k) is non-negative, which it is since k <= n

Looking back at the example inputs and outputs, they match the expected results.

Also, in the code, func_2 returns max_profit, which is updated in each iteration of the binary search.

I think the code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to maximize Bob's profit from selling buns with a promotional pricing strategy. We achieve this by carefully selecting the number of buns, \( k \), to sell at a modified price and the remaining at the usual price.

## Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We have \( n \) buns.
   - Usual price per bun: \( a \) coins.
   - Promotional price for the first \( k \) buns: \( b \) coins for the first bun, decreasing by 1 coin for each subsequent bun.
   - We need to choose \( k \) to maximize the total profit.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - For a given \( k \), the profit from the first \( k \) buns is calculated as:
     \[
     k \times b - \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
     \]
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is:
     \[
     (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - Total profit:
     \[
     k \times b - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]

3. **Optimal \( k \) Selection**:
   - The profit function is quadratic in \( k \) and concave down, so it has a single peak.
   - We use binary search to efficiently find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit within the range \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - Use a loop to perform binary search:
     - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
     - Compute profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
     - If profit at `mid + 1` is greater, adjust `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Else, adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.
     - Track the maximum profit encountered.

## Solution Code
```python
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        if mid + 1 <= high:
            profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        else:
            profit_next = -1  # To handle the case when mid + 1 exceeds high
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        a = int(data[index + 1])
        b = int(data[index + 2])
        print(func_2(n, a, b))
        index += 3
```

## Explanation
- **func_1(k, n, a, b)**: Computes the profit for a given \( k \).
- **func_2(n, a, b)**: Implements binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes profit.
- **Main Block**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints the result using `func_2`.

This approach ensures efficiency and correctness, handling large inputs effectively due to the logarithmic time complexity of the binary search.
