Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings that I need to form, and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. For example, if k is 3, I'd be using 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The task is to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n from these k alphabets appear as subsequences in s. And I need to make sure that s is as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities with the same length, I can choose any of them.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Given that, I need to ensure that every possible combination of length n from the first k alphabets is present as a subsequence in s.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

Input:

1 2

Output:

ab

Explanation:

Possible strings of length 1 from 'a' and 'b': "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab" as subsequences.

In the second test case:

Input:

2 1

Output:

aa

Explanation:

Only one possible string of length 2 from 'a': "aa". It's present in "aa" as a subsequence.

In the third test case:

Input:

2 2

Output:

baab

Explanation:

Possible strings of length 2 from 'a' and 'b': "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All these are present in "baab" as subsequences.

In the fourth test case:

Input:

2 3

Output:

abcbac

Explanation:

Possible strings of length 2 from 'a', 'b', 'c': "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". All these are present in "abcbac" as subsequences.

From these examples, it seems that the output string needs to be constructed in a way that maximizes the overlap of subsequences to minimize the overall length.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import collections

from collections import Counter

from collections import defaultdict

import math

from math import log

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

res = func_1()

print(res)

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'

return s[:k] * n

So, the program defines a function func_1() that takes n and k, creates a string s consisting of the first k lowercase letters, and then repeats this string n times.

Wait a minute, is this the correct approach?

Let's think about it. For example, take the third test case:

n=2, k=2

According to the program:

s = 'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

But in the example, the output is 'baab', which also works.

Is 'abab' correct? Let's check if all subsequences are present.

Possible subsequences of length 2:

- aa: Is there a subsequence 'aa' in 'abab'? Looking at positions: 'a' at position 0 and another 'a'... but in 'abab', the 'a's are at positions 0 and 2. So, indices 0 and 2 give 'aa'.

- ab: positions 0 and 1, or 2 and 3.

- ba: positions 1 and 2.

- bb: positions 1 and 3.

So, all are present. Wait, but is this the minimal length? The example gives 'baab' which is also length 4, same as 'abab'. So, in this case, both are minimal.

But let's check another case.

Fourth test case:

n=2, k=3

According to the program:

s = 'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

But the example output is 'abcbac', which is shorter.

Does 'abcabc' contain all possible subsequences of length 2 from 'a', 'b', 'c'?

Possible subsequences:

- aa: positions 0 and 3.

- ab: positions 0 and 1, or 0 and 4, etc.

- ac: positions 0 and 5.

- ba: positions 1 and 3.

- bb: positions 1 and 4.

- bc: positions 1 and 5, or 4 and 5.

- ca: positions 2 and 3.

- cb: positions 2 and 4.

- cc: positions 2 and 5.

So, all are present. But 'abcbac' is shorter than 'abcabc'. So, 'abcabc' is correct but not minimal.

Hmm, so the program's approach of repeating s n times doesn't always give the minimal length.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them."

So, if the program produces a correct string but not necessarily the minimal one, is it still acceptable if there are multiple answers with the same minimal length?

Wait, in the fourth test case, 'abcabc' is longer than 'abcbac', so it's not minimal. But the program would output 'abcabc' for n=2, k=3.

But in the example, 'abcbac' is provided, which is shorter.

Is 'abcabc' still a correct answer? Yes, because it contains all the required subsequences, but it's not minimal.

So, is the program correct but not optimal?

Wait, but the problem says: "print the one with the smallest length." So, if there are multiple minimal answers, any one is acceptable. But 'abcabc' is not minimal, so is the program incorrect in this case?

Wait, but in the third test case, 'abab' is minimal, and 'baab' is also minimal, both of length 4.

So, in that case, both are acceptable.

But in the fourth test case, 'abcabc' is length 6, while 'abcbac' is also length 6. So, is 'abcabc' minimal? Wait, in the example, 'abcbac' is provided, which is also length 6.

Wait, hold on, 'abcbac' is length 6, same as 'abcabc'. So, in this case, both are minimal.

Wait, but in the example, 'abcbac' is provided, which is supposed to be minimal.

So, is 'abcabc' also minimal? Yes, it's also length 6.

So, in this case, both are acceptable.

But in the fourth test case, 'abcabc' contains all the required subsequences, and 'abcbac' also does, both of the same length.

So, in this case, the program's output is acceptable.

But, is this always the case? Let's check for larger k.

Suppose n=2, k=4.

According to the program, s = 'abcd' * 2 = 'abcdabcd'

But, is there a shorter string that contains all possible length-2 subsequences from 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'?

For example, 'abcbdcad', which is shorter than 'abcdabcd'.

Wait, let's check:

Possible subsequences:

- aa: positions ... need two 'a's.

- ab: positions ... yes.

- ac: positions ... yes.

- ad: positions ... yes.

- ba: positions ... yes.

- bb: positions ... yes.

- bc: positions ... yes.

- bd: positions ... yes.

- ca: positions ... yes.

- cb: positions ... yes.

- cc: positions ... yes.

- cd: positions ... yes.

- da: positions ... yes.

- db: positions ... yes.

- dc: positions ... yes.

- dd: positions ... yes.

I'm not sure if 'abcdabcd' is the minimal length or not.

Wait, perhaps for k=4, 'abcdabcd' is minimal.

But in general, the program's approach is to repeat the string s n times, where s is the first k letters.

But, is this always minimal?

From the problem description, it seems that there might be a better way to construct s to make it shorter.

I recall that in combinatorics, there's a concept called a de Bruijn sequence, which contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once.

But in this problem, it's about subsequences, not substrings.

Wait, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings, not subsequences.

So, perhaps there's a different approach for subsequences.

I need to find a string s that contains all possible combinations of length n from the first k letters as subsequences, and make s as short as possible.

So, what's the minimal length of s?

I need to think about the number of possible subsequences.

There are k choices for each position in the string, and the string is of length n, so there are k^n possible subsequences.

But in reality, some of these subsequences might overlap in their positions.

Wait, no, in terms of subsequences, order matters, but positions don't.

Wait, actually, in subsequences, order is preserved, but positions are not.

Wait, no, in a subsequence, the order of the characters is the same as in the original string, but some characters may be skipped.

So, for example, in "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, where the positions are 0,2,4.

So, to contain all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, I need to ensure that for every possible combination of n letters from the first k, there exists a way to choose positions in s that match that subsequence.

This seems tricky.

I need to find a minimal string s such that every possible combination of n letters from the first k appears as a subsequence.

I need to minimize the length of s.

I'm not sure about the general formula for the minimal length.

But in the program provided, it's simply repeating the first k letters n times.

So, for n=2, k=2, it's 'abab', which has length 4.

In the example, 'baab' is provided, which is also length 4.

So, in this case, it's minimal.

For n=2, k=3, the program would output 'abcabc', which has length 6, same as the example 'abcbac'.

So, in this case, it's also minimal.

But for larger k, is this always minimal?

I'm not sure.

But in the problem statement, it says that for t up to 676, and n up to 26, and k up to 26.

So, perhaps for the given constraints, this approach is acceptable.

But I need to verify if the program is correct.

Is the program's approach correct?

In the function func_1(), it takes n and k, creates s as the first k letters, and repeats it n times.

Then, it returns this string.

Is this guaranteeing that all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters are present in s?

Let me think about it.

In the string s = 'abc' repeated n times, for k=3.

Does this contain all possible subsequences of length n from 'a', 'b', 'c'?

For n=2, k=3:

Possible subsequences:

- 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc'

In s = 'abcabc':

- 'aa': positions 0 and 3.

- 'ab': positions 0 and 1, or 0 and 4, etc.

- 'ac': positions 0 and 5.

- 'ba': positions 1 and 3.

- 'bb': positions 1 and 4.

- 'bc': positions 1 and 5, or 4 and 5.

- 'ca': positions 2 and 3.

- 'cb': positions 2 and 4.

- 'cc': positions 2 and 5.

So, all are present.

Similarly, for n=3, k=2:

s = 'ababab'

Possible subsequences:

- 'aaa': positions 0,2,4.

- 'aab': positions 0,2,3.

- 'aba': positions 0,1,3.

- 'abb': positions 0,1,4.

- 'baa': positions 1,3,4.

- 'bab': positions 1,3,5.

- 'bba': positions 1,4,5.

- 'bbb': positions 1,4,5.

Wait, but for 'bbb', positions 1,4,5 in 'ababab' are 'b','b','b'.

Yes, they are present.

So, it seems that repeating s n times ensures that all possible subsequences are present.

But is this the minimal possible length?

For n=2, k=2: 'abab' vs possibly a shorter string.

Is there a string shorter than 'abab' that contains all subsequences 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb'?

Let's see:

Consider 'aabb':

- 'aa': positions 0 and 1.

- 'ab': positions 0 and 2.

- 'ba': positions 1 and 2.

- 'bb': positions 2 and 3.

So, 'aabb' also works and is of length 4, same as 'abab'.

Is there a string of length 3 that contains all these subsequences?

Let's try 'abb':

- 'aa': not present, only one 'a'.

So, not possible.

Hence, length 4 is minimal.

So, in this case, the program's output is minimal.

For n=2, k=3:

Program outputs 'abcabc', which is of length 6.

Is there a shorter string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 from 'a', 'b', 'c'?

Let's see:

Consider 'abcbac' as in the example.

It's also of length 6.

Is there a string of length 5 that contains all subsequences?

Let's try 'abcac':

- 'aa': positions 0 and 3.

- 'ab': positions 0 and 1.

- 'ac': positions 0 and 4.

- 'ba': positions 1 and 3.

- 'bb': not present, only one 'b' in positions 1 and 2.

So, 'bb' is missing.

Hence, length 5 is not sufficient.

What about 'abcbc':

- 'aa': not present.

So, again, not sufficient.

Seems like length 6 is minimal.

Hence, in this case, the program's output is also minimal.

So, perhaps for general n and k, repeating s n times is minimal.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, for n=1, k=2:

s = 'ab' *1 = 'ab'

Which is correct and minimal.

For n=3, k=2:

s = 'ab' *3 = 'ababab'

Is there a shorter string that contains all subsequences of length 3 from 'a' and 'b'?

Possible subsequences:

- 'aaa', 'aab', 'aba', 'abb', 'baa', 'bab', 'bba', 'bbb'

Is there a string shorter than 6 that contains all these subsequences?

Let's try 'aaabbb':

- 'aaa': positions 0,1,2.

- 'aab': positions 0,1,3.

- 'aba': positions 0,3,4.

- 'abb': positions 0,3,5.

- 'baa': positions 3,4,5 (but 'b's at 3 and 4, 'a's at 4 and 5? Wait, no.

Wait, positions in 'aaabbb':

- 'aaa': 0,1,2.

- 'aab': 0,1,3.

- 'aba': 0,2,3.

- 'abb': 0,2,4.

- 'baa': positions? There are no 'b's before 'a's in this string.

Wait, 'b's start at position 3.

So, 'baa': not possible, because 'b' is at position 3, and 'a's are before it.

Hence, 'aaabbb' doesn't contain 'baa'.

What about 'ababab':

- 'baa': positions 1,3,4 ('b','a','a').

Yes, that works.

So, perhaps 'ababab' is minimal.

Is there a shorter string?

Let's try 'ababb':

- 'aaa': not present, only one 'a' at positions 0,2,3.

Wait, but 'a's are at 0,2,3.

So, 'aaa' would be positions 0,2,3.

Wait, but 'aaa' requires three 'a's in subsequence, which are not present in 'ababb'.

Because 'ababb' has 'a's at positions 0,2,3, but in subsequence, they need to be in order.

Wait, 'a's at positions 0,2,3 in 'ababb' are 'a','a','b', which can be taken as 'aaa' by choosing positions 0,2,3.

Wait, but 'b' is at position 3, so choosing positions 0,2,3 would be 'a','a','b', which is not 'aaa'.

So, 'aaa' is not present in 'ababb'.

Hence, 'ababb' is not sufficient.

What about 'abababb':

Longer than 'ababab', so not minimal.

Hence, 'ababab' seems to be minimal for n=3, k=2.

So, in general, it seems that repeating s n times gives a string that contains all required subsequences, and it might be minimal.

But I need to confirm this for general n and k.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for the minimal length.

I recall that for subsequences, the minimal length to contain all possible subsequences of length n from k letters is k + (n-1)*(k-1).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's n*k.

But in the examples, for n=2, k=2: minimal length is 4, which is n*k.

For n=2, k=3: minimal length is 6, which is n*k.

For n=1, k=2: minimal length is 2, which is n*k.

For n=3, k=2: minimal length is 6, which is n*k.

So, perhaps in general, the minimal length is n*k.

If that's the case, then the program's approach of repeating s n times is correct and minimal.

But I need to verify this.

Let's consider n=3, k=3.

According to the program, s = 'abc' *3 = 'abcabcabc', length 9.

Is there a shorter string that contains all possible subsequences of length 3 from 'a', 'b', 'c'?

Possible subsequences: all combinations of 'a', 'b', 'c' of length 3, which are 27 in total.

Is there a string shorter than 9 that contains all these subsequences?

I doubt it.

Because each new character can only help form new subsequences when added appropriately.

But in this case, since k=3 and n=3, n*k=9, and it's likely minimal.

So, perhaps in general, n*k is the minimal length.

Hence, the program's approach is correct.

But to be thorough, let's check for n=1, k=1.

s = 'a' *1 = 'a'

Which is correct and minimal.

For n=2, k=1:

s = 'a' *2 = 'aa'

Which is correct and minimal.

For n=0, but n is at least 1, so no need to consider.

Wait, in the problem statement, n is at least 1.

So, for all valid n and k, n*k seems to be the minimal length.

Hence, the program's approach is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
