Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad wants to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. He already has n problems in his bank, each with one of these difficulty levels. If he doesn't have enough problems for m rounds, he needs to create some more. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of new problems he needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

First, I need to understand what "enough for m rounds" means. Since each round requires one of each difficulty level, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each level. So, for seven levels (A through G), he needs 7*m problems in total, assuming he has exactly m of each level.

But he already has some problems in his bank, so I need to check how many of each difficulty level he has and see if it meets or exceeds the required m for each level.

If he has less than m problems of a certain level, he needs to make up the difference. So, for each level that he doesn't have m problems, he needs to create m - (number he has) more problems for that level.

Also, since there are seven difficulty levels, and he needs m of each, the total required is 7*m. But he already has n problems, so the total he needs to create is 7*m - (sum of problems he already has for each level that are less than or equal to m).

Wait, that might not be the best way to think about it. A better approach is to calculate for each difficulty level separately.

Let me outline a step-by-step plan:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and m: n is the number of problems in the bank, m is the number of rounds.

b. Read the string s of length n, where each character represents the difficulty level of a problem.

c. Count the frequency of each difficulty level in s.

d. For each difficulty level from A to G, calculate how many more problems are needed to reach m. If he has fewer than m problems of that level, he needs m - (number he has). If he has m or more, he needs 0 for that level.

e. Sum up the additional problems needed for all difficulty levels.

f. Output this sum.

Now, looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

Let's verify the first test case:

n=10, m=1, s='BGECDCBDED'

Count the frequencies:

B: 3

G: 2

E: 3

C: 2

D: 2

A: 0

F: 0

He needs m=1 of each level: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

So, for A: needs 1, has 0 → needs to create 1

F: needs 1, has 0 → needs to create 1

Total additional problems needed: 2

Which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, s='BGECDCBDED'

Frequencies:

B: 3

G: 2

E: 3

C: 2

D: 2

A: 0

F: 0

He needs m=2 of each level.

For A: needs 2, has 0 → needs 2

F: needs 2, has 0 → needs 2

Total additional: 4

Wait, but the output is 5. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, he has:

B:3, G:2, E:3, C:2, D:2, A:0, F:0

For m=2:

A needs 2, has 0 → +2

B needs 2, has 3 → 0

C needs 2, has 2 → 0

D needs 2, has 2 → 0

E needs 2, has 3 → 0

F needs 2, has 0 → +2

G needs 2, has 2 → 0

Total additional: 4

But the output is 5. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, the string is 'BGECDCBDED', which has:

B:3

G:1

E:3

C:2

D:2

A:0

F:0

Wait, G appears only once in 'BGECDCBDED'. Let's count:

B: positions 1,7

G: position 6

E: positions 3,5,9

C: positions 4,8

D: positions 2,10

So, B:2, G:1, E:3, C:2, D:2, A:0, F:0

Oops, I miscounted earlier. B is at positions 1 and 7, not three times.

So, correct frequencies:

A:0

B:2

C:2

D:2

E:3

F:0

G:1

For m=2:

A: needs 2, has 0 → +2

B: needs 2, has 2 → 0

C: needs 2, has 2 → 0

D: needs 2, has 2 → 0

E: needs 2, has 3 → 0

F: needs 2, has 0 → +2

G: needs 2, has 1 → +1

Total additional: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 5

Yes, that matches the output.

So, my initial approach seems correct.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, s='BBCDEFFGG'

Frequencies:

B:2

C:1

D:1

E:1

F:2

G:2

A:0

Needs m=1 of each:

A: needs 1, has 0 → +1

B: needs 1, has 2 → 0

C: needs 1, has 1 → 0

D: needs 1, has 1 → 0

E: needs 1, has 1 → 0

F: needs 1, has 2 → 0

G: needs 1, has 2 → 0

Total additional: 1

Which matches the third output.

So, my approach seems solid.

Now, looking at the provided program:

from collections import Counter

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

ans = 0

p = 'ABCDEF'

hmp = Counter(s)

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

print(ans)

Let's analyze this.

It reads t, the number of test cases, then loops through each test case.

For each test case:

- Reads n and m

- Reads the string s

- Initializes ans = 0

- Sets p = 'ABCDEF' (which are the difficulty levels A through F)

- Creates a Counter object hmp from s, which counts the frequency of each character in s.

Then, it loops through each character in p ('ABCDEF'):

- If that character is not in hmp, it adds m to ans.

Then, it loops through each key in hmp:

- If the count of that key is less than m, it adds (m - hmp[i]) to ans.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait a second, there's a potential issue here.

The difficulty levels are A through G, but p is set to 'ABCDEF', which misses 'G'.

So, if there are problems of level G, they might not be handled correctly.

Wait, actually, in the second loop, it iterates through each key in hmp, which includes all levels present in s, including G if present.

But, in the first loop, it only checks for levels in 'ABCDEF'. So, if a level is G and it's not in p, it would not add m for G if it's not in hmp.

Wait, but in the second loop, if G is in hmp and hmp[G] < m, it would add m - hmp[G].

But, if G is not in hmp at all, then in the first loop, since p is 'ABCDEF', it won't check for G, and thus won't add m for G.

This seems like a mistake.

To correct this, p should include all levels: 'ABCDEFG'.

Let's check with the first test case:

n=10, m=1, s='BGECDCBDED'

hmp: B:3, G:1, E:3, C:2, D:2, A:0, F:0

p = 'ABCDEF'

First loop:

A not in hmp → ans += 1

F not in hmp → ans +=1

Second loop:

B: hmp[B]=3 >=1 → no addition

G: hmp[G]=1 <1 → ans +=1-1=0

E: hmp[E]=3 >=1 → no addition

C: hmp[C]=2 >=1 → no addition

D: hmp[D]=2 >=1 → no addition

So, ans = 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

Which is correct.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, s='BGECDCBDED'

hmp: B:2, G:1, E:3, C:2, D:2, A:0, F:0

First loop:

A not in hmp → ans +=2

F not in hmp → ans +=2

Second loop:

B:2 >=2 → 0

G:1 <2 → ans +=1

E:3 >=2 → 0

C:2 >=2 → 0

D:2 >=2 → 0

Total ans = 2 + 2 +1 =5

Which is correct.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, s='BBCDEFFGG'

hmp: B:2, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:2, G:2, A:0

First loop:

A not in hmp → ans +=1

F is in hmp, so no addition here

Second loop:

B:2 >=1 → 0

G:2 >=1 → 0

C:1 >=1 → 0

D:1 >=1 → 0

E:1 >=1 → 0

F:2 >=1 → 0

Total ans =1

Which is correct.

So, even with p='ABCDEF', it seems to work because in the second loop, G is handled if it's in hmp.

But, to be safe and correct, p should include all levels, including G.

However, in the current implementation, it seems to work correctly because even if G is missing in p, in the second loop, if G is in hmp and hmp[G] < m, it adds m - hmp[G].

But, if G is not in hmp at all, the first loop doesn't check for G since it's not in p.

Wait, in the first test case, G is in hmp, so ans isn't increased for G in the first loop.

In the second test case, G is in hmp but hmp[G]=1 < m=2, so ans +=1 in the second loop.

If G was not in hmp at all, then in the first loop, since G is not in p, it wouldn't add m for G.

But in reality, if G is not in hmp and G is not in p, then it would miss adding m for G.

Wait, but in the first test case, G is in hmp, so it's handled in the second loop.

If G was not in hmp and p doesn't include G, then ans wouldn't account for the m problems needed for G.

But in the given examples, G is present in hmp, so it works.

Let me think of a test case where G is not in hmp and p doesn't include G.

Suppose t=1

n=5 m=1

s='ABCDE'

hmp: A:1, B:1, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:0, G:0

p='ABCDEF'

First loop:

A in hmp → skip

F not in hmp → ans +=1

Second loop:

A:1 >=1 → 0

B:1 >=1 → 0

C:1 >=1 → 0

D:1 >=1 → 0

E:1 >=1 → 0

F:0 <1 → ans +=1

G:0 <1 → should add 1, but since G is not in p and not in hmp, it's missed.

So, ans =1 (from F) +1 (from F in second loop) =2

But actually, he needs to create problems for F and G, so should be 2.

Wait, but in this case, it's adding twice for F, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in the first loop, F not in hmp → ans +=1

In the second loop, F:0 <1 → ans +=1

So, ans=1+1=2

But actually, only 1 for F and 1 for G, total 2.

But the program doesn't know about G, so it's coincidentally correct.

This is risky; it's just coinciding in this case.

A better approach is to include all levels in p: 'ABCDEFG'

Then, in the first loop, for each level in 'ABCDEFG', if it's not in hmp, ans +=m

Then, in the second loop, for levels in hmp, if hmp[i] < m, ans += m - hmp[i]

But actually, this double-counts for levels like F in the above example.

Wait, in the above example, F is not in hmp, so in the first loop, ans +=1 (since m=1)

Then, in the second loop, F is not in hmp, so it doesn't process F in the second loop.

Wait, no, in the second loop, it only processes keys that are in hmp.

So, for F not in hmp, only the first loop adds m=1 to ans.

Similarly, for G not in hmp, first loop would add m=1 to ans.

Total ans=1 (F) +1 (G)=2, which is correct.

But in the current program, p='ABCDEF', so G is missed in the first loop.

So, to fix this, p should be 'ABCDEFG'.

But in the given program, p='ABCDEF', which misses G.

Yet, in the earlier test cases, it worked correctly because G was present in hmp, and handled in the second loop.

But in the example I just gave, where G is not in hmp, it would miss adding m for G.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

To confirm, let's consider t=1

n=5 m=1

s='ABCDE'

Expected output:2 (needs to create F and G)

What does the program output?

p='ABCDEF'

First loop:

A in hmp → skip

B in hmp → skip

C in hmp → skip

D in hmp → skip

E in hmp → skip

F not in hmp → ans +=1

Second loop:

A:1 >=1 → 0

B:1 >=1 → 0

C:1 >=1 → 0

D:1 >=1 → 0

E:1 >=1 → 0

F:0 <1 → ans +=1

Total ans=1+1=2

Wait, but G is missing, and it's not in p, so it's not checked in the first loop.

But in this case, ans=2, which is correct.

But this is just coincidental because F and G both require 1 each, totaling 2.

If m=2, let's see:

t=1

n=5 m=2

s='ABCDE'

hmp: A:1, B:1, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:0, G:0

First loop:

A:1 <2 → ans +=1

F not in hmp → ans +=2

Second loop:

A:1 <2 → ans +=1

B:1 <2 → ans +=1

C:1 <2 → ans +=1

D:1 <2 → ans +=1

E:1 <2 → ans +=1

F:0 <2 → ans +=2

Total ans=1 (from A in first loop) +2 (from F in first loop) +1 (A in second loop) +1 (B) +1 (C) +1 (D) +1 (E) +2 (F in second loop) =1+2+1+1+1+1+1+2=10

But actually, needed is m=2 of each: A,B,C,D,E,F,G

He has 1 of each except F and G are 0.

So, needs to create:

A:1, B:1, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:2, G:2 → total 1+1+1+1+1+2+2=9

But the program outputs 10, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

First loop:

A: in hmp with 1 < m=2 → ans +=1

F: not in hmp → ans +=2

Second loop:

A:1 <2 → ans +=1

B:1 <2 → ans +=1

C:1 <2 → ans +=1

D:1 <2 → ans +=1

E:1 <2 → ans +=1

F:0 <2 → ans +=2

Total ans=1 (A first loop) +2 (F first loop) +1 (A second loop) +1 (B) +1 (C) +1 (D) +1 (E) +2 (F second loop) =1+2+1+1+1+1+1+2=10

But actually, total needed is 9, as above.

So, it's overcounting.

The overcounting happens because F is being counted twice: once in the first loop (ans +=2) and again in the second loop (ans +=2), totaling 4 for F, but actually needed is only 2 for F.

This indicates a flaw in the logic.

A better approach is to iterate through all difficulty levels (A through G), and for each level, calculate m - hmp[level] if hmp[level] < m, else 0.

So, p should be 'ABCDEFG', and for each level in p, if level not in hmp, ans += m

Then, for levels in hmp, if hmp[level] < m, ans += m - hmp[level]

But this would still overcount if a level is in hmp but hmp[level] < m.

Wait, no, it's better to only iterate through p and handle each level separately.

Here's a corrected version:

p = 'ABCDEFG'

for level in p:

if level not in hmp:

ans += m

else:

if hmp[level] < m:

ans += m - hmp[level]

This ensures each level is considered exactly once.

In the original program, p='ABCDEF', which misses G.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

To confirm, let's consider a test case where G is not in hmp.

t=1

n=5 m=1

s='ABCDE'

Expected output:2 (need to create F and G)

Program output:2 (coincidentally correct)

But if m=2:

Expected:9 (A:1, B:1, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:2, G:2)

Program output:10

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
