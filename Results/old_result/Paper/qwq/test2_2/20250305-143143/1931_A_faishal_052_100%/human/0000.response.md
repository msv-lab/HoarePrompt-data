Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has a word made up of exactly three lowercase Latin letters. Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, up to 'z' being 26. He encodes the word by summing up these numbers. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. But this encoding is ambiguous because different words can have the same sum, like "ava" also sums to 24.

My task is to find the lexicographically smallest word that could correspond to a given sum. So, for each test case with a given sum, I need to output the smallest possible three-letter word that adds up to that sum.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible words that have the same sum, I should choose the one that would appear first in a dictionary. For example, between "abc" and "acb", "abc" is smaller because 'b' comes before 'c' in the alphabet.

So, to find the smallest word, I should minimize the letters at the earliest positions in the word. That is, make the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

Let's think about the constraints. Each letter is between 'a' (1) and 'z' (26), and there are exactly three letters. The sum of these letters is between 3 and 78, as 1+1+1=3 and 26+26+26=78.

Given that, I need a way to distribute the sum among three letters such that the letters are as small as possible in lex order.

One approach is to iterate through all possible combinations of three letters, calculate their sums, and find the one with the smallest lex order for a given sum. However, with t up to 100 and n up to 78, this might be inefficient, but since 26^3 = 17,576, it's manageable. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think of a better way. Since I need the smallest lex order, I should maximize the letters towards the end, starting from the beginning.

So, fix the first letter as 'a' (1), then try to make the second letter as small as possible, and the third letter will be determined by the remaining sum.

Wait, but that might not always give the smallest lex order. Let's consider an example.

Suppose n=24.

If I fix the first letter as 'a' (1), then the remaining sum is 23 for the last two letters. To minimize the second letter, I would set it to 'a' (1), making the third letter 'v' (22), so "aav". Another possibility is "ava" (1, 22, 1), but "aav" is smaller than "ava" because 'v' (22) is before 'a' (1) in lex order.

Wait, no, in "aav", the letters are 'a', 'a', 'v', and in "ava", they are 'a', 'v', 'a'. In lex order, 'a' is compared first, which is the same, then 'a' vs 'v', and 'a' comes before 'v', so "aav" is smaller than "ava". So "aav" is indeed the smallest.

Another example: n=70.

If I try to set the first letter to 'a' (1), then the remaining sum is 69 for the last two letters. The smallest possible second letter is 'a' (1), making the third letter 'z' (26), but 1+1+26=28, which is less than 70. So that's not enough. I need to increase the letters.

If I set the first letter to 'r' (18), and the next two to 'z' (26), that's 18+26+26=70, so "rzz". Is there a smaller lex order than "rzz"? Let's see.

If I set the first letter to 'q' (17), then the remaining sum is 53 for the last two letters. If I set the second letter to 'z' (26), then the third letter would be 27, which is beyond 'z' (26), so that's invalid. If I set the second letter to 'y' (25), then the third letter would be 53-25=28, which is again invalid. So 'q' doesn't work for the first letter.

With 'r' (18), the remaining sum is 70-18=52, which can be divided as 26+26, so "rzz" is valid.

Is there any way to get a smaller first letter? Seems not, because 'q' doesn't work.

Another example: n=3.

The smallest possible word is "aaa", since 1+1+1=3.

n=55.

Let's see: "czz": 3 + 26 + 26 = 55. Is there a smaller lex order? Let's try "b z z": 2 + 26 + 26 = 54, which is less than 55. So "bzz" is 54, which is less than 55. So I need a higher first letter.

"c z z": 3 + 26 + 26 = 55, which matches. Is there a smaller lex order than "czz"? Let's see.

If I try "a z z": 1 + 26 + 26 = 53, which is less than 55.

"b z z": 2 + 26 + 26 = 54, still less.

So "czz" is the smallest.

Another example: n=48.

"a u z": 1 + 21 + 26 = 48. Is there a smaller lex order? Let's see.

"a t z": 1 + 20 + 26 = 47, which is less than 48.

"a u z": 1 + 21 + 26 = 48.

Is there any other combination with smaller letters?

If I try "a v z": 1 + 22 + 26 = 49, which is more than 48.

So "auz" seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it correctly implements this logic.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the sum n.

It initializes an empty list arr for each test case.

Then, it iterates twice (for j in range(2)), which suggests it's trying to set values for the first two letters, and the third will be determined by the remaining sum.

In the loop, it checks if n < 28, then sets arr.append(1), and subtracts 1 from n.

If n < 52, it sets arr.append(26), and subtracts 26 from n.

If n <= 78, it sets arr.append(26), and subtracts 26 from n.

After the loop, it appends the remaining n as the third letter.

Then, it sorts the array arr and converts the numbers to letters using chr(info[i][j] + 96).

Wait, sorting the array after setting the letters seems incorrect because we want the smallest lex order, which should be achieved by minimizing the earlier letters, not by sorting the entire word.

For example, in the first test case with n=24, the program would set arr=[1,1], then append 22, sort to [1,1,22], which corresponds to "aav", which is correct.

In the second test case n=70, it would set arr=[26,26], append 18, sort to [18,26,26], which is "rzz", which is correct.

In the third test case n=3, it would set arr=[1,1], append 1, sort to [1,1,1], which is "aaa", correct.

In the fourth test case n=55, it would set arr=[26,26], append 3, sort to [3,26,26], which is "czz", correct.

In the fifth test case n=48, it would set arr=[26,26], append 48-52=-4, which is invalid. Wait, n=48, arr=[26,26], n=48-26-26=-4, which is invalid.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's see:

For n=48, first iteration j=0:

n=48 >28, so arr.append(26), n=48-26=22

Second iteration j=1:

n=22 <28, so arr.append(1), n=22-1=21

Then append 21, so arr=[26,1,21], sort to [1,21,26], which is "auz", which is correct.

So, in this case, it worked.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's consider another example, say n=27.

According to the program:

First iteration: n=27 >28? No, n<28, so arr.append(1), n=27-1=26

Second iteration: n=26 <52, so arr.append(26), n=26-26=0

Then append 0, sort [1,26,0], which is [0,1,26], but letter 'a' corresponds to 1, so 0 is invalid.

This seems wrong. The correct word for n=27 should be "abz": 1+2+26=29, which is more than 27. Wait, but "aaz":1+1+25=27, which is valid and smaller than "abz".

So, the program would output [1,26,0], which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the program.

Let's look again:

for j in range(2):

if lex <28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

elif lex <=78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, arr.append(lex)

Then, arr.sort()

So, in the case n=27:

First iteration: n=27 <28, so arr.append(1), n=27-1=26

Second iteration: n=26 <52, so arr.append(26), n=26-26=0

Then, arr.append(0), so arr=[1,26,0], sort to [0,1,26]

But 'a' is 1, 'z' is 26, and 0 is invalid.

So, this is a problem. The program would try to use 0, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the program avoids this by ensuring that the sum is correct.

But in this case, 1+26+0=27, but 0 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the program doesn't handle the constraints properly.

Let me check another example.

n=25

First iteration: n=25 <28, arr.append(1), n=25-1=24

Second iteration: n=24 <52, arr.append(26), n=24-26=-2

Then, arr.append(-2), so arr=[1,26,-2], sort to [-2,1,26], which is invalid.

But the correct word for n=25 is "aay":1+1+23=25.

So, the program seems to have issues in these cases.

Another example: n=28

First iteration: n=28 <28? No, n<52? Yes, arr.append(26), n=28-26=2

Second iteration: n=2 <28, arr.append(1), n=2-1=1

Then, arr.append(1), so arr=[26,1,1], sort to [1,1,26], which is "aaz", sum=1+1+26=28, correct.

So, in this case, it works.

But in n=27, it tries to use 0, which is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to see how the program handles n=27.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let's see:

n=27

First iteration: n=27, which is <28, so arr.append(1), n=27-1=26

Second iteration: n=26, which is <52, so arr.append(26), n=26-26=0

Then, arr.append(0), so arr=[1,26,0], sort to [0,1,26]

Then, converting 0 to a letter would be invalid, as 'a' is 1.

So, perhaps the program needs to ensure that no letter is 0.

Wait, but in the example given, n=24 outputs "aav", which is correct.

n=70 outputs "rzz", correct.

n=3 outputs "aaa", correct.

n=55 outputs "czz", correct.

n=48 outputs "auz", correct.

But in my test case n=27, it outputs [0,1,26], which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps in the program, since it's using chr(info[i][j] +96), and 0 +96=96, which is '`', which is invalid.

So, the program would output something like "`az", which is invalid.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it can produce invalid letters.

Moreover, the logic seems flawed because it doesn't ensure that all letters are between 1 and 26.

I think a better approach would be to set the first letter as small as possible, then set the second letter as small as possible given the first letter, and finally set the third letter to be the remaining sum minus the first two letters, ensuring that it's between 1 and 26.

So, for n=27, starting with 'a' (1), remaining sum is 26. Then set the second letter to 'a' (1), remaining third letter is 25, which is 'y', so "aay", which is correct.

But the program tries to set the first two letters based on the conditions, which can lead to invalid letters.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is incorrect because it can produce invalid letters with value 0.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given value. The letters are converted to their corresponding positions in the alphabet, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.

## Approach

1. **Minimize the First Letter**: Start with the smallest possible letter for the first position, which is 'a' (1).
2. **Minimize the Second Letter**: Given the first letter, choose the smallest possible letter for the second position.
3. **Calculate the Third Letter**: The third letter is determined by subtracting the sum of the first two letters from the total sum. Ensure it is within the range [1, 26].

## Solution Code

```python
def find_smallest_word(target_sum):
    # Ensure target_sum is within bounds
    if target_sum < 3 or target_sum > 78:
        return "Invalid sum"
    
    # Iterate over all possible first letters
    for first in range(1, 27):
        # Iterate over all possible second letters
        for second in range(1, 27):
            third = target_sum - first - second
            # Check if the third letter is within bounds
            if 1 <= third <= 26:
                # Return the lexicographically smallest word
                return chr(first + 96) + chr(second + 96) + chr(third + 96)
    return "No valid word found"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        n = int(data[i])
        print(find_smallest_word(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of test cases and the target sums from the input.
2. **Finding the Smallest Word**:
    - For each test case, iterate through all possible values for the first and second letters.
    - Calculate the required value for the third letter.
    - If the third letter is within the valid range [1, 26], form the word and return it.
    - Since we iterate from the smallest possible letters, the first valid word found will be the lexicographically smallest.
3. **Output the Result**: Print the smallest word for each test case.

This approach ensures that we always get the smallest possible word in lex order for the given sum.
