Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I need to perform exactly K operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after K operations, and since the sum can be very large, I need to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation does. So, in one operation, I choose a contiguous subarray, calculate its sum, and then insert that sum into the array somewhere. The key here is that I can choose where to insert it, but the value is fixed as the sum of the chosen subarray.

My aim is to maximize the sum of the array after K operations. Since I have to perform exactly K operations, I need to figure out the best way to choose and insert these subarray sums.

Let me think about the sum of the array. Initially, it's just the sum of the given array A. Each operation allows me to insert a sum of a subarray into the array, which effectively increases the total sum by that subarray sum.

Wait a minute, when I insert the sum of a subarray into the array, I'm adding that sum to the total sum of the array. So, to maximize the total sum after K operations, I need to choose subarrays whose sums are as large as possible to insert into the array.

So, the problem reduces to selecting K subarrays, computing their sums, and adding those sums to the total sum of the array. I need to maximize this total addition.

But there's a catch: each operation inserts a sum into the array, which might allow for larger sums in subsequent operations. I need to consider how the inserted sums affect the possible sums in future operations.

Let me consider a simple example to understand this better.

Take the first example from the input:

2 2

-4 -7

According to the note, it's advantageous to take empty subarrays twice and insert zero each time, resulting in a sum of -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

But why would someone choose to insert zero if they can choose a subarray with a positive sum? In this case, all possible subarrays have negative sums, so inserting zero is better than inserting a negative sum.

So, in cases where all subarrays have negative sums, inserting zero is the best choice.

In the second example:

3 3

2 2 8

The note says to take the sum of the entire array (12) and insert it three times, resulting in sums 12, 24, and 48 added successively.

So, the total sum would be the initial sum plus 12 + 24 + 48 = 12 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96.

Wait, but according to the operation, each time you insert the sum of a subarray into the array, not replace anything, just insert it somewhere in the array.

So, starting with [2,2,8], sum=12.

First operation: choose the entire array [2,2,8], sum=12, insert 12 somewhere, say at the end: [2,2,8,12], sum=24.

Second operation: choose the entire new array [2,2,8,12], sum=24, insert 24 somewhere, say at the end: [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48.

Third operation: choose the entire new array [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48, insert 48 somewhere, say at the end: [2,2,8,12,24,48], sum=96.

So, by choosing the entire array each time and inserting its sum back, the sum doubles each time.

That makes sense.

So, in this case, the optimal strategy is to choose the entire array each time, getting the current sum and adding it back to the array, effectively doubling the sum each time.

Wait, but doubling the sum each time isn't always possible, right? Because you can only insert one sum per operation, not multiple sums.

Wait, in the second operation, you have the updated array including the previously inserted sum.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

After the first operation, you have [2,2,8,12], sum=24.

In the second operation, you can choose any subarray of this new array and insert its sum.

Choosing the entire array [2,2,8,12], sum=24, insert 24 into the array, making it [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48.

In the third operation, choose the entire array [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48, insert 48 into the array, making it [2,2,8,12,24,48], sum=96.

So, yes, by choosing the entire array each time and inserting its sum, the sum doubles each time.

Is this always the optimal strategy?

Let me consider another example.

Take the fourth test case:

5 1

4 -2 8 -12 9

According to the note, it's advantageous to take the subarray [4, -2, 8], sum=10, and insert it at the beginning, resulting in [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], sum=17.

So, in this case, inserting the sum of a positive subarray is better than inserting the sum of the entire array, which would be 4 + (-2) + 8 + (-12) + 9 = 7, but inserting 10 gives a higher sum of 17 compared to inserting 7, which would give 4 + (-2) + 8 + (-12) + 9 + 7 = 14.

Hence, choosing the subarray with the maximum sum and inserting it is better than inserting the sum of the entire array.

So, perhaps the strategy is to find the maximum sum subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum in each operation.

But wait, in the second example, inserting the sum of the entire array was better because it led to exponential growth.

But in the fourth example, inserting the sum of a partial subarray was better.

So, there must be a better general strategy.

Let me think about this more carefully.

Each operation allows me to add any subarray sum to the array. The sum of the array increases by that subarray sum.

I need to maximize the sum of the array after K operations.

Wait, but I need to add the subarray sum to the array, which then becomes part of the array for future operations.

Wait, no. When I insert the subarray sum into the array, it becomes an element of the array, so it can be part of future subarrays.

But the key is that I can choose where to insert it, but the problem probably doesn't matter where I insert it since I can always choose to insert it in a way that allows me to include it in future subarrays.

Wait, but the problem says "insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array."

So, I can insert it at any position in the array.

But perhaps it's best to think about the sum added at each step separately.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each operation allows me to add to the total sum the sum of any subarray (including the empty subarray, which sums to zero).

But, in reality, when I insert a subarray sum into the array, it becomes part of the array, potentially affecting future subarray sums.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider an alternative approach.

Let me consider that each operation allows me to add to the total sum the sum of any subarray, because I'm inserting that sum into the array, and that sum then becomes part of the array for future operations.

But it's not just adding the subarray sum once; it's adding it and then potentially including it in future subarrays.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can model this as adding the subarray sum to the array, which then allows that sum to be included in future subarrays.

Wait, maybe I can think recursively.

Let me denote S as the initial sum of the array.

Then, in each operation, I can choose to add any subarray sum, say P, to the array, which increases the total sum to S + P.

Then, in the next operation, I can choose another subarray sum from the updated array, which now includes P.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

In the second example:

Initial array: [2,2,8], S=12

After first operation: insert 12, array becomes [2,2,8,12], S=24

After second operation: insert 24, array becomes [2,2,8,12,24], S=48

After third operation: insert 48, array becomes [2,2,8,12,24,48], S=96

So, the sum doubles each time.

Wait, but 12 + 12 = 24, 24 + 24 = 48, 48 + 48 = 96.

So, each operation adds the current sum to itself.

Hence, sum becomes sum + sum = 2*sum.

So, after K operations, sum becomes S * (2^K).

But in the fourth example:

Initial array: [4,-2,8,-12,9], S=7

Choose subarray [4,-2,8], sum=10, insert at beginning: [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], S=17

But according to the previous pattern, if I were to double the sum each time, starting from S=7, after one operation, it should be 14.

But choosing a better subarray sum allows me to add more than just doubling.

Wait, in this case, adding 10 increases the sum to 17, which is more than doubling.

So, perhaps the strategy is to, in each operation, add the maximum possible subarray sum available at that time.

In the second example, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the entire array, which allows for doubling.

In the fourth example, adding a subarray sum of 10 in the first operation gives a higher sum than doubling the initial sum.

Wait, but in the second example, adding the sum of the entire array allows for exponential growth because each time you're adding the current sum, effectively doubling it.

In the fourth example, adding 10 in the first operation gives 17, which is better than doubling the initial sum from 7 to 14.

But if I were to add 17 in the second operation, I would get 17 + 17 = 34, which is better than adding the sum of any subarray in the updated array.

Wait, but I only have one operation in this example.

Okay, perhaps the strategy is to, in each operation, add the maximum subarray sum possible at that step.

Kadane's algorithm can find the maximum subarray sum in O(N) time.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is, in each operation, find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, insert it into the array, and repeat for K operations.

But this seems inefficient because K can be up to 2*10^5, and for each operation, running Kadane's algorithm would be O(N), leading to O(N*K) time complexity, which is too slow (up to 4*10^10 operations).

Hence, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I observe that inserting the sum of the entire array in each operation allows the sum to double each time, as in the second example.

But in cases where there are positive subarrays, inserting their sums can lead to higher increases.

Wait, but in reality, inserting the sum of the entire array is equivalent to inserting the current sum, which, when added to the array, allows the sum to double.

But if there are positive subarrays, inserting their sums can lead to higher increases.

Wait, but in the fourth example, inserting the sum of the entire array (7) would lead to a sum of 14, but inserting the sum of [4,-2,8]=10 leads to a sum of 17, which is better.

So, perhaps the strategy is to, in each operation, add the maximum subarray sum possible, but not necessarily the sum of the entire array.

But how do I find this maximum subarray sum efficiently over K operations?

Wait, perhaps I can compute the maximum subarray sum once, and then in each operation, add that maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

But that might not be optimal because the array changes after each insertion.

Wait, but in the second example, adding the current sum (which is the sum of the entire array) in each operation leads to exponential growth.

But in the fourth example, adding a higher subarray sum leads to a higher total sum.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the maximum subarray sum that can be achieved in the initial array, and then, in each operation, add that maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

But that might not account for the fact that inserting sums can create larger subarrays in future operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the maximum increase per operation is equal to the maximum subarray sum of the current array.

But computing this in each operation is too slow.

Is there a way to compute the maximum subarray sum over all K operations more efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can compute the maximum subarray sum of the initial array once, and then note that, in each operation, I can add that maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

But that doesn't account for the fact that inserting sums can create larger subarrays in future operations.

Wait, in the second example, by inserting the sum of the entire array each time, the sum doubles each time, which is equivalent to adding the current sum each time.

But in the fourth example, adding the maximum subarray sum once gives a better increase than adding the sum of the entire array.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to add the maximum subarray sum in the initial array in each operation, rather than recomputing it each time.

But that might not be optimal because, in some cases, adding the sum of the entire array leads to exponential growth.

Wait, but in the second example, adding the sum of the entire array leads to exponential growth, which is better than just adding the maximum subarray sum each time.

But in the fourth example, adding the maximum subarray sum once gives a higher sum than adding the sum of the entire array.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both options: adding the sum of the entire array or adding the maximum subarray sum.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to add the sum of the entire array in each operation, which allows for exponential growth.

But in cases where the maximum subarray sum is larger than the sum of the entire array, adding the maximum subarray sum can lead to a higher total sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum between the sum of the entire array and the maximum subarray sum.

Wait, but the sum of the entire array is always greater than or equal to the maximum subarray sum if all elements are non-negative, but if there are negative elements, the maximum subarray sum could be higher than the sum of the entire array.

Wait, no, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the subarray with the largest sum, which could be larger than the sum of the entire array if there are negative elements.

Wait, no, the sum of the entire array is the sum of all elements, and the maximum subarray sum is the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.

So, in the fourth example, the sum of the entire array is 4 + (-2) + 8 + (-12) + 9 = 7, but the maximum subarray sum is 4 + (-2) + 8 = 10, which is larger than the sum of the entire array.

So, in this case, adding 10 is better than adding 7.

But if I add 10, the new sum becomes 17, and the maximum subarray sum could potentially be higher in the next operation.

But computing this for K operations seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as, in each operation, I can add the maximum subarray sum of the current array.

But to optimize, perhaps I can compute the maximum subarray sum of the initial array, say M, and then, in each operation, add M to the total sum.

But this assumes that M doesn't change after inserting M into the array, which might not be the case.

Wait, but in reality, inserting M into the array could create a larger maximum subarray sum in the next operation.

For example, if I have [A, B, C] with sum S and maximum subarray sum M.

I insert M into the array: [A, B, C, M].

Now, the maximum subarray sum could be M or a combination that includes M.

If M is positive, then the maximum subarray sum could be M plus some other elements, potentially leading to a larger M in the next operation.

But this seems too vague to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to compute the total sum after K operations more efficiently.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any subarray sum to the total sum, and I need to maximize the total sum after K operations.

This seems similar to choosing K subarrays whose sums to add to the total sum, with the condition that each chosen subarray sum is added to the array for future operations.

But this interdependence makes it complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that, after each operation, the sum of the array increases by the subarray sum that I choose to insert.

Hence, the total sum after K operations would be the initial sum plus the sum of the K subarray sums that I choose to insert.

But I need to maximize this total sum, so I need to choose the K largest possible subarray sums to insert.

But the problem is that each chosen subarray sum affects the array for future operations.

This seems too interdependent to handle directly.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I denote the sum of the array after K operations as S_K.

Initially, S_0 is the sum of the array.

After the first operation, S_1 = S_0 + M1, where M1 is the sum of the chosen subarray.

After the second operation, S_2 = S_1 + M2, where M2 is the sum of the chosen subarray from the updated array.

And so on, up to S_K = S_{K-1} + MK.

My goal is to maximize S_K.

The challenge is that each MK depends on the previous operations because the array is updated with each insertion.

This seems too recursive and computationally expensive.

Is there a pattern or formula that can express S_K in terms of S_0 and the maximum subarray sum?

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can choose to add the current maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

If I can ensure that the maximum subarray sum doesn't decrease over operations, then I can add the initial maximum subarray sum in each operation.

But in reality, inserting the maximum subarray sum can potentially create larger subarrays in future operations.

Wait, perhaps I can find a lower bound by always adding the initial maximum subarray sum.

But I need the exact maximum, not just a lower bound.

This isn't sufficient.

Let me think about the properties of the maximum subarray sum.

Kadane's algorithm can find the maximum subarray sum in O(N) time.

But running it K times is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the maximum sum after K operations in a more efficient manner.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any subarray sum to the total sum, and I need to maximize the total sum after K operations.

This seems similar to choosing K subarrays whose sums to add to the total sum, with the condition that each chosen subarray sum is added to the array for future operations.

But again, this is too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that, after K operations, the total sum is the initial sum plus the sum of K chosen subarray sums, where each subsequent subarray sum can be influenced by the previous insertions.

This seems too complex to handle directly.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I observe that, in each operation, I can choose to add the sum of the entire array, which is S.

Then, after the first operation, the sum becomes S + S = 2S.

After the second operation, I can add 2S, making the total sum 2S + 2S = 4S.

After the third operation, I can add 4S, making the total sum 4S + 4S = 8S.

And so on, up to K operations, resulting in S * (2^K).

But in some cases, adding the maximum subarray sum instead of the entire array sum can lead to higher totals.

For example, in the fourth test case, adding the maximum subarray sum of 10 in the first operation gives 17, which is better than adding the sum of the entire array, which is 7, resulting in 14.

But in the second test case, adding the sum of the entire array in each operation leads to exponential growth, which is better.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose, in each operation, to add either the sum of the entire array or the maximum subarray sum, whichever is larger.

Wait, but the maximum subarray sum can be larger than the sum of the entire array if there are negative elements.

Hence, perhaps I should set M as the maximum subarray sum of the initial array, and S as the sum of the entire array.

Then, in each operation, I can choose to add M to the total sum.

Hence, after K operations, the total sum would be S + K*M.

But in the second test case, this would give S + K*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but the actual result is 96.

So, this approach underestimates the sum.

Hence, it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, by adding M in each operation, the array's sum increases by M each time, and potentially M can increase in future operations.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I denote M as the maximum subarray sum of the initial array.

Then, in each operation, I can add M to the total sum, and potentially, M can increase in future operations.

But I need a way to model this growth.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that, after each operation, the sum of the array becomes S + M, and in the next operation, I can add M again, leading to S + 2M, and so on.

But in the second test case, this would be S + K*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but the actual result is 96.

So, this is not accurate.

Wait, in the second test case, adding the sum of the entire array each time leads to doubling the sum each time.

So, starting with S=12, after first operation: S=12 + 12=24, second operation: S=24 + 24=48, third operation: S=48 + 48=96.

So, it's not just adding M each time, but adding the current sum each time.

Hence, it's more like S *= 2 in each operation.

But in the fourth test case, adding M=10 in the first operation gives S=17.

Then, in the second operation, if I add M=17, I get S=34, which is better than adding the initial M=10.

But in that case, M increases with each operation.

This seems like M is growing exponentially.

But this is getting too complicated.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any subarray sum to the total sum.

Hence, to maximize the total sum after K operations, I need to add the largest possible subarray sum in each operation.

But as we've seen, the largest subarray sum can change after each insertion.

Hence, perhaps I need to find a way to maximize the sum by choosing the best possible subarray sums to add in each operation.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that, in each operation, I can add the sum of the entire array to the total sum, and then insert that sum into the array.

Hence, after each operation, the sum of the array doubles.

Hence, after K operations, the sum would be S * (2^K).

But in the fourth test case, adding the sum of the entire array in each operation would lead to S=7, then 14, then 28, etc., but choosing to add a larger M=10 in the first operation gives a higher sum.

Hence, this approach might not always be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose, in the first operation, to add the maximum subarray sum M, and then, in subsequent operations, add the current sum of the array.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Let me consider the following approach:

Compute the maximum subarray sum M of the initial array.

Then, in each operation, add M to the total sum.

Hence, after K operations, the total sum would be S + K*M.

But, as we've seen in the second test case, this underestimates the sum.

Hence, it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, after adding M in the first operation, the array changes, and the new maximum subarray sum could be higher.

Hence, perhaps I need to set M to the maximum of the initial M and S.

Wait, but this seems arbitrary.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I denote M as the maximum subarray sum of the initial array.

Then, after the first operation, I can add M to the sum, making it S + M.

In the second operation, I can add M again, making it S + 2*M.

And so on, up to S + K*M.

But, as we've seen, in some cases, adding the sum of the entire array leads to exponential growth.

Hence, this linear approach is insufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, after each operation, the sum of the array becomes S + M, and then in the next operation, I can add S + M, leading to exponential growth.

But this seems similar to the doubling approach in the second test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to set M to S, the sum of the entire array, and then in each operation, add the current sum to itself.

Hence, sum after K operations is S * (2^K).

But in the fourth test case, adding M=10 in the first operation gives S=17, then adding 17 in the second operation gives S=34, which is better than adding S=7 in each operation (which would give S=7*(2^K)).

Wait, but in the second test case, adding S in each operation leads to S*(2^K), which matches the example.

In the fourth test case, adding M=10 in the first operation and then adding the new sum in subsequent operations leads to higher sums than just adding S in each operation.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is to set M as the maximum between S and the maximum subarray sum, and then in each operation, add M to the sum.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, M=10 and S=7, so M > S.

Hence, set M=10.

Then, after K operations, the sum would be S + K*M = 7 + K*10.

But in the example, with K=1, it's 17, which matches 7 + 1*10 = 17.

But in the second test case, with S=12 and M=12, it's 12 + K*12, which for K=3 would be 48, but the actual sum is 96.

Hence, this approach doesn't work for the second test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to set M as the maximum subarray sum, and then in each operation, add M to the sum, and update M to be the maximum of the previous M and the new sum.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any subarray sum to the total sum, and I need to maximize the total sum after K operations.

Hence, the total sum is S + sum_{i=1 to K} M_i, where M_i is the subarray sum added in the i-th operation.

My aim is to maximize this sum.

But without knowing how M_i relates to previous operations, it's hard to find a general formula.

This seems too complex.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can choose to add any subarray sum, including the sum of the entire array.

Hence, if I choose to add the sum of the entire array in each operation, the sum doubles each time.

Hence, sum after K operations is S * (2^K).

But in some cases, choosing to add a larger M (maximum subarray sum) in the first operation and then adding the updated sum in subsequent operations can lead to higher sums.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is to choose, in the first operation, to add the maximum subarray sum M, and then in each subsequent operation, add the current sum to itself.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can set the initial sum S and the maximum subarray sum M.

Then, in the first operation, add M to S, making it S + M.

In the second operation, add S + M to the sum, making it S + M + S + M = 2*(S + M).

In the third operation, add 2*(S + M) to the sum, making it 2*(S + M) + 2*(S + M) = 4*(S + M).

And so on, up to K operations.

Hence, after K operations, the sum would be (S + M) * (2^{K-1}).

But in the fourth test case, with S=7 and M=10, and K=1, this would give (7 + 10) * (2^{0}) = 17, which matches the example.

In the second test case, S=12 and M=12, so (12 + 12) * (2^{K-1}) = 24 * (2^{K-1}).

For K=3, this would be 24 * 4 = 96, which matches the example.

Hence, perhaps this is the general formula: sum after K operations is (S + M) * (2^{K-1}).

But let's check with another example.

Take the first test case:

2 2

-4 -7

S = -11, M = 0 (since all subarrays have negative sums or zero).

Hence, sum after K operations is ( -11 + 0 ) * (2^{1}) = -11 * 2 = -22.

But according to the note, it's 999,999,996, which is -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Hence, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle negative sums differently.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is sum = S + M * (2^{K} - 1).

In the second test case:

S=12, M=12

sum = 12 + 12*(8 - 1) = 12 + 12*7 = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches.

In the fourth test case:

S=7, M=10, K=1

sum = 7 + 10*(2 - 1) = 7 + 10*1 = 17, which matches.

In the first test case:

S=-11, M=0

sum = -11 + 0*(4 - 1) = -11 + 0 = -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

Hence, this formula seems to work.

Hence, the general formula for the sum after K operations is:

sum = S + M * (2^K - 1)

where S is the initial sum of the array, and M is the maximum subarray sum of the initial array.

This seems to align with the examples.

Hence, the strategy is:

1. Compute the initial sum S of the array.

2. Compute the maximum subarray sum M of the initial array.

3. Compute the sum after K operations as sum = S + M * (2^K - 1)

4. Take the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

This seems efficient, as computing S is O(N), computing M using Kadane's algorithm is O(N), and the rest is O(1).

Hence, total time complexity is O(N), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Let me verify this formula with another example.

Take the seventh test case:

6 1000

-1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000

S = -6000000000

M = 0 (since all elements are negative)

Hence, sum = -6000000000 + 0*(2^{1000} - 1) = -6000000000

Modulo 10^9 + 7: (-6000000000) mod (10^9 + 7)

Since 10^9 + 7 is 1000000007,

-6000000000 mod 1000000007.

To compute this, we can do:

-6000000000 mod 1000000007 = (-6*1000000000) mod 1000000007

= (-6*1000000000 + 6*1000000007) mod 1000000007

= ( -6000000000 + 6000000042 ) mod 1000000007

= 42 mod 1000000007 = 42

But according to the sample output, it's 42.

Hence, the formula works.

Another test case:

2 1

1000000000 8

S = 1000000008

M = 1000000000 (the first element)

Hence, sum = 1000000008 + 1000000000*(2 - 1) = 1000000008 + 1000000000 = 2000000008

Modulo 10^9 + 7: 2000000008 mod 1000000007 = 2000000008 - 1000000007 = 999999991

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

2000000008 - 1000000007 = 999999991, which is still larger than 1000000007.

So, 999999991 - 1000000007 = -14, which modulo 1000000007 is -14 + 1000000007 = 1000000007 - 14 = 999999993.

But the sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Let me compute 2000000008 mod 1000000007 correctly.

2000000008 divided by 1000000007 is 1 with a remainder of 2000000008 - 1000000007 = 999999991.

But 999999991 is still larger than 1000000007, which it's not; 999999991 is less than 1000000007.

Hence, 2000000008 mod 1000000007 = 999999991.

But the sample output is 2, which suggests that my formula is incorrect for this case.

Hence, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, perhaps I need to take into account that, when M is added, it's added to the sum, but also, M could be part of future subarrays.

But in this case, adding M=1000000000 in the first operation makes the new sum 2000000008, but perhaps in the next operations, I can add even larger M.

But in this particular case, K=1, so only one operation.

Hence, according to my formula, sum = S + M*(2^K -1) = 1000000008 + 1000000000*(1) = 2000000008 mod 1000000007 = 999999991, but the sample output is 2.

There must be a mistake in my formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, when M is added to the array, it can be included in future subarrays, potentially increasing M in future operations.

But in this case, K=1, so it's just adding M once.

Hence, sum should be S + M = 1000000008 + 1000000000 = 2000000008 mod 1000000007 = 999999991.

But the sample output is 2, which suggests that my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, in each operation, I can add any subarray sum, including the sum of the entire array, which includes the previously added M.

Wait, but in this case, K=1, so it's just adding M once.

I'm confused here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum = S + M * (2^K -1 - K)

But in the second test case, with K=3, it would be S + M*(8 - 3 -1) = 12 + 12*4 = 60, which doesn't match the sample output of 96.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum = S * (2^K) + M * (2^K -1)

But in the second test case, that would be 12*8 + 12*7 = 96 + 84 = 180, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that, in each operation, I can add the current sum to itself.

Hence, sum after K operations is S * (2^K)

But in the fourth test case, with S=7 and K=1, sum would be 14, but the sample output is 17, which is higher.

Hence, this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to set M as the maximum of S and the maximum subarray sum.

Hence, M = max(S, maximum subarray sum)

Then, sum after K operations is M * (2^K) - S

In the second test case, M=12, S=12, sum = 12*8 - 12 = 96 -12=84, which doesn't match the sample output of 96.

Hence, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps
