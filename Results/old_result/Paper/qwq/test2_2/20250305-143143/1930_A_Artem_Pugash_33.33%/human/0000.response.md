Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is as large as possible. Since I have to do this for multiple test cases, efficiency might be important, but given that n can be up to 50, and there are up to 5000 test cases, I need to make sure my solution is optimized.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I sort the numbers, maybe that can help. For example, if I sort them in ascending order, I can pair the smallest numbers together. Wait, but I need to maximize the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair. So, if I pair the smallest with the next smallest, their minimum will be the smaller one, which might not be the best strategy.

Wait a minute, no. Actually, that might be the best strategy. Let's consider why. If I pair the smallest with the next smallest, I'm adding the smallest one to my score. Then, the next pair will be the next two smallest, and so on. Since I'm adding the smaller of each pair, and I'm pairing the smallest available numbers each time, I'm ensuring that I'm adding the smallest possible numbers in a way that maximizes the sum, given that all numbers are being used.

But is there a better way? Let's think about an example. Suppose I have numbers [1,2,3,4]. If I pair 1 with 2, I get min(1,2)=1, and pair 3 with 4, getting min(3,4)=3, for a total of 4. If I pair 1 with 3, I get min(1,3)=1, and pair 2 with 4, getting min(2,4)=2, for a total of 3. Wait, that's worse than the first pairing. If I pair 1 with 4, getting min(1,4)=1, and 2 with 3, getting min(2,3)=2, total is again 3, which is less than pairing the two smallest together.

So, in this case, pairing the smallest together gives a better score. Let's try another example. Suppose I have [1,1,2,2]. If I pair 1 with 1, I get min(1,1)=1, and pair 2 with 2, getting min(2,2)=2, for a total of 3. If I pair 1 with 2, I get min(1,2)=1, and pair 1 with 2, getting min(1,2)=1, for a total of 2, which is less than the first pairing.

So, it seems that pairing the smallest numbers together gives a better score. Is this always the case? Let's think about why this might be optimal.

If I sort the numbers in ascending order, and then pair them consecutively, I'm pairing the smallest with the next smallest, and so on. Since I'm adding the smaller one of each pair, and the smaller one is as large as possible in this pairing strategy, it seems optimal.

Wait, but in the second example, pairing [1,1,2,2], pairing [1,1] and [2,2] gives a sum of 3, whereas pairing [1,2] and [1,2] gives a sum of 2. So, pairing like this does indeed maximize the sum.

Let me think about another example. Suppose I have [1,2,3,4,5,6]. If I pair [1,2], [3,4], [5,6], I get 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. If I pair [1,3], [2,4], [5,6], I get 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, which is less than 9. If I pair [1,5], [2,6], [3,4], I get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is even less. So, again, pairing the smallest together gives the highest sum.

It seems that sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them consecutively maximizes the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

Let me try to see why this works in general. If I sort the numbers as a1 <= a2 <= ... <= a_{2n}, and pair (a1, a2), (a3, a4), ..., (a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}), then the sum is a1 + a3 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this always greater than any other pairing? Let's consider another pairing where I swap some pairs. For example, suppose I pair (a1, a3), (a2, a4), etc. Then the sum would be a1 + a2 + a5 + ..., which might be less than the original sum.

Wait, in the earlier example, pairing [1,1,2,2], pairing [1,1] and [2,2] gives 1 + 2 = 3, while pairing [1,2] and [1,2] gives 1 + 1 = 2, which is less.

Similarly, in [1,2,3,4], pairing [1,2] and [3,4] gives 1 + 3 = 4, while pairing [1,3] and [2,4] gives 1 + 2 = 3, which is less.

So, it seems that pairing consecutive sorted numbers gives the maximum sum.

Is there a mathematical proof for this?

Yes, this is similar to the greedy algorithm where you always choose the locally optimal choice, which leads to the global optimum.

In this case, by sorting the numbers and pairing them consecutively, you're ensuring that the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest possible numbers, thus maximizing the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

Alternatively, think of it this way: to maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair, you want the smaller numbers to be in pairs where they are the larger number as much as possible. But by pairing them with even smaller numbers, you ensure that the smaller number in that pair is as large as possible.

Wait, actually, no. By pairing a smaller number with an even smaller number, the minimum is the even smaller number. But in reality, by pairing the two smallest together, you're adding the smallest one to the sum, and then the next smallest, and so on.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each pair, I'm adding the smaller number to the sum. So, I want the smaller numbers to be paired with larger numbers only if that allows me to keep more of the larger numbers for other pairs.

But in reality, pairing the smallest with the next smallest ensures that I'm adding the smallest possible numbers in a way that the sum is maximized, because each pair's minimum is as large as possible given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I should look at it this way: sorted in ascending order, the first pair is (a1, a2), sum min(a1, a2) = a1. The next pair is (a3, a4), sum min(a3, a4) = a3, and so on.

Any other pairing would involve pairing a smaller number with a larger number, which would make the minimum in that pair the smaller number, and then the next pair would have to pair the next smallest with possibly a larger number, and so on.

But in the consecutive pairing, each pair's minimum is the smaller of the two, which is the next smallest available number.

Let me see if there's a counterexample where pairing non-consecutive numbers gives a higher sum.

Suppose I have [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Consecutive pairing: (1,2)->1, (3,4)->3, (5,6)->5, sum=9.

Alternative pairing: (1,3)->1, (2,4)->2, (5,6)->5, sum=8, which is less than 9.

Another alternative: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6) ->1 + 2 + 3=6, which is less than 9.

Another one: (1,5), (2,6), (3,4) ->1 + 2 + 3=6, again less than 9.

So, it seems that the consecutive pairing gives the highest sum.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the numbers in ascending order and pair them consecutively, adding the smaller one of each pair to the sum.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

numCases = int(input())

for i in range(numCases):

numInteger = int(input())

numbers = input().split()

numbers.sort(reverse=False)

suma = 0

while numbers != []:

a = int(numbers.pop(0))

b = int(numbers.pop(0))

suma += min(a, b)

print(suma)

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. Read the number of test cases, numCases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, which is half the number of integers.

b. Read the 2n integers as a list called numbers.

c. Sort the numbers in ascending order (reverse=False).

d. Initialize suma to 0.

e. While there are numbers left in the list:

i. Pop the first two numbers, a and b.

ii. Add the minimum of a and b to suma.

f. Print the final suma.

Given that we've established that sorting in ascending order and pairing consecutive numbers gives the maximum sum, this seems correct.

But wait, in Python, the pop(0) operation is O(n), which is inefficient for large lists because it requires shifting all elements. Since n can be up to 50 and there are up to 5000 test cases, it's not ideal, but it should work within reasonable time limits.

Alternatively, since the list is sorted, and we're always taking the first two elements, we could simply iterate through the list in steps of 2.

But efficiency isn't the main concern here; correctness is.

Given that, is there any scenario where this approach might fail?

Let's consider the examples from the problem statement.

First test case:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output should be 2.

Sorting [2,3] gives [2,3]. Pop 2 and 3, min is 2. Sum is 2. Correct.

Second test case:

2

1 1 2 1

Sorting gives [1,1,1,2]. Pair (1,1)->1, (1,2)->1. Sum is 2. Correct.

Third test case:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Sorting gives [1,1,1,1,1,1]. Pair (1,1)->1, (1,1)->1, (1,1)->1. Sum is 3. Correct.

Seems correct.

Let me think of another test case.

Test case:

n=2

numbers=[1,2,3,4]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

Pair (1,2)->1, (3,4)->3. Sum=4.

Alternative pairing: (1,3)->1, (2,4)->2. Sum=3, which is less.

So, the program's approach is correct.

Another test case:

n=3

numbers=[1,2,2,3,3,4]

Sorted: [1,2,2,3,3,4]

Pair (1,2)->1, (2,3)->2, (3,4)->3. Sum=6.

Alternative pairing: (1,3)->1, (2,3)->2, (2,4)->2. Sum=5, which is less.

Again, the program's approach is better.

I can't think of any case where this approach would fail.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
