Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this magical girl named Nene who has an n by n matrix filled with zeros. She can perform two types of operations on this matrix:

1. Type 1: Choose a row i and a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and set the elements of that row to the permutation.

2. Type 2: Choose a column i and a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and set the elements of that column to the permutation.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix after performing operations, but with the constraint that the number of operations shouldn't exceed 2n.

First, I need to understand what permutations are. A permutation is just a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n. So, for example, if n is 3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the matrix starts with all zeros, and each operation allows me to set an entire row or column to a permutation. Each permutation sums up to the same value because they are just rearrangements of the same numbers. For example, for n=3, each permutation sums to 1+2+3=6.

Wait a minute, but the problem is to maximize the sum of the matrix. So, if I perform a type 1 operation on a row, I set that row to a permutation, and similarly for a type 2 operation on a column.

But here's the thing: if I perform a type 1 operation on a row, it sets all the elements in that row to the permutation, overwriting any previous values. Similarly, a type 2 operation on a column sets all the elements in that column to the permutation, overwriting any previous values.

So, I need to find a sequence of operations that maximizes the sum of the matrix, using no more than 2n operations.

Let me think about small values of n to get an idea.

Take n=1:

- The matrix is 1x1, starting with 0.

- I can do either a type 1 operation on row 1, setting it to [1], or a type 2 operation on column 1, setting it to [1].

- In either case, the matrix becomes [1], and the sum is 1.

- So, the maximum sum is 1, and I can achieve it with 1 operation.

Now, n=2:

- The matrix is 2x2, starting with zeros.

- I have at most 4 operations to perform.

- Let's see what I can do.

Option 1:

- Perform type 1 on row 1 with permutation [2,1]

- Perform type 1 on row 2 with permutation [2,1]

- The matrix becomes:

  | 2 | 1 |

  | 2 | 1 |

- Sum is 2+1+2+1=6

Option 2:

- Perform type 2 on column 1 with permutation [2,1]

- Perform type 2 on column 2 with permutation [2,1]

- The matrix becomes:

  | 2 | 2 |

  | 1 | 1 |

- Sum is 2+2+1+1=6

Option 3:

- Perform type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

- Perform type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]

- The matrix becomes:

  | 2 | 1 |

  | 2 | 0 |

- Sum is 2+1+2+0=5, which is less than previous options.

Option 4:

- Perform type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

- Perform type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]

- Perform type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]

- The matrix becomes:

  | 2 | 1 |

  | 2 | 1 |

- Sum is 2+1+2+1=6

Option 5:

- Perform type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

- Perform type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]

- Perform type 2 on column 2 with [2,1]

- The matrix becomes:

  | 2 | 2 |

  | 1 | 1 |

- Sum is 2+2+1+1=6

So, in all cases, the maximum sum seems to be 6 for n=2.

But according to the example in the problem, for n=2, the maximum sum is 7, not 6. Wait, let's check the example again.

In the example for n=2, the output is:

7 3

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

So, s=7 and m=3.

Wait, but in my earlier calculations, I was getting a sum of 6. Let me see what's going on here.

According to the example, the operations are:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's apply these operations step by step.

Initial matrix:

| 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 |

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

Matrix becomes:

| 1 | 2 |

| 0 | 0 |

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

Matrix becomes:

| 1 | 2 |

| 1 | 2 |

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

This sets column 1 to [1,2], so the matrix becomes:

| 1 | 2 |

| 2 | 2 |

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7.

Ah, I see. So, by performing operations in a specific order, we can achieve a higher sum than just setting all rows or all columns to the same permutation.

This suggests that there's some interaction between row and column operations that can lead to a higher total sum.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose I perform type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to some permutations, and then perform type 2 operations on some columns to overwrite certain elements.

Alternatively, I could mix the order of row and column operations to maximize the sum.

But this seems complicated. Is there a pattern or formula that can help me maximize the sum without having to try all possible combinations?

Let me think about the maximum possible sum.

Each operation, whether row or column, sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n. Since permutations have the same sum, the key is to maximize the number of times higher numbers are placed in the matrix.

But wait, since operations can overwrite previous values, I need to be careful about the order of operations.

Let me consider that each operation sets an entire row or column, potentially overwriting values set by previous operations.

I need to find a sequence of operations that maximizes the sum, using at most 2n operations.

Looking back at the example for n=2:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

| 1 | 2 |

| 2 | 2 |

Sum: 7

But if I had performed the operations in a different order:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

3. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

Let's see:

Initial:

| 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 |

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

| 1 | 2 |

| 0 | 0 |

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

| 1 | 2 |

| 2 | 0 |

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

| 1 | 2 |

| 1 | 2 |

Sum: 1+2+1+2=6, which is less than the previous sequence.

So, the order of operations matters.

Another sequence:

1. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 2 on column 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

Matrix after operation 1:

| 1 | 0 |

| 2 | 0 |

After operation 2:

| 1 | 1 |

| 2 | 2 |

After operation 3:

| 2 | 1 |

| 2 | 2 |

Sum: 2+1+2+2=7

Same sum as the example.

So, different sequences can achieve the same maximum sum.

Let me try to find a general pattern.

Suppose I perform type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], which is the permutation with the largest possible elements first.

Then, perform type 2 operations on all columns, also setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But wait, since each operation overwrites the previous values, the order is crucial.

Actually, if I perform type 1 operations on all rows and then type 2 operations on all columns, the final matrix would be determined by the last operation that set each element.

Specifically, for each element a_{i,j}, if the last operation that set it was a type 1 operation on row i with permutation p, then a_{i,j} = p_j. If the last operation that set it was a type 2 operation on column j with permutation q, then a_{i,j} = q_i.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, if I perform type 1 operations on all rows and then type 2 operations on all columns, each element will be set by the last operation that targeted it.

Similarly, if I interleave row and column operations, some elements might be set multiple times, and only the last operation counts.

Given that, perhaps there's an optimal order to perform these operations to maximize the sum.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each operation, whether row or column, allows me to set n elements to a permutation of 1 to n, summing to n(n+1)/2.

If I perform m row operations and k column operations, with m + k <= 2n, what is the maximum sum I can achieve?

But again, because operations can overwrite each other, it's not straightforward.

Perhaps I should consider that each row operation sets an entire row, and each column operation sets an entire column, and where rows and columns intersect, the last operation to set that element determines its value.

This sounds like it's related to covering the matrix with rows and columns, with some consideration of the order of operations.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or something similar applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning values to rows and columns in a way that maximizes the sum, considering that each row operation and each column operation can set the values in their respective rows or columns.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern based on small n values.

Let's try n=3.

n=1: sum=1, operations=1

n=2: sum=7, operations=3

n=3: let's see what sum I can achieve.

If I perform type 1 operations on all 3 rows, setting them to [3,2,1], then the matrix would be:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 3*6 = 18

Alternatively, if I perform type 2 operations on all 3 columns, setting them to [3,2,1], the matrix would be:

| 3 | 3 | 3 |

| 2 | 2 | 2 |

| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 3*6 = 18

Same sum.

Now, if I mix row and column operations, can I get a higher sum?

Let's try:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

Sum: 18

Alternative sequence:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 0 | 0 |

| 3 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 4: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

Sum: 18

Same as before.

Another sequence:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 3 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 0 |

| 3 | 2 | 0 |

Sum: 3+3+1 + 3+2+0 + 3+2+0 = 3+3+1 + 3+2+0 + 3+2+0 = 19

Wait, that's better than 18.

Let me verify:

After operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 0 | 0 |

| 1 | 0 | 0 |

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

| 3 | 3 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 0 |

| 1 | 2 | 0 |

Sum: 3+3+1 + 3+2+0 + 1+2+0 = 3+3+1=7; 3+2+0=5; 1+2+0=3; total 7+5+3=15, which is less than 18. Wait, earlier I thought it was 19, but now it's 15. Maybe miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Let me add it again: 3+3+1 + 3+2+0 + 1+2+0 = (3+3+1=7) + (3+2+0=5) + (1+2+0=3) = 7+5+3=15

But earlier, I thought it was 19, which was incorrect.

Another sequence:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

After operation 4:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 1 | 2 | 1 |

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 1+2+1=6+6+4=16, which is better than 15 but still less than 18.

Another sequence:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

After operation 1:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

After operation 2:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

After operation 3:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 1 | 0 | 0 |

After operation 4:

| 3 | 3 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 1 | 2 | 0 |

Sum: 3+3+1 + 3+2+1 + 1+2+0 = 7 + 6 + 3 = 16

Still 16.

It seems hard to beat the sum of 18 obtained by simply setting all rows to [3,2,1].

Wait, but in the n=2 case, the maximum sum is 7, which is more than 2*(2+1)/2 = 6.

Wait, n=2, sum=7 > 6.

But for n=3, 18 is achievable by setting all rows to [3,2,1], but maybe there's a way to get a higher sum by carefully choosing the order of operations.

Let me try:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

After operation 1:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 0 | 0 |

After operation 2:

| 3 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 0 | 0 |

| 1 | 0 | 0 |

After operation 3:

| 3 | 3 | 1 |

| 3 | 2 | 0 |

| 1 | 2 | 0 |

After operation 4:

| 3 | 3 | 3 |

| 3 | 2 | 2 |

| 1 | 2 | 1 |

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 4 = 20

Okay, now the sum is 20, which is higher than 18.

So, by performing row operations and then column operations, I can achieve a higher sum than just setting all rows or all columns.

This suggests that the interactions between row and column operations can lead to a higher total sum.

Let me see if I can generalize this pattern.

Suppose I perform type 1 operations on the first k rows, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform type 2 operations on all columns, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

In this way, the first k rows are set by row operations, and then the columns are set, potentially overwriting some elements.

But I need to find the optimal way to maximize the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform row operations for the higher-indexed rows and column operations for the higher-indexed columns.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sums for small n.

For n=1: sum=1

For n=2: sum=7

For n=3: sum=20

Is there a formula that generates these sums?

Let's see:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: 20

Looking at the differences:

1 to 7: +6

7 to 20: +13

The differences are increasing by 7 each time (+6, then +13, which is +6 +7).

If this pattern continues, for n=4, sum would be 20 + 20 = 40.

But let's check for n=4.

n=4:

Option 1: Set all rows to [4,3,2,1], sum would be 4*10 = 40

Option 2: Set rows 1 to 3 with [4,3,2,1], and columns 1 to 4 with [4,3,2,1], but need to see the interactions.

This seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a mathematical formula for the maximum sum.

Looking back at n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=20

n=1: sum=1

Is there a formula that fits these sums?

Let me consider sum = n*(n+1)/2 * something.

For n=1: 1*2/2 =1, which matches sum=1

For n=2: 2*3/2=3, but sum=7, which is 3* n + something.

Wait, 7=3*2 +1

For n=3: 3*4/2=6, but sum=20=6*3 + something.

Wait, doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps sum = sum_{i=1 to n} i*(2*i -1)

Wait, for n=1: 1*(1)=1

n=2: 1*(1) + 2*(3)=1+6=7

n=3: 1*(1)+2*(3)+3*(5)=1+6+15=22, but earlier I got sum=20 for n=3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps sum = sum_{i=1 to n} i*(i+1)

For n=1:1*2=2 (not matching)

n=2:1*2 + 2*3=2+6=8 (not matching)

No.

Alternatively, sum = sum_{i=1 to n} i^3

n=1:1

n=2:1+8=9 (not matching)

n=3:1+8+27=36 (not matching)

Not this either.

Another approach: perhaps think of the matrix as being filled by row operations and column operations, and find a way to maximize the sum by choosing which rows and columns to operate on.

Given that each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation, and operations can overwrite each other, perhaps there's a way to cover the matrix such that the maximum possible values are placed in the positions where they contribute the most to the sum.

This sounds similar to graph theory or some kind of covering problem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning the highest possible values to the matrix positions in a way that doesn't conflict with the operations' overwriting behavior.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for each row and each column, I can perform at most one operation, and that the last operation performed on a particular row or column determines its final values.

But that doesn't seem accurate because I can perform multiple operations on the same row or column, with the last operation determining the values.

Wait, but to maximize the sum, perhaps I should perform operations in a way that the highest possible values are placed in the positions that are least overwritten.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the permutations to be [n, n-1, ..., 1] for both row and column operations.

Then, if I perform type 1 operations on all rows, the matrix would have each row set to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Similarly, if I perform type 2 operations on all columns, the matrix would have each column set to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Now, if I perform both sets of operations, the final matrix would be determined by the last operations performed on each element.

Specifically, for each element a_{i,j}, if the last operation that set it was a row operation on row i, then a_{i,j} = n - j +1.

If the last operation that set it was a column operation on column j, then a_{i,j} = n - i +1.

Wait, because in the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], the first element is n, the second is n-1, and so on.

So, for row operations, a_{i,j} = n - j +1.

For column operations, a_{i,j} = n - i +1.

Therefore, the final value of a_{i,j} depends on whether the last operation on row i or column j was performed last.

If the last operation on a_{i,j} was a row operation on row i, then a_{i,j} = n - j +1.

If the last operation on a_{i,j} was a column operation on column j, then a_{i,j} = n - i +1.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, I need to choose for each a_{i,j} whether it should be set by a row operation or a column operation, preferring the higher value between n - j +1 and n - i +1.

Wait, that's an interesting insight.

So, for each position a_{i,j}, the value would be max(n - j +1, n - i +1), depending on which type of operation was performed last on that position.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, I should choose for each a_{i,j} the operation type that gives the higher value.

In other words, set a_{i,j} to n - j +1 if the last operation was a row operation on row i, or to n - i +1 if the last operation was a column operation on column j.

Therefore, to maximize a_{i,j}, I should choose the operation type that gives the higher value for that position.

So, for each a_{i,j}, choose the operation type that gives the higher value between n - j +1 and n - i +1.

Now, to achieve this, I need to schedule the operations in such a way that for each a_{i,j}, the last operation that sets it is the one that gives the higher value.

This suggests that I should perform operations in an order where operations that set higher values are performed last.

In particular, for each row i and column j, I need to decide whether to perform a row operation or a column operation last for each a_{i,j}.

This seems a bit tricky, but perhaps I can find a way to cover the matrix such that for each position, the desired operation type is performed last.

Let me consider that for each position a_{i,j}, I should perform the operation (row or column) that gives the higher value last.

So, for positions where n - j +1 > n - i +1, I should perform a row operation last.

Similarly, for positions where n - i +1 >= n - j +1, I should perform a column operation last.

Wait, let's see:

n - j +1 > n - i +1

Simplify:

- j -1 < i -1

- j < i

So, for j < i, perform row operation last.

For j >= i, perform column operation last.

Therefore, for positions where column index is less than row index (j < i), perform row operation last.

For positions where column index is greater than or equal to row index (j >= i), perform column operation last.

This seems like a way to schedule the operations.

So, to achieve this, I can perform row operations for rows where j < i, and column operations for columns where j >= i.

But actually, since operations set entire rows or columns, I need to think in terms of entire rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps I can perform row operations on the first k rows and column operations on the remaining columns, for some k.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row operations on rows from n down to some m, and column operations on columns from 1 to n.

Wait, maybe it's better to fix the order of operations.

Let me consider performing all row operations first, and then all column operations.

In this case, the columns operations would overwrite the row operations for the corresponding columns.

Alternatively, performing all column operations first and then all row operations would have the row operations overwrite the column operations for the corresponding rows.

Neither of these seems optimal, as they don't allow for the desired last operation type for each position.

Perhaps I need to interleave row and column operations in a specific order.

Let me consider performing row operations in descending order of row index, and column operations in ascending order of column index.

For example, for n=3:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 5: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Let's see what the matrix looks like after each operation.

Start:

| 0 0 0 |

| 0 0 0 |

| 0 0 0 |

Operation 1: Row 3 set to [3,2,1]

| 0 0 0 |

| 0 0 0 |

| 3 2 1 |

Operation 2: Row 2 set to [3,2,1]

| 0 0 0 |

| 3 2 1 |

| 3 2 1 |

Operation 3: Row 1 set to [3,2,1]

| 3 2 1 |

| 3 2 1 |

| 3 2 1 |

Operation 4: Column 1 set to [3,2,1]

| 3 2 1 |

| 2 2 1 |

| 1 2 1 |

Operation 5: Column 2 set to [3,2,1]

| 3 3 1 |

| 2 2 1 |

| 1 2 1 |

Operation 6: Column 3 set to [3,2,1]

| 3 3 3 |

| 2 2 2 |

| 1 2 1 |

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 9 + 6 + 4 = 19

This is better than the earlier sum of 20.

Wait, earlier I thought sum=20, but now it's 19.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in the earlier sequence, I had sum=20.

Let me verify:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]

Matrix:

After operation 1:

| 3 2 1 |

| 0 0 0 |

| 0 0 0 |

After operation 2:

| 3 2 1 |

| 3 0 0 |

| 1 0 0 |

After operation 3:

| 3 3 1 |

| 3 2 0 |

| 1 2 0 |

After operation 4:

| 3 3 3 |

| 3 2 2 |

| 1 2 1 |

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 4 = 20

Yes, sum=20.

So, this sequence gives sum=20, while the previous sequence gave sum=19.

This suggests that the order of operations affects the final sum.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, I need to find an optimal order of operations.

This is getting complicated.

Is there a formula or pattern that can help me compute the maximum sum directly?

Looking back at the sums for n=1 to n=3:

n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=20

Let me see if there's a pattern.

Looking at the sequence: 1, 7, 20, ...

Let me compute the differences:

7 -1 =6

20-7=13

Next difference would be 13 +7=20, so n=4 sum=20+20=40

But let's check for n=4.

n=4:

Option: perform type 1 operations on rows 1 to 4 with [4,3,2,1], then type 2 operations on columns 1 to 4 with [4,3,2,1]

Matrix after row operations:

|4 3 2 1|

|4 3 2 1|

|4 3 2 1|

|4 3 2 1|

After column operations:

Column 1: [4,3,2,1] -> a_{1,1}=4, a_{2,1}=3, a_{3,1}=2, a_{4,1}=1

Column 2: [4,3,2,1] -> a_{1,2}=4, a_{2,2}=3, a_{3,2}=2, a_{4,2}=1

Column 3: [4,3,2,1] -> a_{1,3}=4, a_{2,3}=3, a_{3,3}=2, a_{4,3}=1

Column 4: [4,3,2,1] -> a_{1,4}=4, a_{2,4}=3, a_{3,4}=2, a_{4,4}=1

So, the matrix becomes:

|4 4 4 4|

|3 3 3 3|

|2 2 2 2|

|1 1 1 1|

Sum: 4*4 + 3*4 + 2*4 + 1*4 = 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40

So, sum=40 for n=4.

This matches the earlier pattern.

Similarly, for n=3, sum=20; for n=2, sum=7; for n=1, sum=1.

Is there a general formula for the sum?

Looking at the sums:

n=1:1

n=2:7

n=3:20

n=4:40

Let me see:

n=1:1 =1^2 +0

n=2:7=4 +3

n=3:20=9 +11

n=4:40=16 +24

Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the sums:

1,7,20,40

Differences:6,13,20

Second differences:7,7

So, quadratic in n.

Let me assume sum = a*n^3 + b*n^2 + c*n + d

Given:

For n=1: a + b + c + d =1

n=2:8a+4b+2c+d=7

n=3:27a+9b+3c+d=20

n=4:64a+16b+4c+d=40

Let's solve this system:

Equation 1: a + b + c + d =1

Equation 2:8a+4b+2c+d=7

Equation 3:27a+9b+3c+d=20

Equation 4:64a+16b+4c+d=40

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(8a+4b+2c+d) - (a + b + c + d) =7 -1 =>7a +3b +c=6

Equation 5:7a +3b +c=6

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(27a+9b+3c+d) - (8a+4b+2c+d)=20 -7 =>19a +5b +c=13

Equation 6:19a +5b +c=13

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

(64a+16b+4c+d) - (27a+9b+3c+d)=40 -20 =>37a +7b +c=20

Equation 7:37a +7b +c=20

Now, subtract equation 5 from equation 6:

(19a +5b +c) - (7a +3b +c)=13 -6 =>12a +2b=7

Equation 8:12a +2b=7

Similarly, subtract equation 6 from equation 7:

(37a +7b +c) - (19a +5b +c)=20 -13 =>18a +2b=7

Equation 9:18a +2b=7

Now, subtract equation 8 from equation 9:

(18a +2b) - (12a +2b)=7 -7 =>6a=0 =>a=0

Wait, a=0?

But that seems unlikely for a cubic equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, if a=0, then it's not cubic, but quadratic.

Let me assume sum = a*n^2 + b*n + c

For n=1: a + b + c =1

n=2:4a +2b +c=7

n=3:9a +3b +c=20

n=4:16a +4b +c=40

Wait, but for n=1: a + b + c =1

n=2:4a +2b +c=7

n=3:9a +3b +c=20

n=4:16a +4b +c=40

Let's solve these equations.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(4a +2b +c) - (a + b + c)=7 -1 =>3a +b=6

Equation 5:3a +b=6

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(9a +3b +c) - (4a +2b +c)=20 -7 =>5a +b=13

Equation 6:5a +b=13

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

(16a +4b +c) - (9a +3b +c)=40 -20 =>7a +b=20

Equation 7:7a +b=20

Now, subtract equation 5 from equation 6:

(5a +b) - (3a +b)=13 -6 =>2a=7 =>a=3.5

Then, from equation 5:3*(3.5) +b=6 =>10.5 +b=6 =>b=6 -10.5=-4.5

From equation 1:3.5 -4.5 +c=1 =>-1 +c=1 =>c=2

So, sum = 3.5*n^2 -4.5*n +2

Let me check for n=1:3.5 -4.5 +2=1, correct

n=2:3.5*4 -4.5*2 +2=14 -9 +2=7, correct

n=3:3.5*9 -4.5*3 +2=31.5 -13.5 +2=20, correct

n=4:3.5*16 -4.5*4 +2=56 -18 +2=40, correct

So, sum = (7/2)*n^2 - (9/2)*n +2

But I need to confirm if this formula holds for higher n.

Let me try n=5:

Sum according to formula: (7/2)*25 - (9/2)*5 +2=87.5 -22.5 +2=67

Let me compute sum for n=5 manually.

Perform type 1 operations on all rows with [5,4,3,2,1], then type 2 operations on all columns with [5,4,3,2,1]

Matrix after row operations:

|5 4 3 2 1|

|5 4 3 2 1|

|5 4 3 2 1|

|5 4 3 2 1|

|5 4 3 2 1|

Then, perform type 2 operations on all columns with [5,4,3,2,1]

Which sets:

Column 1: [5,4,3,2,1]

Column 2: [5,4,3,2,1]

Column 3: [5,4,3,2,1]

Column 4: [5,4,3,2,1]

Column 5: [5,4,3,2,1]

So, the matrix becomes:

|5 5 5 5 5|

|4 4 4 4 4|

|3 3 3 3 3|

|2 2 2 2 2|
