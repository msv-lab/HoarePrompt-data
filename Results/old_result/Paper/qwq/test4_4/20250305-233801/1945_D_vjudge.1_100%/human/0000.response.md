Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, making it n+1 people in line. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe some people to move up in the queue, but he doesn't want to spend too much money. His goal is to be among the first m people in the line after all the bribing.

Okay, so for each person in the queue, there are two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to jump in front of person j (who is before him in the line), he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between positions j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of those people.

I need to figure out the minimum amount of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that is before his current position and swap places with that person, paying a_j coins to that person and b_k coins to everyone between j and his current position.

Wait, actually, the problem says: "He can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k." So, it's not just swapping positions, but moving Kirill to position j by paying a_j and b_k for each k between j and i.

I need to model this operation in a way that allows Kirill to move forward in the queue by paying these costs.

Let me think about this step by step.

Initially, Kirill is at position n (since the numbering starts from 1, position n is the last one).

He wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

He can perform operations to move from his current position i to any position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and operations are edges with associated costs.

But with n up to 200,000, a standard shortest path algorithm would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way to compute this.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to compute the minimum cost incrementally.

Let's consider that Kirill starts at position n.

He can move directly to position j < n by paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to n-1.

But he can also move to an intermediate position first.

Wait, but the problem allows him to perform this operation any number of times.

So, he can make multiple jumps, each time choosing to jump to some position j < i and paying the corresponding costs.

I need to find the sequence of jumps that minimizes the total cost to reach position <= m.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider that each operation allows him to move from position i to any position j < i, with a cost of a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

I can think of this as a graph where each position is a node, and there is a directed edge from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

But with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is impossible.

I need a better approach.

Let me try to find a way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.

Perhaps I can compute for each position i from 1 to n, the minimum cost to reach position i, and then take the minimum among the first m positions.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Let dp[i] be the minimum cost to reach position i.

We need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to n, and then take the minimum of dp[1] to dp[m].

Now, how to compute dp[i]?

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j > i, by paying a_i plus the sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's see.

If Kirill is at position j and wants to move to position i < j, he pays a_i plus sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k.

Wait, no, the problem says: "exchange places with the person at position j (j < i), paying a_j and for each k such that j < k < i, paying b_k."

So, moving from position i to j (j < i), the cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

So, in terms of dp:

dp[j] = min over all i > j { dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k }

But this seems too slow to compute for all j.

I need a better way.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple operations, each time choosing to move to a position j < i, paying a_j and the sum of b_k between j and i.

But perhaps there's a way to consider the total cost if Kirill decides to move directly to some position j, considering all the intermediate steps.

Wait, maybe I can model this as choosing a position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1, and then recursively computing the minimum cost to reach the final position from j.

But this still seems too recursive and not efficient enough.

Let me try to find a way to compute this in linear time or O(n log n).

Another idea: perhaps I can consider the cost to reach position i as the minimum between:

- The cost to reach position i directly from position n, which would be a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{n-1} b_k.

- Or, the cost to reach some position j > i and then move from j to i.

Wait, but this still seems too slow.

Maybe I can precompute the sum of b_k from position i to n, and then find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me define suffix sums for b:

Let suff[i] = sum of b_k from k = i to n-1.

Then, the sum from k = j+1 to i-1 is suff[j+1] - suff[i].

Wait, actually, suff[i] = sum_{k=i}^{n-1} b_k.

So, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = suff[j+1] - suff[i].

But I need to be careful with the indices.

Now, let's try to redefine dp[i]:

dp[i] = the minimum cost to reach position i.

To compute dp[i], we can consider moving from any position j > i to position i, paying a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k.

Wait, no, paying a_i plus sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k.

Wait, no, the problem says: "exchange places with the person at position j (j < i), paying a_j plus for each k such that j < k < i, paying b_k."

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the indices.

Let me try to rephrase.

If Kirill is at position i and wants to move to position j (j < i), he pays a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

So, in terms of dp:

dp[j] = min over all i > j { dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k }

But this is still not efficient.

Maybe I need to find a way to compute this without considering each pair (i,j).

Let me consider that sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} b_k - sum_{k=i}^{n-1} b_k = suff[j+1] - suff[i]

So, dp[j] = min over all i > j { dp[i] + a_j + suff[j+1] - suff[i] }

This can be rearranged as:

dp[j] = a_j + suff[j+1] + min over all i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }

Now, this is interesting.

Because the min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] } can be precomputed.

Let me define another array, let's say, min_diff = min over i from j+1 to n of (dp[i] - suff[i])

Then, dp[j] = a_j + suff[j+1] + min_diff[j+1]

So, if I can compute min_diff for all j, then dp[j] can be computed in O(1) time for each j.

But to compute min_diff, I need dp[i] for i > j, which depends on dp[j], so there's a dependency issue.

Wait, no, min_diff[j] is the minimum of (dp[i] - suff[i]) for i from j+1 to n.

But dp[i] for i > j depends on min_diff for those i.

This seems circular.

Maybe I need to compute dp[i] from i = n down to i = 1.

Let me try that.

Start with dp[n] = a[n] + suff[n+1] - suff[n], but suff[n+1] is 0, since suff[n] = b[n-1].

Wait, I need to define suff properly.

Let me define suff[i] = sum of b_k from k = i to n-1.

So, suff[n] = 0, because there are no k from n to n-1.

Wait, indices are from 0 to n-1, position 1 to n.

Wait, in Python, lists are 0-indexed.

So, position 1 corresponds to index 0 in the lists.

Let me clarify the indices.

Let me define:

- a[0] to a[n-1] corresponding to positions 1 to n.

- b[0] to b[n-1] corresponding to positions 1 to n.

- suff[i] = sum of b[k] for k from i to n-1.

So, suff[i] = b[i] + suff[i+1]

With suff[n] = 0.

Now, for position j < i, the cost to move from i to j is a[j] + suff[j+1] - suff[i]

Because sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = suff[j+1] - suff[i]

Therefore, dp[j] = min over i > j { dp[i] + a[j] + suff[j+1] - suff[i] }

Rearranged:

dp[j] = a[j] + suff[j+1] + min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }

So, if I can compute min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }, then I can compute dp[j].

To do this efficiently, I can compute min_diff[j] = min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }

And compute dp[j] = a[j] + suff[j+1] + min_diff[j+1]

So, I need to compute min_diff[j] for all j from 0 to n-1.

To compute min_diff[j], I need the minimum of (dp[i] - suff[i]) for i from j+1 to n-1.

But dp[i] depends on min_diff[i+1], so I need to compute dp[i] from i = n-1 down to i = 0.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Compute suff[i] for i from 0 to n-1.

   - suff[i] = b[i] + suff[i+1], with suff[n] = 0.

2. Compute min_diff[i] for i from n-1 down to 0.

   - min_diff[i] = min(dp[i] - suff[i], min_diff[i+1])

   - But dp[i] is a[i] + suff[i+1] + min_diff[i+1]

   - Wait, this seems recursive and might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate backwards.

Let me try to initialize:

- min_diff[n] = 0

- For i from n-1 down to 0:

   - min_diff[i] = min(dp[i] - suff[i], min_diff[i+1])

But dp[i] depends on min_diff[i+1], which we'll compute later.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that dp[j] = a[j] + suff[j+1] + min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }

Assuming that min_diff[j+1] = min over i > j { dp[i] - suff[i] }

Then dp[j] = a[j] + suff[j+1] + min_diff[j+1]

And min_diff[j] = min(dp[j] - suff[j], min_diff[j+1])

So, min_diff[j] = min(a[j] + suff[j+1] + min_diff[j+1] - suff[j], min_diff[j+1])

Simplify:

min_diff[j] = min(a[j] + suff[j+1] - suff[j] + min_diff[j+1], min_diff[j+1])

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to move directly to any position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

Alternatively, he can move to an intermediate position first.

But perhaps the minimal cost path is to move directly to some position j <= m.

Let me consider that Kirill moves directly to some position j <= m, and compute the cost for that.

The cost would be a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Wait, no, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k, where i is his current position.

Wait, but if he moves directly to j from n, the sum would be from k=j+1 to n-1.

Wait, suff[j+1].

So, the cost to move directly from n to j is a_j + suff[j+1].

But he might be able to do better by moving to an intermediate position first.

Wait, maybe the minimal cost is the minimum over all possible j from 1 to m of (a_j + suff[j+1]).

But perhaps there are better options by moving through some intermediate positions.

But is that the case?

Let me consider a small example.

Take the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute suff[i]:

suff[4] = 0

suff[3] = b[3] + suff[4] = 5 + 0 = 5

suff[2] = b[2] + suff[3] = 8 + 5 = 13

suff[1] = b[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 13 = 16

suff[0] = b[0] + suff[1] = 4 + 16 = 20

So, suff = [20,16,13,5,0]

Now, if Kirill moves directly to position 1:

Cost = a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 16 = 23

If he moves directly to position 2:

Cost = a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 13 = 16

But according to the example output, the minimal cost is 14, which is less than 16.

So, moving directly to position 2 is not the minimal cost.

Hence, there must be a better way, perhaps by moving through some intermediate positions.

Wait, maybe Kirill can move from position n to some position i, then from i to j, and so on, accumulating costs.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to reach position j directly from position n.

The cost is a_j + suff[j+1].

But perhaps he can reach position j by first moving to some position k > j, and then to j, and this might be cheaper.

But in this case, it seems that moving directly is better.

Wait, in the first test case, moving directly to position 2 costs 3 + 13 = 16, but the minimal cost is 14.

So, there must be a better way.

Maybe Kirill can move to position 3 first, then to position 1.

Wait, position 3 is index 2.

Cost to move from n=4 to 3: a[2] + suff[3] = 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from position 3 to position 1: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 16 = 23

Total cost: 11 + 23 = 34, which is higher than 16.

Not better.

Alternatively, move from n=4 to position 2: cost 3 + 13 = 16

Then, from position 2 to position 1: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 16 = 23

Total cost: 16 + 23 = 39, worse.

Wait, perhaps moving to position 3 first doesn't help.

Maybe moving to position 4 to position 1 directly: 7 + 16 = 23

Or position 4 to position 2: 3 + 13 = 16

But the minimal cost is 14, so there must be another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look at the example output again.

In the first test case, the output is 14.

How can Kirill spend only 14 coins?

Let me check the operations.

Starting at position 4.

Option 1: Move directly to position 1: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 16 = 23

Option 2: Move directly to position 2: a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 13 = 16

Option 3: Move to position 3 first, then to position 1.

Cost to move from 4 to 3: a[2] + suff[3] = 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from 3 to 1: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 16 = 23

Total: 11 + 23 = 34

Worse.

Option 4: Move from 4 to 2, then to 1.

Cost: 3 + 13 + 7 + 16 = 39

Worse.

Wait, maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps Kirill can move from position 4 to position 3, paying a[2] + suff[3] = 6 + 5 = 11

Then, from position 3 to position 2, paying a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 13 = 16

Total: 11 + 16 = 27

Still worse.

Or from position 4 to position 3: 6 + 5 = 11

Then from position 3 to position 1: 7 + 16 = 23

Total: 34

Still worse.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when moving from i to j, the sum is suff[j+1] - suff[i], but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple operations, each time moving to some position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

But maybe there's a way to model this as choosing a set of people to bribe, and then summing up the costs accordingly.

Wait, maybe I should consider that Kirill can choose a subset of people to move in front of, and compute the total cost based on their a_j and the sum of b_k in between.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to move directly to some position j, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to n-1 (suff[j+1]).

Alternatively, he can choose to move to some position k first, paying a_k plus sum_{k+1}^{n-1} b_k, and then from k to j, paying a_j plus sum_{j+1}^{k-1} b_k.

But sum_{j+1}^{k-1} b_k = suff[j+1] - suff[k]

So total cost would be a_k + suff[k+1] + a_j + suff[j+1] - suff[k]

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose any sequence of moves, but the total cost would be the sum of a_j for each j he moves to, plus the sum of b_k for each k between the positions he moves through.

But this seems too vague to compute efficiently.

Perhaps I need to consider that the minimal cost to reach position j is the minimum over all sequences of moves that end at j.

But dynamic programming might still be too slow.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the minimal cost to reach position j is a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to n-1, minus some savings if he moves through some positions.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The code defines a function func_1(n, k, a, b):

c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

ans = float('inf')

for i in range(k):

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])

print(ans)

So, it computes c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] = sum of c[k] from k = i to n-1.

Then, it computes ans as the minimum over i from 0 to k-1 of a[i] + suff[i+1]

Wait, in the first test case:

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

c = [min(7,4)=4, min(3,3)=3, min(6,8)=6, min(9,5)=5]

suff = [4+3+6+5=18, 3+6+5=14, 6+5=11, 5, 0]

Then, ans = min over i=0 and i=1:

a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 14 = 21

a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 11 = 14

So, ans = 14, which matches the first test case.

Similarly, second test case:

n=6, m=2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

c=[5,8,7,1,4,1]

suff=[5+8+7+1+4+1=26, 8+7+1+4+1=21, 7+1+4+1=13, 1+4+1=6, 4+1=5, 1, 0]

ans = min(a[0]+suff[1], a[1]+suff[2]) = 6+21=27, 9+13=22 => min is 22

Which matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=7, m=7

a=[7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b=[9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

c=[7,1,9,2,1,4,9]

suff=[7+1+9+2+1+4+9=33, 1+9+2+1+4+9=26, 9+2+1+4+9=25, 2+1+4+9=16, 1+4+9=14, 4+9=13, 9, 0]

ans = min over i=0 to i=6 of a[i] + suff[i+1]

a[0]+suff[1]=7+26=33

a[1]+suff[2]=2+25=27

a[2]+suff[3]=9+16=25

a[3]+suff[4]=2+14=16

a[4]+suff[5]=6+13=19

a[5]+suff[6]=5+9=14

a[6]+suff[7]=9+0=9

So, min is 9, which matches the third test case.

Fourth test case:

n=2, m=1

a=[2,3]

b=[1,1]

c=[1,1]

suff=[1+1=2, 1, 0]

ans = min over i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 2 + 1 = 3

Which matches the fourth test case.

So, the code seems to be correct, as it passes all the test cases provided.

But I need to understand why this approach works.

Let's analyze the code.

It computes c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] = sum of c[k] from k=i to n-1.

Then, ans = min over i from 0 to m-1 of a[i] + suff[i+1]

Why does this work?

Let me try to interpret this.

c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

suff[i] = sum of c[k] from k=i to n-1.

Then, a[i] + suff[i+1] = a[i] + sum_{k=i+1}^{n-1} c[k]

We take the minimum of this over i from 0 to m-1.

But why is this the minimal cost?

Wait, perhaps c[i] represents some kind of minimal cost to "skip" person i.

If c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]), it means that to skip person i, Kirill can either pay a[i] to move in front of them directly, or pay b[i] for some other reason.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that suff[i+1] represents the minimal cost to "skip" everyone from i+1 to n-1.

Then, a[i] is the cost to move in front of person i.

So, a[i] + suff[i+1] would be the cost to move in front of person i and skip everyone from i+1 to n-1.

Then, taking the minimum over i from 0 to m-1 gives the minimal total cost to reach some position <= m.

But why is c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])?

Let me think about what c[i] represents.

If c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]), it means that to skip person i, Kirill can choose the cheaper option between a[i] and b[i].

But in the operation, when moving from i to j, he pays a_j plus sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

So, perhaps c[i] represents the minimal cost to skip person i and all persons after him.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps c[i] represents the minimal cost to "remove" person i from the queue, either by paying a_i to move in front of him or paying b_i for some other operation.

But I'm still not getting it.

Let me consider that suff[i+1] is the minimal cost to cover positions from i+1 to n-1.

Then, a[i] + suff[i+1] is the cost to move to position i and cover the rest.

Taking the minimum over i from 0 to m-1 gives the minimal cost to reach some position <= m.

But I still don't see why c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]).

Maybe I need to look at it differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to move directly to position j, paying a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} b_k.

But sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} b_k is suff[j+1]

So, total cost is a_j + suff[j+1]

Then, taking the minimum over j from 0 to m-1 gives the minimal cost among all direct moves to positions <= m.

But in the first test case, this gives 14, which matches the example.

But is this always correct?

Wait, but why does c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])?

Shouldn't c[i] be b[i], since sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k is the sum of b_k between j and i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the sum of b_k differently.

Wait, maybe the minimal cost to reach position j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} min(a_k, b_k)

Which would be a_j + suff[j+1], where suff[j+1] is the sum of min(a_k, b_k) from k=j+1 to n-1.

This seems to align with the code.

So, the minimal cost to reach position j is a_j plus the sum of min(a_k, b_k) for k from j+1 to n-1.

Then, the minimal total cost is the minimum over j from 0 to m-1 of a_j + suff[j+1]

This seems plausible, but I need to verify why this works.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to either pay a_j to move in front of person j, or pay b_j to perform some operation.

But I'm still not fully grasping it.

Alternatively, perhaps min(a[i], b[i]) represents the minimal cost to skip person i.

Then, suff[i+1] is the total minimal cost to skip everyone from i+1 to n-1.

So, a[j] + suff[j+1] is the cost to move to position j and skip everyone after j.

Taking the minimum over j from 0 to m-1 gives the minimal cost to reach some position <= m.

This seems consistent with the examples.

Therefore, the approach in the code seems correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
