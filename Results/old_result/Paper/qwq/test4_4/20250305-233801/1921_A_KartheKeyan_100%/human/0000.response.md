Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're in random order. I need to find the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the input forms a valid square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligning with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that.

Given four points, I need to figure out which ones are opposite corners of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the coordinates should have some specific patterns.

Let me think about the properties of such a square. For sides parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates of opposite sides will be the same, and similarly for the y-coordinates.

Wait, no. Actually, for sides parallel to the axes, each side will be either horizontal or vertical. So, for a square, opposite sides will have the same length, and all angles are right angles.

But since it's a square, all sides are equal in length, and all angles are 90 degrees. Given that, and sides parallel to the axes, the coordinates should be such that two pairs of points share the same x-coordinate (vertical sides), and another two pairs share the same y-coordinate (horizontal sides).

But in this problem, the square's sides are parallel to the axes, so the coordinates should be straightforward.

Given that, perhaps I can sort the coordinates to make it easier to identify the positions of the points.

Let me look at the example inputs and outputs to understand better.

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Sorting these points:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

It's clear that these form a square with side length 3 (since x goes from 1 to 4, y goes from 2 to 5), so area should be 9.

Second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Sorting these:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

This forms a square with side length 2, area 4.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Sorting these:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

This forms a square with side length 28 (x from 17 to 45, y from 11 to 39), area 784.

So, in all cases, sorting the coordinates seems to help in identifying the side lengths.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The function func() is defined. It reads an integer t, which is the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers, which are the coordinates of the four corners.

It stores these coordinates in a list called coord.

Then, it sorts this list. Since it's a list of tuples, sorting will be done lexicographically, first by x, then by y.

After sorting, it calculates two distances: p1 and p2.

p1 is the squared distance between the first two points in the sorted list.

p2 is the squared distance between the last two points in the sorted list.

Then, it calculates the area as the square root of p1 multiplied by the square root of p2, and prints the rounded result.

Wait a minute, that seems incorrect.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical. So, the distance between two adjacent points should be equal, and the area should be the square of that distance.

But in this program, it's calculating the distances between the first two and the last two points, which, after sorting, are likely to be opposite sides.

Wait, in the sorted list, for the first test case:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

So, p1 is between (1,2) and (1,5): distance squared is (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

p2 is between (4,2) and (4,5): distance squared is (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Then, area is sqrt(9) * sqrt(9) = 3 * 3 = 9, which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1: between (-1,-1) and (-1,1): ( -1+1 )^2 + (1 - (-1))^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

p2: between (1,-1) and (1,1): (1-1)^2 + (1 - (-1))^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

area: sqrt(4)*sqrt(4) = 2*2 = 4, which matches.

Third test case:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1: (17,11) to (17,39): (17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

p2: (45,11) to (45,39): (45-45)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

area: sqrt(784)*sqrt(784) = 28*28 = 784, which matches.

So, in all the test cases, this approach seems to work.

But is this a general solution?

Let's think about how this works.

After sorting the coordinates lexicographically, the first two points will have the same x-coordinate, and the last two will have the same x-coordinate, assuming that the x-coordinates are unique or properly sorted.

Then, p1 and p2 are the squared distances between these points, which, in this configuration, represent the lengths of the vertical sides of the square.

Then, multiplying these two lengths should give the area, but wait, no.

Wait, in the first test case, p1 and p2 are both 9, and their square roots are both 3, and multiplying them gives 9, which is correct.

Similarly, in the second test case, p1 and p2 are both 4, square roots are 2, multiplied gives 4.

In the third test case, p1 and p2 are both 784, square roots are 28, multiplied gives 784.

Wait, but in a square, all sides are equal, so why are we multiplying the lengths of two sides?

Actually, in a square, area is side length squared. So, if side length is s, area is s^2.

In this approach, they are calculating s * s, which is correct.

But is this general?

Wait, in the way they're calculating, p1 and p2 are both equal to s^2, because they are squared distances between points that are s units apart.

Then, sqrt(p1) is s, and sqrt(p2) is s, and their product is s^2, which is the area.

So, yes, this seems correct.

But is there any case where this might fail?

Let me think about it.

Suppose the square is degenerate, but the problem says it's guaranteed to have positive area, so we don't need to handle degenerate cases.

What if the points are not in the order assumed?

Well, the sorting should take care of that, as it sorts the coordinates lexicographically.

But wait, in the sorting, if two points have the same x-coordinate, they will be sorted by y-coordinate.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, this should work.

But what if two points have the same x-coordinate, but they are not supposed to be together?

Wait, in a square with sides parallel to the axes, for each unique x-coordinate, there should be exactly two points with that x-coordinate, corresponding to the left and right sides.

Wait, no. Actually, for a square, there should be two distinct x-coordinates, each appearing exactly twice, and similarly for y-coordinates.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, there are two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.

Each x-coordinate is shared by two points (the left and right sides), and each y-coordinate is shared by two points (the top and bottom sides).

But in the sorting approach, when we sort the points lexicographically, the first two points will have the smallest x-coordinate, and if x-coordinates are the same, the smaller y-coordinate first.

Similarly, the last two points will have the largest x-coordinate.

Then, p1 is the squared distance between the first two points, which should be the vertical distance between them, and p2 is the squared distance between the last two points, which should be the vertical distance between them.

In a square, these distances should be equal, which they are.

Then, taking sqrt(p1)*sqrt(p2) = s * s = s^2, which is the area.

This seems correct.

Is there any edge case where this might fail?

Let me consider a square where the sides are very small, but since area is positive and s > 0, it should still work.

What if the square is rotated such that its sides are not parallel to the axes? But the problem says sides are parallel to the axes, so we don't need to handle that.

What if the square is aligned such that its sides are horizontal or vertical?

Well, that's the case we're dealing with.

I think this approach is correct.

An alternative approach could be to find the unique x-coordinates and unique y-coordinates, compute the difference between them, and square that difference to get the area.

But the approach taken in the code seems to work as well.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
