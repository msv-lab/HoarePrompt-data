Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2, and then each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow in the lineup, or I can choose not to do anything. I need to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with at most one swap.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses without any swaps. Let's consider the initial setup:

- Cows are in positions 1 to n.

- Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Position 3.

- And so on, until all cows have been included.

Since higher-rated cows always win, the tournament is essentially a series of comparisons where the highest-rated cow among the ones involved will be the final winner.

But my goal isn't to win the entire tournament; it's to maximize the number of wins my specific cow gets, possibly by swapping its position.

Let me think about how swapping positions can affect the number of wins my cow gets.

Option 1: Do nothing.

In this case, my cow stays in its original position and participates in the tournament as is. I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins my cow gets.

Option 2: Swap my cow with another cow in the lineup.

By swapping, I change the position of my cow, which can alter the path it takes through the tournament, potentially leading to more wins.

I need to consider both options and choose the one that maximizes my cow's wins.

Let me try to model the tournament process.

Imagine the tournament as a sequence of matches where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

For example, with n=6 and k=1, and ratings [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]:

- Match 1: Position 1 (12) vs Position 2 (10). 12 wins.

- Match 2: Winner (12) vs Position 3 (14). 14 wins.

- Match 3: Winner (14) vs Position 4 (11). 14 wins.

- Match 4: Winner (14) vs Position 5 (8). 14 wins.

- Match 5: Winner (14) vs Position 6 (3). 14 wins.

So, in this case, cow 1 (rating 12) wins only once.

But if I swap cow 1 with cow 3 (rating 14):

- New lineup: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

- Match 1: 14 vs 10. 14 wins.

- Match 2: 14 vs 12. 14 wins.

- Match 3: 14 vs 11. 14 wins.

- Match 4: 14 vs 8. 14 wins.

- Match 5: 14 vs 3. 14 wins.

Now, my original cow 1 (now in position 3 with rating 12) doesn't participate in any matches because 14 wins all matches. So, in this case, my cow gets 0 wins.

Wait, but in the problem, when I swap, I'm moving my cow to another position, but its rating remains the same. So, if I swap cow k with another cow, their ratings are swapped.

Wait, no. The problem says: "swap the position of your cow with another cow". So, I think it's just swapping the positions of the cows, not their ratings. Each cow has a fixed rating.

Wait, but in the example above, if I swap cow 1 and cow 3, then cow 1 is now in position 3 with rating 14, and cow 3 is in position 1 with rating 12.

Wait, no, if I swap positions, then the ratings move with the positions. So, if I swap position 1 and position 3, then position 1 has rating 14, position 2 has 10, position 3 has 12, and so on.

But in the note, it shows swapping cow 5 to position 3, meaning swapping the positions of cow 5 and cow 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Let me read the problem again.

"you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, I can choose to swap my cow (cow k) with another cow, meaning their positions are exchanged.

So, the ratings stay with the cows, but their positions are swapped.

Wait, in the note, for the second test case:

"In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3."

So, in that case, cow 5 is swapped with cow 3, meaning cow 5 goes to position 3 and cow 3 goes to position 5.

But in terms of ratings:

Original: [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

After swapping cow 5 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 727):

New lineup: [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

Then, the tournament proceeds as described in the note.

Wait, but in the note, it says:

"swap your cow to position 3"

So, swap cow 5 to position 3, meaning cow 5 (rating 12) is now in position 3, and whatever was in position 3 (rating 727) moves to position 5.

So, new lineup: [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

Then, the tournament proceeds:

- Match 1: 7 vs 2. 7 wins.

- Match 2: 7 vs 12. 12 wins.

- Match 3: 12 vs 10. 12 wins.

- Match 4: 12 vs 727. 727 wins.

- Match 5: 727 vs 13. 727 wins.

So, cow 5 (now in position 3 with rating 12) wins two matches.

Similarly, in the first test case, with n=6 and k=1, and ratings [12,10,14,11,8,3], it's optimal to do nothing, and cow 1 wins once.

In the third test case, with n=2 and k=2, and ratings [1000000000,1], it's optimal to do nothing, but cow 2 (rating 1) loses to cow 1 (rating 1000000000), so it wins 0 matches.

So, I need to find, for each test case, the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve, by choosing to swap it with another cow or not.

I need an efficient way to compute this, considering the constraints: t <= 10^4 test cases, n <= 10^5 per test case, sum of n over all test cases <= 10^5.

So, per test case, I need an O(n) solution, or better, since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is <=10^5.

So, overall time should be O(10^5).

Now, how to approach this?

First, let's consider what determines the number of wins for cow k.

In the tournament, matches are sequential, with the winner of the previous match playing the next cow in line.

Higher-rated cows always win.

So, for cow k to win a match, it needs to have a higher rating than its opponent.

The number of wins cow k can achieve depends on its position and the ratings of the cows it ends up playing against.

If I can determine the sequence of opponents cow k would face in the tournament, I can count how many of them have lower ratings than cow k.

But with swaps allowed, I need to consider the effect of swapping cow k with another cow to change its position and thus the sequence of opponents.

I need to find the best possible position for cow k to maximize its wins.

Wait, but I can only swap it with one other cow, not place it anywhere arbitrarily.

Wait, no, I can choose to swap it with any other cow, meaning I can place it in any position by swapping it with the cow in that position.

So, effectively, I can place my cow in any position by swapping it with the cow in that position.

But I can only perform one swap.

Wait, but swap is between my cow and another cow.

So, I can choose to swap my cow with any one other cow, changing my cow's position and the position of the other cow.

Alternatively, I can choose to do nothing.

So, I have n options: keep it in its original position, or swap it with any one of the other n-1 cows.

So, I need to consider n different scenarios: original position, or swapped with each of the other n-1 cows.

For each scenario, compute the number of wins for my cow, and choose the maximum among these n options.

But n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases <=10^5.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I need a way to compute, for each possible position that my cow can be in, the number of wins it can achieve.

Let's think about how the tournament progresses.

The tournament is a sequence of matches, starting with the first two cows, and then the winner plays the next cow, and so on.

But in this setup, it's not a standard tournament tree; it's more like a single elimination tournament where the winner continues to the next match.

But in this problem, it's specified that each match i is between the winner of match i-1 and the cow in position i+1.

So, in the initial setup, match 1 is between position 1 and 2, then match 2 is between the winner of match 1 and position 3, and so on.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the tournament will progress until the highest-rated cow is reached, and it will win all remaining matches.

But I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow, which may not be the highest-rated cow.

So, I need to place my cow in a position where it can win as many matches as possible before losing to a higher-rated cow.

I need to find the position where my cow can keep winning against the cows that it faces, maximizing the number of wins before it loses.

Let me think about the tournament process in more detail.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, my cow will participate in the tournament starting from match p-1 (since match p-1 is between the winner of match p-2 and position p).

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Actually, in this tournament structure, each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will face the current winner up to that point.

I need to trace the path my cow would take in the tournament.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to simulate the tournament and see when my cow would get a chance to play, depending on its position.

But with n up to 10^5 per test case, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the highest-rated cow will eventually win all matches until the end.

Other cows can win matches only against cows with lower ratings.

So, for my cow, to maximize its wins, I need to place it in a position where it can win against the cows before it and the cows after it, up to the point it faces a higher-rated cow.

I need to find a position where the cows before it have lower ratings than my cow, or where the highest-rated cow before it is as low as possible, so my cow can win more matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where the maximum rating among the cows before it is minimized.

So, if I can place my cow in a position where the highest-rated cow before it is as low as possible, my cow can win more matches.

Because it will win against all cows with lower ratings before it, and lose only when it faces a higher-rated cow.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, the winner continues to the next match.

So, the sequence of matches is deterministic based on the positions.

I need to model this process more accurately.

Let me consider that the tournament is a sequence of matches, where the current winner is always the winner of the previous match, and it plays against the next cow in line.

So, the matches are:

Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2.

Winner of Match 1 vs Position 3 (Match 2).

Winner of Match 2 vs Position 4 (Match 3).

And so on, until all cows have been included.

Now, for my cow to participate in a match, it needs to be either one of the initial cows or a winner of a previous match.

But if I place my cow in a certain position, I need to see how many matches it can win before losing to a higher-rated cow.

I need to find the position where my cow can win the maximum number of matches before facing a cow with a higher rating.

Let me think about the tournament in terms of the sequence of matches.

Suppose I have cows in positions 1 to n, with ratings a1, a2, ..., an.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: a1 vs a2. Winner is max(a1, a2).

- Match 2: winner of Match 1 vs a3. Winner is max(winner of Match 1, a3).

- Match 3: winner of Match 2 vs a4. And so on.

So, the winner of each match is the maximum of the two cows involved.

Eventually, the overall winner is the maximum rating among all cows.

Now, for my cow, to maximize its wins, I need to place it in a position where it can win as many matches as possible before facing a cow with a higher rating.

In other words, I need to place my cow as early as possible in the sequence, but making sure that there are no higher-rated cows before it that would defeat it immediately.

Wait, but if I place my cow early, it may face higher-rated cows earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to place it in a position where all cows before it have lower ratings, or as few higher-rated cows as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where the maximum rating among the cows before it is less than my cow's rating, and as many cows after it as possible have lower ratings.

But I need to maximize the number of wins, which means my cow should be able to win against all cows before it (if placed after them) until it faces a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the left and right of my cow's position.

If I place my cow at position p, then in the tournament, it will face the winner of the previous matches, which is the maximum of the ratings from position 1 to p-1.

If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, it wins the match; otherwise, it loses.

Then, it proceeds to the next match, and so on.

Wait, actually, in this tournament structure, the current winner is always the maximum of all the cows that have been involved so far.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

In each match, the winner is the higher-rated between the current winner and the next cow.

So, the current winner after match i is the maximum of the ratings of all cows involved up to match i.

Wait, but in the problem, it's specified that in each match, the cow with the higher rating wins and proceeds to the next match.

So, the winner of each match is the cow with the higher rating between the two cows in that match.

But the next match is between this winner and the next cow in position.

So, effectively, the winner of the tournament is the cow with the highest rating, as it will defeat all others.

But I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow, not necessarily win the entire tournament.

Let me consider that my cow can win a match as long as it has a higher rating than its opponent.

So, if my cow is placed at position p, then it will have opportunities to win matches against the cows before it, provided it can reach those matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the tournament bracket in more detail.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of how many cows with lower ratings are before my cow in position, because those are the ones it can potentially defeat.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cows with lower ratings that are before my cow in position.

But actually, in this tournament structure, the matches are sequential, and the opponent is determined by the position.

So, perhaps I need to find, for a given position p, how many cows with lower ratings are before p, and my cow can win against them.

But I need a more precise way to model this.

Let me try to simulate the tournament for a specific position of my cow.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2. Winner is the higher of a1 and a2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Position 3.

- ...

- Match p-1: Winner of Match p-2 vs Position p.

At match p-1, my cow (at position p) participates.

If my cow's rating is higher than the winner of the previous matches, it wins; otherwise, it loses.

If it wins, it proceeds to the next match, and so on.

So, to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to maximize the number of matches it wins before losing to a higher-rated cow.

To do this, I need to place my cow in a position where the maximum rating among the cows before it is as low as possible, so that my cow can win more matches.

In other words, I need to find the position p where the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1 is less than my cow's rating, and p is as small as possible.

Wait, but if I place my cow too early, there might be higher-rated cows before it, which would defeat it immediately.

So, I need to find the position p where the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1 is less than my cow's rating, and p is as large as possible.

Wait, no, I want p to be as small as possible, but also ensure that the maximum rating before p is less than my cow's rating.

Wait, I need to balance between placing my cow early (to face fewer cows) and ensuring that the cows before it don't have higher ratings that would defeat it.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position p, the number of wins my cow would achieve if placed at p.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to compute, for each possible position p, how many cows before p have lower ratings than my cow.

But in reality, it's not just about the number of cows with lower ratings before p, because the tournament is sequential, and the opponent is determined step by step.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the current winner after match i is the maximum of all cows involved up to match i.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the current winner before match p-1 is the maximum of positions 1 to p-1.

If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, it wins match p-1; otherwise, it loses.

If it wins match p-1, it becomes the new current winner and proceeds to match p, and so on.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows after position p whose ratings are lower than my cow's rating, plus one (for winning against the current winner), until it loses to a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

If I place my cow at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows from positions 1 to p-1 that have lower ratings than my cow.

But actually, it's not that simple because the tournament is sequential, and the current winner accumulates as we go.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the current winner after match i is the maximum of positions 1 to i+1.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the current winner before match p-1 is the maximum of positions 1 to p-1.

If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, it wins match p-1 and becomes the new current winner.

Then, it proceeds to match p, where it faces position p+1.

If its rating is higher than position p+1, it wins again, and so on.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for winning against the current winner, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for winning against the current winner, up to the point it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote:

- Let m be the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

- If my cow's rating is higher than m, it wins match p-1.

- Then, it becomes the current winner and faces position p+1 in match p.

- If its rating is higher than position p+1, it wins again.

- This continues until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for winning against the current winner, up to the point it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but the current winner before match p-1 is m, so if my cow's rating is higher than m, it wins match p-1.

Then, it proceeds to match p, where it faces position p+1.

If its rating is higher than position p+1, it wins again.

This continues until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for winning against the current winner.

In other words, it's equal to the number of cows from position p+1 to n that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one, but stopping when it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but it's not necessarily all cows from p+1 to n, because it might lose to a higher-rated cow before reaching the end.

So, it's equal to the number of consecutive cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for winning against the current winner.

Wait, no, it's not necessarily consecutive; it's just all cows after p that have lower ratings than my cow, but the tournament is sequential, so it would stop as soon as it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than my cow, up to the first cow that has a higher rating.

In other words, it's equal to the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, until the first cow with a higher rating is encountered.

This seems similar to counting the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, until a cow with a higher rating is found.

Wait, this sounds like counting the number of cows after p with lower ratings, up to the first higher-rated cow.

So, for each possible position p, I need to compute this count.

But doing this naively for each p would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider precomputing for each position p, the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, until the first cow with a higher rating.

To compute this efficiently, I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the number of lower-rated cows until a higher-rated cow is encountered.

But I need to do this specifically for my cow's rating.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from position p+1 to n, and count the number of cows with lower ratings than my cow until I encounter the first cow with a higher rating.

This can be done efficiently using some preprocessing.

Wait, perhaps I can preprocess the next higher-rated cow for each position.

That is, for each position i, find the position of the next cow with a higher rating than my cow.

Then, the number of wins for position p is equal to the number of cows between p+1 and the position of the next higher-rated cow minus one.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

Let my cow have rating x.

For each position p, let's find the first position q > p such that a_q > x.

Then, the number of wins for position p is q - p - 1 + 1 = q - p, because my cow wins against all cows from p+1 to q-1, and loses at q.

But wait, plus one for winning against the current winner.

Wait, no.

Actually, when placing my cow at position p, it first has to win against the current winner up to p-1, which is m, the maximum of positions 1 to p-1.

If x > m, then it wins that match and becomes the current winner.

Then, it proceeds to win against all cows from p+1 to q-1, where q is the first position > p where a_q > x.

So, the total number of wins is 1 (for winning against m) plus the number of cows from p+1 to q-1.

Thus, total wins = 1 + (q - p - 1) = q - p.

But, if x <= m, then my cow loses immediately and gets 0 wins.

So, for each position p, if x > m, then wins = q - p; else, wins = 0.

Therefore, to compute this efficiently, I need to:

1. Precompute m for each p, where m is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1).

2. Precompute q for each p, where q is the first position > p with a_q > x.

Then, for each p, if x > m, then wins = q - p; else, wins = 0.

Finally, I need to take the maximum over all possible p, including p = k (original position).

But I need to consider that swapping my cow with another cow would change the positions of the ratings.

So, if I swap my cow with another cow, their ratings are exchanged in the positions.

Wait, but in terms of computing m and q, I need to consider the new lineup after the swap.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, I need to compute m, which is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), but with my cow's rating at position p.

Wait, no, if I place my cow at position p, then the maximum of a1 to a(p-1) is the maximum of the original ratings except for my cow's rating, which is now at position p.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that swapping my cow with another cow changes the ratings at those two positions.

So, if I swap my cow from position k to position p, then position k now has the rating that was originally at position p, and position p has my cow's rating.

Then, for each possible p, I need to compute m and q based on this new lineup.

This seems too slow for n up to 10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that m is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), and q is the first position > p with a_q > x.

I need to compute m and q for each p, considering the new lineup after swapping.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute m and q without considering the swap, and then adjust for the swap.

Let me try to precompute m and q for the original lineup.

First, precompute m for each p:

m[p] = max(a1 to a(p-1))

This can be done in O(n) time.

Then, precompute q for each p:

q[p] = the smallest q > p such that a_q > x, or n+1 if no such q exists.

This can be done using a stack in O(n) time.

Then, for each possible p, if x > m[p], then wins = q[p] - p; else, wins = 0.

Then, the maximum over all p is the answer.

But wait, this is for placing my cow at position p without swapping.

But I can choose to swap my cow with another cow, which changes the ratings at positions k and p.

So, I need to consider both options: placing my cow at p (by swapping it with the cow at p), or keeping it at k.

So, I need to compute the maximum over all p (including k) of wins[p].

But in order to compute m[p] and q[p], I need to consider the new lineup after swapping.

So, for each p, if I swap my cow to position p, then:

- The rating at position p becomes x.

- The rating at position k becomes a[p] (the original rating at p).

Then, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), but with a[p] possibly changed if p < k.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider two cases:

1. Do not swap: p = k.

2. Swap my cow with another cow: p != k.

In the do-not-swap case, p = k, and m[k] is the maximum of a1 to a(k-1).

q[k] is the first position > k with a_q > x.

If x > m[k], then wins = q[k] - k; else, wins = 0.

In the swap case, p != k:

- Swap positions k and p.

- New rating at position p: x.

- New rating at position k: a[p].

Then, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), with a[p] being the original a[p] (but now at position k).

Wait, no: after swapping, the rating at position p is x, and at position k is a[p].

So, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), which remains unchanged unless p < k.

Wait, if p < k, then in the new lineup, position p has x, and position k has a[p].

So, m[p] = max(a1 to a(p-1)), which is unchanged from the original m[p], because p < k.

Similarly, m[k] = max(a1 to a(k-1)), but with a[p] at position k.

Wait, no, m[k] is the maximum of a1 to a(k-1), which now includes a[p] if p < k.

This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider that swapping my cow with another cow changes the positions of the ratings, which affects the m and q computations.

This seems too time-consuming to compute for each possible p.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the original problem again.

I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow, which is equal to the number of cows it can defeat before facing a stronger cow.

By swapping, I can change its position to potentially have more easier opponents before facing stronger ones.

But perhaps there's a way to compute this without considering each possible swap individually.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of wins is achieved by placing my cow in a position where it can defeat all cows before it with lower ratings and as many cows after it as possible before facing a stronger cow.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in the original lineup, without swapping, my cow is at position k.

I can compute the number of wins it gets in this setup.

Then, consider swapping it with another cow, say at position p, and compute the number of wins in this new lineup.

I need to do this for all possible p and choose the maximum.

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this in O(n) time.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow at position p is equal to the number of cows before p with lower ratings than my cow, plus the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, it's not simply counting the number of lower-rated cows before and after.

It's about the sequence of matches and who the current winner is.

I need to stick to the tournament structure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where my cow is placed.

Then, the number of wins my cow achieves is equal to the number of cows from p+1 to q-1 that have lower ratings than my cow, where q is the smallest position > p such that a_q > x.

Plus, one win for beating the current winner up to p-1, if x > m.

So, total wins = 1 (for beating m) + (q - p - 1), provided x > m.

Else, wins = 0.

So, wins = q - p, if x > m; else, 0.

To maximize this over all p, including p = k (no swap), and p != k (swap with position p).

Now, to compute this efficiently, I need to precompute m[p] and q[p] for all p.

m[p] = max(a1 to a(p-1))

q[p] = smallest q > p such that a_q > x, or n+1 if no such q exists.

Then, for each p, if x > m[p], then wins[p] = q[p] - p; else, wins[p] = 0.

Finally, the answer is the maximum of wins[p] over all p.

Now, I need to compute m[p] and q[p] efficiently.

Computing m[p] is straightforward: m[p] = max(m[p-1], a[p-1])

Computing q[p] can be done using a stack to find the next greater element for each p.

This can be done in O(n) time.

So, overall, for each test case, I can precompute m[p] and q[p], and then find the maximum wins[p] over all p.

But wait, in the swap scenario, swapping my cow with position p means that the rating at position p becomes x, and the rating at position k becomes a[p].

So, m[p] and q[p] need to be adjusted based on this swap.

This complicates things.

Perhaps I can consider that for each possible p, swapping my cow to p changes the lineup, and I need to recompute m[p] and q[p] for this new lineup.

But this seems too slow for n up to 10^5.

I need a smarter way to handle the swap.

Wait, perhaps I can compute m[p] and q[p] for the original lineup, and then adjust for the swap.

Let me consider that.

First, compute m[p] and q[p] for the original lineup.

Then, for the swap scenario, when I swap my cow to position p, I need to update m[p] and q[p] accordingly.

But how?

If I swap my cow to position p, then:

- The rating at position p becomes x.

- The rating at position k becomes a[p].

Then, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), but with a[p] possibly changed if p < k.

Similarly, q[p] is the first position > p with a_q > x, but with the new ratings.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that swapping my cow to position p only affects m[p] and q[p] in specific ways.

Wait, perhaps I can compute m[p] and q[p] for the original lineup, and then adjust for the swap.

Let me consider that.

First, compute m[p] and q[p] for the original lineup.

Then, for each possible p, if I swap my cow to p, I need to:

- Set a[p] = x.

- Set a[k] = original a[p].

Then, m[p] needs to be recomputed if p < k, because a[p] has changed.

Similarly, q[p] needs to be recomputed based on the new a[p].

This seems too time-consuming.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins is achieved when my cow is placed in a position where it can defeat as many cows as possible before facing a stronger one.

This is similar to finding the length of the increasing subsequence ending with my cow's rating.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings before and after my cow's position.

But again, it's tricky due to the sequential nature of the tournament.

Let me try to think about the do-nothing case first.

In the do-nothing case, p = k.

Then, m[k] = max(a1 to a(k-1))

If x > m[k], then my cow wins against m[k], and proceeds to win against all cows from position k+1 to the first cow with a rating higher than x.

So, wins = number of cows from k+1 with rating < x, until the first cow with rating > x, plus one for beating m[k].

Which is q[k] - k.

Else, if x <= m[k], wins = 0.

Similarly, in the swap case, if I swap my cow to position p, then:

- m[p] = max(a1 to a(p-1)), but with a[p] being the original a[p] if p < k, or the original a[k] if p > k.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider that swapping my cow to position p affects the m[p] and q[p] computations.

I need a better way to handle this.

Let me consider that for the swap case, I can compute m[p] and q[p] as if my cow is at position p, and the original a[p] is now at position k.

Then, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), with a[p] being x.

But actually, when I swap my cow to position p, the rating at position p becomes x, and the rating at position k becomes a[p].

So, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), which is unchanged from the original m[p], unless p < k.

If p < k, then in the new lineup, a[p] is x, and a[k] is original a[p].

So, m[k] = max(a1 to a(k-1)), which now includes x if p < k.

Similarly, q[p] is the first position > p with a_q > x, in the new lineup.

This seems too involved to compute for each p.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow at position p is equal to the number of cows from p+1 to n with rating < x, until the first cow with rating > x, plus one for beating m[p], provided x > m[p].

So, wins[p] = q[p] - p, if x > m[p]; else, 0.

Then, the maximum over all p is the answer.

Now, to compute m[p] and q[p] efficiently, I can precompute m[p] as the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), and q[p] as the next greater element than x after p.

But in the swap scenario, m[p] and q[p] need to be adjusted based on the new lineup.

This seems too time-consuming.

Perhaps I need to consider that the best position p for my cow is where m[p] is less than x, and q[p] is as large as possible.

So, I need to choose p such that x > m[p], and q[p] is maximized.

Thus, wins[p] = q[p] - p is maximized.

So, I need to find p where x > m[p], and q[p] - p is maximized.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute m[p] and q[p] for all p, and then find the p with the maximum q[p] - p where x > m[p].

This can be done in O(n) time per test case.

But considering t test cases with sum n over all test cases <=10^5, this should be acceptable.

Now, to implement this:

- For each test case, read n, k, and the array a.

- Let x = a[k-1], since positions are 1-based.

- Compute m[p] for all p: m[1] = 0, m[p] = max(m[p-1], a[p-1]) for p >=2.

- Compute q[p] for all p: q[p] is the smallest q > p such that a_q > x, or n+1 if no such q exists.

- For each p from 1 to n:

- If x > m[p], then wins[p] = q[p] - p

- Else, wins[p] = 0

- The answer is the maximum of wins[p] over all p.

But, in the swap scenario, I need to consider that swapping my cow to position p changes the lineup.

Wait, but in the above approach, I'm considering placing my cow at position p, which involves swapping it with the cow at position p.

So, I need to make sure that m[p] and q[p] are computed for the new lineup after the swap.

But in the above approach, m[p] and q[p] are computed for the original lineup, which may not be accurate after the swap.

So, perhaps I need to adjust m[p] and q[p] based on the swap.

This seems too involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, in the new lineup:

- a[p] = x

- a[k] = original a[p]

Then, m[p] is the maximum of a1 to a(p-1), which is the same as original m[p], unless p < k, in which case a[p] is now x, which might affect m[k].

Wait, no.

If p < k, then in the new lineup, a[p] = x, and a[k] = original a[p].

So, m[k] = max(a1 to a(k-1)), which now includes x if p < k.

Similarly, m[p] = max(a1 to a(p-1)), which is unchanged unless p < k and x affects it.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider two cases separately:

1. Do nothing: p = k.

Compute wins[k] based on the original lineup.

2. Swap my cow with another cow: p != k.

Compute wins[p] based on the new lineup after swapping.

Then, take the maximum over all p.

But computing this for each p is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that
