Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, I need to buy k tickets for my employees over n days, where each day the price per ticket is given by a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then for all subsequent days, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying exactly k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Take the first test case from the example:

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

So, n=4 days, m=2 tickets per day, k=3 tickets to buy.

The prices are 8,6,4,2.

I need to buy 3 tickets, with no more than 2 per day, and the prices increase by the number of tickets bought each day for subsequent days.

An optimal way, according to the note, is:

- Buy 0 on day 1. New prices from day 2: [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2. New prices from day 3: [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3. Cost: 4. New price for day 4: [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4. Cost: 6.

Total cost: 10.

Wait, but why not buy 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2?

Let's try:

- Buy 2 on day 1. Cost: 16. New prices from day 2: [8,6,4] +2 = [10,8,6]

- Buy 1 on day 2. Cost: 10.

Total cost: 26, which is worse than the optimal 10.

Another try:

- Buy 1 on day 4. Cost: 2. New prices for day 4 only, but since it's the last day, no effect.

- Buy 1 on day 3. Cost: 4. New prices for day 4: [3]

- Buy 1 on day 4. Cost: 3.

Total cost: 9, which is better than the provided optimal. Maybe there's a mistake in the note.

Wait, but in the note, they bought 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4 for a total of 10. I found a way to spend 9. Maybe the note is not the absolute optimal, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the note is just an example, not necessarily the best.

Let me think differently.

I need to minimize the total cost, considering that buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the impact on future days.

However, given the constraints (n up to 3e5, m and k up to 1e9), a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that increasing the price for future days is equivalent to adding x to all future prices, where x is the number of tickets bought today.

So, buying x tickets on day i increases the price for days i+1 to n by x.

I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum over all days of (number of tickets bought on that day * price on that day).

But since buying tickets on earlier days increases the price for later days, there is a trade-off.

I need to balance buying tickets on cheaper days versus the increased cost for future days.

Perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, with a certain number of tickets per day, subject to the constraints.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the overall cost formula.

Letâ€™s denote b_i as the number of tickets bought on day i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of b_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of b_j)

Because each b_j bought on previous days increases the price for day i by b_j.

This can be rewritten as:

sum over i from 1 to n of b_i * a_i + b_i * sum over j from 1 to i-1 of b_j

I need to minimize this sum, subject to sum of b_i equals k, and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems complicated due to the interdependency between b_i's.

Maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me think about the total cost differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of b_i * a_i plus sum over i from 1 to n of b_i * sum over j from 1 to i-1 of b_j.

The second term is sum over all pairs (i,j) with j < i of b_i * b_j.

So, total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i,j with j < i of b_i * b_j.

This seems tricky to minimize directly.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider sorting the days in some order to minimize the cost.

Since buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices for later days, maybe I should buy tickets on the cheapest days first, but considering the impact on future days.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on day 4 seems better, but according to the note, buying on later days is part of the optimal strategy.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the days in increasing order of a_i and buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, but considering the impact on future days.

Wait, but in the first test case, a = [8,6,4,2], so sorted is [2,4,6,8].

If I buy on the cheapest days first, considering the increased prices.

Wait, perhaps sorting the days in increasing order of a_i is the way to go.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can decide how many tickets to buy on each sorted day, considering that buying on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

Wait, but the days are ordered in some sequence, and I need to respect that sequence.

Wait, no, because the price increase applies to all future days, regardless of their original order.

But if I sort the days, I need to make sure that the days are processed in a way that respects the sequence.

This seems confusing.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

Which can be written as sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), where s_i is the sum of b_j for j <= i.

So, total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Let s_i = s_{i-1} + b_i

Then, total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

So, total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * (s_i - b_i)

Which is sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i * b_i

But s_i = sum over j <= i of b_j = k, since all b_j for j <= i are included in s_i.

Wait, no, s_i is the sum up to day i.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the dual problem or find a better approach.

Let me consider the impact of buying x tickets on day i.

The cost for day i is x * a_i, and for all subsequent days, the price increases by x.

So, the total additional cost for future days is x * sum over j > i of b_j.

Wait, no.

Actually, for each ticket bought on day i, the price for all future days increases by 1.

Wait, no, for each ticket bought on day i, the price for all future days increases by that ticket.

Wait, according to the problem, if you buy x tickets on day i, then for all j > i, a_j increases by x.

So, the total additional cost for future days is x * sum over j > i of b_j.

Therefore, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * x * sum over j > i of b_j.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each day i, the price per ticket on that day is a_i plus the sum of b_j for all j < i.

Because each b_j for j < i increases the price by 1 for all future days, including day i.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the prices per ticket for the remaining days will have their prices increased by x".

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

Therefore, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

Because for day i, the price is a_i plus the sum of b_j for all j < i.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, total cost = sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), where s_{i-1} is the sum of b_j for j < i.

Given that s_{i-1} is the cumulative sum up to day i-1.

I need to minimize this total cost, given that sum of b_i = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

Given the large constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think about the sorted order.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the smallest a_i, but considering the impact on future days.

Wait, but buying on a day with smaller a_i increases the prices for future days, which might be detrimental if there are many future days with even smaller a_i.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the first test case, a = [8,6,4,2], sorted is [2,4,6,8].

If I buy on the smallest a_i first, which is day 4 (a=2), then the prices for future days don't matter since it's the last day.

Then, I can buy some tickets on day 3 (a=4), and so on.

Wait, perhaps processing the days in sorted order can work.

Wait, perhaps I should process the days in increasing order of a_i.

Let me sort the days in increasing order of a_i, and then assign b_i in that order.

Wait, but I need to consider the cumulative sum s_{i-1} for each day.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the contribution of each b_i.

Let me think about the cost for each ticket.

Each ticket bought on day i incurs a cost of a_i plus the sum of b_j for all j < i.

Wait, no, for day i, it's a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

So, the cost for b_i tickets on day i is b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), where s_{i-1} = sum of b_j for j < i.

I need to minimize sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), subject to sum of b_i = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a linear objective function with linear constraints.

Maybe linear programming could solve it, but it's too slow for n=3e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each day i, the cost per ticket is a_i + s_{i-1}, and I can buy up to m tickets.

I need to assign b_i to minimize sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), with sum of b_i = k and b_i <= m.

Wait, but s_{i-1} depends on the previous b_j's, so it's not independent.

This seems recursive.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming where I keep track of the cumulative sum s_i and minimize the total cost.

Let me try to model this as a DP.

Define dp[i][s] as the minimum cost to buy tickets on the first i days with cumulative sum s.

But with n=3e5, and s up to k, which is up to 1e9, this is infeasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * s_{i-1}.

Given that s_i = s_{i-1} + b_i, and s_0 = 0.

So, total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * s_{i-1}.

I can write this as sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * (s_i - b_i) = sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost as sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j).

This seems similar to sum over all pairs (i,j) with j <= i of b_i * b_j - sum over i of b_i^2, plus sum over i of b_i * a_i.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1}.

Given that s_{i-1} is the sum of b_j for j < i.

I need to minimize this total cost.

Let me consider that for each day i, I can choose b_i between 0 and m, and s_{i-1} is determined by previous choices.

This seems like a dependent choice problem.

Maybe I can use a greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the days in some order and assign b_i accordingly.

Wait, perhaps sorting the days based on a_i - s_{i-1} or something similar.

But s_{i-1} depends on previous choices, so it's not straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of days q on which I buy tickets, and on each of these q days, I buy m tickets, except possibly on the last day where I buy the remaining tickets.

Wait, since m can be up to 1e9 and k up to 1e9, but n is up to 3e5, perhaps I can select a subset of days to buy m tickets each, except possibly one day where I buy fewer.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me consider that I buy m tickets on q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) tickets on the q-th day.

And I choose the q cheapest days, sorted by a_i.

Wait, but with the price increases, it's not just about choosing the q cheapest days, because buying on one day affects the prices on future days.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I need to select q days, sort them in some order, and buy m tickets on q-1 days and the remaining on the q-th day.

But I need to consider the cumulative impact on prices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix q, the number of days on which I buy tickets, and then choose the q days with the smallest a_i, and buy m tickets on q-1 days and k - m*(q-1) on the q-th day.

Then, calculate the total cost considering the price increases.

Let me try this approach.

First, sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, for each possible q (from 1 to min(n, ceil(k/m))), select the first q days, buy m tickets on the first q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) on the q-th day.

Then, calculate the total cost, considering that each day's price is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

Wait, but in this sorted order, the sum of b_j for j < i is the total tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate the sum of b_j for j < i.

Let me try with the first test case.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2], sorted is [2,4,6,8]

Let's try q=1:

Buy 3 tickets on day 1. Cost: 3 * (2 + 0) = 6.

Wait, but in the original sequence, day 4 has a=2, so buying on day 4 would be cheaper, but in the sorted order, it's day 1.

But in the original sequence, day 4 is the last day, so no price increase from future days.

Wait, perhaps this sorted order doesn't directly correspond to the original days, which have a sequence.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to consider the days in sorted order but adjust the prices based on the cumulative b_j.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think about the impact of buying on a day.

Each time I buy x tickets on a day, it increases the price for all future days by x.

So, to minimize the total cost, I should try to buy tickets on days with lower a_i, but also consider that buying on a day with lower a_i increases the prices for future days.

Wait, perhaps buying on days with higher a_i is better, so that the increased prices for future days are higher, but then the cost on that day is higher.

This seems counterintuitive.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that buying on a day with higher a_i increases the prices for future days by a higher amount, which might not be desirable.

Wait, no, the increase is by the number of tickets bought, not by a_i.

Wait, no, according to the problem, buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket for all subsequent days by x.

So, the increase is by x, not by a_i.

Wait, but a_i is the base price for day i.

So, the price on day j for j > i is a_j + sum over all i < j of b_i.

Wait, no, more precisely, buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket for all subsequent days by x.

So, for each day j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

Therefore, buying x tickets on day i increases the price for all j > i by x.

Hence, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

Because for day i, the price is a_i plus the sum of b_j for all j < i.

Yes, that's correct.

So, total cost = sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}), where s_{i-1} is the sum of b_j for j < i.

I need to minimize this total cost.

Let me consider that s_{i-1} is the cumulative sum up to day i-1.

So, for day i, the cost is b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

I need to choose b_i for each day, with sum of b_i = k and b_i <= m, to minimize the total cost.

This seems like a problem that can be solved using a priority queue or some sorted structure.

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can assign b_i to these days, starting from the smallest a_i.

Wait, but buying on a day with smaller a_i increases the prices for future days, which might negate the benefit of the small a_i.

Wait, perhaps it's better to buy on days with larger a_i, to minimize the impact on future days.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that the incremental cost of buying an additional ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of days remaining, including day i.

Wait, perhaps something similar to the number of days remaining.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that buying a ticket on day i costs a_i plus the number of days after i multiplied by the number of tickets bought on day i.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Let me consider the dual problem.

Suppose I fix the number of days q on which I buy tickets, and on each of these q days, I buy a certain number of tickets.

Then, the total cost would be sum over these q days of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

This seems complex.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting q days, and assigning b_i to these q days, with b_i <= m, and sum of b_i = k.

Then, the total cost is sum over these q days of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

This still seems tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal total cost can be achieved by selecting the q days with the smallest a_i + s_{i-1}.

But s_{i-1} depends on the previous choices.

This seems like a dependency issue.

Perhaps I need to use a priority queue to always choose the day with the smallest current price.

But how do I update the prices for the remaining days each time I buy tickets on a day.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that for each day, I can buy up to m tickets, and the price per ticket is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

So, for each day i, the price per ticket is a_i plus the total tickets bought on previous days.

I need to minimize the sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

This seems similar to assigning weights to days based on their a_i and the cumulative sum.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days based on a_i + s_{i-1}, but s_{i-1} depends on previous choices.

This seems circular.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can consider buying tickets on these days in that order.

For each day, the cost per ticket is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

Since I'm sorting by a_i, the sum s_{i-1} is the total tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the sorted days and assign b_i accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the minimal cost is achieved by buying as many tickets as possible on the days with the smallest a_i, considering the price increases.

Wait, but buying on a day with a small a_i increases the prices for future days, which might offset the benefit.

Wait, maybe it's better to buy on days with larger a_i to minimize the impact on future days.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either.

This is confusing.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * sum over j < i of b_j.

Which is sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1}.

This can be rewritten as sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * (s_i - b_i) = sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2.

But s_i = sum over j <= i of b_j = s_{i-1} + b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to minimize this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the total cost is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over j < i of b_i * b_j.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the total cost can be expressed as sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i,j with j < i of b_i * b_j.

Which is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * s_{i-1}.

Yes, that's consistent with what I had earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum over i of b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1}.

I can think of this as sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * sum over j < i of b_j.

Which is sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i,j with j < i of b_i * b_j.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that s_{i-1} is the sum of b_j for j < i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

I can think of this as sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * s_{i-1}.

Given that s_{i-1} is the sum of b_j for j < i, this seems like a sum over all pairs (i,j) with j < i of b_i * b_j.

Yes, exactly.

So, total cost = sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i,j with j < i of b_i * b_j.

This is equivalent to sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * sum over j < i of b_j.

I need to minimize this total cost.

This seems like a quadratic assignment problem, which is generally NP-hard, but maybe there's a smarter way to approach this given the specific structure.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n log n) solution or something similar.

Let me consider that the minimal total cost can be achieved by selecting q days, buying m tickets on q-1 days, and the remaining tickets on the q-th day.

Then, I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and choose the q smallest a_i.

Then, for each such selection, calculate the total cost considering the price increases.

Let me try this with the first test case.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2], sorted is [2,4,6,8]

Let me try q=1:

Buy 3 tickets on day 1. Cost: 3 * (2 + 0) = 6.

q=2:

Buy 2 tickets on day 1. Cost: 2 * (2 + 0) = 4.

Then, buy 1 ticket on day 2. Cost: 1 * (4 + 2) = 6.

Total cost: 10.

q=3:

Buy 2 tickets on day 1. Cost: 2 * (2 + 0) = 4.

Buy 1 ticket on day 2. Cost: 1 * (4 + 2) = 6.

Total cost: 10.

Wait, but in q=1, it's 6, which is better.

Wait, but according to the note, they did q=3 with total cost 10.

Wait, perhaps q=1 is better.

But in the second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a = [8,6,4,2], sorted is [2,4,6,8]

q=1:

Buy 8 tickets on day 1. Cost: 8 * (2 + 0) = 16.

But m=2, so can't buy more than 2 per day.

Wait, m=2, k=8, so need q=4 days, buying 2 tickets each day.

Total cost: 2*(2+0) + 2*(4+2) + 2*(6+4) + 2*(8+6) = 2*2 + 2*6 + 2*10 + 2*14 = 4 + 12 + 20 + 28 = 64.

Which matches the second test case's output.

In
