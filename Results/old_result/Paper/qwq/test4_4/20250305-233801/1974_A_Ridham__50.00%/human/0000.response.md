Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take 1x1 cells, meaning one cell each, and others take 2x2 cells, which means they occupy four cells in a square.

I need to find out the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons given the numbers of each type of application.

Let's look at the input and output specifications.

Input:

- The first line has an integer t, which is the number of test cases.

- Each of the next t lines has two integers x and y, where x is the number of 1x1 icons and y is the number of 2x2 icons.

Output:

- For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line, which is the minimum number of screens needed.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

- 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99

Okay, so I need to process up to 10,000 test cases, each with values of x and y between 0 and 99.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

So, for each pair (x, y), there's a corresponding number of screens required.

I need to understand how to calculate the minimum number of screens needed for any given x and y.

First, I need to understand how the screens can be utilized.

Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, so 15 cells in total.

2x2 icons take up 4 cells each, but they must be placed in a way that forms a square.

1x1 icons take up one cell each.

I need to maximize the usage of each screen to minimize the number of screens required.

Let me think about how to place the 2x2 icons on the screen.

Given the screen is 5x3, I need to see how many 2x2 squares can fit into this grid.

Let's visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, cells are A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, and so on up to C5.

A 2x2 icon can be placed starting at A1, covering A1, B1, A2, B2.

Similarly, starting at A2: A2, B2, A3, B3.

Starting at A3: A3, B3, A4, B4.

Starting at A4: A4, B4, A5, B5.

Starting at B1: B1, C1, B2, C2.

Starting at B2: B2, C2, B3, C3.

Starting at B3: B3, C3, B4, C4.

Starting at B4: B4, C4, B5, C5.

So, possible starting positions for 2x2 icons are:

- A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4.

That's 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons on a single screen.

But, placing one 2x2 icon at A1 would occupy A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, placing another at A3 would occupy A3, B3, A4, B4.

And so on.

Also, placing a 2x2 icon at B1 would occupy B1, C1, B2, C2.

So, there might be overlaps or blockages depending on where I place them.

Wait, but since each 2x2 icon occupies a specific square, I need to make sure that their placements don't overlap.

In a 5x3 grid, how many 2x2 icons can fit without overlapping?

Let me try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible on a single screen.

If I place one at A1, covering A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, I can place another at A3, covering A3, B3, A4, B4.

And possibly another at A4, but that would overlap with the one at A3.

Wait, no, A4 is already covered by the one at A3.

Alternatively, placing one at B1, covering B1, C1, B2, C2.

Then, placing one at B3, covering B3, C3, B4, C4.

And one at B5, but B5 is only partially in the grid since row 5 only has cells B5 and C5.

Wait, row 5 has cells A5, B5, C5.

So, a 2x2 icon starting at B4 would cover B4, C4, B5, C5.

So, that's possible.

Therefore, on a single screen, I can place up to 3 non-overlapping 2x2 icons:

- One at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2

- One at A3: A3, B3, A4, B4

- One at B4: B4, C4, B5, C5

So, total of 3 2x2 icons per screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so 3 icons take 12 cells.

The screen has 15 cells, so remaining cells are 15 - 12 = 3 cells.

These 3 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, in this arrangement, per screen:

- Up to 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons.

But, maybe there are other arrangements that can fit more 1x1 icons.

Let me consider another arrangement.

Suppose I place only 2 2x2 icons per screen.

For example:

- Place one at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2

- Place one at A3: A3, B3, A4, B4

Then, remaining cells are A5, B5, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5.

That's 7 cells.

So, I could place 7 1x1 icons in addition to the 2 2x2 icons.

Alternatively, placing one 2x2 icon at B1: B1, C1, B2, C2

And another at B3: B3, C3, B4, C4

Then, remaining cells are A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B5, C5.

That's also 7 cells.

So, in this arrangement, per screen:

- 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

This seems better than the previous arrangement in terms of number of 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, not placing any 2x2 icons and placing only 1x1 icons.

Then, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

Or, placing one 2x2 icon and seeing how many 1x1 icons can be placed around it.

Let's try placing one 2x2 icon at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2

Then, remaining cells are A3, B3, A4, B4, A5, B5, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5.

That's 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, placing one 2x2 icon at B1: B1, C1, B2, C2

Then, remaining cells are A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B3, B4, B5, C3, C4, C5.

Again, 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, with one 2x2 icon, 11 1x1 icons can be placed.

Comparing to previous arrangements:

- Arrangement with 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons.

- Arrangement with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

- Arrangement with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

- Arrangement with 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

I need to choose the arrangement that allows me to fit all the icons using the fewest screens.

So, I need a strategy to minimize the number of screens.

Given that 2x2 icons take up more space, it might be beneficial to prioritize placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, but the above arrangements show that placing fewer 2x2 icons allows for more 1x1 icons.

I need to balance this to minimize the total number of screens.

Let me think differently.

Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons, but other arrangements allow for more 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Or 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

Or 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

I need to maximize the usage of each screen.

Perhaps I should calculate the total space required and divide by the screen capacity.

But, since there are different icon sizes, it's not straightforward.

Let me calculate the total space required.

Each 1x1 icon requires 1 cell.

Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.

So, total cells required = x * 1 + y * 4.

But each screen has 15 cells.

So, a naive approach would be to divide the total cells required by 15 and round up.

But this doesn't account for the fact that 2x2 icons must be placed in squares, not just any 4 cells.

So, I need a better approach.

Looking back at the possible arrangements:

- Arrangement A: 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons per screen (total 15 cells)

- Arrangement B: 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons per screen (total 15 cells)

- Arrangement C: 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons per screen (total 15 cells)

- Arrangement D: 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons per screen (total 15 cells)

I need to choose the arrangement that allows me to fit the given x and y with the fewest screens.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen while also accommodating the 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

Wait, but from the arrangements above, arrangement A allows 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons, which uses all 15 cells.

Arrangement B allows 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons, using all 15 cells.

Arrangement C allows 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, using all 15 cells.

Arrangement D allows 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons, using all 15 cells.

So, in all these arrangements, each screen is fully utilized.

I need to choose the arrangement that allows me to fit y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons using the fewest screens.

I need to prioritize arrangements that can accommodate more 2x2 icons if y is large, but also consider the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Let me think about that.

Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons, as in arrangement A.

So, the number of screens required just for the 2x2 icons would be ceil(y / 3).

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons would be x, and each screen can hold up to 3 1x1 icons if it has already 3 2x2 icons, or up to 7 if it has 2 2x2 icons, or up to 11 if it has 1 2x2 icon, or up to 15 if it has no 2x2 icons.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should consider the total cell capacity per screen, which is 15 cells, and ensure that the combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons doesn't exceed that.

But again, I need to respect the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.

Wait, but in reality, since the screen is a grid, I need to make sure that the 2x2 icons are placed in positions that don't overlap.

But manually arranging them for each test case isn't feasible, especially since there are up to 10,000 test cases.

I need a formula or a algorithm that can compute the minimum number of screens without having to simulate the grid for each screen.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons.

Since each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons, the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 3).

2. Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed.

3. For each screen used for 2x2 icons, determine how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells.

From arrangement A, with 3 2x2 icons, 3 1x1 icons can be placed.

From arrangement B, with 2 2x2 icons, 7 1x1 icons can be placed.

From arrangement C, with 1 2x2 icon, 11 1x1 icons can be placed.

From arrangement D, with 0 2x2 icons, 15 1x1 icons can be placed.

So, for each screen, based on the number of 2x2 icons placed on it, there is a corresponding capacity for 1x1 icons.

To minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 1x1 icons placed on the screens that are already used for 2x2 icons.

In other words, for each screen used for 2x2 icons, I should place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining cells.

So, if I have s screens for the 2x2 icons, then the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens is s * capacity, where capacity depends on the number of 2x2 icons per screen.

But since the capacity varies depending on how many 2x2 icons are placed on each screen, I need to find the optimal distribution.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total cell capacity.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, total cells required = 4*y + 1*x.

Then, the minimum number of screens needed is ceil((4*y + x) / 15).

But wait, this doesn't account for the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.

From earlier, we saw that per screen, even though there are 15 cells, not all combinations are possible due to the grid structure.

But in the example provided, for input (1,1), the output is 1, which matches ceil((4*1 + 1*1)/15) = ceil(5/15) = 1.

Similarly, for (7,2), it's ceil(4*2 + 7)/15 = ceil(15/15) = 1.

Wait, but in the note, it shows arrangement with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, which totals 15 cells, matching one screen.

But for (12,4), output is 2.

Total cells required: 4*4 + 12 = 28.

28 cells would require ceil(28/15) = 2 screens.

Similarly, for (0,3), ceil(12/15) = 1, but in the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, for (0,3), ceil(12/15) = 1, but the sample output is 2.

Hmm, that suggests that just dividing the total cells by 15 and rounding up isn't sufficient.

There must be another constraint.

Looking back, perhaps it's because of the way 2x2 icons are placed.

Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons, as per the earlier arrangement.

So, for y=3, ceil(3/3)=1 screen.

But in the sample, for y=3 and x=0, it's outputting 2 screens.

Wait, perhaps because in reality, even though 3 2x2 icons fit into one screen, there might be a requirement for additional screens due to the specific grid arrangement.

But earlier, I thought that 3 2x2 icons can fit into one screen, leaving space for 3 1x1 icons.

But in this case, x=0, so no 1x1 icons.

But the sample output is 2 screens.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Let me look back.

Earlier, I thought that per screen, up to 3 2x2 icons can be placed, with room for 3 1x1 icons.

But according to the sample, for y=3 and x=0, it requires 2 screens.

That suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Maybe only 2 2x2 icons can be placed per screen, with room for 7 1x1 icons.

But in that case, for y=3, ceil(3/2)=2 screens, which matches the sample output of 2 for (0,3).

Similarly, for y=9, it would be ceil(9/2)=5 screens, which matches the last test case (0,9) with output 5.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that per screen, 3 2x2 icons can be placed.

But according to the sample, for y=3, it requires 2 screens.

So, perhaps only 2 2x2 icons can be placed per screen.

Let me try to see.

If each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons, then for y=3, I would need ceil(3/2)=2 screens.

Each screen would have 2 2x2 icons and potentially 7 1x1 icons, but since x=0, I only need to place the 2x2 icons.

So, for y=3, I need 2 screens, each with 2 2x2 icons, and one screen would have only 2 2x2 icons, without needing to fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

This seems consistent with the sample output.

Similarly, for y=9, ceil(9/2)=5 screens.

For y=2 and x=7, total cells required are 8 + 7 =15, which fits into one screen with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Similarly, for y=2 and x=8, total cells are 8 + 8 =16, which would require ceil(16/15)=2 screens.

But in the sample, for (8,1), which is 4 + 8 =12 cells, output is 1 screen.

Wait, with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, totaling 15 cells, which fits into one screen.

Wait, but 4 + 8 =12, which is less than 15, but perhaps the arrangement requires more screens.

Wait, no, (8,1) is 8 1x1 and 1 2x2, totaling 8 + 4 =12 cells.

But according to the sample, output is 1 screen.

In arrangement C, 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons fit into one screen, so 12 cells are fine.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, (0,3) requires 2 screens, which is 12 cells, but (8,1) also requires only 1 screen with 12 cells.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, no, (0,3) is 0 1x1 and 3 2x2, which require ceil(3/2)=2 screens.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

So, for (0,3), I need 2 screens, each with 2 2x2 icons, and one screen would have only 2 2x2 icons.

For (8,1), I need 1 screen with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, but only 8 1x1 icons are needed, so it fits into one screen.

Hence, the difference is in how the 2x2 icons are placed.

So, perhaps the key is to calculate the number of screens required based on the number of 2x2 icons, and then see if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into those screens or require additional screens.

In other words:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: s = ceil(y / 2)

- Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: x - (s * capacity)

Where capacity is the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on a screen that already has 2 2x2 icons, which is 7, as per arrangement B.

If x - (s * 7) > 0, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The number of additional screens would be ceil((x - s * 7)/15)

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s * 7)/15)

But need to handle cases where x - s * 7 is negative.

Wait, let's test this with the sample input.

Take (1,1):

y=1, s=ceil(1/2)=1

x=1

remaining x = 1 - 1*7 = -6, which is negative, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens = 1 + 0 =1, which matches the sample.

Another test case: (7,2)

y=2, s=1

x=7

remaining x =7 -1*7=0, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens =1 +0=1, matches sample.

Another test case: (12,4)

y=4, s=ceil(4/2)=2

x=12

remaining x=12 -2*7= -2, which is negative, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens =2 +0=2, matches sample.

Another test case: (0,3)

y=3, s=ceil(3/2)=2

x=0

remaining x=0 -2*7=-14, which is negative, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens =2 +0=2, matches sample.

Another test case: (1,0)

y=0, s=0

x=1

remaining x=1 - 0*7=1

additional screens = ceil(1/15)=1

Total screens =0 +1=1, matches sample.

Another test case: (8,1)

y=1, s=1

x=8

remaining x=8 -1*7=1

additional screens=ceil(1/15)=1

Total screens=1 +1=2, but in the sample, it's outputting 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 1 screen with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, but x=8, which is less than 11, so it should fit into one screen.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the capacity of 1x1 icons per screen depends on the number of 2x2 icons placed on that screen.

In arrangement A: 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons

Arrangement B: 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons

Arrangement C: 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons

Arrangement D: 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons

So, for s screens, if I place 2 2x2 icons per screen, then each screen can have up to 7 1x1 icons.

But in the case of (8,1), y=1, s=1 (since ceil(1/2)=1)

Then, the screen has 1 2x2 icon and can have up to 11 1x1 icons.

Since x=8 < 11, it fits into one screen.

Hence, my earlier formula is incorrect because it assumes that each screen with 2x2 icons can only have 7 1x1 icons, which is not the case.

I need to adjust the formula.

Perhaps a better approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons, given that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

- Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed, considering the capacity of each screen used for 2x2 icons.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total cell capacity used by the 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells across all screens.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me calculate the number of screens required based on the total cells needed.

Total cells required = 4*y + x

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, the minimum number of screens required is ceil((4*y + x)/15)

But earlier, I saw that for (0,3), ceil(12/15)=1, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, ceil(12/15)=1, but sample output is 2.

Hence, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't consider the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.

Similarly, for (8,1), ceil(12/15)=1, which matches the sample output of 1.

But for (0,3), ceil(12/15)=1, but sample output is 2.

Hence, this approach is invalid.

So, I need another way.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Or, 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

Or, 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- Option 1: 2 2x2 and 7 1x1

- Option 2: 1 2x2 and 11 1x1

- Option 3: 0 2x2 and 15 1x1

I need to maximize the usage of each screen to fit as many icons as possible.

So, I should prioritize placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, but also consider the remaining capacity for 1x1 icons.

This seems like a knapsack problem, where each screen is a knapsack with specific capacities for different item types.

But since t can be up to 10,000, I need an efficient solution, not something exponential.

Perhaps I can model this as follows:

- Calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

- Then, see if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the screens with the remaining capacity, or if additional screens are needed.

So, number of screens for 2x2 icons: s = ceil(y / 2)

Then, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens: s * 7

If x <= s * 7, then total screens needed is s.

Else, additional screens needed: ceil((x - s * 7)/15)

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s * 7)/15)

But earlier, this didn't match the sample for (8,1).

Wait, for (8,1):

y=1, s=1

x=8

remaining x=8 -1*7=1

additional screens=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=1+1=2, but sample output is 1.

Wait, but according to the sample, it's 1 screen.

So, perhaps my assumption that each screen can hold up to 7 1x1 icons along with 2 2x2 icons is incorrect.

Wait, but in arrangement C, with 1 2x2 icon, I can have up to 11 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps I should adjust the formula based on the actual arrangement used.

Let me consider that for s screens, I can place up to 2 s 2x2 icons and 7 s 1x1 icons.

But in reality, per screen, with 1 2x2 icon, I can have up to 11 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of screens that have only 1 2x2 icon and as many 1x1 icons as possible.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me iterate through possible number of screens and see if the icons can fit.

But with t up to 10^4, this approach would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Or, alternatively, up to 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

Or, up to 15 1x1 icons.

I need to maximize the usage of each screen.

Perhaps I can model this as follows:

- Assign as many screens as possible to hold 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

- Then, assign screens to hold 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

- Finally, assign screens to hold only 1x1 icons.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let s2 be the number of screens that hold 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Let s1 be the number of screens that hold 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

Let s0 be the number of screens that hold only 1x1 icons.

Then, the total number of screens is s2 + s1 + s0.

We need to minimize s2 + s1 + s0, subject to:

2*s2 + 1*s1 >= y (for the 2x2 icons)

7*s2 + 11*s1 + 15*s0 >= x (for the 1x1 icons)

And s2, s1, s0 are integers greater than or equal to 0.

This is an integer linear programming problem, which is too slow for t=10^4.

I need a better approach.

Let me try to prioritize placing 2 2x2 icons per screen as much as possible.

So, calculate s2 = floor(y / 2)

Then, remaining y' = y - 2*s2

Now, y' can be 0 or 1.

If y' ==1, then need one more screen with 1 2x2 icon and as many 1x1 icons as possible.

Then, calculate the total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens.

For s2 screens: 7*s2 1x1 icons

For s1 screens: 11*s1 1x1 icons

For s0 screens: 15*s0 1x1 icons

Total 1x1 icons placed: 7*s2 + 11*s1 + 15*s0

We need this to be at least x.

So, after assigning s2 screens with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons, and s1 screens with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, and s0 screens with 15 1x1 icons, we need to satisfy the inequalities.

This seems too involved for an efficient solution.

Let me look for a better way.

I found that in the sample input, for (0,3), the output is 2.

According to the sample explanation, it's not possible to place 3 2x2 icons on one screen due to grid constraints.

Hence, I need to accept that per screen, only 2 2x2 icons can be placed.

Therefore, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens required is ceil(y / 2).

Then, for the 1x1 icons, I need to see how many screens are needed beyond those used for 2x2 icons.

But wait, in the arrangement where s screens are used for 2x2 icons, each such screen can also hold some 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens is s * capacity.

Then, if x <= s * capacity, then total screens needed is s.

Else, additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - s * capacity)/15)

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s * capacity)/15)

But earlier, I tried this with capacity=7, but it didn't match the sample.

Wait, perhaps capacity should be variable based on the number of 2x2 icons per screen.

But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that per screen used for 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 7 1x1 icons if it has 2 2x2 icons, or up to 11 if it has 1 2x2 icon.

Hence, I need to maximize the number of screens with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Let me try this approach.

Calculate s2 = floor(y / 2)

Then, remaining y' = y - 2*s2

If y' ==1, then s1 =1

Else s1=0

Then, total screens for 2x2 icons is s2 + s1

Total capacity for 1x1 icons on these screens is s2 * 7 + s1 * 11

Then, remaining x' = x - (s2 * 7 + s1 * 11)

If x' >0, then additional screens needed is ceil(x' /15)

Total screens = s2 + s1 + ceil(x' /15)

Let me test this with the sample input.

Test case (1,1):

y=1, s2=0, y'=1, s1=1

capacity for 1x1: 0*7 +1*11=11

x=1, x'=1-11=-10, which is negative, so x'=0

additional screens=ceil(0/15)=0

total screens=0+1+0=1, matches sample.

Test case (7,2):

y=2, s2=1, y'=0, s1=0

capacity for 1x1:1*7 +0*11=7

x=7, x'=7-7=0

additional screens=ceil(0/15)=0

total screens=1+0+0=1, matches sample.

Test case (12,4):

y=4, s2=2, y'=0, s1=0

capacity for 1x1:2*7 +0*11=14

x=12, x'=12-14=-2, which is negative, so x'=0

additional screens=0

total screens=2+0+0=2, matches sample.

Test case (0,3):

y=3, s2=1, y'=1, s1=1

capacity for 1x1:1*7 +1*11=18

x=0, x'=0-18=-18, which is negative, so x'=0

additional screens=0

total screens=1+1+0=2, matches sample.

Test case (8,1):

y=1, s2=0, y'=1, s1=1

capacity for 1x1:0*7 +1*11=11

x=8, x'=8-11=-3, which is negative, so x'=0

additional screens=0

total screens=0+1+0=1, matches sample.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should be 2 screens, but according to the sample, it's 1 screen.

Wait, no, the sample output for (8,1) is 1.

So, according to this formula, it's 1 screen, which matches the sample.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought it should be 2 screens, but that was based on an incorrect formula.

Hence, this seems correct.

Another test case: (0,9)

y=9, s2=4, y'=1, s1=1

capacity for 1x1:4*7 +1*11=28+11=39

x=0, x'=0-39=-39, which is negative, so x'=0

additional screens=0
