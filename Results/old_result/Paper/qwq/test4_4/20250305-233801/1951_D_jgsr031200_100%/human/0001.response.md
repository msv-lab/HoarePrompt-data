Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel, and Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

First, I need to understand how Alice buys the jewels. She goes to each stall one by one and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins. So, if a stall has a price p, and she has c coins, she'll buy floor(c/p) jewels and then move on to the next stall.

Bob's goal is to set up the stalls and their prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels in total. He can set up at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a price between 1 and 10^18 coins per jewel.

I need to determine, for given n and k, whether it's possible for Bob to achieve this, and if so, provide a setup of stalls and their prices.

Let's think about some simple cases.

Case 1: k = n

If k equals n, that means Alice should buy exactly n jewels. Since each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy n jewels from a single stall with price 1. So, in this case, Bob can set up one stall with price 1, and Alice will buy n jewels.

Case 2: k > n

Wait, no. If k > n, and each jewel costs at least 1 coin, Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins. So, in this case, it's impossible. Wait, but the problem says 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, so I need to make sure that k ≤ n.

Wait, but in the sample input, there's a case where n=6 and k=4, and the answer is "NO". So, even if k ≤ n, it might not be possible.

Case 3: n = 7, k = 3

In the first sample input, with n=7 and k=3, the answer is "YES", and they provide a setup with 10 stalls, each with prices from 2 to 11. Let's see why this works.

Alice has 7 coins.

- At stall 1 with p=2, she buys floor(7/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Since she has only 1 coin left, she can't buy anything from the remaining stalls.

- Total jewels bought: 3.

So, it works.

But in the second sample input, n=6 and k=4, and it's "NO". Let's see why.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, Alice will buy floor(6/p1) from the first stall, then floor((6 - floor(6/p1)*p1)/p2) from the second, and so on.

Is there a way to set up stalls such that she buys exactly 4 jewels?

Let's try.

- If s=1, with p1=1, she buys floor(6/1)=6 jewels. Too many.

- With p1=2, she buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, total jewels:3.

- With p1=3, she buys 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, total jewels:2.

- With p1=4, she buys 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then p2=1, she buys floor(2/1)=2 jewels. Total jewels:3.

- Or p2=2, she buys 1 jewel. Total jewels:2.

- Or p2=3, she can't buy anything with 2 coins.

- So, maximum jewels:3.

- If s=2, can't get to 4.

- With s=3, similar issues.

- It seems impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with n=6.

Hence, "NO".

Third sample input: n=255, k=8.

They provide s=8 with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Let's see:

- Start with 255 coins.

- Stall 1, p=128: buy floor(255/128)=1 jewel, spend 128 coins, left with 127.

- Stall 2, p=64: buy floor(127/64)=1, spend 64, left with 63.

- Stall 3, p=32: buy 1, spend 32, left with 31.

- Stall 4, p=16: buy 1, spend 16, left with 15.

- Stall 5, p=8: buy 1, spend 8, left with 7.

- Stall 6, p=4: buy 1, spend 4, left with 3.

- Stall 7, p=2: buy 1, spend 2, left with 1.

- Stall 8, p=1: buy 1, spend 1, left with 0.

- Total jewels:8.

Perfect.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Set up stalls with decreasing prices, perhaps in a way that each price is less than or equal to the remaining coins after buying from the previous stall.

- Ensure that the total jewels bought equal k.

But how to generalize this?

Let's think about the minimal number of stalls required.

In the third sample, they used 8 stalls, which is acceptable since s ≤ 60.

But in the first sample, they used 10 stalls for n=7 and k=3.

Wait, but actually, in the first sample, s=10 is provided, but maybe fewer stalls could have been used.

Wait, in the first sample, with n=7 and k=3, perhaps s=2 would have sufficed.

For example:

- Stall 1: p=2 → buy 3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 1.

- Stall 2: p=1 → buy 1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:4.

But k=3, so this is too many.

Alternatively:

- Stall 1: p=3 → buy 2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 1.

- Stall 2: p=1 → buy 1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

This works.

So, with s=2, it's possible.

But in the provided solution, they used s=10 with p=2 to p=11, which also results in k=3.

But why use 10 stalls when 2 suffices?

Probably to illustrate that multiple solutions exist, and any valid setup is acceptable.

So, the problem allows up to 60 stalls, and any setup within that limit that achieves exactly k jewels is acceptable.

Now, I need to implement a function that, given n and k, decides whether it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

If it's possible, output "YES", followed by the number of stalls s, and then the list of prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

If not possible, output "NO".

I need to make sure that s ≤ 60 and 1 ≤ pi ≤ 10^18.

Constraints are t ≤ 1000 test cases, and n and k up to 10^18.

Time constraints should be fine since t=1000 and per test case operations should be O(1) or low polynomial.

Now, to find a general approach.

First, if k > n, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=7 and k=3, which is fine.

In the second sample, n=6 and k=4, which is impossible because with n=6, maximum jewels Alice can buy is floor(6/1)=6, but in this case, with the setup, it's "NO", meaning that it's impossible to get exactly k=4 jewels.

Wait, but with n=6 and k=4, is it possible?

Let's see:

- If s=1, p1=1, buys 6 jewels. Too many.

- s=2, p1=2, p2=1:

- Buy floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=3, p2=1:

- Buy floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=1, p2=2:

- Buy floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:6.

- p1=4, p2=1:

- Buy floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

- Buy floor(2/1)=2 jewels, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=5, p2=1:

- Buy floor(6/5)=1 jewel, spend 5 coins, left with 1.

- Buy floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=2, p2=3:

- Buy floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=3, p2=2:

- Buy floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=4, p2=2:

- Buy floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

- Buy floor(2/2)=1 jewel, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=3, p2=3:

- Buy floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=2, p2=4:

- Buy floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=1, p2=1:

- Buy floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:6.

Seems like with s=2, it's impossible to get exactly k=4.

With s=3:

- p1=2, p2=2, p3=1:

- Buy floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=3, p2=1, p3=1:

- Buy floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=2, p2=3, p3=1:

- Buy floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=1, p2=2, p3=3:

- Buy floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:6.

- p1=4, p2=1, p3=1:

- Buy floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

- Buy floor(2/1)=2 jewels, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

Still not 4.

Seems like no matter how I set up the stalls, I can't get exactly k=4 with n=6.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer.

So, the problem is to determine, for given n and k, whether there exists a setup of at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

I need to find a general method to decide this.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels from the first stall, spends floor(n/p1)*p1 coins, then moves to the second stall with remaining coins n - floor(n/p1)*p1, and so on.

I need the sum of floor(n/pi) over all i from 1 to s to be equal to k.

Moreover, s ≤ 60.

This seems tricky.

Is there a way to minimize s?

In the third sample, they used s=8 for n=255 and k=8, which seems efficient.

In the first sample, s=10 for n=7 and k=3, but as I saw earlier, s=2 suffices.

So, perhaps s=2 is sufficient in many cases.

Let me consider s=2.

Set p1 and p2.

Total jewels bought: floor(n/p1) + floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2).

I need this to be equal to k.

Is there a way to choose p1 and p2 such that this expression equals k?

Let me denote q1 = floor(n/p1), q2 = floor((n - q1*p1)/p2), and I need q1 + q2 = k.

This seems a bit complicated to solve directly.

Maybe I can think differently.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

Suppose I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2.

Like in the third sample, they used 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which are powers of 2.

With these prices, Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall until her coins are less than the price.

In the third sample, with n=255 and k=8, using the prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, she buys 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This seems similar to binary representation.

Each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of n.

But in this case, since all prices are powers of 2, and n is 255, which is 11111111 in binary, she buys 1 jewel from each stall.

This works for k=8.

But what if k is not equal to the number of bits in n?

For example, n=7 (binary 111), k=3.

Using prices 4,2,1, she would buy 1+1+1=3 jewels.

So, s=3.

But in the first sample, n=7 and k=3, they used s=10, but s=3 suffices.

Wait, earlier I thought s=2 suffices with p1=3 and p2=1.

So, s=2 is sufficient.

But s=3 with p1=4, p2=2, p3=1 also works.

So, multiple setups are possible.

Hence, using powers of 2 seems a general approach.

In the third sample, they used exactly 8 stalls for n=255 and k=8.

Similarly, for n=7 and k=3, using p1=4, p2=2, p3=1 works.

But in that case, s=3, which is less than 60.

So, perhaps using binary representation is a general solution.

But in the second sample, n=6 and k=4, using p1=4, p2=2, p3=1:

- Buy floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

- Buy floor(2/2)=1 jewel, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

Which is less than k=4.

So, it's not possible.

Hence, using powers of 2 doesn't always work.

Wait, but in this case, k=4 is greater than the maximum possible jewels Alice can buy, which seems to be 3 with n=6.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible to get k=4 with n=6.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer.

So, perhaps using powers of 2 is a general approach, but sometimes it's impossible due to constraints.

I need a general method to decide whether it's possible and provide a setup if it is.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k > n, output "NO", since it's impossible.

- If k == n, set s=1 with p1=1. Alice buys n jewels.

- If k < n, try to set up s stalls with appropriate prices.

But how to set up the prices?

One idea is to set p1 such that floor(n/p1) is as large as possible without exceeding k.

For example, set p1 such that floor(n/p1) = m, where m is chosen appropriately.

But this seems vague.

Another idea is to use a greedy approach:

- Set p1 as large as possible such that floor(n/p1) is minimized but still positive.

- Then, set p2 based on the remaining coins, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Let q1 = floor(n/p1), q2 = floor((n - q1*p1)/p2), ..., qs = floor((remaining after s-1 stalls)/ps).

Total jewels bought: q1 + q2 + ... + qs = k.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum is k.

This seems like a Diophantine equation, but with floor functions, which makes it more complicated.

Perhaps I can consider the minimal possible s.

What's the minimal s required to achieve k jewels?

In the third sample, s=8 is used, but maybe fewer stalls could have been used.

Wait, in the third sample, n=255 and k=8.

Using s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 makes Alice buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

But perhaps with s=3, using p1=128, p2=64, p3=63, but not sure.

Wait, with p1=128, q1=1, spend 128, left with 127.

p2=64, q2=1, spend 64, left with 63.

p3=63, q3=1, spend 63, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

Which is less than k=8.

So, s=3 is not sufficient in this case.

Hence, using higher prices reduces the number of jewels bought per stall.

Whereas using lower prices increases the number of jewels bought per stall.

Hence, to maximize the number of jewels bought, use lower prices.

But in this problem, we need to get exactly k jewels, not necessarily maximize or minimize.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the residual coins after each stall.

After stall i, Alice has c_i coins left.

c_0 = n

c_i = c_{i-1} - q_i * p_i, where q_i = floor(c_{i-1}/p_i)

And q_i is the number of jewels bought from stall i.

Total jewels: sum q_i from i=1 to s equals k.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum is k.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- Start with p1 as high as possible, so that q1 is minimized.

- Then, set p2 based on the remaining coins after p1, and so on.

But I need to ensure that the sum of q_i equals k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal possible k for a given n and s.

Minimal k is s, achieved when p1=p2=...=ps=1, so q1=q2=...=qs=1.

Wait, no. If p1=p2=...=ps=1, then q1 = floor(n/1) = n, and q2 = floor((n - n*1)/1) = floor(0/1)=0, and so on.

Hence, total jewels: n + 0 + 0 + ... = n.

Not s.

Wait, my earlier assumption was wrong.

Actually, with p1=p2=...=ps=1, q1 = floor(n/1) = n, and then for subsequent stalls, q2 = floor((n - n*1)/1) = floor(0/1)=0, so total jewels: n.

Hence, minimal k is 1, by setting p1=1, and s=1.

Wait, but in that case, k=n.

Wait, no, if s=1 and p1=1, then q1=n, total jewels=n.

If s=1 and p1=n, then q1=1, total jewels=1.

So, with s=1, minimal k=1, maximal k=n.

With s=2:

- Set p1 high to minimize q1, and p2 low to maximize q2.

- For example, set p1=n, then q1=1, spend n coins, left with 0.

- Then, p2=1, but can't buy anything more.

- Total jewels:1.

- Or set p1=n-1, q1=1, spend n-1 coins, left with 1.

- p2=1, q2=1, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- Or set p1=n-2, q1=1, spend n-2 coins, left with 2.

- p2=2, q2=1, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- Or set p1=n-3, q1=1, spend n-3 coins, left with 3.

- p2=2, q2=1, spend 2 coins, left with 1.

- p3=1, q3=1, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- So, with s=2, minimal k=2, maximal k=n.

Wait, but in the first sample, with s=2, p1=3 and p2=1, k=3.

But with s=2, p1=2 and p2=1, k=4, which is more than n=7.

Wait, no, in the first sample, n=7 and k=3.

Wait, with s=2, p1=3 and p2=1, k=2+1=3.

Wait, no: floor(7/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 1.

Then floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

Yes.

Similarly, with p1=2 and p2=1: floor(7/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 1.

Then floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

Total jewels:4.

But in this case, k=4 > n=7 is not possible, but n=7, k=4 is possible with s=2.

Wait, but n=7, k=4, which is possible with s=2.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=7 and k=3, and they used s=10, but with s=2, it's possible to get k=3 or k=4.

But in the second sample, n=6 and k=4, and it's "NO".

Wait, with s=2, p1=2 and p2=1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

p1=3 and p2=1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:2.

p1=4 and p2=1: floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

floor(2/1)=2 jewels, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

p1=5 and p2=1: floor(6/5)=1 jewel, spend 5 coins, left with 1.

floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

Total jewels:2.

p1=2 and p2=3: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

p1=1 and p2=1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:6.

Seems like with s=2, for n=6, possible k values are 2,3, or 6.

But not k=4.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, with s=2, possible k values are limited.

What if s=3?

For n=6:

- p1=3, p2=2, p3=1:

- floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=4, p2=2, p3=1:

- floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 2.

- floor(2/2)=1 jewel, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=3, p2=1, p3=1:

- floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

- p1=2, p2=2, p3=1:

- floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

- p1=1, p2=1, p3=1:

- floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:6.

Still, no k=4.

Hence, impossible.

So, perhaps with s=3, possible k values are 2,3, or 6.

But not 4.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Now, I need a general approach to determine whether k is achievable with s ≤ 60.

I need to find a way to construct such a setup or determine it's impossible.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k > n, output "NO".

- If k == n, set s=1 with p1=1.

- If k < n, try to set up s stalls with appropriate prices.

But how to set up the prices?

An idea is to set p1 such that floor(n/p1) = m, where m is chosen appropriately.

Let me denote m = floor(n/p1).

Then, remaining coins: n - m*p1.

Then, repeat for p2, p3, etc.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I can think recursively.

Define a function that, given remaining coins c and remaining jewels to buy r, and number of stalls left, tries to find a price p such that floor(c/p) = q, where q ≤ r, and then recurse with c - q*p and r - q.

But this seems too time-consuming, especially since n and k can be up to 10^18.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal k for a given s.

With s stalls, minimal k is s (by setting p1=p2=...=ps=1, but as I saw earlier, this doesn't hold).

Wait, earlier I thought that setting p1=p2=...=ps=1 would make q1=n and q2=...=qs=0, but actually, it's not.

Wait, let's recast.

If p1=p2=...=ps=1, then q1=n, and q2=0, ..., qs=0.

Hence, total jewels: n.

Wait, but if s=1, p1=1, q1=n.

If s=2, p1=1, p2=1: q1=n, q2=0, total jewels:n.

If s=2, p1=2, p2=1: q1=floor(n/2), q2=floor((n - q1*2)/1).

Wait, with n=7, p1=2, p2=1:

q1=3, spend 6, left with 1.

q2=1, spend 1, left with 0.

Total jewels:4.

Similarly, with n=6, p1=2, p2=1:

q1=3, spend 6, left with 0.

q2=0.

Total jewels:3.

Hence, with s=2, p1=2, p2=1, k=4 for n=7, and k=3 for n=6.

So, for s=2, depending on n, k can be different.

But I need a general method.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Set p1 = ceil(n / k).

Wait, what?

Let me think.

If Bob wants Alice to buy exactly k jewels, he can set p1 such that she buys as few jewels as possible from the first stall, and then the remaining from other stalls.

Wait, but this is not clear.

Let me try with n=7 and k=3.

Set p1 = ceil(7/3)=3.

Then, q1 = floor(7/3)=2, spend 6 coins, left with 1.

Then, set p2=1, q2=1, spend 1 coin, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

Perfect.

Similarly, for n=255 and k=8, set p1=ceil(255/8)=32, but in the sample, they used p1=128, which is higher.

But with p1=32:

q1=floor(255/32)=7, spend 224 coins, left with 31.

Then, set p2=ceil(31/1)=31, q2=1, spend 31 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:8.

So, s=2 suffices.

But in the sample, they used s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which also works.

Hence, s=2 suffices in this case.

Another approach: set p1 such that q1 is as small as possible, then proceed recursively.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the total is exactly k.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Let's consider the total jewels bought: q1 + q2 + ... + qs = k.

Where q1 = floor(n / p1), q2 = floor((n - q1*p1) / p2), and so on.

This seems similar to a process where each stall takes as many jewels as possible given the remaining coins.

I need to find p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum is exactly k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Set p1 = ceil(n / k), which is the minimal price that makes q1 = floor(n / p1) as small as possible.

- Then, set p2 = ceil((n - q1*p1) / (k - q1)), and so on recursively.

This seems similar to a greedy algorithm.

Let me try with n=7 and k=3.

Set p1 = ceil(7/3)=3.

q1 = floor(7/3)=2, spend 6, left with 1.

Set p2 = ceil(1/1)=1.

q2 = floor(1/1)=1, spend 1, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

Perfect.

Another example: n=255, k=8.

Set p1 = ceil(255/8)=32.

q1 = floor(255/32)=7, spend 224, left with 31.

Set p2 = ceil(31/1)=31.

q2 = floor(31/31)=1, spend 31, left with 0.

Total jewels:8.

Works with s=2.

But in the sample, they used s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Which also works, but s=2 suffices.

Hence, perhaps setting p1=ceil(n/k), then p2=ceil((n - q1*p1)/(k - q1)), and so on, until k is reached.

This seems like a general approach.

Let me try with n=6 and k=4.

Set p1=ceil(6/4)=2.

q1=floor(6/2)=3, spend 6, left with 0.

Set p2=ceil(0/1)=0.

But p2 can't be 0.

Hence, invalid.

Hence, it's impossible to achieve k=4 with n=6.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, this seems like a viable approach.

Algorithm:

- While k > 0 and s > 0:

- Set p = ceil(c / k), where c is current coins.

- q = floor(c / p)

- If q > k, set q = k.

- Add p to the list of prices.

- c = c - q * p

- k = k - q

- s = s - 1

- If k == 0, output "YES" and the list of prices.

- Else, output "NO".

But need to make sure that s ≤ 60.

In the first sample, n=7, k=3:

- p1=3, q1=2, c=1, k=1, s=1

- p2=1, q2=1, c=0, k=0, s=0

- Output "YES" with s=2 and p1=3, p2=1

In the third sample, n=255, k=8:

- p1=32, q1=7, c=31, k=1, s=1

- p2=31, q2=1, c=0, k=0, s=0

- Output "YES" with s=2 and p1=32, p2=31

But in the sample, they used s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Which also works, but s=2 suffices.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Let me try with n=6, k=4:

- p1=2, q1=3, c=0, k=1, s=1

- p2=0, invalid

- Hence, "NO"

Perfect.

Hence, this algorithm seems to work.

Now, I need to implement this.

But in the code provided, it's different.

Let's see what the provided code does.

Given code:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(*costs)

So, it sets up s=2 stalls with p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1.

Then, calculates h = floor(n/p1) + floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2)

And checks if h >= k.

If h < k, output "NO", else output "YES" with s=2 and p1=n - k + 1, p2=1.

Let's see with n=7, k=3.

p1=7-3+1=5, p2=1.

q1=floor(7/5)=1, spend 5 coins, left with 2.

q2=floor(2/1)=2, spend 2 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:3.

Hence, h=3 >= k=3, so output "YES" with s=2 and p1=5, p2=1.

Which is correct.

With n=6, k=4.

p1=6-4+1=3, p2=1.

q1=floor(6/3)=2, spend 6 coins, left with 0.

q2=0.

Total jewels:2 < k=4.

Hence, h=2 < 4, output "NO".

Correct.

With n=255, k=8.

p1=255-8+1=248, p2=1.

q1=floor(255/248)=1, spend 248 coins, left with 7.

q2=floor(7/1)=7, spend 7 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:8.

Hence, h=8 >= k=8, output "YES" with s=2 and p1=248, p2=1.

Which is correct.

Hence, this approach seems to work.

But in the sample, they used s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

But with s=2, it's also possible.

Hence, this approach is valid.

But why does this work?

Let me see.

Set p1 = n - k + 1, p2 =1.

Then, q1 = floor(n / p1) = floor(n / (n - k +1)).

Let m = n - k +1.

Then, q1 = floor(n / m).

Let’s compute q1.

q1 = floor(n / m) = floor(n / (n - k +1)).

Let’s see for n=7, k=3: m=5, q1=1.

For n=6, k=4: m=3, q1=2.

For n=255, k=8: m=248, q1=1.

Then, q2 = floor((n - q1*m)/1) = n - q1*m.

Total jewels: q1 + q2 = q1 + (n - q1*m).

Simplify: q1 + n - q1*m = n + q1*(1 - m).

But m = n - k +1.

So, 1 - m = 1 - (n - k +1) = -n + k -1 +1 = -n + k.

Hence, total jewels: n + q1*( -n + k )

We need this to be equal to k.

So, n - q1*(n - k) = k.

Rearrange: n - k = q1*(n -k)

Hence, q1 = (n - k)/(n -k) =1.

Wait, but only if n -k !=0.

But in the case n=7, k=3, n -k =4, q1=1.

Wait, 1*(4)=4, which is n -k.

Hence, total jewels: n - (n -k) =k.

Hence, it works.

Wait, in general, q1 = floor(n / m), where m = n -k +1.

Then, q2 = n - q1*m.

Total jewels: q1 + q2 = q1 + n - q1*m.

Set this equal to k: q1 + n - q1*m =k.

Rearrange: n + q1*(1 - m) =k.

But m = n -k +1.

Substitute: n + q1*(1 - (n -k +1)) =k.

Simplify: n + q1*(1 - n +k -1) =k.

Which is n + q1*(k - n) =k.

Rearrange: n + q1*k - q1*n =k.

Bring terms with q1: q1*k - q1*n =k -n.

Factor q1: q1*(k -n) =k -n.

If k !=n, then q1 =1.

Hence, q1=1.

But in the earlier examples, q1 was 1 in some cases and more in others.

Wait, in n=7, k=3, q1=1.

n=6, k=4: q1=2.

n=255, k=8: q1=1.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Hence, with p1 = n -k +1, q1=1 if n >= m, else 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, m = n -k +1.

Then, q1 = floor(n / m).

If n >= m, q1 = floor(n / m).

In n=7, k=3, m=5, q1=1.

n=6, k=4, m=3, q1=2.

n=255, k=8, m=248, q1=1.

Hence, q1 + q2 = n - (m)*(q1 -1).

Wait, earlier analysis seems off.

But in any case, the approach seems to work.

Hence, the provided code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels given n coins. The solution involves a strategic approach to select stall prices such that the total jewels bought by Alice equals the desired value k.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases:**
    - If k is greater than n, it's impossible because Alice cannot buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.
    - If k equals n, setting one stall with price 1 will make Alice buy exactly n jewels.

2. **General Case:**
    - Set up two stalls with specific prices:
        - First stall price (`p1`): n - k + 1
        - Second stall price (`p2`): 1
    - Calculate the number of jewels Alice can
