Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. I need to determine if he can form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

First, I need to understand what's meant by "different." The problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, for example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle. Got it.

So, Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of the sides, meaning he can either cut along the length or the width. Let's consider both options.

If he cuts parallel to the width, he's essentially dividing the length a into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a. The two resulting rectangles would have dimensions a1 x b and a2 x b.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the length, he divides the width b into two parts, b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b. The resulting rectangles would be a x b1 and a x b2.

Now, from these two rectangles, he can rearrange them to form a new rectangle. He can rotate them or move them around, but the total area remains the same, which is a * b.

The key here is that the new rectangle should be different from the original one, meaning its dimensions should not be the same as the original rectangle, considering the rotation equivalence.

So, the area of the new rectangle is still a * b, but its dimensions could be different, as long as they are integer values and the area remains the same.

Wait, but he's forming the new rectangle from the two pieces he got after cutting the original rectangle. So, the two pieces together should form this new rectangle.

Let me think about this differently. When Bob cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, he has two pieces with integer dimensions. Then, he tries to arrange these two pieces to form another rectangle.

The problem allows rotation and moving these pieces, but I assume that the pieces must be placed together without overlapping to form the new rectangle.

Given that, the total area remains a * b, but the dimensions can change.

However, since he's using both pieces to form the new rectangle, and the pieces have integer dimensions, the new rectangle must have dimensions that are achievable by combining these two pieces.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me look at the examples provided.

In the first test case, the rectangle is 1x1. It cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles because if you cut it, you'd get two 1x0.5 rectangles, but the problem specifies that the sides must be integers. So, cutting a 1x1 rectangle into two integer-sided rectangles isn't possible, hence "No".

In the second test case, 2x1. Cutting it, you can either cut the length or the width.

If you cut parallel to the width, you get two 1x1 rectangles. From these, you can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original. So, "No".

In the third test case, 2x6. Cutting it, you have options.

If you cut parallel to the width, you can get two 1x6 rectangles. From these, you can form a 6x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, you could cut parallel to the length. If you cut the 2x6 into two 2x3 rectangles. From these two 2x3 rectangles, you can place them side by side to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 or 6x2). So, "Yes".

In the fourth test case, 3x2. Cutting it, you can cut parallel to the width or the length.

If you cut parallel to the width, you get two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, you can't have 1.5. So, perhaps you can only cut parallel to the length.

Cutting parallel to the length, you can cut the 3 into 1 and 2, so you get a 1x2 and a 2x2 rectangle. From these, can you form a new rectangle? Placing them side by side, you could get a 3x2, which is the same as the original. Or, maybe arrange them differently to get a different rectangle.

Wait, but in this case, it's said "Yes", so there must be a way to form a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, for example, 2x3 and 3x2 are considered the same.

In the third test case, 2x6 can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 or 6x2).

Similarly, in the fourth test case, 3x2 can be cut into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, perhaps there's another way to cut it.

Wait, maybe I need to consider only cuts that result in integer-sided rectangles.

For 3x2, if you cut parallel to the width, you can't get integer sides because 3 isn't even.

If you cut parallel to the length, you can cut the 2 into 1 and 1, resulting in two 3x1 rectangles. From these, you can form a 1x6 or 6x1 rectangle, which is the same as 2x3 or 3x2, which is considered the same as the original. But the answer is "Yes", so perhaps there's another way.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the key is to see if the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a rectangle with different aspect ratio.

I need to find a general condition for when this is possible.

Let me consider the area. The area remains the same, a*b.

The new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c*d = a*b, and c != a or c != b (considering rotation equivalence).

But the problem is not just about the existence of such c and d, but about whether the two pieces can be rearranged to form such a c x d rectangle.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think about the cuts.

If Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, each of these smaller rectangles has integer sides.

Then, from these two smaller rectangles, he can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle must have an area equal to a*b, and its dimensions must be integers.

Moreover, the new rectangle must be different from the original one, meaning that its dimensions should not be equal to the original dimensions, considering rotation equivalence.

So, for the new rectangle to be different, its dimensions must not be equal to a and b, or b and a.

Now, the question is, given the two smaller rectangles from the cut, can they be arranged to form such a new rectangle.

Perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible cuts and the resulting pieces.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width.

In this case, we divide the length a into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a.

The two resulting rectangles are a1 x b and a2 x b.

Now, from these two rectangles, we need to arrange them to form a new rectangle with area a*b.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to the length, we divide b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b, resulting in a x b1 and a x b2.

Again, we need to arrange these two to form a new rectangle with area a*b.

Now, the problem is to see if we can form a rectangle with dimensions different from a and b, using these two pieces.

I think the key here is to realize that when you have two rectangles, you can arrange them in different ways: side by side, one on top of the other, or even rotated.

But, since rotations are allowed, we need to consider all possible orientations.

Let me consider the general case.

Suppose we have two rectangles: one of size c x d and another of size e x f.

We can arrange them in various ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally: total width c + e, height max(d, f).

2. Place them side by side vertically: total height d + f, width max(c, e).

3. Place one on top of the other: similar to above.

4. Rotate some of them and try different arrangements.

But this seems too general. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, in our specific case, the two pieces are either a1 x b and a2 x b (if cut parallel to width), or a x b1 and a x b2 (if cut parallel to length).

So, in the first case, both pieces have the same height b, and in the second case, both have the same width a.

This might simplify things.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width, resulting in a1 x b and a2 x b.

If we arrange these two pieces side by side horizontally, we get a rectangle of width a1 + a2 = a and height b, which is the same as the original.

If we arrange them vertically, we get a rectangle of width b and height a1 + a2 = a, which is the same as the original, just rotated.

So, in this arrangement, we don't get a new rectangle.

Is there another way to arrange them?

Well, we can rotate one or both of the pieces.

If we rotate one piece, say the a1 x b piece becomes b x a1, and the a2 x b piece becomes b x a2.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally, we get a rectangle of width b + b = 2b and height max(a1, a2).

Similarly, arranging them vertically, we get a rectangle of width max(b, b) = b and height a1 + a2 = a.

Again, this might not give us a new rectangle.

Unless, perhaps, if a1 = a2, then 2b x a1, which could be different from the original.

Wait, but in that case, a1 = a/2, so a needs to be even for a1 and a2 to be integers.

Similarly, for the other arrangement.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a general condition.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: cannot be cut into two integer-sided rectangles, so "No".

- 2x1: can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, same as original, so "No".

- 2x6: can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x3, different from original, so "Yes".

- 3x2: can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 2x2, different from original, so "Yes".

- 2x2: can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x4 or 4x1, different from original, so "Yes".

- 2x4: can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x2, same as original, or 1x8 or 8x1, different from original.

Wait, in this case, it's "Yes", meaning that there exists at least one way to form a different rectangle.

Indeed, from two 2x2 rectangles, you can form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

So, "Yes".

- 6x3: can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 6x3, same as original, or 3x6, same as original, so "No".

Wait, but the sample output is "No".

So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

From this, perhaps the general condition is that if either a or b is even, and the ratio of a:b is not 1:1, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, in the 2x2 case, both a and b are even, and the ratio is 1:1, and the answer is "Yes".

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, b is even, but the answer is "No".

Hmm, maybe that's not the right condition.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, if you cut parallel to the width, you can cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form 3x6, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, cutting parallel to the length, you can cut the 6 into two 3's, again getting two 3x3 rectangles.

So, in this case, you can only form the same rectangle.

Hence, "No".

In the 2x4 case, cutting parallel to the width, you can cut into two 1x4 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x8, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

Alternatively, cutting parallel to the length, you can cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x2, same as original, or 1x8, different.

Hence, "Yes".

In the 2x2 case, cutting parallel to the width, you get two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from the original 2x2.

Hence, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, cutting parallel to the width, you can't get integer-sided rectangles, but cutting parallel to the length, you can cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from the original 3x2.

Wait, but 1x4 has area 4, while original area is 6, which is inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the area should remain the same.

Wait, no, the area is a*b, which is 3*2=6.

But if I have two 1x2 rectangles, their total area is 2*2=4, which is less than 6.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, if I cut a 3x2 into two 1x2 rectangles, that would be a total area of 1*2 + 1*2 = 4, but the original area is 6.

That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cutting.

If I cut the 3x2 rectangle along the length, dividing the 3 into 1 and 2, I get a 1x2 and a 2x2 rectangle.

Their areas are 2 and 4, totaling 6, which matches the original area.

Then, from these two pieces, can I form a new rectangle?

If I arrange the 1x2 and 2x2 rectangles side by side horizontally, I get a rectangle of width 1 + 2 = 3 and height 2, which is the same as the original.

If I arrange them vertically, I can stack the 1x2 on top of the 2x2, but that would give me a height of 1 + 2 = 3 and width 2, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, if I rotate the 1x2 rectangle to become 2x1, and place it next to the 2x2, I can get a rectangle of width 2 + 2 = 4 and height 1, which is different from the original 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

So, in this case, by rotating one of the pieces, I can form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the general approach seems to be:

- Cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

- Rotate and arrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle with different dimensions from the original.

- If it's possible to form such a rectangle, output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, to generalize this, I need to find a condition based on a and b that determines whether this is possible.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: cannot be cut into two integer-sided rectangles, so "No".

- 2x1: can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, same as original, so "No".

- 2x6: can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x3, different from original, so "Yes".

- 3x2: can be cut into a 1x2 and a 2x2, which can be arranged to form 2x3 or 3x2, which is different from original, so "Yes".

- 2x2: can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x4 or 4x1, different from original, so "Yes".

- 2x4: can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x2 or 1x8, different from original, so "Yes".

- 6x3: can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form 3x6, same as original, or perhaps other configurations, but in the note, it's "No".

Wait, but in the note, it's "No", so perhaps there's no way to form a different rectangle from 6x3.

Wait, but if I cut the 6x3 into two 3x3 rectangles, and arrange them side by side, I get 6x3, same as original.

If I arrange them one on top of the other, I get 3x6, which is the same as original.

If I rotate one of them, say one becomes 3x3 and the other becomes 3x3, still the same.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to cut the 6x3 rectangle.

If I cut parallel to the length, dividing the 3 into, say, 1 and 2, then I get a 6x1 and a 6x2 rectangle.

Now, from these two pieces, can I form a new rectangle?

If I arrange them side by side horizontally, I get a rectangle of width 6 + 6 = 12 and height max(1,2) = 2, which is 12x2.

This is different from the original 6x3, so it should be "Yes".

But according to the sample output, it's "No".

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in this case, 12x2 and 2x12 are considered the same.

Is there a way to form a 12x2 rectangle from the two pieces: a 6x1 and a 6x2?

Let's see:

- The area is 6*1 + 6*2 = 6 + 12 = 18, which should match the original area of 6*3=18.

- To form a 12x2 rectangle, which has area 24, which is not equal to 18. Wait, that's a mistake.

Wait, 12x2 has area 24, but the pieces have total area 18. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, the original rectangle has area 6*3=18.

If I cut it into a 6x1 and a 6x2, their areas are 6*1=6 and 6*2=12, totaling 18.

Now, to form a new rectangle with area 18, but different dimensions from the original 6x3.

Possible dimensions are:

- 1x18

- 2x9

- 3x6 (same as original)

- 9x2 (same as 2x9)

- 18x1 (same as 1x18)

So, if I can form a 2x9 rectangle from the two pieces, that would be different from the original.

Is that possible?

Let's see:

I have a 6x1 and a 6x2 rectangle.

If I rotate the 6x1 to become 1x6, and the 6x2 to become 2x6.

Now, I have a 1x6 and a 2x6.

If I place them side by side horizontally, I get a rectangle of width 1 + 2 = 3 and height 6, which is 3x6, same as the original.

If I place them vertically, I get width 6 and height 1 + 2 = 3, which is 6x3, same as original.

If I arrange them differently, say place the 1x6 on top of the 2x6, I get a rectangle of width 6 and height 1 + 2 = 3, again 6x3.

Alternatively, place them side by side horizontally, getting 3x6.

It seems that with these two pieces, I can only form rectangles that are the same as the original.

Hence, "No".

So, in this case, even though a is even, and b is odd, but since the only possible new rectangles are the same as the original, the answer is "No".

From this, perhaps the general condition is that if both a and b are even, or if at least one of them is even and greater than 2, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a=2 is even, but the answer is "No".

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, a=2 is even, but b=1 is odd, and the answer is "No".

In the 2x2 case, a=2 is even, b=2 is even, and the answer is "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, and the answer is "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and the answer is "No".

Wait, this is confusing.

Maybe the condition is that if both a and b are even, or if one is even and the other is a multiple of 3 or something.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me think about the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle has dimensions a and b, and the new rectangle has dimensions c and d, with c*d = a*b, and c != a and d != b.

But, in the 6x3 case, possible new rectangles are 1x18, 2x9, 3x6 (same as original), 9x2, 18x1.

So, possible new rectangles are 2x9 and 9x2, but in the explanation, it's "No", meaning that perhaps it's not possible to form those from the pieces.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that if the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a rectangle with dimensions that are not the same as the original, considering rotation equivalence.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find a mathematical condition.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:

print('NO')

elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, the program checks:

- If both a and b are odd, output "NO".

- If a / 2 equals b or b / 2 equals a, output "NO".

- Otherwise, output "YES".

Let's test this against the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Let's apply the program to these inputs.

1. 1 1: both odd, so "NO" → matches sample output "No".

2. 2 1: a=2, b=1; a/2=1 equals b, so "NO" → matches "No".

3. 2 6: a=2, b=6; a/2=1 != 6, and b/2=3 !=2, so "YES" → matches "Yes".

4. 3 2: a=3, b=2; a/2=1.5 !=2, and b/2=1 !=3, so "YES" → matches "Yes".

5. 2 2: a=2, b=2; a/2=1 !=2, and b/2=1 !=2, so "YES" → matches "Yes".

6. 2 4: a=2, b=4; a/2=1 !=4, and b/2=2 !=2, so "YES" → matches "Yes".

7. 6 3: a=6, b=3; a/2=3 equals b, so "NO" → matches "No".

So, the program's output matches the sample output.

Does this mean the program is correct?

Well, based on the sample inputs, yes, but I need to verify if this logic holds generally.

Let's consider some additional test cases.

Test case 1: 4x4

- Both even.

- a/2=2 !=4, b/2=2 !=4.

- According to the program, "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2x4 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 4x4 rectangle, same as original.

Alternatively, rotate one to form two 4x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form an 8x2 rectangle, different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 2: 5x5

- Both odd.

- Program says "NO".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cannot cut into two integer-sided rectangles, since 5 is odd.

Hence, "No".

Test case 3: 4x2

- a=4, b=2; a/2=2 equals b, so "NO".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 4x2, same as original.

Or a 2x4, which is the same as original.

Hence, "No".

Test case 4: 4x3

- a=4, b=3; a is even, b is odd; a/2=2 !=3, b/2=1.5 !=4.

- Program says "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2x3 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 4x3, same as original.

Or a 2x6, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 5: 8x2

- a=8, b=2; a/2=4 !=2, b/2=1 !=8.

- Program says "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 4x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form an 8x2, same as original.

Or a 4x4, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 6: 3x3

- Both odd.

- Program says "NO".

- Cannot cut into two integer-sided rectangles, hence "No".

Test case 7: 2x3

- a=2, b=3; a/2=1 !=3, b/2=1.5 !=2.

- Program says "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 1x3 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 2x3, same as original.

Or a 1x6, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 8: 1x2

- a=1, b=2; a/2=0.5 !=2, b/2=1 !=1.

- Program says "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 0.5x2 rectangles, but sides must be integers, so invalid.

Cut parallel to length: two 1x1 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 1x2 or 2x1, same as original.

Hence, "No".

Wait, but according to the program, it's "YES", but actually it should be "No".

Wait, a=1, b=2: a % 2 !=0 and b %2 !=0? a=1 is odd, b=2 is even.

Wait, the condition is if both are odd, print "NO".

Here, a=1 (odd), b=2 (even), so it goes to the elif clause: a/2 = 0.5 !=2, and b/2=1 !=1, so "YES".

But in reality, as per test case 2x1, which is similar to 1x2, the answer should be "No".

Hence, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for 1x2.

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 is "No", but 1x2 should be similar.

This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Looking back, in the program, it checks if both are odd, print "NO".

Else, if a/2 == b or b/2 == a, print "NO".

Else, print "YES".

But in the 1x2 case, a=1, b=2; a/2=0.5 !=2, and b/2=1==1, so it should print "NO".

Wait, b/2=1 == a=1, so it should print "NO".

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

In Python, a/2 == b or b/2 == a.

For a=1, b=2:

a/2 = 0.5 !=2, and b/2=1 == a=1, so condition is True, so print "NO".

Hence, for 1x2, it should print "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would print "YES", but actually, according to the condition, b/2 == a, so it should print "NO".

Hence, the program is correct for 1x2.

I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

So, for a=1, b=2:

- a %2 !=0 and b%2 !=0? a=1 (odd), b=2 (even), so first condition False.

- Then, check if a/2 == b or b/2 == a.

- a/2 = 0.5 !=2, b/2=1==1, so b/2 == a is True.

- Hence, print "NO", which is correct.

So, my earlier mistake was not considering that b/2 == a in the 1x2 case.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Let me check another case.

Test case 9: 4x6

- a=4, b=6; a/2=2 !=6, b/2=3 !=4, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2x6 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 4x6, same as original.

Or a 2x12, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 10: 5x2

- a=5, b=2; a%2 !=0, b%2==0; a/2=2.5 !=2, b/2=1 !=5, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2.5x2 rectangles, invalid.

Cut parallel to length: two 5x1 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 5x2, same as original.

Or a 10x1, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 11: 3x4

- a=3, b=4; a%2 !=0, b%2==0; a/2=1.5 !=4, b/2=2 !=3, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 1.5x4 rectangles, invalid.

Cut parallel to length: two 3x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 3x4, same as original.

Or a 6x2, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 12: 2x3

- a=2, b=3; a%2==0, b%2 !=0; a/2=1 !=3, b/2=1.5 !=2, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 1x3 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 2x3, same as original.

Or a 1x6, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 13: 2x2

- a=2, b=2; a%2==0, b%2==0; a/2=1 !=2, b/2=1 !=2, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 1x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 1x4, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 14: 1x1

- a=1, b=1; both odd, so "NO".

- Cannot form a different rectangle.

Hence, "No".

Test case 15: 6x3

- a=6, b=3; a%2==0, b%2 !=0; a/2=3 == b=3, so "NO".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 3x3 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 6x3, same as original.

Or a 3x6, same as original.

Hence, "No".

Test case 16: 4x2

- a=4, b=2; a/2=2 == b=2, so "NO".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 4x2, same as original.

Or a 2x4, same as original.

Hence, "No".

Test case 17: 2x5

- a=2, b=5; a%2==0, b%2 !=0; a/2=1 !=5, b/2=2.5 !=2, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 1x5 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 2x5, same as original.

Or a 1x10, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

Test case 18: 3x5

- a=3, b=5; both odd, so "NO".

- Cannot form a different rectangle.

Hence, "No".

Test case 19: 8x4

- a=8, b=4; a/2=4 == b=4, so "NO".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 4x4 rectangles.

Arrange them to form an 8x4, same as original.

Or a 4x8, same as original.

Hence, "No".

Test case 20: 5x4

- a=5, b=4; a%2 !=0, b%2==0; a/2=2.5 !=4, b/2=2 !=5, so "YES".

- Can we form a different rectangle?

Cut parallel to width: two 2.5x4 rectangles, invalid.

Cut parallel to length: two 5x2 rectangles.

Arrange them to form a 5x4, same as original.

Or a 10x2, which is different from original.

Hence, "Yes".

From these test cases, it seems that the program's logic correctly determines whether it's possible to form a different rectangle or not.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to cut a given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

## Approach

1. **Initial Check for Odd Dimensions**:
    - If both dimensions of the rectangle are odd, it is impossible to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Hence, output "NO".

2. **Check for Specific Cases**:
    - If one dimension is exactly double the other (i.e., `a` is twice `b` or vice versa), cutting the rectangle and rearranging the pieces will not produce a new unique rectangle. Hence, output "NO".

3. **General Case**:
    - In all other cases, it is possible to cut and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. Hence, output "YES".

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Note: The function func() should be called to execute the code.
# However, in programming competition settings, the function might be
# automatically called by the judge system, so it's often omitted in solutions.
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  1. Read the number of test cases, `n`.
  2. For each test case, read the dimensions `a` and `b`.
  3. Check if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, output "NO" because it's impossible to cut them into smaller integer-sided rectangles.
  4. Check if `a` is exactly double `b` or vice versa. If so, output "NO" because rearrangement doesn't produce a new unique rectangle.
  5. In all other cases, output "YES" as it's possible to form a new rectangle.

- **Rationale**:
  - The initial check handles cases where cutting isn't possible due to odd dimensions.
  - The specific case check handles scenarios where cutting and rearranging doesn't yield a new unique rectangle.
  - The general case assumes that in all other scenarios, it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

This approach ensures an efficient determination for each test case with minimal computations, suitable for the constraints provided.
