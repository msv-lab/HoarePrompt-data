Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on.

First, I need to understand how the signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But according to the problem, they have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs in year x, we start looking for the second sign in year x+1, and so forth.

So, for example, if n=2 and a=[2,3], and the first sign occurs in year 2, then we start looking for the second sign in year 3. The second sign occurs every 3 years, so it would occur in years 3, 6, 9, etc. So in this case, it would occur in year 3, which is exactly after the first sign.

But wait, in the example provided in the problem, for n=6 and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the answer is 36. Let's see how that works.

- First sign occurs in year 3.

- Then we start looking for the second sign from year 4 onwards. The second sign occurs every 2 years, so it would occur in years 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. So the first occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

- Then we start looking for the third sign from year 5 onwards. The third sign occurs every 4 years, so it occurs in years 4, 8, 12, etc. The first occurrence after year 4 is in year 8.

- Then we start looking for the fourth sign from year 9 onwards. The fourth sign occurs every 5 years, so it occurs in years 5, 10, 15, etc. The first occurrence after year 8 is in year 10.

- Then we start looking for the fifth sign from year 11 onwards. The fifth sign occurs every 9 years, so it occurs in years 9, 18, 27, etc. The first occurrence after year 10 is in year 18.

- Finally, we start looking for the sixth sign from year 19 onwards. The sixth sign occurs every 18 years, so it occurs in years 18, 36, 54, etc. The first occurrence after year 18 is in year 36.

So, the sixth sign occurs in year 36, which is the answer.

From this, it seems like for each sign, we need to find the smallest year that is greater than the year the previous sign occurred and is a multiple of the current sign's period.

So, in code, I need to keep track of the year where the previous sign occurred, and for each subsequent sign, find the smallest year that is greater than the previous year and is a multiple of the current sign's period.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

It initializes start_year to 0, and for each sign, it updates start_year using the formula:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Let's see what this formula does.

((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

This seems to be calculating the smallest multiple of nums[x] that is greater than start_year.

Let's break it down:

- (start_year + 1) // nums[x]: This gives the quotient when start_year + 1 is divided by nums[x].

- Adding 1 to this quotient gives the next multiple.

- Multiplying by nums[x] gives the actual year which is the next multiple.

So, yes, this formula finds the smallest year that is a multiple of nums[x] and is greater than start_year.

This matches what we need: for each sign, find the smallest year that is a multiple of its period and is greater than the year the previous sign occurred.

Let's test this with the first example:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Start with start_year=0

1. For a=3:

((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = (1 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

2. For a=2:

((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6

Wait, but in the earlier manual calculation, the second sign should occur in year 4, not year 6.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the manual calculation, after the first sign at year 3, we start looking for the second sign from year 4 onwards. The second sign occurs every 2 years, so it occurs in years 2, 4, 6, etc. So the first occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

But according to the formula, it's giving year 6.

So, there's an issue here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Let's check the formula again:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

For the second sign:

start_year = 3

((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6

But according to the problem, it should be 4.

This suggests that the formula is not correctly capturing the logic.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.

Let's think differently.

Given a previous year p, and a period a, the next occurrence after p is ceil(p / a) * a.

But in code, ceil(p / a) can be implemented as (p + a - 1) // a.

So, next_year = ((p + a - 1) // a) * a

But in the given code, it's ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Wait, that's different.

Let's compare:

Correct formula: ((p + a - 1) // a) * a

Given formula: ((p + 1) // a + 1) * a

These are not the same.

Let's test with p=3, a=2:

Correct formula: ((3 + 2 - 1) // 2) * 2 = (4 // 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

Given formula: ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6

So, the given formula gives 6, but it should be 4.

This means the given program is incorrect.

But wait, in the example, the program outputs 36, which matches the correct answer.

Wait, how is that possible if the formula seems wrong?

Let's see the sequence with the given formula:

1. start_year = 0

2. a=3: ((0 + 1)//3 + 1)*3 = (1//3 +1)*3 = (0 +1)*3 = 3

3. a=2: ((3 + 1)//2 +1)*2 = (4//2 +1)*2 = (2 +1)*2 = 6

Wait, but in the manual calculation, the second sign should be at year 4, not 6.

But in the original manual calculation, it was 4, but according to the program, it's 6.

But in the initial manual calculation, there was a mistake.

Wait, in the first explanation, it was said that the second sign occurs in year 4, but according to the program, it's year 6.

But in the problem's example, the sequence is:

- First sign at year 3

- Second sign at year 4

- Third sign at year 8

- Fourth sign at year 10

- Fifth sign at year 18

- Sixth sign at year 36

But according to the program, it's:

- First sign at year 3

- Second sign at year 6

- Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the program is doing something different.

Let's see:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

start_year=0

1. a=3: ((0+1)//3 +1)*3 = (1//3 +1)*3 = (0 +1)*3 = 3

2. a=2: ((3+1)//2 +1)*2 = (4//2 +1)*2 = (2 +1)*2 = 6

3. a=4: ((6+1)//4 +1)*4 = (7//4 +1)*4 = (1 +1)*4 = 8

4. a=5: ((8+1)//5 +1)*5 = (9//5 +1)*5 = (1 +1)*5 = 10

5. a=9: ((10+1)//9 +1)*9 = (11//9 +1)*9 = (1 +1)*9 = 18

6. a=18: ((18+1)//18 +1)*18 = (19//18 +1)*18 = (1 +1)*18 = 36

So, the program outputs 36, which matches the correct answer.

But earlier, I thought that for the second sign, it should be 4, but according to the program, it's 6.

Wait, but in the sequence, it still ends up at 36, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps in the second step, even though the second sign occurs at year 4, but according to the program, it's at year 6, but then in subsequent steps, it still reaches the correct final year.

But no, in the manual calculation, if the second sign is at year 6, then:

- First sign at year 3

- Second sign at year 6

- Third sign: start from year 7, a=4, so occurrences at 4,8,12,... First after 6 is 8

- Fourth sign: start from year 9, a=5, occurrences at 5,10,15,... First after 8 is 10

- Fifth sign: start from year 11, a=9, occurrences at 9,18,27,... First after 10 is 18

- Sixth sign: start from year 19, a=18, occurrences at 18,36,54,... First after 18 is 36

So, even with the program's calculation of second sign at year 6, the final answer is still 36.

But in the manual calculation, if we follow the program's logic, it's still correct.

Wait, but in the manual calculation, starting from year 3, looking for second sign from year 4, which is at year 4, but program says year 6.

But in the program's logic, it's looking for the next multiple of a_i after start_year, which is ((start_year + 1) // a_i + 1) * a_i.

So, for start_year=3, a_i=2:

((3 + 1)//2 +1)*2 = (4//2 +1)*2 = (2 +1)*2 = 6

But according to the problem, the second sign occurs every 2 years, so at years 2,4,6,8,...

But after the first sign at year 3, we start looking from year 4 onwards.

So, the first occurrence after year 3 is year 4, not year 6.

So, the program is incorrect here.

But interestingly, in the sequence, it still reaches the correct final year.

Wait, but is the program always giving the correct answer, even if it's not calculating intermediate years correctly?

Looking at the example where n=5 and a=[1,2,3,4,5], the output should be 5, according to the sample output.

Let's see:

start_year=0

1. a=1: ((0+1)//1 +1)*1 = (1//1 +1)*1 = (1 +1)*1 = 2

2. a=2: ((2+1)//2 +1)*2 = (3//2 +1)*2 = (1 +1)*2 = 4

3. a=3: ((4+1)//3 +1)*3 = (5//3 +1)*3 = (1 +1)*3 = 6

4. a=4: ((6+1)//4 +1)*4 = (7//4 +1)*4 = (1 +1)*4 = 8

5. a=5: ((8+1)//5 +1)*5 = (9//5 +1)*5 = (1 +1)*5 = 10

But according to the sample output, it should be 5.

So, the program is giving 10, but the sample output is 5.

This indicates that the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, the sample input is:

4

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Sample output:

36

5

5

2012

So, for n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5], output should be 5.

But according to the program, it's giving 10, which is different from the sample output.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the program's output for that case.

Let's recalculate:

start_year=0

1. a=1: ((0+1)//1 +1)*1 = (1//1 +1)*1 = (1 +1)*1 = 2

2. a=2: ((2+1)//2 +1)*2 = (3//2 +1)*2 = (1 +1)*2 = 4

3. a=3: ((4+1)//3 +1)*3 = (5//3 +1)*3 = (1 +1)*3 = 6

4. a=4: ((6+1)//4 +1)*4 = (7//4 +1)*4 = (1 +1)*4 = 8

5. a=5: ((8+1)//5 +1)*5 = (9//5 +1)*5 = (1 +1)*5 = 10

So, the program outputs 10, but the sample output is 5.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now, I need to find out what's wrong with the program.

The issue seems to be with the formula used to calculate the next year.

The formula in the program is:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

As we've seen, this calculates the smallest multiple of nums[x] that is greater than start_year.

But according to the problem, after the i-th sign occurs in year x, we start looking for the (i+1)-th sign starting from year x+1.

So, we need the smallest year y >= x+1 such that y is a multiple of nums[x].

This can be calculated as:

y = ceil((x + 1) / nums[x]) * nums[x]

In integer division, this is equivalent to:

y = ((x + 1) + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x]

But in the program, it's:

y = ((x + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Which is different.

Let's compare the two:

Correct formula: y = ((x + 1) + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x]

Program's formula: y = ((x + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

These are not the same.

Let's see with x=3, nums[x]=2:

Correct formula: y = ((3 + 1) + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = (4 + 1) // 2 * 2 = 5 // 2 * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

Program's formula: y = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

So, the program's formula gives 6, but the correct one is 4.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

In the first test case, it still coincidentally gave the correct final answer because the errors canceled out, but in the second test case, it gave 10 instead of 5, which is wrong.

So, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
