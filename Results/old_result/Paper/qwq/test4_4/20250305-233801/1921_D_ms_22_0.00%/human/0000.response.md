Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have Petya's array `a` of `n` integers and Vasya has another array `b` of `m` integers where `m >= n`. Vasya wants to choose `n` integers from `b`, arrange them in some order to form array `c`, and maximize the total difference `D = sum(|a_i - c_i|)`.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

First, I need to understand what makes the difference `|a_i - c_i|` large. The difference is maximized when `c_i` is as far away as possible from `a_i`.

Given that Vasya can choose any `n` elements from `b` and arrange them in any order, the arrangement order matters. So, I need to pair each `a_i` with some `c_i` from the selected subset of `b` to maximize the sum of differences.

Wait, but the problem says Vasya can arrange them in a certain order. So, the mapping between `a_i` and `c_i` is flexible; I can pair any `c_i` with any `a_i`, but I have to choose which `c_i` to use.

Actually, no. The problem says "arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array `c` of length `n`". So, the order of `c` matters in the sense that each `c_i` corresponds to `a_i`. But Vasya can choose which elements from `b` to include in `c` and in what order.

But to maximize `sum(|a_i - c_i|)`, I need to pair each `a_i` with a `c_i` from the selected subset of `b` such that the sum of differences is maximized.

This sounds like I need to select `n` elements from `b` and assign them to `c_i` in a way that maximizes the sum of `|a_i - c_i|`.

Hmm, this seems similar to matching elements from `a` to elements from `b` to maximize the sum of differences.

I recall that in assignment problems, the Hungarian algorithm can be used to minimize the sum, but here I need to maximize it.

Alternatively, maybe I can sort both arrays and pair the smallest with the largest, or something like that.

Let me think about the properties of the arrays.

Given that Vasya can choose any `n` elements from `b` and arrange them in any order, the arrangement order affects the sum.

I need to choose `n` elements from `b` and assign them to `c_i` to maximize `sum(|a_i - c_i|)`.

Perhaps I should consider the potential maximum difference for each `a_i`, which would be the maximum of `|a_i - b_j|` for all `b_j`.

But I need to choose `n` elements from `b`, not necessarily all distinct, but in this problem, `b` can have duplicates.

Wait, the problem says "he wants to choose some `n` integers of them and arrange them in a certain order", so duplicates are allowed if they exist in `b`.

But in the input, `b` can have duplicates, but since `b` is given as a list, duplicates are possible.

But in terms of selection, if `b` has duplicates, I can choose the same value multiple times only if it appears multiple times in `b`.

So, I need to be careful with duplicates.

Let me consider sorting `b` in ascending order.

If I sort `b`, then I can consider selecting elements from either end to maximize the difference.

But I need to pair each `a_i` with a `c_i` such that the difference is maximized.

Wait, maybe for each `a_i`, I can consider the maximum possible difference with any `b_j`, and then select `n` elements from `b` that maximize the sum.

But that seems too vague.

Perhaps a better approach is to sort both `a` and `b`, and then try to pair them in a way that maximizes the sum of differences.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first example from the input:

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

So, a = [6,1,2,4], b = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

If I sort b: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Now, to maximize the sum of differences, I need to pair each a_i with a c_i from b such that the sum is maximized.

In the explanation, it says Vasya can create array (1,5,7,2), and D = |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

So, in this case, pairing 6 with 1, 1 with 5, 2 with 7, and 4 with 2.

Another possible pairing: pair 6 with 7, 1 with 1, 2 with 2, 4 with 3.

Then D = |6-7| + |1-1| + |2-2| + |4-3| = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2, which is less than 16.

So, the first pairing is better.

How to generalize this?

I need to select n elements from b and assign them to c_i to maximize sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds like a matching problem where I need to assign each a_i to a c_i from b, maximizing the sum of differences.

Since assignment problems can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm for minimization, but here I need maximization.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a greedy approach.

Let me think about sorting a and b.

If I sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and pair them accordingly, that might maximize the sum.

Wait, in the first example:

a sorted: [1,2,4,6]

b sorted descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pairing 1 with 7: |1-7|=6

2 with 5: |2-5|=3

4 with 3: |4-3|=1

6 with 3: |6-3|=3

Sum: 6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

So, that's not optimal.

Alternatively, pairing largest a with smallest b, and smallest a with largest b.

So, pair smallest a with largest b, and largest a with smallest b.

In the first example:

a sorted: [1,2,4,6]

b sorted: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Pair 1 with 7: |1-7|=6

2 with 5: |2-5|=3

4 with 3: |4-3|=1

6 with 1: |6-1|=5

Sum: 6+3+1+5=15, which is still less than 16.

Wait, in the explanation, they have paired 6 with 1, 1 with 5, 2 with 7, and 4 with 2, summing to 16.

So, my approach gave 15, but 16 is possible.

So, perhaps pairing largest a with smallest b and smallest a with largest b isn't always optimal.

Maybe there's a better strategy.

Let me consider that for each a_i, the maximum possible difference is with either the smallest or largest b_j.

So, for each a_i, I can compute |a_i - b_min| and |a_i - b_max|, and choose the larger one.

Then, for the remaining b_j's, repeat the process.

But I need to select n elements from b, so I need to ensure that the selected c_i's are distinct elements from b.

Wait, no, duplicates are allowed if they exist in b.

Wait, actually, from the input, duplicates are allowed in b.

In the first example, b has two 3's.

So, if I choose two 3's for c, that's allowed.

So, I need to select n elements from b, allowing duplicates if they exist in b, and arrange them to maximize the sum of differences.

But in the first example, c is [1,5,7,2], which are all unique, but b has duplicates.

In another test case, b has all 1's, and c would also be [1,1,1].

So, duplicates are allowed in c if they exist in b.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can sort b, and then for each a_i, choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, without exceeding the frequency of b_j in b.

But that might not be straightforward.

An alternative idea: sort b, and maintain two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of b.

For each a_i, choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, either from the start or the end, and assign it to c_i.

Then, move the pointer accordingly.

But I need to ensure that I don't choose the same b_j for multiple c_i's.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to be using a heap to keep track of the maximum differences possible for each a_i.

Let me look at the code.

The code sorts b in ascending order.

Then, it creates a max heap where it stores the negative of the differences, so that the largest differences are at the top.

For each a_i, it computes the difference with b[0] (smallest b) and b[m-1] (largest b), and pushes the larger difference into the heap, along with the a_i and the index from which the difference was taken (either 0 or m-1).

Then, it initializes two pointers, tp1 and tp2, to the start and end of b.

Then, it pops elements from the heap one by one.

For each popped element, it checks if the index from which the difference was taken is still available (i.e., not already used by another a_i).

If the index is still within the range [tp1, tp2], it adds the difference to the answer and moves the corresponding pointer (tp1 or tp2).

If the index is outside the range, it computes a new difference based on the current tp1 or tp2.

This seems to be a greedy approach where it always tries to assign the a_i to the b_j that gives the largest possible difference, and then adjusts the available b_j's accordingly.

In the first example, with a = [6,1,2,4] and b = [1,2,3,3,5,7], sorted b is [1,2,3,3,5,7].

For each a_i:

- a=6: |6-1|=5, |6-7|=1 → choose 5 with b=1 (index=0)

- a=1: |1-1|=0, |1-7|=6 → choose 6 with b=7 (index=5)

- a=2: |2-1|=1, |2-7|=5 → choose 5 with b=7 (index=5)

- a=4: |4-1|=3, |4-7|=3 → choose 3 with either b=1 or b=7; let's say index=5

Then, it pushes these into the heap: (-5,6,0), (-6,1,5), (-5,2,5), (-3,4,5)

The heap will pop the largest difference first, which is -3 (actually 3), corresponding to a=4 and b=7.

Since index=5 is within tp1=0 and tp2=5, it adds 3 to ans and moves tp2 to 4.

Next, pop (-5,2,5): index=5 is now tp2=4, which is not equal to 5, so it's outside the range.

So, compute diff1=|2-1|=1, diff2=|2-5|=3 → choose 3 with b=5 (index=4)

Add 3 to ans, and set tp2=3.

Next, pop (-6,1,5): index=5 is outside tp1=0 and tp2=3, so compute diff1=|1-1|=0, diff2=|1-5|=4 → choose 4 with b=5 (index=4), but tp2 is now 3, so choose b=3 (index=3)

Wait, this seems confusing.

Maybe I need to see the code in action step by step.

Let me try to simulate it for the first test case.

Given:

n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4]

b = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Sort b: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize max_heap:

For a=6:

|6-1|=5, |6-7|=1 → choose 5, index=0

heap: (-5,6,0)

For a=1:

|1-1|=0, |1-7|=6 → choose 6, index=5

heap: (-5,6,0), (-6,1,5)

For a=2:

|2-1|=1, |2-7|=5 → choose 5, index=5

heap: (-5,6,0), (-6,1,5), (-5,2,5)

For a=4:

|4-1|=3, |4-7|=3 → choose 3, index=0 or 5; let's say index=0

heap: (-5,6,0), (-6,1,5), (-5,2,5), (-3,4,0)

Now, tp1=0, tp2=5

First pop: (-3,4,0) → since index=0 is within [0,5], add 3 to ans, set tp1=1

ans=3

Next pop: (-5,2,5) → index=5 is within [1,5], add 5 to ans, set tp2=4

ans=8

Next pop: (-6,1,5) → index=5 is within [1,4], add 6 to ans, set tp2=3

ans=14

Next pop: (-5,6,0) → index=0 is within [1,3], no, so compute diff1=|6-1|=5 (tp1=1) and diff2=|6-5|=1 (tp2=3), choose 5 with tp1=1

Add 5 to ans, set tp1=2

ans=19

Wait, but in the explanation, the total difference is 16, but according to this simulation, it's 19, which is higher than the expected output.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulation.

Wait, in the explanation, c is [1,5,7,2], which gives D=5+4+5+2=16.

But according to this code's simulation, it's giving 19, which is higher.

So, maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the first pop: (-3,4,0) → add 3, set tp1=1

ans=3

Next pop: (-5,2,5) → add 5, set tp2=4

ans=8

Next pop: (-6,1,5) → add 6, set tp2=3

ans=14

Next pop: (-5,6,0) → index=0 is now tp1=1 to tp2=3, so index=0 is outside

So, compute diff1=|6-1|=5 (tp1=1), diff2=|6-5|=1 (tp2=3), choose 5 with tp1=1

Add 5 to ans, set tp1=2

ans=19

But in reality, selecting c=[1,5,5,2] would give D=|6-1|+|1-5|+|2-5|+|4-2|=5+4+3+2=14, which is less than 16.

Wait, but according to the explanation, c=[1,5,7,2] gives 16.

But in my simulation, the code is selecting c=[1,5,5,1], which might not be possible because there's only one 5 and one 1 in b.

Wait, b has [1,2,3,3,5,7], so two 3's, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 7.

So, c=[1,5,5,2] is possible.

Wait, but in my simulation, it's adding 5 for a=6 with c=1, a=2 with c=7, a=1 with c=5, and a=4 with c=5.

Wait, but in the simulation above, it's adding differences based on the heap pops, and the indices.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need a better way to understand the code's logic.

Let me try to think differently.

An alternative approach: for each a_i, the maximum possible difference is either |a_i - b_min| or |a_i - b_max|.

But to maximize the sum, I need to choose for each a_i the maximum of these two, but also considering that I can only choose n elements from b, and each b_j can be used only once.

So, it's like assigning each a_i to a unique c_i from b, maximizing the sum of differences.

This sounds like a maximum weight matching problem, where the weights are the differences.

But that would be too slow for the constraints.

So, perhaps a greedy approach is sufficient.

The code seems to be trying to select for each a_i the b_j that gives the maximum difference, either the smallest or the largest b_j, and then adjusting the available b_j's accordingly.

But in the simulation above, it seems to be selecting c's that may not be possible given the availability in b.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the frequency of elements in b.

Wait, perhaps I should sort b and maintain two pointers, one at the start and one at the end.

For each a_i, choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference without exceeding the available elements.

This seems similar to the code's approach.

But in the first example, with a=[6,1,2,4] and b=[1,2,3,3,5,7], sorted b=[1,2,3,3,5,7].

Start with tp1=0 and tp2=5.

First, choose a=6: max difference is |6-1|=5 or |6-7|=1 → choose 5 with b=1 (index=0)

Assign c_i=1, set tp1=1

Next, a=1: max difference is |1-1|=0 or |1-7|=6 → choose 6 with b=7 (index=5)

Assign c_i=7, set tp2=4

Next, a=2: max difference is |2-1|=1 or |2-7|=5 → choose 5 with b=7 (index=5), but tp2=4, so choose b=5 (index=4)

Assign c_i=5, set tp2=3

Next, a=4: max difference is |4-1|=3 or |4-5|=1 → choose 3 with b=1 (index=1)

Assign c_i=1, set tp1=2

So, c=[1,7,5,1], D=5+6+3+3=17, which is higher than the explanation's 16.

But according to the explanation, c=[1,5,7,2] gives 16.

So, perhaps selecting c=[1,7,5,1] is allowed, but in the original b, there is only one 1, so we can't use it twice.

Wait, b has two 1's? No, b=[1,2,3,3,5,7], only one 1.

So, we can't assign two 1's to c.

Hence, the code's approach is flawed because it's trying to use b_j multiple times if they are chosen from the same index.

Wait, but in the simulation above, for a=6 and a=4, both are choosing b=1, but b has only one 1.

So, that's invalid.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the frequency of elements in b.

Wait, but in the code, when it assigns a b_j to a_i, it moves the pointer tp1 or tp2 accordingly, ensuring that the same b_j isn't used multiple times.

In the simulation above, when a=6 chooses b=1 (tp1=0), then tp1 is incremented to 1.

Then, a=1 chooses b=7 (tp2=5), then tp2 is decremented to 4.

Then, a=2 chooses b=5 (tp2=4), then tp2=3.

Then, a=4 tries to choose b=1 (tp1=1), but b[1]=2, which is available.

So, c=[1,7,5,2], D=|6-1|+|1-7|+|2-5|+|4-2|=5+6+3+2=16, which matches the explanation.

So, perhaps my earlier simulation was incorrect.

Let me try again.

Given a=[6,1,2,4], sorted b=[1,2,3,3,5,7], tp1=0, tp2=5

First, heap has:

(-3,4,0), (-5,2,5), (-6,1,5), (-5,6,0)

Pop (-3,4,0): choose b=1, assign c_i=1, tp1=1

ans=3

Next, pop (-5,2,5): choose b=7, assign c_i=7, tp2=4

ans=3+5=8

Next, pop (-6,1,5): choose b=5, assign c_i=5, tp2=3

ans=8+6=14

Next, pop (-5,6,0): index=0 is now b[1]=2 (since tp1=1)

Choose b=2, assign c_i=2, tp1=2

ans=14+5=19

But c=[1,7,5,2], which is valid, and D=5+6+3+2=16, but the code adds 19.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the differences.

Wait, for a=6 assigned c=2: |6-2|=4

So, c=[1,7,5,2], D=5+6+3+4=18, which is still more than 16.

But according to the explanation, it's 16.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect because it's adding the differences incorrectly.

Wait, no, in the heap, it's storing the maximum difference possible for each a_i, and then assigning the corresponding b_j based on the pointers.

But in reality, some assignments might not be possible due to overlapping pointers or frequency constraints.

Hence, perhaps the code is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the actual code again.

Looking back at the code:

After initializing the heap with the maximum differences for each a_i (either with b[0] or b[m-1]), it starts popping elements from the heap.

For each popped element, if the index is still within the current range [tp1, tp2], it adds the difference to the answer and moves the corresponding pointer.

If the index is outside the current range, it computes the difference with the current tp1 or tp2, chooses the maximum, adds it to the answer, and moves the corresponding pointer.

This seems to be a greedy approach that tries to assign the best possible difference for each a_i, considering the available b_j's.

However, in the simulation above, it seems to be assigning c_i's that sum up to more than the expected output.

Perhaps there's an issue with how the differences are being added to the answer.

Wait, in the heap, it's storing the negative of the differences, so that the largest differences are popped first.

Then, for each popped element, if the index is still available, it adds the difference to the answer and moves the pointer.

If the index is not available, it computes a new difference with the current tp1 or tp2 and adds that to the answer, moving the corresponding pointer.

This seems to be a way to assign the best possible difference for each a_i, considering the remaining b_j's.

But in the simulation, it's giving an answer of 19, while the expected output is 16.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Given a=[6,1,2,4], sorted b=[1,2,3,3,5,7], tp1=0, tp2=5

Heap:

(-3,4,0): difference 3 for a=4 with b=1

(-5,2,5): difference 5 for a=2 with b=7

(-6,1,5): difference 6 for a=1 with b=7

(-5,6,0): difference 5 for a=6 with b=1

First pop: (-3,4,0) → assign c_i=1,
