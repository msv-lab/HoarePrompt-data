Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as t's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

Also, it's important to note that t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters in any position.

My task is to find such a template t for each test case, and based on whether it exists, print "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

In the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c". The solution says "YES", and the explanation is that using template "C" works because 'a' and 'b' are different from 'c' (since 'C' is uppercase, it requires the corresponding character in a and b to be different from 'c').

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa". The output is "NO", meaning no such template exists where a and b match, but c does not.

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder". The output is "YES", with the template "CODEforces" being an example where a and b match, but c does not.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc". The output is "NO", meaning no such template exists.

Okay, so I need to find a general way to determine if such a template t exists for any given a, b, and c.

Let me try to think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand the constraints imposed by a, b, and c on the template t.

For each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] must be equal to t[i], and b[i] must be equal to t[i], but c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], but c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, actually, re-reading the problem statement:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- If t[i] is lowercase, then s[i] must be equal to t[i].

So, for a and b to match t, and c to not match t.

Let me formalize this.

For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

  - a[i] == t[i]

  - b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

  - a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the corresponding lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i], we have:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Our goal is to choose for each position i whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, such that all these conditions are satisfied.

This seems like a problem where for each position, we can make independent choices, and we need to ensure that the choices for all positions collectively satisfy the conditions for a, b, and c.

Let me consider each position independently and see what possibilities there are.

For each position i:

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

Then:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

This implies that a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

If a[i] != b[i], then this case is invalid because a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i] cannot both hold if a[i] != b[i].

So, for this case to be possible:

- a[i] must equal b[i]

- c[i] must not equal a[i]

If these two conditions hold, then choosing t[i] as lowercase works for this position.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

Then:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Here, t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is a lowercase letter.

Let’s denote lowercase(t[i]) as l.

So:

- a[i] != l

- b[i] != l

- c[i] == l

From these, we have:

- l != a[i]

- l != b[i]

- c[i] == l

Combining these:

c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Because l == c[i], and l != a[i], l != b[i].

So, for this case to be possible:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

If these two conditions hold, then choosing t[i] as uppercase with t[i] = c[i].upper() works, because lowercase(t[i]) = c[i], and since c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which satisfies a[i] != l and b[i] != l.

Wait, but c[i] == l, and l is the lowercase of t[i], so t[i] = c[i].upper().

But c[i] is lowercase, as per the problem statement, so t[i] would be the uppercase of c[i].

Now, in this case, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] must hold.

So, summarizing:

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then we can choose t[i] as lowercase equals to a[i].

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then we can choose t[i] as uppercase with t[i] = c[i].upper().

- In any other case, it's impossible to choose t[i] to satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, for the entire strings:

- For each position i, check if either:

  - a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i] (choose t[i] lowercase as a[i])

  - c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] (choose t[i] uppercase as c[i].upper())

- If for any position i, neither of the above two conditions holds, then it's impossible to find such a template t.

- Otherwise, it's possible to construct t by choosing for each position i either lowercase a[i] or uppercase c[i].upper(), depending on which condition holds.

Wait, but there's a catch here.

If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], we can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i].

If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], we can choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper().

But what if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i]? Then neither condition holds, so it's impossible.

Also, what if a[i] != b[i], but c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]? Then we can choose t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper().

Wait, but if a[i] != b[i], and we choose t[i] as uppercase, then we need a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

If we set t[i] to c[i].upper(), then lowercase(t[i]) = c[i].

So, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] must hold.

If a[i] != b[i], but c[i] == a[i], then we cannot choose t[i] as uppercase because c[i] == a[i], so a[i] != c[i] is false.

Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], same issue.

Wait, let's think again.

If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then choosing t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper() works.

But if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then it's impossible.

Because:

- If c[i] == a[i], and a[i] != b[i], then:

  - If we choose t[i] as lowercase, then t[i] = a[i], but b[i] != a[i], so b[i] != t[i], which violates the condition that b[i] == t[i] if t[i] is lowercase.

  - If we choose t[i] as uppercase, then t[i] = c[i].upper(), so lowercase(t[i]) = c[i] = a[i], but a[i] != b[i], so b[i] != a[i], which satisfies b[i] != lowercase(t[i]). Also, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is fine.

Wait, but in this case, c[i] == a[i], and a[i] != b[i].

So, choosing t[i] as uppercase c[i].upper() would make lowercase(t[i]) = c[i] = a[i].

Then:

- a[i] == lowercase(t[i]) → a[i] == a[i], which is fine.

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i]) → b[i] != a[i], which is true.

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) → c[i] == a[i], which is true.

Wait, but according to the problem:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, re-reading the problem:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

So, for a and b to match t:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

And for c to not match t:

- For at least one i, if t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i], or if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, more precisely, c does not match t means that there exists at least one i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i], or

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

But, to ensure that c does not match t, we need to make sure that there is at least one position where the above holds, while for a and b, they match t in all positions.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider the conditions again.

For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

  - a[i] == t[i]

  - b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

  - a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for each position i, we have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

Each choice imposes certain constraints on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

We need to choose for each position i independently, and the choices should satisfy all the conditions across all positions.

This sounds like a problem that can be modeled using constraints satisfaction.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let me consider that for each position i, there are certain possibilities, and I need to ensure that overall, a and b match t, and c does not.

An alternative approach is to consider that for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where c does not satisfy the template condition, while a and b do.

But to maximize the chances of a and b matching, and c not matching, perhaps I can choose t[i] in a way that exploits the differences between a, b, and c.

Wait, perhaps I can look at each position independently and see what choices I have for t[i], and then see if there's a combination that satisfies all the required conditions.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can choose t[i] to be either lowercase or uppercase, with certain constraints.

Let me formalize the possibilities for each position i.

For position i:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase.

  - This requires:

    - a[i] == t[i]

    - b[i] == t[i]

    - c[i] != t[i]

  - Therefore, for this option to be valid:

    - a[i] == b[i]

    - c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase.

  - This requires:

    - a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

    - b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

    - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

  - Therefore, for this option to be valid:

    - c[i] != a[i]

    - c[i] != b[i]

So, for each position i, I have two options, each with their own constraints.

If for a particular position i, neither option is possible, then it's impossible to find such a template t.

Otherwise, it's possible to choose t[i] for each position i in a way that satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the overall condition for the existence of t is that for every position i, at least one of the two options is possible.

In other words, for each position i:

- Either (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]) or (c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i])

If this holds for all positions i, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, let's verify this.

Consider that for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then Option 1 is possible.

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then Option 2 is possible.

- If neither holds, then it's impossible.

Therefore, for the entire string, if for every position i, at least one of these two conditions holds, then "YES", else "NO".

Looking back at the example test cases:

First test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

For position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? No, a != b.

- c != a? Yes, c != a

- c != b? Yes, c != b

So, Option 2 is possible: choose t[i] as uppercase with t[i] = 'C'

Hence, "YES"

Second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

For position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? 'a' != 'b', No

- c[1] != a[1]? 'a' != 'a', No

- c[1] != b[1]? 'a' != 'b', Yes

So, Option 2 requires c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], but c[1] == a[1], so Option 2 is invalid.

Option 1 requires a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1], but a[1] != b[1], so Option 1 is invalid.

Therefore, for position 1, neither option is possible → impossible → "NO"

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "NO", which matches.

Third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

Let's consider position by position.

For position 1:

a[1]='m', b[1]='l', c[1]='a'

- a != b

- c != a and c != b → 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' → Yes

→ Option 2 possible

For position 2:

a[2]='a', b[2]='u', c[2]='d'

- a != b

- c != a and c != b → 'd' != 'a' and 'd' != 'u' → Yes

→ Option 2 possible

...

Continuing this way, for all positions, Option 2 is possible because c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=3

a="acc"

b="abd"

c="abc"

Position 1:

a[1]='a', b[1]='a', c[1]='a'

- a == b

- c != a? 'a' != 'a', No

→ Option 1 requires a == b and c != a, which is not satisfied.

Option 2 requires c != a and c != b, but c == a, so Option 2 is invalid.

→ Neither option is possible → "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Therefore, the condition seems correct: for each position i, at least one of the two options must be possible.

Hence, in code, for each test case, iterate through each position i from 1 to n, and check if at least one of the two conditions holds:

- (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i])

- (c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i])

If for any position i, neither condition holds, then output "NO" for that test case.

Otherwise, output "YES"

This seems straightforward.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

for x in c:

if x not in a and x not in b:

print('YES')

no = False

break

if no:

print('NO')

This seems incorrect.

First, it checks if c == a or c == b, and if so, prints "NO". This makes sense because if c is exactly equal to a or b, then any template that a and b match will also be matched by c, which contradicts the requirement that c does not match the template.

However, if c != a and c != b, it then checks if there exists any character in c that is not in a and not in b. If such a character exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

This seems flawed.

Consider the first test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

Here, c != a and c != b.

It checks for each character in c (which is 'c'):

- 'c' not in a ('a'), which is True

- 'c' not in b ('b'), which is True

So, it prints "YES", which is correct.

Second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

c == a, so it prints "NO", which is correct.

Third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

c != a and c != b.

Now, it checks for each character in c:

For 'a', 'd', 'h', 'o', 'c', 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'r'

- 'a' is in a and b?

a contains 'a', b contains 'l', so 'a' in a but not in b.

- 'd' is in a and b?

a contains 'd', b contains 'k', so 'd' in a but not in b.

- 'h' is in a and b?

a contains 'h', b contains 'c', so 'h' in a but not in b.

- and so on.

Wait, but the code checks if x not in a and x not in b.

In this case, 'a' is in a, 'd' is in a, 'h' is in a, etc.

So, no character in c is not in both a and b.

Therefore, it would print "NO", which contradicts the sample output "YES".

Hence, this code is incorrect.

The issue is that the code checks if there exists any character in c that is not present in a or b, but this is not the correct condition.

According to our earlier reasoning, for each position i, we need to check the conditions based on a[i], b[i], and c[i], not just whether c's characters are in a or b.

Therefore, this code is flawed.

A correct approach would be to iterate through each position i from 1 to n and check for each position whether at least one of the two conditions holds:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If for all positions i, at least one of these conditions holds, then output "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems straightforward.

I need to implement this logic correctly.

Looking back at the given code, it seems that the logic is misapplied.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{false}} \]
