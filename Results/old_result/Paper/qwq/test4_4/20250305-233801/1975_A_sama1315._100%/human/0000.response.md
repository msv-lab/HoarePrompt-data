Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into a prefix and a suffix, swap them, and concatenate them back together. For example, if you have [3,1,4,1,5], you can split it into [3,1] and [4,1,5], then swap them to get [4,1,5,3,1]. The question is, can she make the array non-decreasing after doing this operation some number of times?

First, I need to understand what this operation does. It's essentially rotating the array by moving a prefix to the end. For example, if you have [1,2,3,4,5], and you choose x=[1,2], y=[3,4,5], swapping them gives you [3,4,5,1,2]. If you do it again, choosing x=[3,4], y=[5,1,2], swapping gives [5,1,2,3,4], and so on.

So, the operation allows us to rotate the array in these specific ways, not just any arbitrary rotation. But wait, actually, since we can perform this operation any number of times, it might be possible to achieve any rotation of the array.

Hmm, is that true? Let's think about it. If I have an array [a,b,c,d], and I split it into x=[a], y=[b,c,d], swapping gives [b,c,d,a]. Then, if I split x=[b,c], y=[d,a], swapping gives [d,a,b,c]. Then, split x=[d], y=[a,b,c], swap to get [a,b,c,d]. So, I was able to rotate the array to its original order in three operations.

Interesting, so it seems like with multiple operations, I can rotate the array in steps. But is it possible to achieve any rotation?

Let me consider a smaller array, say [1,2,3,4]. I want to see if I can rotate it to [3,4,1,2], for example.

Start with [1,2,3,4].

Operation 1: split x=[1], y=[2,3,4], swap to get [2,3,4,1].

Operation 2: split x=[2,3], y=[4,1], swap to get [4,1,2,3].

Operation 3: split x=[4], y=[1,2,3], swap to get [1,2,3,4].

Hmm, I didn't get to [3,4,1,2]. Maybe I need to try different splits.

Let's try again.

Start with [1,2,3,4].

Operation 1: split x=[1,2], y=[3,4], swap to get [3,4,1,2]. Okay, that's the rotation I wanted in just one operation.

Wait, so in this case, I got [3,4,1,2] in one operation. But in the previous attempt, I couldn't get there in multiple operations. Maybe I was doing it wrong.

So, perhaps any rotation can be achieved in a single operation by choosing the appropriate prefix and suffix.

Wait, but the problem says "split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts." So, it's always splitting into two non-empty parts and swapping them.

So, for an array of length n, there are n-1 possible ways to split the array into non-empty prefix and suffix. For each split, swapping the prefix and suffix gives a new arrangement.

Then, by performing this operation multiple times, we can potentially reach different rotations of the array.

But, can we reach any rotation by performing this operation multiple times?

Let's think about it.

Suppose we have an array [a,b,c,d,e].

Possible splits and swaps:

- x=[a], y=[b,c,d,e] → [b,c,d,e,a]

- x=[a,b], y=[c,d,e] → [c,d,e,a,b]

- x=[a,b,c], y=[d,e] → [d,e,a,b,c]

- x=[a,b,c,d], y=[e] → [e,a,b,c,d]

So, in one operation, we can achieve these rotations.

Now, if I perform the operation multiple times, can I achieve other rotations?

For example, starting from [a,b,c,d,e], if I do x=[a], y=[b,c,d,e] to get [b,c,d,e,a], then again x=[b], y=[c,d,e,a] to get [c,d,e,a,b], and so on.

It seems like I can achieve any rotation by repeatedly applying this operation.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=6, a=[1,1,4,5,1,4], and the output is "No". So, even if I can achieve any rotation, it's still possible that none of the rotations are sorted.

So, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if any rotation of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

But, in the second test case, n=5, a=[7,9,2,2,3], and the output is "Yes". Let's see, is there a rotation that's sorted?

Let's list all possible rotations:

Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

Rotation 1: [9,2,2,3,7]

Rotation 2: [2,2,3,7,9]

Rotation 3: [2,3,7,9,2]

Rotation 4: [3,7,9,2,2]

Rotation 5: [7,9,2,2,3]

Among these, [2,2,3,7,9] is sorted in non-decreasing order. So, "Yes".

Similarly, in the third test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3], which is already sorted, so "Yes".

In the first test case, n=6, a=[1,1,4,5,1,4], let's list all possible rotations:

Original: [1,1,4,5,1,4]

Rotation 1: [1,4,5,1,4,1]

Rotation 2: [4,5,1,4,1,1]

Rotation 3: [5,1,4,1,1,4]

Rotation 4: [1,4,1,1,4,5]

Rotation 5: [4,1,1,4,5,1]

Rotation 6: [1,1,4,5,1,4]

None of these are sorted in non-decreasing order. Hence, "No".

So, it seems like the problem reduces to checking if any rotation of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n is up to 50, and t is up to 1000, it's acceptable to check all possible rotations for each test case.

So, for each test case, get the array, generate all possible rotations by performing the operation, and check if any of them is sorted.

But wait, in the problem, it's specified that the operation is to split into a prefix and a suffix and swap them, both prefix and suffix must be non-empty.

So, for an array of length n, there are n-1 possible splits.

But, as we saw earlier, by performing this operation multiple times, we can achieve any rotation of the array.

Is that true?

Let me think about it.

Suppose we have an array [a,b,c,d].

Possible splits and swaps:

- x=[a], y=[b,c,d] → [b,c,d,a]

- x=[a,b], y=[c,d] → [c,d,a,b]

- x=[a,b,c], y=[d] → [d,a,b,c]

Now, from [b,c,d,a], we can perform splits and swaps again:

- x=[b], y=[c,d,a] → [c,d,a,b]

- x=[b,c], y=[d,a] → [d,a,b,c]

- x=[b,c,d], y=[a] → [a,b,c,d]

From [c,d,a,b], we can perform splits and swaps:

- x=[c], y=[d,a,b] → [d,a,b,c]

- x=[c,d], y=[a,b] → [a,b,c,d]

- x=[c,d,a], y=[b] → [b,c,d,a]

From [d,a,b,c], we can perform splits and swaps:

- x=[d], y=[a,b,c] → [a,b,c,d]

- x=[d,a], y=[b,c] → [b,c,d,a]

- x=[d,a,b], y=[c] → [c,d,a,b]

From [a,b,c,d], which is the original array, we can perform splits and swaps:

- x=[a], y=[b,c,d] → [b,c,d,a]

- x=[a,b], y=[c,d] → [c,d,a,b]

- x=[a,b,c], y=[d] → [d,a,b,c]

So, it seems like by performing these operations, we can cycle through different rotations of the array.

Moreover, it seems like we can achieve any rotation by performing a sequence of these operations.

For example, to get from [a,b,c,d] to [c,d,a,b], we can do:

- Split x=[a], y=[b,c,d] → [b,c,d,a]

- Split x=[b,c], y=[d,a] → [d,a,b,c]

- Split x=[d], y=[a,b,c] → [a,b,c,d]

- Split x=[a,b], y=[c,d] → [c,d,a,b]

So, in four operations, we achieved the rotation [c,d,a,b].

Similarly, we can achieve any other rotation.

Therefore, it seems like with multiple operations, we can achieve any rotation of the array.

Hence, to solve the problem, we need to check if there exists any rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given that n is up to 50, and t is up to 1000, it's feasible to check all n rotations for each test case.

So, the plan is:

- For each test case, get the array a.

- Generate all n possible rotations of a by performing the operation.

- Check if any of these rotations is sorted in non-decreasing order.

- If yes, output "Yes"; else, "No".

Now, in the code provided, there's func_1(a) which seems to implement this idea.

Let's look at func_1(a):

def func_1(a):

n = len(a)

sorted_a = sorted(a)

concatenated_a = a + a

for i in range(n):

if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:

return 'Yes'

return 'No'

So, what's happening here?

It sorts the array a to get sorted_a.

Then, it concatenates a with itself to get concatenated_a, which is a + a.

Then, it checks for each possible rotation (by sliding a window of size n over concatenated_a) if that substring equals sorted_a.

If any rotation matches sorted_a, it returns 'Yes'; else, 'No'.

This seems correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, a=[1,1,4,5,1,4], sorted_a=[1,1,4,4,5,1], which is [1,1,4,4,5,1].

Concatenated_a = [1,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,4,5,1,4]

Now, checking each rotation:

i=0: [1,1,4,5,1,4] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

i=1: [1,4,5,1,4,1] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

i=2: [4,5,1,4,1,1] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

i=3: [5,1,4,1,1,4] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

i=4: [1,4,1,1,4,5] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

i=5: [4,1,1,4,5,1] == [1,1,4,4,5,1]? No

Hence, 'No', which matches the first test case.

Second test case: a=[7,9,2,2,3], sorted_a=[2,2,3,7,9]

Concatenated_a = [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3]

Checking each rotation:

i=0: [7,9,2,2,3] == [2,2,3,7,9]? No

i=1: [9,2,2,3,7] == [2,2,3,7,9]? No

i=2: [2,2,3,7,9] == [2,2,3,7,9]? Yes

Hence, 'Yes', matches the second test case.

Third test case: a=[1,2,3], sorted_a=[1,2,3]

Concatenated_a = [1,2,3,1,2,3]

Checking each rotation:

i=0: [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]? Yes

Hence, 'Yes'.

So, the func_1(a) seems to be correctly implementing the idea of checking if any rotation of a matches the sorted version of a.

Now, func_2() reads the input, processes each test case by calling func_1(a), and collects the results, then prints them all at once.

This seems correct.

But, I need to make sure that the input reading is handled properly.

In func_2():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

idx = 0

t = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))

idx += n

result = func_1(a)

results.append(result)

print('\n'.join(results))

This is a standard way to read multiple test cases from input, especially in competitive programming.

It reads all input at once, splits it into tokens, and parses them one by one.

So, overall, the program seems correct.

I don't see any mistakes in the logic or implementation.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness: True**
