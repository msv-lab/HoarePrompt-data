Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, such that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(a, b) is that number.

The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b). In mathematical terms, that means (a + b) mod (b * gcd(a, b)) = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify this condition somehow. Let's try to manipulate the expression.

Let’s denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a can be written as a = d * a1, and b can be written as b = d * b1, where a1 and b1 are coprime integers (since d is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, that means (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so what does this imply?

Wait, d = gcd(a, b), and a1 = a / d, b1 = b / d, with gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

So, (a1 + b1) should be divisible by b1 * d.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so a1 + b1 being divisible by b1 would imply that a1 is divisible by b1, but since gcd(a1, b1) = 1, that can only happen if b1 = 1.

Wait, if b1 > 1 and b1 divides a1, but a1 and b1 are coprime, that's only possible if b1 = 1.

So, perhaps the only solution is when b1 = 1, which means b = d.

Wait, but d = gcd(a, b), and if b = d, then b divides a, since d divides a.

So, in this case, b divides a.

Wait, let's see: if b divides a, then gcd(a, b) = b, since b divides a.

So, a + b should be divisible by b * b = b^2.

Because gcd(a, b) = b, so b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b^2.

So, a + b should be divisible by b^2.

But a is a multiple of b, since b divides a.

So, a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = b * (k + 1)

This needs to be divisible by b^2.

So, b * (k + 1) should be divisible by b^2.

Which means that k + 1 should be divisible by b.

Because b * (k + 1) / b^2 = (k + 1) / b, which is an integer only if k + 1 is divisible by b.

So, k + 1 is divisible by b.

But k = a / b, and since a ≤ n, and b ≤ m.

Wait, a = k * b, with k being an integer.

So, a ranges from b to n, in steps of b.

And k ranges from 1 to floor(n / b).

So, for each b, k can be from 1 to floor(n / b).

And k + 1 should be divisible by b.

So, k + 1 ≡ 0 mod b.

Which means k ≡ -1 mod b.

Since k is positive, and k ≤ floor(n / b), we can find the number of k's that satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b.

Wait, -1 mod b is equivalent to b - 1 mod b.

So, k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

So, k = b * t + (b - 1), for some integer t ≥ 0.

And k must be ≤ floor(n / b).

So, b * t + (b - 1) ≤ floor(n / b).

We can solve for t:

b * t + (b - 1) ≤ floor(n / b)

b * t ≤ floor(n / b) - (b - 1)

t ≤ floor( (floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b )

So, for each b from 1 to m, we can compute the number of valid k's, which is the number of t's satisfying the above inequality.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think differently.

Given that a is a multiple of b, since b divides a, we can write a = k * b.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = b * (k + 1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * b, since gcd(a, b) = b.

So, b * (k + 1) should be divisible by b * b, which simplifies to (k + 1) divisible by b.

So, k + 1 is divisible by b, meaning k ≡ -1 mod b.

As before.

Now, to find the number of such k's for each b, given that a = k * b ≤ n.

So, k ≤ floor(n / b)

And k ≡ -1 mod b.

Which is the same as k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

So, for each b from 1 to m, we need to count the number of k's satisfying k ≡ b - 1 mod b, and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n / b).

This seems manageable.

Let me try to write a formula for the number of such k's for a given b.

Let floor(n / b) be denoted as q.

Then, k can be from 1 to q, with k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

This is an arithmetic sequence: b - 1, 2b - 1, 3b - 1, ..., up to the largest k ≤ q.

The general term is t_m = m * b - 1, where m is a positive integer.

We need t_m ≤ q, so m * b - 1 ≤ q, hence m ≤ floor((q + 1) / b)

So, the number of terms is floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid a's is floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

And the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

This seems efficient enough, but with constraints n and m up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, we need to optimize it.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n and m up to 2*10^6, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider precomputing some values or finding a mathematical simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to iterate over d, the gcd, and find the number of pairs for each d.

Wait, maybe that's more complicated.

Let me consider fixing b and finding the number of a's for each b.

As above, a = k * b, with k ≡ b - 1 mod b, and k ≤ floor(n / b)

Wait, actually, k ≡ b - 1 mod b is the same as k ≡ -1 mod b.

Which means k = m * b - 1 for some integer m ≥ 1.

And k ≤ floor(n / b)

So, m * b - 1 ≤ floor(n / b)

Thus, m ≤ floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

Hence, for each b, the number of k's is floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

So, the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6, we need an efficient way to compute this.

One way is to iterate over each b from 1 to m, compute floor(n / b), then compute floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b), and sum them up.

Given that m can be up to 2*10^6 and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6, this should be acceptable.

Let me try to write a function that, given n and m, computes the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

But perhaps there's a way to optimize this further.

Let me consider the inner expression: floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b)

This can be rewritten as floor((n / b + 1) / b), but since n / b is a float, but in integer division, floor(n / b) is n // b in Python.

So, in Python, this would be (n // b + 1) // b

So, for each b from 1 to m, compute (n // b + 1) // b and sum them up.

This seems straightforward.

Now, considering the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and sum of m over all test cases up to 2*10^6, this should be efficient enough.

Let me try to implement this and see.

Wait, but in the example, for n=10, m=8, the output is 14.

Let me verify this.

For b from 1 to 8:

b=1: (10//1 +1)//1 = 11//1 =11

b=2: (10//2 +1)//2 =6//2=3

b=3: (10//3 +1)//3 =4//3=1

b=4: (10//4 +1)//4 =3//4=0

b=5: (10//5 +1)//5=3//5=0

b=6: (10//6 +1)//6=2//6=0

b=7: (10//7 +1)//7=2//7=0

b=8: (10//8 +1)//8=2//8=0

Total:11+3+1+0+0+0+0+0=15

But according to the note, there are 14 pairs.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding.

Looking back at the note, the pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

That's 14 pairs.

But according to my calculation, the sum is 15.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the range for a.

Wait, a can be up to n, which is 10, and b up to 8.

But in the note, a can be up to n, which is 10, but b up to 8.

Wait, but in the list, there are pairs like (10,2), which is okay since b=2 ≤8.

But (10,2) is included, but perhaps some pairs are being double-counted or miscounted.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a ≤n and b≤m, and that b divides a.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, for each b, a is a multiple of b up to n.

And k = a / b, with k ≡ -1 mod b.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Let me recast this.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = k * b, with k being an integer ≥1, and k ≤ floor(n / b)

And k ≡ -1 mod b

Which is k = m * b -1 for some m ≥1, and k ≤ floor(n / b)

So, m * b -1 ≤ floor(n / b)

Thus, m ≤ floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

Hence, for each b, the number of k's is floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

So, for n=10, m=8:

b=1: floor((10//1 +1)/1)=floor(11/1)=11, but in reality, a can be from 1 to 10, and b=1, which divides all a, so a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but k=a/b=a, and k ≡0 mod1, which is always true, so 10 pairs, but according to my formula, it's 11.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I have an off-by-one error.

Wait, floor(n/b)=floor(10/1)=10

Then, floor((10+1)/1)=11

But there are only 10 possible a's (1 through 10), so perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((floor(n / b) +1 - (b >1)) / b )

Wait, need to think carefully.

Wait, for b=1, floor(n / b)=10, then floor((10+1)/1)=11, but there are only 10 a's.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be floor((floor(n / b) +1 - b)/b )

Let me check:

For b=1: floor((10+1 -1)/1)=10, which matches.

For b=2: floor((5+1 -2)/2)= floor(4/2)=2, but according to earlier, there are 3 pairs: (2,2),(4,2),(6,2),(8,2),(10,2), but k=1,2,3,4,5 for b=2, but k ≡1 mod2, so k=1,3,5, which is 3 pairs, matching the adjusted formula.

Wait, with the adjusted formula, floor((floor(n / b) +1 -b)/b )

For b=2: floor((5+1 -2)/2)= floor(4/2)=2, but there are 3 pairs.

Wait, still discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((floor(n / b) - b +1)/b )

Wait, for b=2: floor((5 -2 +1)/2)= floor(4/2)=2, but there are 3 pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil((floor(n / b) - b +1)/b )

But I need to stick to integer operations.

This is getting messy.

Perhaps I need to find another way.

Let me consider that for each b, k can be from 1 to floor(n / b), with k ≡ b-1 mod b.

So, the sequence of k's is b-1, 2b-1, 3b-1, ..., up to the largest k ≤ floor(n / b)

Let me find how many terms are there in this sequence.

Let me denote q = floor(n / b)

Then, the number of k's is the number of integers m ≥1 such that m * b -1 ≤ q

Which is m ≤ floor((q +1)/b )

So, the number of k's is floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

But in the n=10, m=8 case, this gives 11+3+1+0+0+0+0+0=15, but the note says 14 pairs.

So, perhaps I need to cap a at n.

Wait, for b=1, k can be from 1 to 10, but k ≡0 mod1, which is always true, so 10 pairs.

But according to the formula, it's floor((10+1)/1)=11, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be min(floor(n / b), floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b ))

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust for b=1 separately.

Wait, for b=1, any a is acceptable, since b=1 divides a, and a+b = a+1 should be divisible by b * gcd(a,b) =1 *1=1, which is always true.

So, for b=1, the number of a's is n.

But according to my formula, it's floor((n +1)/1)=n+1, which is one more than n.

So, perhaps for b=1, I need to handle it separately.

Let me adjust the formula:

For b=1, number of a's is n.

For b ≥2, number of a's is floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

Then, for n=10, m=8:

b=1: 10

b=2: floor((5+1)/2)=3

b=3: floor((3+1)/3)=1

b=4: floor((2+1)/4)=0

...

Total:10+3+1=14, which matches the note.

Great, so the adjusted formula is:

If b=1, number of a's is n

Else, number of a's is floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

And total number of pairs is sum over b from 1 to m of number of a's for that b.

This seems correct now.

So, in code, for each test case, read n and m, then compute the sum as above.

Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough, as m can be up to 2*10^6, but the total sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6.

So, it's acceptable.

Now, to implement this.

In Python, floor division is done using '//' operator.

So, for b from 1 to m:

if b ==1:

ans += n

else:

q = n // b

ans += (q +1) // b

print(ans)

But, in the example with n=10, m=8, this gives 10 + floor(5+1)/2=3 + floor(3+1)/3=1 + ... total 14, which matches.

Another test case: n=1, m=1

Only b=1, ans=1, which matches the first example.

Another test case: n=2, m=3

b=1:2

b=2: floor(2+1)/2=1

b=3: floor(0+1)/3=0

Total:3, which matches the second example.

Seems correct.

So, I can proceed to implement this.

But, looking back at the given program, it seems to be something else.

Wait, the given program is:

def func_15():

(n, m) = func_7()

i = 1

ans = 0

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans -1

def func_16():

for _ in range(func_10()):

sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')

So, it's reading t test cases, and for each test case, reading n and m, then computing the sum as described in func_15(), and printing the result.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the correct way is to iterate b from 1 to m, and for each b, if b==1, add n, else add floor((floor(n / b) +1)/b )

But in the given code, it's doing something different.

It's iterating i from 1 to m, and while i <= m and i*i <= n +i, it adds floor((n +i)/(i*i)), and finally returns ans -1.

This seems different from what I thought.

So, perhaps there's another way to compute the number of pairs.

Let me try to understand the given code.

In func_15(), it reads n and m, then initializes i=1 and ans=0.

Then, it runs a loop while i <= m and i*i <= n +i:

ans += floor((n +i)/(i*i))

i +=1

Finally, return ans -1

So, it's summing floor((n +i)/(i*i)) for i from 1 to some limit, and then subtracting 1 from the total.

I need to see if this computes the same value as my earlier formula.

Let me test it with n=10, m=8.

Compute floor((10+1)/(1*1))=11/1=11

i=2: 12/4=3

i=3:13/9=1

i=4:14/16=0

So, ans=11+3+1=15, then ans-1=14, which matches the expected output.

Similarly, for n=1, m=1:

i=1: floor(1+1)/(1)=2/1=2

ans=2, then ans-1=1, which matches.

For n=2, m=3:

i=1: floor(2+1)/1=3

i=2: floor(3)/4=0

i=3: floor(5)/9=0

ans=3+0+0=3, ans-1=2, but according to earlier, it should be 3.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, for n=2, m=3, the correct answer should be 3, but according to this code, ans=3, ans-1=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, but in the example, output is 1,3,4,14,153,1643498 for inputs 1 1, 2 3, 3 5, 10 8, 100 1233, 1000000 1145141.

For n=2, m=3, output is 3, which matches ans=3, but according to the code, it's ans-1=2, but the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps the code is not subtracting 1 in this case.

Wait, looking back at func_16(), it calls func_15() and prints the result.

But in func_15(), it returns ans -1.

But in the example, for n=2, m=3, output is 3, which matches ans=3, meaning ans-1=2 doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the code is actually returning ans, not ans-1.

Wait, checking the code again:

def func_15():

...

return ans -1

def func_16():

for _ in range(func_10()):

sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')

But in the example, for n=2, m=3, output is 3, which should be ans=3, meaning ans-1=2, but that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the code is actually returning ans, not ans-1.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop stops before including all necessary terms.

Wait, perhaps the subtraction of 1 is to correct for overcounting.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to compute for n=2, m=3.

i=1: floor((2+1)/1)=3

i=2: floor((3)/4)=0

i=3: floor((5)/9)=0

ans=3+0+0=3, ans-1=2, but the correct answer is 3.

So, perhaps the code is wrong, and it shouldn't subtract 1.

Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, it needs to subtract 1.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, m=1:

i=1: floor(2/1)=2

ans=2, ans-1=1, which is correct.

For n=2, m=3:

ans=3, ans-1
