Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants the sum to be as large as possible after her removal and Bob's subsequent modifications. Bob, on the other hand, will try to minimize the sum by flipping the sign of up to x elements.

I need to think about how their actions interact. Alice can influence the final sum by removing elements that might allow Bob to cause less damage, or perhaps removing elements that are negative to begin with, but wait, the problem says that all a_i are at least 1, so all elements are positive. Hmm, but Bob can multiply them by -1, turning them negative.

So, the array consists of positive integers only. Alice can remove up to k of them, and Bob can flip up to x of them to negative.

Alice's goal is to maximize the sum after Bob's moves, and Bob wants to minimize it.

I need to find the sum after both have played optimally.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, since all elements are positive, the initial sum is just the sum of all elements.

Alice can remove up to k elements. If she removes the smallest elements, she maximizes the remaining sum before Bob's moves.

But Bob will then try to minimize the sum by flipping up to x elements to negative.

So, Alice needs to anticipate Bob's moves and try to minimize the impact of his flips.

Wait, but Alice removes first, without knowing exactly how Bob will respond.

Actually, since Bob goes second, he can see the array after Alice's removal and choose which elements to flip.

So, Alice needs to choose which elements to remove in a way that minimizes the potential damage Bob can do with his flips.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the input:

1

1 1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1

Array: [1]

Alice can remove up to 1 element, which is the only one, so she removes it. Then, Bob has an empty array, and he can't flip anything. So, the sum is 0.

In the second example:

4 1 1

Array: [3,1,2,4]

If Alice removes nothing, Bob will flip the largest element, which is 4, making it -4. So, sum = 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

If Alice removes the smallest element, which is 1, then the array is [3,2,4], and Bob will flip 4 to -4, sum = 3 + 2 -4 = 1.

If Alice removes 2, array is [3,1,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum = 3 +1 -4 = 0.

If Alice removes 3, array is [1,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum =1 +2 -4 = -1.

If Alice removes 4, array is [1,2,3], Bob can't flip anything since x=1 and he chooses not to, sum =1+2+3=6.

Wait, but x=1, so Bob can flip one element. So, he can flip the largest remaining, which is 3 to -3, sum=1+2-3=0.

So, among these options, the best sum Alice can achieve is 0, by removing the 4 and letting Bob flip 3.

But in the explanation, it says it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to get sum=2.

Wait, but according to my calculations, if Alice removes 4 and Bob flips 3, sum is 0, which is better than 2.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the explanation, it says: "In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements. Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is 3+1+2-4=2 ."

But according to my calculation, if Alice removes 4, Bob flips 3 to -3, sum is 0, which is better than 2.

So, why is the answer 2?

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally."

So, both are playing optimally, considering the other's moves.

In this case, perhaps Alice removing 4 is not optimal because Bob can flip 3 to -3, resulting in sum=0.

But if Alice doesn't remove any, Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=2.

Comparing 0 and 2, Bob would prefer a lower sum, so 0 is better for him.

But according to the explanation, the answer is 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after Alice removes elements, Bob chooses which elements to flip to minimize the sum.

So, in the case where Alice removes 4, the array is [1,2,3], and Bob flips 3 to -3, sum=1+2-3=0.

But if Alice doesn't remove any, array is [1,2,3,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2-4=2.

Comparing 0 and 2, Bob prefers 0, but perhaps there's a different choice for Alice that leads to a higher sum.

Wait, if Alice removes 1, the array is [2,3,4], and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=2+3-4=1.

Which is better than 0 but worse than 2.

If Alice removes 2, array is [1,3,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=1+3-4=0.

If Alice removes 3, array is [1,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=1+2-4=-1.

If Alice removes 4, array is [1,2,3], Bob flips 3 to -3, sum=1+2-3=0.

So, among these options, the best sum Alice can achieve is 2, by not removing any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4.

Wait, but if Alice removes 4, the sum is 0, which is better than 2 for Bob (since he wants to minimize the sum), but Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she would prefer 2 over 0.

But according to the explanation, the answer is 2, which suggests that Alice chooses not to remove any elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe Alice, knowing that Bob will flip the largest remaining elements, needs to balance between removing small elements and leaving larger elements that Bob can flip.

In this case, if Alice removes the smallest element, 1, then the array is [2,3,4], and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=2+3-4=1.

Which is better than leaving it as [1,2,3,4] and Bob flipping 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2-4=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that removing 4 gives sum=0, which is better for Bob.

But according to the explanation, the answer is 2, meaning that Alice chooses not to remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, resulting in sum=2.

But why doesn't Alice remove 4, leading to sum=0?

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's moves, considering that Bob will play optimally to minimize it.

So, for each possible action of Alice, Bob will choose the best way to flip up to x elements to minimize the sum.

Then, Alice will choose the action that maximizes the sum among all possible choices Bob can make.

In game theory, this is like finding the maximin strategy for Alice.

So, Alice chooses the removal of up to k elements that maximizes the sum after Bob optimally flips up to x elements.

In the second test case, the possible choices for Alice are:

- Remove no elements: array=[1,2,3,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=2.

- Remove 1: array=[2,3,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=1.

- Remove 2: array=[1,3,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=0.

- Remove 3: array=[1,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=-1.

- Remove 4: array=[1,2,3], Bob flips 3 to -3, sum=0.

Among these options, the best sum Alice can achieve is 2, by not removing any elements.

Hence, the answer is 2.

Wait, but if she removes 4, sum is 0, which is better than 2 for Bob, but Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she would prefer 2.

Therefore, the optimal choice is to not remove any elements.

I think I miscounted earlier.

So, in this case, the answer is 2.

Alright, that makes sense now.

So, generalizing this, Alice needs to choose which elements to remove such that after Bob flips up to x elements, the sum is maximized.

Bob, in turn, will flip the largest possible elements to minimize the sum.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest elements to keep the larger ones for the sum, but considering that Bob will flip the largest ones.

Wait, but in the second test case, removing the smallest element led to a lower sum than not removing any.

So, perhaps it's not always optimal for Alice to remove the smallest elements.

Wait, maybe it's more strategic.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order.

Then, Bob will flip the first x elements to negative.

Wait, but he can choose up to x elements to flip.

So, to minimize the sum, he would flip the largest possible elements.

But Alice can remove some elements to prevent Bob from flipping the largest ones.

Wait, but if Alice removes some elements, she is directly reducing the sum.

So, she needs to balance between removing elements that are small, to keep the larger ones, but also considering that Bob can flip the larger ones.

This is getting a bit complicated.

Let me think about it in terms of minimax.

Alice wants to maximize the minimum sum she can get, considering Bob's minimizing action.

So, for each possible subset of elements Alice removes, Bob will choose to flip the x largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

Alice needs to choose the subset to remove that maximizes this minimized sum.

This sounds like a minimax problem.

Is there a smarter way to compute this without considering all possible subsets?

Given the constraints, n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, it needs to be efficient.

I need an O(n log n) solution per test case, probably.

Let me think about sorting the array.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order.

Then, the first x elements are the largest, which Bob would flip to negative to minimize the sum.

So, if Alice doesn't remove any elements, the sum would be sum(a) - 2*sum(first x elements).

Because Bob flips the first x elements to negative, effectively subtracting 2*sum of those elements.

But Alice can remove up to k elements.

She needs to choose which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

So, if she removes some elements, the sum is reduced by those elements, but Bob can flip up to x elements from the remaining.

She needs to choose which elements to remove such that after Bob flips up to x elements, the sum is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider different cases based on the number of elements Alice removes.

Let's say Alice removes m elements, where 0 <= m <= k.

Then, the remaining array has n - m elements.

Bob can flip up to x elements to minimize the sum.

To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements (since they have the greatest impact when turned negative).

So, for a given m, the sum after Bob's moves would be sum(a) - sum of the first m elements (removed by Alice) - 2*sum of the next x elements.

Wait, not exactly.

Let me think carefully.

After Alice removes m elements, the remaining array has n - m elements.

Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's moves would be:

sum of the remaining n - m elements - 2*sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Which is equivalent to:

sum of the remaining n - m elements - 2*sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Alternatively, since the remaining elements are sorted in descending order, the sum after flipping the top x elements would be:

sum of all remaining elements - 2*sum of the first x remaining elements.

So, for a given m, Alice chooses which m elements to remove, and then Bob flips the top x remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

To maximize the sum, Alice should choose to remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the impact of Bob flipping the top x remaining elements.

This is still a bit confusing.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order.

Then, the top x elements are the ones Bob would flip if Alice doesn't remove any.

So, the sum would be sum(a) - 2*sum of the top x elements.

But Alice can remove up to k elements.

She can choose to remove some of the top x elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but by doing so, she reduces the sum by the values she removes.

She needs to balance between removing elements that Bob would flip and keeping elements that contribute positively to the sum.

This seems like a trade-off.

Perhaps I can consider different possibilities for how many of the top x elements Alice removes.

Let's say Alice removes m elements from the top x elements, where 0 <= m <= k.

Then, she removes the remaining k - m elements from the lower elements.

Wait, but k could be up to n, so I need to be careful.

But this seems promising.

Let me formalize it.

Suppose Alice removes m elements from the top x elements and k - m elements from the remaining n - x elements.

Then, the remaining array has n - k elements, with m of them being from the top x elements.

Wait, actually, if Alice removes m from the top x, then the remaining top x - m elements are still there, and Bob will flip the top x - m elements among them.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe a better approach is to iterate over the number of elements Alice removes from the top x elements.

Let’s define that Alice removes r elements from the top x elements.

Then, she removes the remaining k - r elements from the bottom n - x elements.

Wait, but k could be larger than x, so I need to handle that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array in descending order and then consider the impact of removing elements from the front (largest elements) and from the back (smallest elements).

Let me try to think in terms of choosing which elements to remove.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order: a[1] >= a[2] >= ... >= a[n].

If Alice removes the last k elements, i.e., the smallest k elements, then the remaining array is a[1] to a[n - k].

Then, Bob will flip the first x elements of the remaining array, which are a[1] to a[x].

So, the sum would be sum(a[1] to a[n - k]) - 2*sum(a[1] to a[x]).

But Alice can choose to remove different elements.

Alternatively, she could remove some of the top x elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but by doing so, she reduces the sum by those elements.

So, perhaps there is an optimal number of top elements to remove.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Alice removes the smallest k elements, and then Bob flips the top x elements from the remaining array.

But, perhaps there is a better strategy.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

If k >= x, Alice can remove the smallest k elements, and Bob can flip the top x elements.

Sum would be sum(a[k + 1] to a[n]) - 2*sum(a[k + 1] to a[k + x]).

Wait, no.

If Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining array is a[1] to a[n - k].

Then, Bob flips the top x elements, which are a[1] to a[x].

So, sum = sum(a[k + 1] to a[n]) - sum(a[1] to a[x]).

Wait, no.

Wait, sum of remaining elements is sum(a[k + 1] to a[n]).

Then, Bob flips the top x elements, which are a[1] to a[x], but these are part of the remaining array only if k < x.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice removes m elements from the top x elements and k - m elements from the bottom n - x elements.

Then, the remaining array has n - k elements, with m of them being from the top x elements.

Bob will flip the top x - m elements of the remaining array.

Wait, no.

Bob can flip up to x elements, but he can choose which ones to flip, up to x.

But to minimize the sum, he will flip the largest remaining elements.

So, if Alice removes m from the top x, then the remaining top x - m elements will be flipped by Bob.

Additionally, if x - m > 0, he may flip some from the lower part, but since they are smaller, the impact is less.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements.

I need to maximize the sum after Bob's moves.

Given that Bob will flip up to x elements, Alice wants to minimize the impact of those flips.

One way to think about it is that Alice can remove elements that Bob would likely flip, but by doing so, she reduces the total sum.

So, perhaps it's better for Alice to remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the potential damage Bob can do.

In other words, removing elements that are likely to be flipped by Bob.

Since Bob flips the largest elements to minimize the sum, Alice should consider removing some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but this comes at the cost of reducing the total sum.

So, there is a trade-off.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order: a[1] >= a[2] >= ... >= a[n].

If Alice removes the last k elements, the remaining array is a[1] to a[n - k].

Then, Bob flips the first x elements, sum becomes sum(a[k + 1] to a[n]) - 2*sum(a[1] to a[x]).

Wait, no.

If n - k >= x, Bob flips the first x elements, sum = sum(a[k + 1 to n]) - 2*sum(a[k + 1 to k + x]).

Wait, no.

Wait, after removing k elements, the remaining array is a[1] to a[n - k].

Bob flips up to x of them, choosing the largest ones, which are a[1] to a[x].

So, sum = sum(a[k + 1 to n]) - 2*sum(a[k + 1 to k + x]).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the total sum minus the sum of removed elements minus twice the sum of the top x remaining elements.

So, sum_after = sum(a) - sum(removed) - 2*sum(top x remaining).

Alice wants to choose which elements to remove to maximize sum_after.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider iterating over the number of top elements Alice removes.

Let’s say Alice removes m elements from the top x elements and k - m from the bottom.

Then, the remaining array has n - k elements, with x - m of the top x elements remaining.

Bob will flip the top x - m remaining elements.

So, sum_after = sum(a) - sum(removed) - 2*sum(top x - m remaining).

This seems complicated to optimize.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me look at the provided code and see if I can understand the logic.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)

ans1 = sum(a)

for i in range(x):

ans1 -= a[i] * 2

ans2 = ans1

for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

print(ans2)

So, it sorts the array in descending order.

Then, it initializes ans1 as sum(a), and subtracts 2*a[i] for the first x elements, which makes sense if Alice removes nothing and Bob flips the top x elements.

Then, it iterates over k removals, adding back a[i] for each removal, and if i + x < n, subtracting 2*a[i + x].

This seems like it's considering removing the top elements and replacing the flipped elements accordingly.

Wait, let's see.

In the first step, ans1 is sum(a) - 2*sum(a[0] to a[x-1]).

Then, in the loop, for each i from 0 to k-1:

- Add a[i] back (since we're considering removing fewer elements)

- If i + x < n, subtract 2*a[i + x]

- Keep the maximum of these sums in ans2.

Wait, this seems similar to choosing which elements to remove and adjusting the flipped elements accordingly.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me test it with the second test case.

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [4,3,2,1] after sorting descending.

ans1 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 - 2*(4) = 10 - 8 = 2.

Then, loop for i in range(1):

ans1 += a[0] = 4, so ans1 = 6

if 0 + 1 < 4, which is true, subtract 2*a[1] = 6, so ans1 = 0

ans2 = max(0, 2) = 2

So, it prints 2, which matches the explanation.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

ans1 = 21 - 2*(6+5+4) = 21 - 2*15 = 21 - 30 = -9

Then, loop for i in range(6):

i=0: ans1 +=6, ans1=-3; if 0+3<6, subtract 2*a[3]=6, ans1=-9; ans2=max(-9,-9)=-9

i=1: ans1 +=5, ans1=-4; if 1+3<6, subtract 2*a[4]=4, ans1=-8; ans2=max(-8,-9)=-8

i=2: ans1 +=4, ans1=-4; if 2+3<6, subtract 2*a[5]=2, ans1=-6; ans2=max(-6,-8)=-6

i=3: ans1 +=3, ans1=-3; if 3+3<6, subtract 2*a[6], but n=6, so i+ x =9 >6, so no subtraction; ans1=-3; ans2=max(-3,-6)=-3

i=4: ans1 +=2, ans1=-1; no subtraction; ans2=max(-1,-3)=-1

i=5: ans1 +=1, ans1=0; no subtraction; ans2=max(0,-1)=0

So, it prints 0.

But according to the example output, it should be 0, which matches.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[15,12,7,3,3,3]

ans1=43 -2*(15)=43-30=13

Then, loop:

i=0: ans1 +=15, ans1=28; if 0+1<6, subtract 2*a[1]=24, ans1=4; ans2=max(4,13)=13

i=1: ans1 +=12, ans1=16; if 1+1<6, subtract 2*a[2]=14, ans1=2; ans2=max(2,13)=
