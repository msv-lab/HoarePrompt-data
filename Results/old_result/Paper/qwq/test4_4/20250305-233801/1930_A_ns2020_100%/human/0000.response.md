Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I want to maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair, what's the best way to pair the numbers?

One idea is to pair the largest number with the smallest number. That way, the minimum in each pair is as large as possible. Let me see if that makes sense.

Suppose I have the numbers sorted in ascending order: a1, a2, ..., a2n.

If I pair a1 with a2n, a2 with a2n-1, and so on, then in each pair, the minimum is the smaller number in the pair. So, for example, in the pair (a1, a2n), the minimum is a1. In the pair (a2, a2n-1), the minimum is a2, and so on.

But is this the optimal way? Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case: n=1, numbers are 2 and 3.

If I pair 2 and 3, the minimum is 2. That's the only pair, and the score is 2.

Is there another way to pair them? Well, only one way possible in this case.

Second test case: n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1.

So, 2n=4 numbers: 1,1,2,1.

I need to perform 2 moves.

Option 1:

Pair (1,1) and (1,2).

First pair: min(1,1)=1, score +=1.

Second pair: min(1,2)=1, score +=1.

Total score: 2.

Option 2:

Pair (1,2) and (1,1).

First pair: min(1,2)=1, score +=1.

Second pair: min(1,1)=1, score +=1.

Total score: 2.

Option 3:

Pair (1,1) and (1,2).

Same as option 1.

Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get a score of 2.

Wait, but the problem mentions that in the second test case, a sequence of moves that achieves a final score of 2 is shown, and it's claimed that it's the maximum.

So, in this case, it's 2.

Third test case: n=3, numbers are all 1s.

So, pairs would be (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), each contributing 1 to the score, total 3.

Alright, seems straightforward.

But let's think about a case where there are varying numbers.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,4.

Option 1:

Pair (1,2) and (3,4).

Score: 1 + 3 = 4.

Option 2:

Pair (1,4) and (2,3).

Score: 1 + 2 = 3.

Option 3:

Pair (1,3) and (2,4).

Score: 1 + 2 = 3.

So, in this case, pairing the smallest with the largest gives a score of 3, but pairing the two smallest together and the two largest together gives a score of 4, which is higher.

Wait a minute, this suggests that pairing the smallest with the largest isn't always optimal.

In this case, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a higher score.

So, maybe the strategy should be to pair the smallest numbers together and the largest numbers together.

Let me think about why that would be better.

If I pair the smallest with the next smallest, their minimum is the smallest, but since I'm adding the smallest, and in the other pairs, I'm adding the next smallest, and so on.

Wait, but in the earlier example, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives 1 + 3 = 4, while pairing (1,3) and (2,4) gives 1 + 2 = 3, which is less.

So, pairing the two smallest together and the two largest together gives a higher score.

Another example: n=3, numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Option 1:

Pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) → minima are 1,3,5 → sum=9.

Option 2:

Pair (1,6), (2,5), (3,4) → minima are 1,2,3 → sum=6.

Option 3:

Pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6) → minima are 1,2,5 → sum=8.

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the highest sum of minima.

Another way to look at it: to maximize the sum of minima, I should pair the smallest numbers together so that their minima are as large as possible in their pairs.

Wait, but in the first option, pairing (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), the minima are 1,3,5, which sum to 9, which is higher than pairing (1,3),(2,4),(5,6), which gives 1,2,5 summing to 8.

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest seems better.

Generalizing, if I sort the array in ascending order, and pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, then the sum of minima would be a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Wait, in zero-based indexing, that would be A[0] + A[2] + A[4] + ... + A[2n-2].

In other words, sum of A[0], A[2], ..., A[2n-2].

Which is the sum of A[::2] if A is sorted.

Let me check with the earlier example: n=3, A=[1,2,3,4,5,6].

Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Sum of A[::2]: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Which was higher than other options.

Another example: n=2, A=[1,2,3,4].

Sorted: [1,2,3,4].

Sum of A[::2]: 1 + 3 = 4.

Which was higher than pairing (1,3) and (2,4), which gives 1 + 2 = 3.

So, this seems to be a good strategy.

But let's confirm with the test cases.

First test case: n=1, A=[2,3].

Sum of A[::2]: 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=2, A=[1,1,2,1].

Sorted: [1,1,1,2].

Sum of A[::2]: 1 + 1 = 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case: n=3, A=[1,1,1,1,1,1].

Sorted: [1,1,1,1,1,1].

Sum of A[::2]: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Which matches the sample output.

So, this strategy seems correct.

But why does this work?

Well, by sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the next smallest, we ensure that the minima in each pair are as large as possible.

If we were to pair a small number with a large number, the minimum would be the small number, and that small number could have been paired with another small number to get a larger minimum.

For example, in n=2, A=[1,2,3,4]:

Option: pair (1,4) and (2,3):

Sum: 1 + 2 = 3.

Versus pairing (1,2) and (3,4):

Sum: 1 + 3 = 4.

In the first option, pairing 1 with 4 gives min=1, and pairing 2 with 3 gives min=2.

In the second option, pairing 1 with 2 gives min=1, and pairing 3 with 4 gives min=3.

So, the sum is higher in the second option.

Hence, pairing the smallest with the next smallest is better.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and sum up the elements at even indices (0,2,4,...,2n-2).

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

A = list(map(int, input().split()))

A.sort()

print(sum(A[::2]))

t = t - 1

It seems to implement exactly this strategy.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads 2n integers, sorts them, and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first.

Given that this strategy seems correct based on the analysis and the sample inputs, I would say that the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
