Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a certain value. Then, he arranges them in non-increasing order, meaning from largest to smallest. If there are ties, the order of those cubes can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is, did he remove his favorite cube? The tricky part is that since there might be ties in values, the position of the favorite cube after sorting isn't fixed.

Let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand the possible positions the favorite cube can be in after sorting.

Given that the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the favorite cube with value a_f will end up somewhere in the sorted list, depending on its value.

If there are multiple cubes with the same value, their relative order is unspecified, so any of them could be in any position among those with the same value.

So, to determine if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see if it could be among the first k in the sorted list.

Wait, no. More precisely, I need to check if, after sorting, the favorite cube could be in the first k positions (and thus removed) or not.

But it's not just a matter of whether it is or isn't; the problem asks to output "YES" if the cube will be removed in all possible cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, and "MAYBE" if it could go either way.

So, I need to consider all possible permutations of the cubes that are consistent with the sorting criteria and see whether in all such permutations the favorite cube is removed, not removed, or sometimes removed and sometimes not.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote:

- The value of the favorite cube: a_f = a[f-1] (since indices are 1-based)

- The sorted list in non-increasing order: sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)

Now, in the sorted list, the positions of cubes with the same value are arbitrary.

So, the favorite cube could be in any position among those with the same value.

I need to find out, in the sorted list, how many cubes with value a_f are there, and where they are positioned.

If the favorite cube is among the first k, it will be removed.

So, if all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k, then "YES".

If none of the possible positions are within the first k, then "NO".

Otherwise, "MAYBE".

So, to implement this, I need to:

1. Sort the list in non-increasing order.

2. Find all positions of cubes with value a_f in the sorted list.

3. See how many of those positions are within the first k.

4. If all positions are within the first k, output "YES".

5. If none are within the first k, output "NO".

6. Otherwise, output "MAYBE".

Wait, but there's a catch here.

Since cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube could be in any position among those with the same value.

So, in the sorted list, find the range of positions where a_f appears.

Then, the favorite cube could be in any of those positions.

If all those positions are within the first k, then "YES".

If none are within the first k, then "NO".

If some are within the first k and some are not, then "MAYBE".

So, to implement this, I need to:

- Sort the list in non-increasing order.

- Find the starting and ending positions of a_f in the sorted list.

- Check if the starting position is beyond k, in which case "NO".

- Check if the ending position is within k, in which case "YES".

- Otherwise, "MAYBE".

Wait, let's think about this with an example.

Take the first example from the input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5, f=2, k=2.

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

sorted_a = [4,3,3,3,2]

favorite_value = 3 (since a[1] = 3)

Now, in sorted_a, the positions of 3 are positions 2,3,4.

k=2, so the first k=2 cubes are positions 1 and 2.

Position 2 is among the positions where a_f=3 is, so in some cases, the favorite cube could be removed (if it's in position 2), and in some cases, it could be left (if it's in position 3 or 4).

Hence, "MAYBE".

Another example:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 5 (a[4] = 5)

Positions of 5: position 1.

k=3, so positions 1,2,3 are removed.

Since position 1 is within k, the favorite cube is always removed. Hence, "YES".

Another example:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 5

Positions of 5: position 1.

k=2, positions 1 and 2 are removed.

Since position 1 is within k, "YES".

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "NO". So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let's check the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1

42

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

2 1 1

2 1

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Sample Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for the third test case:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 3 (a[4] = 3)

Positions of 3: position 3.

k=2, positions 1 and 2 are removed.

Position 3 is not removed, so "NO".

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought it would be "YES", but according to the sample output, it's "NO". So I must have messed up.

Wait, no. Wait, in this case, favorite_value is 3, which is at position 3 in sorted_a, which is not among the first k=2 positions. So it's not removed. Hence, "NO". Got it.

Another example:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

n=5, f=5, k=5

a = [1,2,5,4,3]

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 3 (a[4] = 3)

Positions of 3: position 3.

k=5, positions 1 to 5 are removed.

So position 3 is removed. Hence, "YES".

Another example:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

n=5, f=5, k=4

a = [3,1,2,4,5]

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 5 (a[4] = 5)

Positions of 5: position 1.

k=4, positions 1 to 4 are removed.

So position 1 is removed. Hence, "YES".

Another example:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

n=5, f=5, k=5

a = [4,3,2,1,5]

sorted_a = [5,4,3,2,1]

favorite_value = 5 (a[4] = 5)

Positions of 5: position 1.

k=5, positions 1 to 5 are removed.

So position 1 is removed. Hence, "YES".

Another example:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

n=6, f=5, k=3

a = [1,2,3,1,2,3]

sorted_a = [3,3,2,2,1,1]

favorite_value = 2 (a[4] = 2)

Positions of 2: positions 3 and 4.

k=3, positions 1,2,3 are removed.

So, if the favorite cube is in position 3, it's removed; if in position 4, it's not removed. Hence, "MAYBE".

Another example:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

n=10, f=1, k=1

a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

sorted_a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

favorite_value = 1 (a[0] = 1)

Positions of 1: all positions 1 to 10.

k=1, position 1 is removed.

Since position 1 is removed, but the favorite cube could be in any position among the ties, it could be in position 1 and thus removed, or in any other position and not removed. Hence, "MAYBE".

Another example:

1 1 1

42

n=1, f=1, k=1

a = [42]

sorted_a = [42]

favorite_value = 42

Positions of 42: position 1.

k=1, position 1 is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another example:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

n=5, f=2, k=3

a = [2,2,1,1,2]

sorted_a = [2,2,2,1,1]

favorite_value = 2 (a[1] = 2)

Positions of 2: positions 1,2,3.

k=3, positions 1,2,3 are removed.

So, the favorite cube is in one of positions 1,2,3, all of which are removed. Hence, "YES".

Another example:

2 1 1

2 1

n=2, f=1, k=1

a = [2,1]

sorted_a = [2,1]

favorite_value = 2 (a[0] = 2)

Positions of 2: position 1.

k=1, position 1 is removed.

Hence, "YES".

Another example:

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

n=5, f=3, k=1

a = [3,3,2,3,2]

sorted_a = [3,3,3,2,2]

favorite_value = 2 (a[2] = 2)

Positions of 2: positions 4 and 5.

k=1, position 1 is removed.

Position 1 is 3, which is not 2. So, the favorite cube is not removed. Hence, "NO".

Alright, based on these examples, my earlier reasoning seems correct.

So, to generalize:

- Sort the list in non-increasing order.

- Find all positions of the favorite value in the sorted list.

- If all those positions are within the first k, output "YES".

- If none of those positions are within the first k, output "NO".

- Otherwise, output "MAYBE".

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n is up to 100 and t is up to 1000, efficiency isn't a big concern here.

I can sort the list each time and find the positions of the favorite value.

But, to make it efficient, perhaps I can count how many cubes have values greater than the favorite value.

Because, in sorted order, cubes with higher values will be before the favorite cube.

And cubes with the same value as the favorite could be in any order among themselves.

So, the favorite cube could be in any position starting from the first position after all higher-value cubes to the last position among the same-value cubes.

Then, if the starting position is after k, it's never removed.

If the ending position is before or equal to k, it's always removed.

Otherwise, it's sometimes removed, sometimes not.

So, to implement this:

- Count how many cubes have values greater than a_f.

- Let's say there are m cubes with values greater than a_f.

- Then, the favorite cube could be in positions m+1 to m + count_of_a_f.

- If m+1 > k, then "NO", because all possible positions are after k.

- If m + count_of_a_f <= k, then "YES", because all possible positions are within k.

- Otherwise, "MAYBE".

Yes, this seems efficient and correct.

Let me verify with the earlier example:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

a_f = 3

Cubes with value >3: 4 (only one cube)

m =1

count_of_a_f =3 (three 3's)

Possible positions for favorite cube: positions 2 to 4.

k=2, so positions 1 and 2 are removed.

Position 2 is within k, positions 3 and 4 are not.

Hence, "MAYBE".

Another example:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

a_f=3

Cubes with value >3: 5 and 4 (two cubes)

m=2

count_of_a_f=1 (only one 3)

Possible positions for favorite cube: position 3.

k=2, positions 1 and 2 are removed.

Position 3 is not removed. Hence, "NO".

Another example:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

a_f=5

Cubes with value >5: none

m=0

count_of_a_f=1 (only one 5)

Possible positions for favorite cube: position 1.

k=5, positions 1 to 5 are removed.

Hence, "YES".

Seems correct.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read a as list of n integers

- a_f = a[f-1]

- count = number of cubes with value > a_f

- count_a_f = number of cubes with value == a_f

- starting_position = count +1

- ending_position = count + count_a_f

- if starting_position > k:

print "NO"

- elif ending_position <= k:

print "YES"

- else:

print "MAYBE"

This should work.

Let me check against the sample input and output to verify.

Sample Input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

Sample Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

Let's verify:

First test case:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

a_f=3

count >3: 1 (4)

count_a_f=3

starting_position=2

ending_position=4

k=2

2 <=2 <=4, so "MAYBE"

Second test case:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

a_f=5

count >5:0

count_a_f=1

starting_position=1

ending_position=1

k=3

1 <=3, so "YES"

Third test case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

a_f=3

count >3:2 (5 and 4)

count_a_f=1

starting_position=3

ending_position=3

k=2

3 >2, so "NO"

Fourth test case:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[1,2,5,4,3]

a_f=5

count >5:0

count_a_f=1

starting_position=1

ending_position=1

k=5

1 <=5, so "YES"

Fifth test case:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

a_f=5

count >5:0

count_a_f=1

starting_position=1

ending_position=1

k=4

1 <=4, so "YES"

Sixth test case:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[4,3,2,1,5]

a_f=5

count >5:0

count_a_f=1

starting_position=1

ending_position=1

k=5

1 <=5, so "YES"

Seventh test case:

n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

a_f=2

count >2:2 (3 and 3)

count_a_f=2

starting_position=3

ending_position=4

k=3

3 <=3 <=4, so "MAYBE"

Eighth test case:

n=10, f=1, k=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

a_f=1

count >1:0

count_a_f=10

starting_position=1

ending_position=10

k=1

1 <=1, so "MAYBE" Wait, according to the sample output, it's "MAYBE", but according to my logic, since starting_position=1 <=k=1 <=ending_position=10, it should be "MAYBE". Okay.

Ninth test case:

n=1, f=1, k=1

a=[42]

a_f=42

count >42:0

count_a_f=1

starting_position=1

ending_position=1

k=1

1 <=1, so "YES"

Tenth test case:

n=5, f=2, k=3

a=[2,2,1,1,2]

a_f=2

count >2:0

count_a_f=4

starting_position=1

ending_position=4

k=3

1 <=3 <=4, so "MAYBE" Wait, but in earlier reasoning, it was "YES". Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, in this case, all positions from 1 to 4 are within k=3? No.

Wait, starting_position=1, ending_position=4, k=3.

So positions 1 to 3 are removed.

The favorite cube could be in positions 1 to 4.

So, if it's in positions 1 to 3, it's removed; if in position 4, not removed. Hence, "MAYBE". But in earlier reasoning, I thought it was "YES". Maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, looking back, in one of the earlier examples, it was "YES", but perhaps I misremembered.

Wait, in the sample input, the tenth test case is:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

According to the sample output, it's "YES".

But according to my logic, it should be "MAYBE".

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k.

Wait, no. In this case, the favorite cube is one of the four 2's.

Positions are 1 to 4 in sorted order.

k=3, positions 1 to 3 are removed.

So, if the favorite cube is in position 1,2, or 3, it's removed; if in position 4, it's not removed.

Hence, it's "MAYBE".

But the sample output says "YES".

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, let's check the sample output again.

Sample Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for the tenth test case, it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps if the starting position is <=k and ending position >k, it's "MAYBE"; otherwise, if ending_position <=k, "YES"; else, "NO".

But according to this, starting_position=1 <=k=3 and ending_position=4 >3, so "MAYBE". But sample output is "YES". Contradiction.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps because the favorite cube is among the first k in all possible permutations, it's "YES".

Wait, no. In this case, since the favorite cube could be in position 4, which is not removed, it should be "MAYBE".

But the sample output is "YES". So my logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to count how many cubes with value a_f are in the first k positions.

If the number of a_f in the first k positions is equal to the total number of a_f, then "YES".

If none of the a_f are in the first k positions, then "NO".

Else, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the sorted list, cubes with the same value can be in any order.

So, in the sorted list, find the positions of a_f.

If all of them are within the first k, "YES".

If none are within the first k, "NO".

Else, "MAYBE".

But in the tenth test case, positions of a_f=2 are 1,2,3,4.

k=3.

Positions 1,2,3 are within k=3, position 4 is not.

So, the favorite cube could be in position 4, which is not removed.

Hence, "MAYBE".

But the sample output is "YES". So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that all cubes with value a_f are in the first k positions.

Wait, no. In this case, there are four 2's, positions 1,2,3,4.

k=3.

So, in the first k=3 positions, there are three 2's.

The favorite cube is one of the four 2's.

If it's in positions 1,2,3, it's removed; if in position 4, it's not removed.

Hence, "MAYBE".

But sample output is "YES". So my logic must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of a_f in the first k positions is equal to the total number of a_f.

Wait, no. In this case, there are three 2's in the first k=3 positions and one 2 in position 4.

So, the favorite cube could be in position 4, which is not removed.

Hence, "MAYBE".

But sample output is "YES". So I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after sorting, all a_f are in the first k positions, regardless of their exact positions.

Wait, but in this case, not all a_f are in the first k positions.

Wait, maybe I need to see how many a_f are in the first k positions.

If the number of a_f in the first k positions is equal to the total number of a_f, then "YES".

If it's zero, then "NO".

Else, "MAYBE".

But in this case, there are three a_f in the first k=3 positions and one a_f in position 4.

So, the number of a_f in the first k is less than the total number of a_f.

Hence, "MAYBE".

But sample output is "YES". So my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the favorite cube is always in the first k positions if there are at least k cubes with value >= a_f.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cubes with value > a_f.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me think in terms of the number of cubes with value > a_f.

In the tenth test case:

n=5, f=2, k=3

a=[2,2,1,1,2]

a_f=2

Cubes with value >2: none.

So, m=0

count_a_f=4

starting_position=1

ending_position=4

k=3

Since starting_position=1 <=k=3 and ending_position=4 >k=3, "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES". Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, maybe if starting_position <=k and ending_position >k, it's "MAYBE"

Else if ending_position <=k, "YES"

Else, "NO"

In this case, starting_position=1 <=k=3 and ending_position=4 >k=3, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES". So my logic is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if starting_position <=k and ending_position >k, it's "MAYBE" only if there are multiple a_f.

Wait, in this case, count_a_f=4, which is more than 1.

Wait, maybe if count_a_f >1 and starting_position <=k < ending_position, then "MAYBE"

Else if ending_position <=k, "YES"

Else, "NO"

In this case, count_a_f=4, starting_position=1, ending_position=4, k=3

Since count_a_f >1 and starting_position <=k < ending_position, "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES". Still contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if count_a_f >1 and starting_position <=k < ending_position, but all a_f are within the first k, then "YES"

Wait, in this case, not all a_f are within the first k, so "MAYBE"

But sample output is "YES". So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the sample input and output again to see what's expected.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3 -> MAYBE

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5 -> YES

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3 -> NO

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3 -> YES

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5 -> YES

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5 -> YES

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3 -> MAYBE

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -> MAYBE

1 1 1

42 -> YES

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2 -> YES

2 1 1

2 1 -> YES

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2 -> NO

Wait, in the tenth test case:

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

a_f=2

After sorting: [2,2,2,1,1]

Positions of a_f=2: 1,2,3

k=3, removes positions 1,2,3

Hence, the favorite cube is always removed, since all its possible positions are within k=3.

Hence, "YES"

Wait, earlier I thought that position 4 could be a_f=2, but in this specific sorted list, position 4 is 1, not 2.

Wait, no, in this case, sorted_a = [2,2,2,1,1]

So, positions 1,2,3 are 2's.

Hence, all a_f=2 are in positions 1,2,3, which are within k=3.

Hence, "YES"

So, in this case, all a_f are within the first k positions.

Hence, "YES"

Earlier, I miscounted the positions.

So, in this case, count >a_f:0

count_a_f=4

starting_position=1

ending_position=4

But in the sorted list, there are only three 2's.

Wait, no, in the list [2,2,2,1,1], there are three 2's.

But in the original list, a=[2,2,1,1,2], so four 2's?

Wait, no, a=[2,2,1,1,2], which is three 2's and two 1's.

Wait, no, indices are 1-based.

Wait, n=5, f=2, k=3

a = [2,2,1,1,2]

a_f = a[1] =2

Wait, f=2, so a_f=a[1] (0-based index)

Wait, the problem says: the cube with index f is favorite.

Given that indices are 1-based.

So, f=2, a=[2,2,1,1,2], a_f=a[1] (1-based index) which is the second 2.

Wait, but in the list, there are three 2's.

So, in sorted order, [2,2,2,1,1]

The favorite cube is one of the three 2's.

All three are in positions 1,2,3, which are within k=3.

Hence, "YES"

So, in this case, all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k.

Hence, "YES"

So, my earlier logic was incorrect because I miscounted the number of a_f in the sorted list.

Hence, the correct logic is:

- Count the number of cubes with value > a_f.

- Let m be that count.

- count_a_f is the number of cubes with value == a_f.

- starting_position = m +1

- ending_position = m + count_a_f

- If ending_position <=k, then "YES"

- Elif starting_position >k, then "NO"

- Else, "MAYBE"

In the tenth test case:

m=0 (no value >2)

count_a_f=3 (three 2's)

starting_position=1

ending_position=3

k=3

ending_position <=k, so "YES"

In the third test case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

a_f=3

m=2 (5 and 4)

count_a_f=1 (one 3)

starting_position=3

ending_position=3

k=2

ending_position=3 >k=2, so "NO"

In the first test case:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

a_f=3

m=1 (4)

count_a_f=3 (three 3's)

starting_position=2

ending_position=4

k=2

starting_position <=k < ending_position, so "MAYBE"

Seems consistent now.

Hence, the correct implementation is:

- For each test case, read n, f, k and the list a.

- a_f = a[f-1]

- m = number of cubes with value > a_f

- count_a_f = number of cubes with value == a_f

- starting_position = m +1

- ending_position = m + count_a_f

- if ending_position <=k:

print "YES"

- elif starting_position >k:

print "NO"

- else:

print "MAYBE"

This should match the sample input and output.

Hence, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
