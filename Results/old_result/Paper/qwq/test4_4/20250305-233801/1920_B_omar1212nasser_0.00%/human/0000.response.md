Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants the sum to be as large as possible, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? That way, the remaining elements are as large as possible.

Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. He wants the sum to be as small as possible, so he should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1. That way, the positive contributions to the sum are reduced as much as possible.

Wait, but Bob can only multiply up to x elements by -1. So, he has to choose which x elements to flip. To minimize the sum, he should flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

But, Alice knows that Bob will do this, so she needs to anticipate Bob's move when deciding which elements to remove.

This seems like a two-player game where each player is making optimal decisions based on what the other will do.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, Alice removes k elements. She wants to maximize the sum after Bob's move. So, she should remove the smallest elements to leave Bob with larger elements to flip.

But, if she removes too many small elements, Bob might have to flip smaller positive elements, which might not reduce the sum as much.

Wait, no. Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll always flip the largest positive elements available to him.

So, Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the remaining sum, and then Bob will flip the largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

I need to find a way to calculate the sum after these operations.

Let me consider sorting the array in ascending order. That way, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and the largest are at the end.

So, after sorting, the array is a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1].

Alice can remove up to k elements from this array. She should remove the smallest k elements to maximize the sum of the remaining elements.

Then, Bob can multiply up to x of the remaining elements by -1. He should multiply the largest x remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

Wait, but if some of the remaining elements are negative, multiplying them by -1 would make them positive, which could increase the sum. But since Bob wants to minimize the sum, he might not want to do that.

Actually, Bob can only choose to multiply up to x elements by -1, but he can choose which ones. So, he should select the elements that, when multiplied by -1, result in the smallest possible sum.

This means that Bob should flip the x largest positive elements to negative, because flipping negative elements would make them positive, which increases the sum, which is not what Bob wants.

So, Bob should only flip positive elements to negative.

Wait, but if there are negative elements, flipping them to positive would increase the sum, which Bob doesn't want. So, he should only flip positive elements.

But, if there are positive elements, he should flip the largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Wait, but if there are no positive elements left after Alice's removal, then Bob can't do anything, because flipping negative elements would make them positive, increasing the sum, which is not Bob's goal.

So, Bob will only flip positive elements if there are any.

Let me try to formalize this.

After Alice removes k elements, the remaining array is a[some indices].

Bob will then flip up to x of these elements by -1, choosing to flip the x largest positive elements.

So, to compute the final sum, I need to:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.

2. Alice removes the smallest k elements, so we take the remaining n - k elements.

3. Among these n - k elements, find the x largest positive elements and flip them to negative.

4. Sum the remaining elements.

But, I need to make sure that if there are less than x positive elements, Bob can only flip those, and won't flip any negative elements.

Also, I need to consider that if after removal, there are no positive elements left, then Bob can't flip anything, because flipping negative elements would make them positive, which increases the sum, which is not Bob's goal.

Wait, but the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1". So, Bob can choose to flip any x elements, but he will choose the ones that minimize the sum.

So, if there are positive elements, he flips the largest positive ones to negative.

If there are no positive elements, then flipping the smallest negative elements to positive would increase the sum, which is not what he wants. So, he shouldn't flip any elements in that case.

Wait, but the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", so he can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

So, in the case where flipping any elements would increase the sum, he chooses to flip zero elements.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1". It doesn't specify that he has to flip exactly x elements.

So, he can choose to flip fewer than x elements if that minimizes the sum.

Therefore, in the case where flipping any positive elements would decrease the sum, he flips the x largest positive elements.

If there are fewer than x positive elements, he flips all of them.

If flipping any elements would increase the sum (i.e., there are no positive elements), he flips zero elements.

So, in summary:

- Alice removes up to k elements to maximize the sum after Bob's move.

- Bob flips up to x elements to minimize the sum.

Given that, I need to find the optimal sum.

Let me consider an example to verify my approach.

Take the first test case:

1

1 1 1

1

After Alice removes one element, there are no elements left. Sum is 0.

Second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Alice can remove one element. To maximize the sum after Bob's move, she should remove the smallest element, which is 1.

Remaining elements: 2, 3, 4

Bob can flip one element. He will flip the largest positive element, which is 4, to -4.

Sum: 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1

But in the sample output, it's 2. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: 3,1,2,4

After sorting: 1,2,3,4

Alice removes the smallest k=1 elements, which is 1.

Remaining: 2,3,4

Bob can flip up to x=1 element.

He will flip the largest positive element, which is 4, to -4.

Sum: 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1

But the sample output is 2. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe Alice shouldn't always remove the smallest k elements.

Wait, in this case, if Alice removes 1, then Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 1.

But if Alice removes 4, then remaining is 1,2,3

Bob can flip one element; if he flips 3 to -3, sum is 1 + 2 + (-3) = 0

Which is worse for Alice than 1.

Wait, but 1 is better than 0 for Alice, since she wants to maximize the sum.

Wait, no, 1 is better than 0 for Alice.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe Alice can choose to remove different elements to get a better sum.

Let's see.

Option 1: Alice removes 1, remaining: 2,3,4

Bob flips 4 to -4, sum: 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1

Option 2: Alice removes 2, remaining: 1,3,4

Bob flips 4 to -4, sum: 1 + 3 + (-4) = 0

Option 3: Alice removes 3, remaining: 1,2,4

Bob flips 4 to -4, sum: 1 + 2 + (-4) = -1

Option 4: Alice removes 4, remaining: 1,2,3

Bob flips 3 to -3, sum: 1 + 2 + (-3) = 0

So, the best option for Alice is to remove 1, resulting in sum 1.

But the sample output is 2. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe Alice can choose to remove different number of elements between 0 and k.

The problem says "remove at most k elements", which means she can choose to remove anywhere from 0 to k elements.

In the second test case, k=1, so she can remove 0 or 1 element.

If she removes 0 elements, then the array is 1,2,3,4

Bob flips the largest x=1 element, which is 4 to -4.

Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) = 2

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, Alice chooses to remove 0 elements, because that gives her a sum of 2, which is better than 1.

Hence, Alice has to choose optimally between removing 0 to k elements.

So, my initial assumption that Alice always removes the smallest k elements is incorrect.

She needs to consider all possibilities of removing 0 to k elements and choose the one that maximizes the sum after Bob's move.

Bob, in turn, will flip up to x elements to minimize the sum.

This seems more complicated.

Let me try to think of a better approach.

Suppose Alice removes m elements, where 0 <= m <= k.

She removes the smallest m elements.

Then, the remaining array is a[m:], which is sorted in ascending order.

Bob will then flip up to x elements to minimize the sum.

He should flip the largest x positive elements to negative.

So, to compute the sum for each m, I need to:

- Remove the smallest m elements.

- From the remaining elements, flip the largest x positive elements to negative.

- Compute the sum of the remaining elements.

Then, Alice will choose the m that maximizes this sum.

So, I need to iterate over m from 0 to k, compute the sum for each m, and take the maximum.

In the second test case:

m=0: remove 0 elements, remaining: 1,2,3,4

Flip the largest x=1 positive element, which is 4 to -4

Sum: 1+2+3+(-4)=2

m=1: remove smallest 1 element, which is 1, remaining: 2,3,4

Flip the largest x=1 positive element, which is 4 to -4

Sum: 2+3+(-4)=1

So, Alice chooses m=0, sum=2, which is better than m=1, sum=1.

Hence, the output is 2, matching the sample.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

Array: 1,4,3,2,5,6

After sorting: 1,2,3,4,5,6

Alice can remove up to 6 elements.

If she removes all 6 elements, sum is 0.

If she removes 5 elements, say 1,2,3,4,5, remaining 6

Bob flips up to 3 elements, flips 6 to -6

Sum: -6

If she removes 4 elements, say 1,2,3,4, remaining 5,6

Bob flips 6 to -6

Sum: 5 + (-6) = -1

If she removes 3 elements, say 1,2,3, remaining 4,5,6

Bob flips 5 and 6 to -5, -6

Sum: 4 + (-5) + (-6) = -7

If she removes 2 elements, say 1,2, remaining 3,4,5,6

Bob flips 5 and 6 to -5, -6

Sum: 3 + 4 + (-5) + (-6) = -4

If she removes 1 element, say 1, remaining 2,3,4,5,6

Bob flips 5 and 6 to -5, -6

Sum: 2 + 3 + 4 + (-5) + (-6) = -2

If she removes 0 elements, remaining 1,2,3,4,5,6

Bob flips 4,5,6 to -4, -5, -6

Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) + (-5) + (-6) = -9

So, the best for Alice is to remove all 6 elements, sum=0.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

Array: 3,7,3,3,32,15

After sorting: 3,3,3,7,15,32

Alice can remove up to 6 elements.

If she removes all 6, sum=0

If she removes 5 elements, say 3,3,3,7,15, remaining 32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: -32

If she removes 4 elements, say 3,3,3,7, remaining 15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 15 + (-32) = -17

If she removes 3 elements, say 3,3,3, remaining 7,15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 7 + 15 + (-32) = -10

If she removes 2 elements, say 3,3, remaining 3,7,15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 3 + 7 + 15 + (-32) = -7

If she removes 1 element, say 3, remaining 3,3,7,15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 3 + 3 + 7 + 15 + (-32) = -4

If she removes 0 elements, sum=3 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 15 + 32 = 63

Bob flips the largest x=1 element, which is 32 to -32

Sum: 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 15 + (-32) = -4

So, the best for Alice is to remove all 6 elements, sum=0, which is better than -4.

But in the sample, the output is 3.

Wait, no, in the sample, the output for this test case is -9, but that's a different test case.

Wait, the sixth test case in the sample has output -9, but in my calculation above, it's -4 if she removes all elements, which is better than -9.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test cases.

Wait, the sixth test case in the sample is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

And the output is -9.

But in my calculation, it's -4.

Hmm, maybe I misread the test case.

Wait, looking back, the sixth test case is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

And the output is -9.

But according to my calculation, it should be -4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, sum after removing all 6 elements is 0.

Sum after removing 5 elements: sum of remaining 1 element, which is 32, flipped to -32, sum=-32

Sum after removing 4 elements: sum=3+7+15+32=57, flip 32 to -32, sum=3+7+15+(-32)=-7

Sum after removing 3 elements: sum=3+3+7+15+32=59, flip 32 to -32, sum=3+3+7+15+(-32)=-4

Sum after removing 2 elements: sum=3+3+7+15+32=59, flip 32 to -32, sum=-4

Sum after removing 1 element: sum=3+3+3+7+15+32=63, flip 32 to -32, sum=-4

Sum after removing 0 elements: sum=3+3+3+7+15+32=63, flip 32 to -32, sum=-4

So, the best for Alice is to remove all 6 elements, sum=0, which is better than -4.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's -9.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Looking back, the sample output is:

0

2

0

3

-5

-9

0

-1

So, for the sixth test case, output is -9, but according to my calculation, it should be -4 or 0.

Hmm, maybe I misread the test case.

Wait, the sixth test case in the input is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

But according to the sample output, it's -9.

But according to my calculation, it should be -4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

In this case, x=1, so he can flip 0 or 1 elements.

He will choose to flip the largest positive element, which is 32 to -32, sum=-4.

But if he chooses to flip 0 elements, sum=63.

He wants to minimize, so he chooses to flip 32 to -32, sum=-4.

But the sample output is -9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Wait, the sixth test case in the input is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

But in my earlier calculation, if Alice removes all 6 elements, sum=0.

If she removes 5 elements, sum=-32.

If she removes 4 elements, sum=-7.

If she removes 3 elements, sum=-4.

If she removes 2 elements, sum=-4.

If she removes 1 element, sum=-4.

If she removes 0 elements, sum=-4.

So, Alice will choose to remove all 6 elements, sum=0, which is better than -4.

But the sample output is -9, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I misread the test case number.

Looking back, the sample input has 8 test cases, and the sixth one is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

And the sample output is:

0

2

0

3

-5

-9

0

-1

So, for this test case, output is -9, but according to my calculation, it should be 0.

There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the sums.

Let me recalculate.

If Alice removes m elements, where m=0 to 6.

For m=0:

Remaining: 3,3,3,7,15,32

Bob flips up to x=1 largest positive element, which is 32 to -32

Sum: 3+3+3+7+15+(-32) = -4

For m=1:

Remove the smallest element, which is 3

Remaining: 3,3,7,15,32

Bob flips up to x=1 largest positive element, 32 to -32

Sum: 3+3+7+15+(-32) = -4

For m=2:

Remove the two smallest elements, 3,3

Remaining: 3,7,15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 3+7+15+(-32) = -7

For m=3:

Remove three smallest elements, 3,3,3

Remaining: 7,15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 7+15+(-32) = -10

For m=4:

Remove four smallest elements, 3,3,3,7

Remaining: 15,32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: 15 + (-32) = -17

For m=5:

Remove five smallest elements, 3,3,3,7,15

Remaining: 32

Bob flips 32 to -32

Sum: -32

For m=6:

Remove all six elements

Sum: 0

So, the sums are:

m=0: -4

m=1: -4

m=2: -7

m=3: -10

m=4: -17

m=5: -32

m=6: 0

Alice will choose the m that maximizes the sum, which is m=6, sum=0.

But the sample output is -9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case number.

Wait, looking back, the sixth test case in the sample input is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

But according to my calculation, the output should be 0, but the sample output is -9.

Maybe I misread the test case number.

Wait, perhaps the test case number is different.

Wait, the fifth test case in the sample input is:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

And the sixth test case is:

10 6 4

1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200

Output: -9

Wait, perhaps I misread which output corresponds to which input.

I need to make sure which test case corresponds to which output.

Looking back, the test cases are:

1. 1 1 1

1

Output: 0

2. 4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Output: 2

3. 6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Output: 0

4. 6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

Output: -9

5. 8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

6. 10 6 4

1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200

Output: -9

7. 2 2 1

4 3

Output: 0

8. 2 1 2

1 3

Output: -1

So, for the fourth test case, which is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

My calculation suggests that Alice should remove all 6 elements, sum=0, but the sample output is -9.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the array elements can be negative, but in the problem statement, it says "1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000", so all elements are positive.

Wait, but in the explanation of the fifth test case, they mention removing 9,9 and flipping 5,5,3 to negative, resulting in -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, if all elements are positive, Bob should flip the largest x elements.

But in this case, after removing 9 and 9, the remaining elements are 5,5,3,3,3,2.

Bob flips the largest x=4 elements: 5,5,3,3 to -5,-5,-3,-3.

Sum: -5 + -5 + -3 + -3 + 3 + 2 = -11, which doesn't match the explanation.

Wait, the explanation says: remove 9,9, sum=5+5+3+3+3+2=21, flip 5,
