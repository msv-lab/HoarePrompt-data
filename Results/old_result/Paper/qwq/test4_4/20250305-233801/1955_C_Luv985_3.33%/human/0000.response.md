Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships in a line, each with some durability a_i. The Kraken attacks them k times, alternating between the first and the last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. After each attack, if a ship sinks, it's removed, which changes the first and last ships for subsequent attacks.

This seems like a simulation problem, but simulating each attack one by one could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15. So, I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think about the pattern of attacks. The Kraken alternates between the first and last ships. So, in the first attack, it hits the first ship, in the second attack, the last ship, third attack back to the first ship, and so on.

If I can group the attacks in pairs (first and last), I might be able to process them more efficiently.

Wait, but k can be very large, up to 10^15, and n can be up to 2*10^5, so I need an approach that doesn't iterate attack by attack.

Let's consider that in each "round" of two attacks (first and last), the Kraken reduces the durability of both ships by 1, provided they are still alive.

But I need to be careful because if one of the ships sinks before the other, subsequent attacks might target different ships.

Maybe I can find a way to calculate how many full rounds can be performed before any ship sinks, and then handle the remaining attacks accordingly.

Let's try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- l = 0 (index of the first ship)

- r = n - 1 (index of the last ship)

I'll need to keep track of the current first and last ships as ships sink in the middle.

I need to process k attacks, alternating between the first and last remaining ships.

One idea is to repeatedly find the minimum durability between the current first and last ships, and determine how many pairs of attacks can be performed before one of them sinks.

For example, if a[l] = 5 and a[r] = 3, then I can perform 3 pairs of attacks (reducing both by 3), and after that, a[l] would be 2 and a[r] would be 0, so the last ship sinks.

Then, I update r to r - 1 and continue with the next first and last ships.

I need to keep doing this until k attacks are used up or no ships are left.

This seems promising. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize l = 0, r = n - 1, ans = 0 (number of sunk ships), and process k attacks.

2. While l < r and k > 0:

a. Find the minimum durability between a[l] and a[r], let's say mi = min(a[l], a[r]).

b. Determine how many pairs of attacks can be performed with mi:

- If mi * 2 <= k, then perform mi pairs of attacks.

- Each pair reduces both a[l] and a[r] by 1.

- So, a[l] -= mi, a[r] -= mi, and k -= mi * 2.

- If a[l] becomes 0, increment ans and l += 1.

- If a[r] becomes 0, increment ans and r -= 1.

c. If mi * 2 > k, then perform k // 2 pairs, and handle the remaining attacks (k % 2) on the first ship.

- Let t = k % 2.

- Attacks performed: k // 2 pairs, plus t attacks on the first ship.

- Update a[l] and a[r] accordingly.

- Check if any ship sinks and update l, r, and ans.

3. After the loop, if l == r and k > 0, check if the remaining attack can sink the last ship.

- If k >= a[l], then ans += 1.

Finally, output ans.

Let me test this logic with the example provided:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1: l=0, r=3

mi = min(1,3) = 1

1*2 = 2 <= 5, so perform 1 pair:

a[l] = 1 - 1 = 0, a[r] = 3 - 1 = 2

k = 5 - 2 = 3

a = [0,2,4,2]

ans +=1, l +=1 -> l=1, r=3

Step 2: l=1, r=3

mi = min(2,2) = 2

2*2 = 4 <= 3? No.

So, perform k//2 = 1 pair:

a[l] -=1, a[r] -=1 -> a[l]=1, a[r]=1

k = 5 - 2*1 = 3 - 2 =1

t = k % 2 =1

So, perform 1 more attack on a[l]:

a[l] -=1 -> a[l]=0

Check if a[l]=0, ans +=1, l +=1 -> l=2, r=3

Step 3: l=2, r=3

mi = min(4,1) =1

1*2=2 <=1? No.

perform k//2=0 pairs, t=k%2=1

So, perform 1 attack on a[l]:

a[l] -=1 -> a[l]=4-1=3

k=1-1=0

No ship sank, so ans remains 2.

Output: 2

Which matches the first example.

Let's check another example:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Following similar steps:

Step 1: l=0, r=3

mi=1, 1*2=2 <=6, so perform 1 pair:

a[l]=0, a[r]=2

k=6-2=4

ans +=1, l=1, r=3

Step 2: l=1, r=3

mi=min(2,2)=2, 2*2=4 <=4, so perform 2 pairs:

a[l]=0, a[r]=0

k=4-4=0

ans +=2, l=2, r=2

But l < r is False, so stop.

Total ans=3, which matches the second example.

Another example:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Step 1: l=0, r=4

mi=min(2,2)=2, 2*2=4 <=20, perform 2 pairs:

a[l]=0, a[r]=0

k=20-4=16

ans +=2, l=1, r=3

Step 2: l=1, r=3

mi=min(7,8)=7, 7*2=14 <=16, perform 7 pairs:

a[l]=0, a[r]=1

k=16-14=2

ans +=1, l=2, r=3

Step 3: l=2, r=3

mi=min(1,1)=1, 1*2=2 <=2, perform 1 pair:

a[l]=0, a[r]=0

k=2-2=0

ans +=2, l=3, r=2

Now l > r, stop.

Total ans=5, matches the third example.

Seems correct.

Now, for the implementation, I need to handle the cases where l < r and k >0.

I need to be careful with the updates of l and r after a ship sinks.

Also, when l == r, and k >0, need to check if k >= a[l], then ans +=1.

Edge cases to consider:

- All ships are sunk before k attacks are done.

- Not all ships are sunk, but k attacks are used up.

- Only one ship left, and k is just enough to sink it.

- Ships have varying durability, including ships with durability 1.

I need to make sure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over t is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient implementation, O(n) per test case.

Let's look at the provided program and see if it matches this logic.

The program is:

def func():

T = int(input())

while T:

T -= 1

(n, k) = input().split()

n = int(n)

k = int(k)

a = input().split()

a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))

l = 0

r = n - 1

ans = 0

while l < r and k > 0:

mi = min(a[l], a[r])

if mi * 2 <= k:

a[l] -= mi

a[r] -= mi

k -= mi * 2

if a[l] == 0:

ans += 1

l += 1

if a[r] == 0:

ans += 1

r -= 1

else:

t = k % 2

if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:

ans += 1

break

if l == r:

ans += k >= a[l]

print(ans)

This seems to follow the logic I outlined.

It groups the attacks in pairs and processes them in batches, reducing the durability of the first and last ships by the minimum durability.

If mi * 2 <= k, it performs mi pairs of attacks, reducing both a[l] and a[r] by mi, and updates k accordingly.

If a[l] or a[r] becomes 0, it increments ans and moves l or r accordingly.

If mi * 2 > k, it performs k//2 pairs and handles the remaining k%2 attack on the first ship.

Then, if l == r, it checks if the remaining k is enough to sink the last ship.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with an example where k is odd.

Suppose n=2, k=1, a=[1,1]

Step 1: l=0, r=1

mi=min(1,1)=1

1*2=2 >1, so perform k//2=0 pairs, t=1%2=1

Perform 1 attack on a[l]:

a[l]=1-1=0

k=1-1=0

ans +=1, l=1, r=1

Now l == r, and k=0, so no more attacks.

Total ans=1, which is correct (only one ship is sunk).

Another test case:

n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

Step 1: l=0, r=1

mi=min(3,2)=2

2*2=4 >2, so perform k//2=1 pair:

a[l]-=1, a[r]-=1 -> a=[2,1]

k=2-2=0

No ship sank, ans=0

Output: 0, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2, k=15, a=[1,5]

Step 1: l=0, r=1

mi=min(1,5)=1

1*2=2 <=15, perform 1 pair:

a[l]=0, a[r]=4

k=15-2=13

ans +=1, l=1, r=1

Now l == r, check if 13 >=4, yes, ans +=1

Total ans=2, which is correct.

Seems the program handles various cases correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
