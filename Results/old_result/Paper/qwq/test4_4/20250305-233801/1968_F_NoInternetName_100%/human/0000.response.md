Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a subarray from index l to r is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what XOR means. XOR, or exclusive or, is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays, specifically whether a subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR values. The key here is to find if there's a way to divide the subarray into at least two contiguous segments where each segment's XOR is the same.

I recall that for XOR, there are some properties that might be useful. One important property is that the XOR of a subarray from index i to j can be calculated using the prefix XOR array. If I have a prefix XOR array where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i, then the XOR of elements from i to j is prefix[j] XOR prefix[i-1].

So, maybe I can precompute the prefix XOR array for the given array a. Let's denote this as x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

Now, for a subarray from l to r, its XOR would be x[r] XOR x[l-1]. But in this problem, we need to check if this subarray can be divided into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Let me think about this. Suppose I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts where k > 1, and each part has the same XOR value.

Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as total_XOR = x[r] XOR x[l-1].

If I can find at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR up to that point is equal to total_XOR divided by k, but since XOR isn't directly divisible, I need to think differently.

Wait, actually, XOR doesn't have a straightforward division operation like addition. So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be divided into k parts with equal XOR, the XOR of each part must be equal to some value, say y, and the combined XOR of all parts should be equal to the XOR of the entire subarray.

But since XOR is associative and commutative, the combined XOR of all parts would just be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times). If k is even, this would be 0, and if k is odd, it would be y.

So, for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR of the subarray must satisfy:

- If k is even, total_XOR must be 0.

- If k is odd, total_XOR must be y, which is the XOR of each part.

But in our case, k can be any integer greater than 1.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let's consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, there must be at least two ways to split it into consecutive segments with equal XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for repeating XOR values in the subarray.

Wait, maybe I should look for points in the subarray where the cumulative XOR up to that point is equal to some value, and see if that value repeats.

Let me think about prefix XOR again. If I look at the prefix XOR from the start of the subarray to each position, and if any two positions have the same prefix XOR, that means the XOR of the elements between them is zero.

But in this problem, I need the XOR of each part to be equal, not necessarily zero.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Let's consider that for the subarray from l to r, I need to find at least one split point m where l <= m < r, such that the XOR from l to m is equal to the XOR from m+1 to r.

But actually, the problem says it should be divided into k > 1 parts with equal XOR, not just two parts.

So, maybe I need to generalize that.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR of the subarray must be divisible in some way.

But again, XOR doesn't directly support division.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the subarray from l to r, and compute its total XOR, say total_XOR.

Now, if I can find at least one way to split this subarray into two parts where the XOR of the first part is equal to the XOR of the second part, then it's interesting with k=2.

Similarly, for k=3, I need to split into three parts with equal XOR, and so on.

But checking for all possible k seems too time-consuming, especially since n and q can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that if the total_XOR is zero, then it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts with zero XOR each.

Wait, but the problem allows for any equal XOR value, not necessarily zero.

I need to think of a better way.

I recall that in XOR properties, if the XOR of a subarray is zero, then it can be split into parts with zero XOR.

But in this problem, the XOR of each part must be equal, not necessarily zero.

Hmm.

Maybe I can look at the differences in prefix XOR values.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

Then, the XOR of subarray from l to r is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

Now, suppose I want to split the subarray from l to r into k parts with equal XOR.

Let y be the XOR value of each part.

Then, the total XOR is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times).

As I mentioned earlier, if k is even, total_XOR = 0, and if k is odd, total_XOR = y.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, total_XOR should be 0 or y respectively.

But y is the XOR of each part, and each part's XOR must be equal to y.

Wait, maybe I can set y to be total_XOR divided by k, but again, XOR doesn't have division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times y appears in the XOR.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR y, the total XOR must be y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But in reality, the total XOR is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

So, for k even, x[r] XOR x[l-1] must be 0.

For k odd, x[r] XOR x[l-1] must be y.

But y is the XOR of each part, which is equal to the XOR of the first part.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that if the total XOR is zero, then it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Similarly, if the total XOR is non-zero, perhaps it can be split into an odd number of parts with that XOR.

But I need to confirm this.

Suppose the subarray from l to r has total XOR equal to zero.

Then, it's possible to split it into an even number of parts, each with XOR zero.

For example, split into two parts with XOR zero each.

Similarly, if the total XOR is non-zero, say y, then it's possible to split it into an odd number of parts, each with XOR y.

For instance, three parts with XOR y each, so total XOR is y XOR y XOR y = y.

Wait, but in this case, total XOR would be y, which matches the total XOR.

So, perhaps:

- If total_XOR == 0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with XOR 0 each.

- If total_XOR == y, then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts with XOR y each.

But the problem allows for any k > 1, so k can be even or odd.

Wait, but if total_XOR == 0, then k must be even, and each part has XOR 0.

If total_XOR == y, then k must be odd, and each part has XOR y.

But in the problem, k can be any integer greater than 1.

So, for total_XOR == 0, k can be any even integer.

For total_XOR == y, k can be any odd integer greater than 1.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think of an example.

Take the example from the problem:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Query: l=1, r=5

Subarray: [1,1,2,3,0]

Total XOR: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 is 0, 0 XOR 2 is 2, 2 XOR 3 is 1, 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, total_XOR = 1.

According to my earlier reasoning, since total_XOR == 1, it might be possible to split into an odd number of parts with XOR 1 each.

Indeed, as shown in the example, it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and 1 XOR 1 is 0, which is not equal to 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the example, it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and 1 == 1 == 2 XOR 3 XOR 0, which is 2 XOR 3 is 1, 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, each part has XOR 1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, since total_XOR is 1, and k=3 (which is odd), it should work.

Wait, but in this case, total_XOR is 1, and k=3, which is odd, and each part has XOR 1, matching total_XOR.

So, that seems consistent.

Another query from the example:

l=2, r=4

Subarray: [1,2,3]

Total XOR: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 2 is 3, 3 XOR 3 is 0.

total_XOR = 0.

According to my earlier reasoning, for total_XOR == 0, it's possible to split into even number of parts with XOR 0 each.

Indeed, in the explanation, it's split into [1,2] and [3], with XOR 3 and 3, which is not equal.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's [1,2],[3], but 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 is 3, so both parts have XOR 3.

But total_XOR is 0, which is different.

Wait, that doesn't match my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Let me think again.

If total_XOR is 0, and we split into k parts with equal XOR y, then y must satisfy that y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) equals total_XOR.

If k is even, then y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

If k is odd, it's y.

So, for total_XOR = 0, we can have:

- k even, y arbitrary, but in practice, y must be such that each part has XOR y, and y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) = 0.

- k odd, y must be equal to total_XOR, which is 0.

Wait, but in the second query of the example, total_XOR is 0, and it's split into two parts with y=3, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches total_XOR.

So, in this case, k=2 (even), and y=3.

But according to my earlier point, for k even and total_XOR=0, y can be any value such that y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

In this case, y=3, and since k=2, y XOR y = 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches total_XOR.

So, in this case, y can be any value, as long as k is even, and y XOR y ... XOR y = 0.

Wait, but in general, for k even, y can be any value, because y XOR y = 0, and 0 XOR 0 ... XOR 0 = 0.

But in practice, for the subarray to be split into k parts with each part having XOR y, we need to ensure that such a split is possible.

So, perhaps for total_XOR = 0, and k even, it's possible to split the subarray into k parts with any y such that y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

But in reality, y must be consistent across all parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times y appears in the XOR.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try another approach.

I recall that in XOR properties, if I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into parts with equal XOR, perhaps I can look for positions where the prefix XOR is equal to a certain value.

Let me define prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

Now, for a subarray from l to r, its total XOR is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

Now, suppose I want to split this subarray into k parts with equal XOR y.

Then, the total XOR should be y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

Wait, more precisely:

- If k is even, y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0, which should equal total_XOR, so total_XOR must be 0.

- If k is odd, y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = y, which should equal total_XOR.

So, for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR y:

- If k is even, total_XOR must be 0.

- If k is odd, total_XOR must be y.

Therefore, for a given subarray with total_XOR:

- If total_XOR == 0, then it can be split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If total_XOR == y, then it can be split into any odd number of parts with XOR y each.

But I need to confirm if such splits are actually possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the frequency of y in the prefix XOR array.

Let me consider that.

If I have total_XOR == 0, then I need to find if there are at least two positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR from the start of the subarray is equal.

Because that would mean that the XOR between those positions is zero.

But in this case, I need parts with equal XOR, not necessarily zero.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to track the occurrences of each prefix XOR value within the subarray.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a subarray from l to r, I can compute the prefix XOR values within this subarray.

Let me define local_prefix[i] = x[l-1] XOR x[i], for i from l-1 to r.

This gives the XOR from l to i.

Now, if I can find multiple i's where local_prefix[i] is equal, then that means the XOR from l to i is the same, which could be useful for splitting.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for repeated values in the local_prefix array.

If local_prefix[i] == local_prefix[j], then the XOR from i+1 to j is zero.

But in this problem, I need the XOR of each part to be equal to some y.

So, maybe I need to look for local_prefix[i] == y.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over possible y values, but that seems inefficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix y, and try to see if I can split the subarray into parts where each part has XOR y.

To do this efficiently, I might need to use the prefix XOR array.

Let me consider that.

Let's say I have the prefix XOR array x.

For a subarray from l to r, its total XOR is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

If I want to split this subarray into parts with XOR y, then the cumulative XOR should satisfy certain properties.

Wait, perhaps I can look for positions where the cumulative XOR from l is multiples of y.

But again, XOR doesn't directly support this.

Maybe I need to consider the difference in prefix XOR.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for the difference between prefix XOR values being equal to y.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first example:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

x = [0,1,0,2,3,1]

Subarray from l=1 to r=5: x[5] XOR x[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

We need to split it into parts with XOR y=1.

Possible splits:

- [1], [1,2,3,0]: 1 and 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 2 is 3, 3 XOR 3 is 0, 0 XOR 0 is 0 ≠ 1 → doesn't work.

- [1,1], [2,3,0]: 1 XOR 1 = 0 ≠ 1 → doesn't work.

- [1,1,2], [3,0]: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 0 XOR 2 = 2 ≠ 1 → doesn't work.

- [1,1,2,3], [0]: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 3 = 3 ≠ 1 → doesn't work.

Wait, but in the problem description, it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

So, how does that work?

Well, in this split, k=3 (odd), total_XOR =1, which matches y.

But according to my earlier logic, for k odd, total_XOR should be y, which it is.

But how to generalize this?

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR y, the following must hold:

- The total XOR is y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

- Additionally, there must be at least k-1 positions in the subarray where the cumulative XOR up to that position is equal to y.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

If I have k parts, there are k-1 split points.

At each split point, the cumulative XOR up to that point should be equal to y (if k is odd) or some multiple of y in terms of XOR.

But again, XOR doesn't have a direct concept of multiples.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the prefix XOR being equal to y at certain points.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, I can look at the prefix XOR from l to each position i in the subarray.

If I can find multiple positions where the prefix XOR from l equals y, then I can split at those positions.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

Define local_prefix[i] = x[i] XOR x[l-1], for i from l to r.

Then, local_prefix[i] is the XOR from l to i.

If I can find positions i1, i2, ..., ik such that local_prefix[i1] = y, local_prefix[i2] = y XOR y = 0, local_prefix[i3] = y, and so on, depending on k.

This seems too vague.

Let me try another approach.

I recall that in some XOR problems, using the property that if a XOR b = c XOR d, then a XOR c = b XOR d, which might help in finding equal XOR values.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Let me consider precomputing all possible subarray XORs for the array and see if that helps.

But with n up to 2e5 and q up to 2e5, that's not feasible directly.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me look back at the problem.

We need to check for each query whether the subarray from l to r can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

An efficient way would be to have a solution that works in O(1) or O(log n) per query.

Given that, perhaps I can precompute some data that allows quick queries.

Let me consider using the prefix XOR array and some data structure to query the frequency of certain XOR values in ranges.

Wait, perhaps I can store the positions where each prefix XOR value occurs and use that to answer queries.

Let me try to outline an algorithm.

1. Compute the prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

2. For each possible XOR value, store the positions where it occurs in a list.

3. For each query from l to r:

a. Compute total_XOR = x[r] XOR x[l-1].

b. If total_XOR == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with XOR 0 each. So, answer "Yes".

c. Else, check if there's at least one position m in the subarray (l <= m < r) such that the XOR from l to m is equal to total_XOR.

- If such a position exists, then the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR: from l to m and m+1 to r, each with XOR equal to total_XOR.

- Additionally, if there are multiple such positions, it might allow for more parts.

d. To check if such a position exists, look for positions in the subarray where local_prefix[m] = total_XOR.

- local_prefix[m] = x[m] XOR x[l-1]

- So, x[m] XOR x[l-1] = total_XOR

- But total_XOR = x[r] XOR x[l-1]

- Therefore, x[m] XOR x[l-1] = x[r] XOR x[l-1]

- Simplifying, x[m] = x[r]

- So, we need to find if there's any m in [l, r-1] where x[m] = x[r]

- Similarly, m should be less than r.

So, in summary, for each query:

- If total_XOR == 0, answer "Yes".

- Else, check if x[r] appears at least once in x[l:] and x[r] appears before r in the subarray.

Wait, more precisely:

- Check if there exists an m such that l <= m < r and x[m] == x[r]

- If such an m exists, then we can split the subarray into two parts: from l to m and m+1 to r, each with XOR equal to total_XOR.

- Additionally, if there are multiple such m's, we might be able to split into more parts.

- But for the problem, we only need to check if it's possible to split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, this seems like a feasible approach.

Let me verify this with the first example.

Example 1:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

x = [0,1,0,2,3,1]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5

total_XOR = x[5] XOR x[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

Check if x[5] = 1 appears in x[1:5], which is x[1]=1, x[2]=0, x[3]=2, x[4]=3

Yes, x[1]=1, which is l=1, m=1 < r=5

So, answer "Yes"

2. l=2, r=4

total_XOR = x[4] XOR x[1] = 3 XOR 1 = 2

Check if x[4]=3 appears in x[2:4], which is x[2]=0, x[3]=2

No, 3 does not appear in x[2:4]

But according to the problem, it's "Yes"

Wait, that's inconsistent with my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem's explanation, for l=2, r=4, subarray [1,2,3], it's split into [1,2],[3], with XOR 3 and 3, which matches total_XOR=2?

Wait, no.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 is 3, but total_XOR is 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated total_XOR.

Wait, a = [1,1,2,3,0]

x = [0,1,0,2,3,1]

l=2, r=4

total_XOR = x[4] XOR x[1] = 3 XOR 1 = 2

But in the explanation, it's split into [1,2],[3], with XOR 3 and 3, but 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 is 3, which matches y=3, but total_XOR is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if x[r] appears in
