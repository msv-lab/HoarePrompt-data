Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR is. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. Given a subarray from index l to r, I need to check if it can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment has the same XOR value.

I recall that for XOR, there are some properties that might be useful here. One important property is that the XOR of a subarray from index i to j can be calculated using the prefix XOR array. If I have a prefix XOR array where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i, then the XOR of elements from i to j is prefix[j] XOR prefix[i-1].

So, I can precompute the prefix XOR array for the given array a. Let's denote this as x, where x[0] = 0, x[1] = a[0], x[2] = a[0] XOR a[1], and so on, up to x[n] = x[n-1] XOR a[n-1].

Next, I need to check for each query (l, r) whether the subarray from l to r can be split into at least two consecutive segments with equal XOR.

Let me think about this. If I can split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR, that means the XOR of the first part is equal to the XOR of the second part. Given that the XOR of the entire subarray is x[r] XOR x[l-1], if I split it into two parts, say up to some index m, then the XOR of the first part is x[m] XOR x[l-1], and the XOR of the second part is x[r] XOR x[m]. So, for these to be equal:

x[m] XOR x[l-1] = x[r] XOR x[m]

Simplifying this, we get:

x[l-1] = x[r] XOR x[m] XOR x[m]

Since XOR is its own inverse, x[m] XOR x[m] is 0, so:

x[l-1] = x[r] XOR 0 => x[l-1] = x[r]

Wait, this suggests that if x[l-1] = x[r], then any split m where l <= m < r would satisfy the condition, because the XOR of both parts would be 0.

But that can't be right because if x[l-1] = x[r], then the entire subarray's XOR is 0, which means any split would have equal XOR only if the XOR of the entire subarray is 0.

But the problem allows splitting into more than two parts as well. So, if the entire subarray's XOR is 0, then it's possible to split it into two parts with equal XOR only if both parts have XOR 0. But in general, if the entire subarray's XOR is not zero, can it still be split into multiple parts with equal XOR?

I think I need to consider the frequency of the prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Let me consider the prefix XOR values from l-1 to r. If I have multiple indices with the same prefix XOR value, that might indicate possible splits.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose I have the prefix XOR array x. For the subarray from l to r, I need to find if there exists at least one way to split it into k > 1 parts such that each part has the same XOR value.

Let me denote the target XOR value as y. Then, for each part, its XOR should be y.

So, if I have parts p1, p2, ..., pk, then XOR of p1 is y, XOR of p2 is y, and so on, up to pk.

The XOR of the entire subarray would be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times).

If k is even, then y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

If k is odd, then it's y.

But in the problem, k can be any integer greater than 1.

So, for the subarray to be interesting, the XOR of the entire subarray should be either 0 (if k is even) or y (if k is odd).

But I need to ensure that such a y exists and that there are at least two parts.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this by looking for repeated prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Let me consider that the XOR of a subarray from i to j is x[j] XOR x[i-1].

If I have x[j] XOR x[i-1] = y for some y, and I need to split the subarray into multiple parts with the same y.

So, for the subarray from l to r, I need to find if there exists at least one m where l <= m < r such that x[m] XOR x[l-1] = y and x[r] XOR x[m] = y.

But y is the target XOR value for each part.

Wait, maybe I can fix y as the XOR of the entire subarray divided by k, but since XOR doesn't have a direct division operation, this might not be straightforward.

Perhaps another approach is needed.

I recall that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the prefix XOR values at the boundaries should differ by multiples of the target XOR y.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let's look at the example provided:

Array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5: subarray [1,1,2,3,0]

Possible split: [1], [1], [2,3,0]

Each part has XOR equal to 1.

Another split: [1,1], [2,3,0]

XOR of [1,1] is 0, which is not equal to 1.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that [1], [1], [2,3,0] is a valid split because 1 XOR 1 = 0, but 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, which is not equal to 1 XOR 1 = 0. Wait, that seems inconsistent with the initial description.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that y1 = y2 = ... = yk must be fulfilled, where yi is the XOR of each part.

In the example, [1], [1], [2,3,0] has y1=1, y2=1, y3=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1, so y1=y2=y3=1, which satisfies the condition.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, if the entire subarray's XOR is y XOR y XOR y, which for k=3 would be y XOR y XOR y = y (since y XOR y = 0, and 0 XOR y = y). So, for the entire subarray's XOR to be y, and for k to be odd, or 0 for even k.

But in this case, k=3, so the entire subarray's XOR should be y, which is 1.

Wait, but in the example, the entire subarray's XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, which matches y=1.

Another split: [1,1], [2,3,0]

XOR of [1,1] is 0, XOR of [2,3,0] is 1, which are not equal.

So, this split is invalid.

Hence, there exists at least one valid split, so the answer is YES.

Another query: l=2, r=4: subarray [1,2,3]

Possible split: [1,2], [3]

XOR of [1,2] is 1 XOR 2 = 3, XOR of [3] is 3, which are equal.

Hence, YES.

Next query: l=3, r=5: [2,3,0]

Possible splits:

[2], [3,0] -> XOR: 2 and 3 XOR 0 = 3, not equal.

[2,3], [0] -> XOR: 2 XOR 3 = 1 and 0, not equal.

[2], [3], [0] -> XOR: 2, 3, 0, which are not all equal.

Hence, NO.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's NO.

So, seems like my reasoning is aligning with the example.

Now, how to generalize this for any subarray efficiently, especially considering the constraints (n and q up to 2e5)?

I need an efficient way to handle multiple queries on different subarrays.

Let's think about the prefix XOR approach.

Compute prefix XOR array x, where x[i] is the XOR of the first i elements.

Then, the XOR of subarray from l to r is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

Now, for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR, let's denote the target XOR value as y.

Then, the XOR of the entire subarray should be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times).

If k is even, this is 0.

If k is odd, this is y.

So, depending on k being even or odd, the total XOR is different.

But k > 1.

So, for k even, total XOR should be 0.

For k odd, total XOR should be y.

But y is the XOR of each part.

Wait, but y is unknown.

Wait, perhaps I can fix y and see if there exists a k > 1 that satisfies the condition.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the subarray from l to r.

I need to find if there exists at least one way to split it into k > 1 parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me consider that all parts have the same XOR value, say y.

Then, the total XOR of the subarray is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y.

Which is 0 if k is even, and y if k is odd.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the total XOR is either 0 or y.

But I don't know k in advance.

Wait, but k can be any integer greater than 1, as long as the splits are possible.

So, perhaps I need to consider both cases.

Case 1: k is even, total XOR is 0.

Case 2: k is odd, total XOR is y.

But y is the XOR of each part.

Wait, but y is also equal to the XOR of the entire subarray if k is odd.

So, if k is odd, total XOR is y, which is also the XOR of the entire subarray.

Hence, y = total XOR.

If k is even, total XOR is 0, so y can be any value such that y XOR y = 0, which is always true.

Wait, but k is at least 2.

So, for k even, total XOR must be 0.

For k odd, total XOR must be y.

But y must be equal to the XOR of each part.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that for a subarray to be split into multiple parts with equal XOR, the prefix XOR values at the split points must be equal.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have the prefix XOR array x.

I need to split the subarray from l to r into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me denote the split points as l-1 = p0 < p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r.

Then, the XOR of the first part is x[p1] XOR x[p0], the second part is x[p2] XOR x[p1], and so on, up to x[r] XOR x[pk-1].

I need all these to be equal.

So, x[p1] XOR x[p0] = x[p2] XOR x[p1] = ... = x[r] XOR x[pk-1].

Let me denote s = x[p0].

Then, x[p1] XOR s = x[p2] XOR x[p1] = ... = x[r] XOR x[pk-1].

Let me denote y = this common value.

Then, x[p1] = s XOR y.

x[p2] = x[p1] XOR y = (s XOR y) XOR y = s.

x[p3] = s XOR y.

And so on.

So, the prefix XOR values at the split points alternate between s and s XOR y.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps another way: for the XOR of each part to be y, then between split points, the prefix XOR should increase by y each time.

Wait, not sure.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I found that in some problems involving splitting arrays into parts with equal sum or other properties, prefix sums or prefix XORs are used to find the positions where splits can occur.

Maybe I can store the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value and look for multiple occurrences within the subarray.

Wait, perhaps I can group the prefix XOR values within the subarray and see if any value repeats, which would indicate that the XOR between those positions is zero, which might help in splitting.

But I need the XOR of each part to be equal to some y, not necessarily zero.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR y, then the total XOR of the subarray is k*y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

Wait, no.

Actually, since XOR is associative and commutative, the total XOR is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y, which is y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the total XOR is 0 or y.

Hence, for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR y, the total XOR must be y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But k can be any integer greater than 1.

So, for a given subarray, I need to check if there exists a y and k > 1 such that the total XOR equals y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

This seems too vague to implement efficiently.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: k=2.

Then, to split into two parts with equal XOR, the total XOR must be 0.

Because y XOR y = 0.

Case 2: k=3.

Then, total XOR must be y.

Case 3: k=4.

Total XOR must be 0.

And so on.

So, for even k, total XOR must be 0.

For odd k, total XOR must be y.

But y is the XOR of each part.

Wait, but y is also equal to the XOR of the entire subarray when k is odd.

This seems confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix y as the XOR of the entire subarray divided by k, but since XOR doesn't have division, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for repeated prefix XOR values within the subarray, which would indicate that the XOR between those positions is zero.

But I need the XOR of each part to be equal to some y, not necessarily zero.

Wait, maybe I can look for the difference between prefix XOR values.

Let me consider that if I have two positions with the same prefix XOR, then the XOR between those positions is zero.

But I need the XOR between positions to be equal to y, where y is the same for all parts.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to check if a subarray has a certain property, we can look for the frequency of prefix sums or prefix XORs.

In this case, perhaps I can store the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value and see if there are multiple positions within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR.

But again, I need the XOR of each part to be equal, not necessarily zero.

Wait, perhaps I can fix y and see if there are enough positions with prefix XOR equal to x[l-1] XOR y within the subarray.

But y is unknown, so that might not help directly.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR y, then the prefix XOR at the split points should follow a certain pattern.

Specifically, if I have split points at positions p1, p2, ..., pk-1, then x[p1] XOR x[l-1] = y, x[p2] XOR x[p1] = y, and so on, up to x[r] XOR x[pk-1] = y.

So, x[p1] = x[l-1] XOR y, x[p2] = x[p1] XOR y = x[l-1], x[p3] = x[p2] XOR y = x[l-1] XOR y, and so on.

This alternation between x[l-1] and x[l-1] XOR y.

So, the split points must have prefix XOR values alternating between x[l-1] and x[l-1] XOR y.

But y is unknown.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the split points must have prefix XOR values that are either x[l-1] or x[l-1] XOR y.

If I can find at least two split points within the subarray that have prefix XOR values equal to x[l-1] or x[l-1] XOR y, then it's possible to split the subarray into at least two parts with equal XOR.

But I still don't know y.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that if the total XOR of the subarray is zero, then it's possible to split it into two parts with equal XOR only if there exists a split point where the XOR of the first part is zero, and hence the second part also has XOR zero.

But that only works for k=2.

Wait, for k=2, if the total XOR is zero, then splitting into two parts with equal XOR is possible only if both parts have XOR zero.

But in general, for k > 2, it's more complicated.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the difference between the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value must be considered.

Wait, perhaps I can group the prefix XOR values within the subarray and see if there are multiple groups with the same value.

But again, I need to ensure that the XOR of each part is equal.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I found that in some problems, using the frequency of prefix sums or prefix XORs can help determine if a subarray has a certain property.

In this case, perhaps I can store the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray and look for patterns that indicate the possibility of splitting into multiple parts with equal XOR.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me try to think about necessary and sufficient conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

First, if the total XOR of the subarray is zero, then it's possible to split it into two parts with equal XOR only if both parts have XOR zero.

But in general, for k > 1, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if the total XOR is zero, then it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

And if the total XOR is y, then it's possible to split it into an odd number of parts, each with XOR y.

But determining this efficiently is challenging.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the prefix XOR values at the split points must follow a specific pattern based on the target XOR y.

But without knowing y, this seems difficult to implement efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over possible y values, but with y potentially up to 2^30 - 1, that's not efficient.

This seems inefficient for the given constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me look at the provided code and see how it approaches the problem.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n (number of elements) and q (number of queries).

- Then, it reads the array a of n integers.

- It computes the prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

- It also creates a dictionary inds, where inds[val] is a list of indices where x[i] == val.

- For each query (l, r), it checks:

- If x[l-1] == x[r], it prints 'Yes'.

- Else, it finds:

- lower: the highest index less than l where x[i] == x[r].

- upper: the lowest index greater than or equal to l where x[i] == x[l-1].

- If upper > lower, it prints 'Yes'; else, 'No'.

Wait, this seems efficient, as it uses precomputed prefix XORs and binary search to find the required indices.

Let me understand why this works.

First, if x[l-1] == x[r], then the XOR of the subarray from l to r is x[r] XOR x[l-1] = 0.

In this case, it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Hence, it prints 'Yes'.

Otherwise, it looks for indices within the subarray where x[i] == x[r] and x[j] == x[l-1], with i < j.

If such indices exist, it means there are points where the prefix XOR equals x[r] and x[l-1], which can be used to create splits with equal XOR.

Wait, but I need to understand this better.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, I need to find split points where the XOR from l-1 to the split point is equal to the target XOR y, and from there to the next split point is also y, and so on.

By having inds[x[r]], I can find indices where the prefix XOR equals x[r], which might indicate possible split points.

Similarly, inds[x[l-1]] can indicate other split points.

But I need to ensure that these split points are in the correct order and that the XOR between them is equal.

The code seems to find if there is at least one index where x[i] == x[r] between l and r, and at least one index where x[j] == x[l-1] between l and r, with i < j.

If such indices exist, it suggests that there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

Hence, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This seems like a efficient way to handle the queries.

Let me verify this with the example.

Example 1:

n=5, q=5

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

x = [0,1,0,2,1,0]

inds[0] = [0,2,5]

inds[1] = [1,4]

inds[2] = [3]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5: x[0]=0, x[5]=0, so x[l-1]==x[r], hence 'Yes'.

2. l=2, r=4: x[1]=0, x[4]=1, so x[l-1]!=x[r].

   Look for an index in inds[x[r]]=inds[1]=[1,4] where index < l=2: inds[1][0]=1 < 2.

   Look for an index in inds[x[l-1]]=inds[0]=[0,2,5] where index >=l=2: inds[0][1]=2 >=2.

   Since 2 > 1, print 'Yes'.

3. l=3, r=5: x[2]=0, x[5]=0, so x[l-1]==x[r], hence 'Yes'.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says 'NO' for this query.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the output, for the first test case, it's:

YES

YES

NO

NO

NO

But according to my earlier calculation, for l=3, r=5, x[2]=0, x[5]=0, so x[l-1]==x[r], hence 'Yes'.

But in the explanation, it's 'NO'.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the code, it has:

if x[l - 1] == x[r
