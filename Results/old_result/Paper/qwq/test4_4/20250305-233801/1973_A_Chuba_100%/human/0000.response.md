Alright, I've got this problem here about three friends playing chess, and I need to figure out the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on their final scores. The scores are p1, p2, and p3, and they're sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to understand how the scoring works. In each game, two players play against each other. If one wins, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0. If it's a draw, both players get 1 point each. Also, the same pair can play multiple times, and it's possible that no games were played at all.

So, the total points distributed in each game are either 2 (in case of a win and loss) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, in both cases, it's 2 points per game. That's interesting. So, regardless of whether it's a win-lose or a draw, each game contributes 2 points to the total points sum.

Given that, the total points sum is p1 + p2 + p3, and since each game contributes 2 points, the total number of games played should be (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2. But, since the number of games has to be an integer, (p1 + p2 + p3) must be even; otherwise, it's impossible, and we should return -1.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

- For 0 0 0, output is 0, which makes sense because no games were played.

- For 0 1 1, output is 1, meaning one draw occurred.

- For 0 1 1, if they played one game between player 2 and 3, and it was a draw, both get 1 point, and player 1 has 0 points. That matches.

- For 1 1 1, output is -1. So, it's impossible to have each player with 1 point.

Let me see why. If each player has 1 point, the total points sum is 3, which is odd. So, (p1 + p2 + p3) is 3, which is not divisible by 2. Hence, it's impossible, and we should return -1. That checks out.

Next, 1 1 2. Total points sum is 4, which is even. So, number of games is 4 / 2 = 2. Now, we need to maximize the number of draws.

Let's think about how to maximize draws. Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a win and loss. But, in draws, both players get 1 point each, whereas in a win and loss, one gets 2 and the other gets 0.

To maximize draws, we should have as many draws as possible. However, we need to satisfy the individual scores.

Let me consider that.

Let's denote:

- Let’s call the players A, B, and C, with scores p1, p2, p3 respectively, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

- We need to maximize the number of draws.

- Each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point.

- Each win/loss involves two players, with one getting 2 points and the other 0.

- We need to reach the total scores p1, p2, p3.

First, check if the total points sum is even. If not, return -1.

Then, we need to find a combination of draws and win/loss games that result in the given scores.

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws.

Let’s think about it in terms of the total points and how draws and win/loss games contribute to the scores.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum (1 point to each player involved in the draw).

Each win/loss game also contributes 2 points to the total sum (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

So, the total number of games is (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of win/loss games.

However, we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with some combination of draws and win/loss games.

Let’s consider that in some games, certain pairs play against each other.

We have three pairs: A vs B, A vs C, and B vs C.

Each pair can play multiple games, which can be either draws or win/loss games.

Our aim is to maximize the number of draws across all these games.

But it's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think in terms of the individual scores.

Suppose we have t games in total, where t = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, let d be the number of draws, and w be the number of win/loss games.

Then, d + w = t.

Now, in each draw, two players each get 1 point, so total points from draws are 2d.

In each win/loss game, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0, so total points from win/loss games are 2w.

Therefore, the total points sum is 2d + 2w = 2t, which matches p1 + p2 + p3.

But we need to maximize d, the number of draws.

However, we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with d draws and w win/loss games.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can look at the minimal number of win/loss games needed to achieve the scores, and the rest can be draws.

Wait, that might work.

If I can minimize the number of win/loss games, then the remaining games can be draws, maximizing d.

So, how do I minimize the number of win/loss games?

Win/loss games allow for transferring 2 points from one player to another.

Wait, no. In a win/loss game, one player gains 2 points, and the other loses 0.

Wait, actually, it's that one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

So, in terms of point differences, a win/loss game can increase the difference between two players by 2 points (if the higher-scoring player wins) or decrease it by 2 points (if the lower-scoring player wins).

But I need to make sure that the differences between the players' scores can be achieved through these games.

Let me consider the differences between the players' scores.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the differences are p2 - p1 and p3 - p2 and p3 - p1.

I need to see if these differences can be achieved through the win/loss games.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of win/loss games required to achieve the score differences.

Wait, maybe I can think about the maximal number of draws as being equal to the total number of games minus the minimal number of win/loss games needed to achieve the score differences.

So, I need to find the minimal number of win/loss games needed to achieve the score differences.

Then, the maximal number of draws would be the total number of games minus that minimal number.

But how do I find the minimal number of win/loss games needed?

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have p1, p2, p3 with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

I need to distribute the points such that the differences between the scores can be explained by the win/loss games.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the sum and the maximum score.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula:

max(0, p3 - p1 - p2) to determine the minimal number of win/loss games needed.

Wait, not sure.

Let me look at the sample inputs.

In the second sample input: 0 1 1

Total points sum is 2, so total games is 1.

To achieve scores 0,1,1, it must be a draw between player 2 and 3, and player 1 didn't play any game.

Hence, number of draws is 1.

In the third sample input: 1 1 1

Total points sum is 3, which is odd, so it's impossible.

In the fourth sample input: 1 1 2

Total points sum is 4, so total games is 2.

To achieve scores 1,1,2, we can have:

- Game 1: Player 1 and Player 2 draw, so both get 1 point.

- Game 2: Player 1 and Player 3 have a win/loss game, where Player 3 wins.

So, Player 1: 1 (from draw) + 0 (from loss) = 1

Player 2: 1 (from draw) + 0 (didn't play) = 1

Player 3: 0 (didn't play) + 2 (from win) = 2

This achieves the scores 1,1,2 with one draw.

But according to the sample output, the maximum number of draws is 2.

Wait, but in this case, only one draw was used.

Wait, maybe there's another way.

Let me think.

If we have two games:

- Game 1: Player 2 and Player 3 draw. So, Player 2: 1, Player 3: 1.

- Game 2: Player 1 and Player 2 draw. So, Player 1: 1, Player 2: 2.

But then Player 3 has only 1 point, which matches p3=2? No, p3=2, but in this scenario, Player 3 has only 1 point.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively:

- Game 1: Player 1 and Player 3 draw. Player 1:1, Player 3:1.

- Game 2: Player 2 and Player 3 draw. Player 2:1, Player 3:2.

This achieves exactly the required scores with two draws.

Perfect, so the maximum number of draws is 2.

Hence, in this case, it's possible to have two draws to achieve the scores 1,1,2.

That's better.

So, in this case, with total games = 2, and both games are draws, achieving the scores.

Wait, but in the previous attempt, having two draws achieved the required scores.

So, the maximum number of draws is 2.

Got it.

Now, looking at the sample input 5: 3 3 3

Total points sum is 9, which is odd, so it's impossible, output -1.

Sample input 6: 3 4 5

Total points sum is 12, so total games is 6.

Now, we need to maximize the number of draws.

So, total draws can be up to 6, but does that satisfy the scores?

If all 6 games are draws, then each player would have 2 points (since each draw gives 1 point to each player involved). But we have p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which doesn't match.

So, not all games can be draws.

We need to find a combination where some games are draws and some are win/loss to achieve the required scores.

To maximize draws, we should minimize the number of win/loss games.

So, let's see.

Let’s assume d is the number of draws, and w is the number of win/loss games.

Then, d + w = 6.

Total points from draws: 2d.

Total points from win/loss games: 2w.

But in win/loss games, the points are distributed as 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser.

So, in win/loss games, the difference in points between players can increase or decrease depending on who wins.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let’s consider that in order to achieve the scores p1, p2, p3, the differences between them must be achievable through the win/loss games.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

Maximum number of draws is (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(p3 - p1 - p2, 0)) / 2

Wait, in the code provided, it's:

result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2

And in the sample input 6: 3 4 5

So, v = [3,4,5]

max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = max(0, -2) = 0

So, result = (3 + 4 + 5 - 0) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6

But in the sample output, it's 6, which matches.

In sample input 4: 1 1 2

v = [1,1,2]

max(0, 2 - 1 -1) = max(0,0) = 0

result = (1+1+2 -0)//2 = 4//2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 3: 1 1 1

v = [1,1,1]

max(0,1-1-1)=max(0,-1)=0

result=(1+1+1-0)//2=3//2=1, but sample output is -1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible.

Wait, in sample input 3, p3=1, p1=1, p2=1, so p3 =1 ≤ p1 + p2 =2, so max(0,1-1-1)=0, result=3//2=1, but sample output is -1.

Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps there's another condition.

Looking back at sample input 1: 0 0 0

Total sum 0, which is even, result=(0-0)=0, which matches output 0.

Sample input 2: 0 1 1

result=(0+1+1 - max(0,1-0-1))//2=(2 - max(0,0))//2=2//2=1, which matches output 1.

Sample input 3:1 1 1

result=(1+1+1 - max(0,1-1-1))//2=(3 - max(0,-1))//2=(3-0)=3//2=1, but sample output is -1.

So, in this case, the formula gives 1, but the correct output is -1.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition that needs to be checked.

Looking back at the problem, it says that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and it's guaranteed that they are sorted.

So, perhaps, in addition to the total sum being even, there's a condition on the individual scores.

Perhaps, p3 ≤ p1 + p2.

In sample input 3: p3=1, p1=1, p2=1, 1 ≤ 1 +1=2, which holds, but it's still impossible.

Wait, but in sample input 4:1 1 2, p3=2 ≤ p1 + p2=1+1=2, and it's possible with 2 draws.

Wait, but in sample input 3:1 1 1, p3=1 ≤ p1 + p2=1+1=2, but it's impossible.

So, perhaps, in addition to p3 ≤ p1 + p2, we need to ensure that the sum is even, and also that the minimal number of win/loss games is less than or equal to the total games.

Wait, perhaps the formula provided in the code is correct, but we need to check if the result is less than or equal to the total number of games.

Wait, in sample input 3: result=1, but it's impossible, so maybe there's another condition.

Wait, perhaps we need to ensure that p1, p2, p3 are such that p1 + p2 >= p3, and also that p1 + p2 + p3 is even.

But in sample input 3: p1 + p2 =1+1=2 >= p3=1, and sum is 3, which is odd, but sum should be even, but in the code, it's checking if sum is even, and if not, output -1.

Wait, but in sample input 3, sum is 3, which is odd, so it should output -1, which matches.

Wait, but according to the code, it first checks if sum is odd, if so, output -1.

Else, compute the result as (p1+p2+p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

In sample input 3, sum is odd, so it should output -1, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the formula gives 1, but since sum is odd, it outputs -1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

v = list(map(int, input().split()))

if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:

print('-1')

else:

result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2

print(result)

So, in sample input 3:1 1 1, sum is 3, which is odd, so it outputs -1, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 4:1 1 2, sum is 4, which is even, so it computes result=(1+1+2 - max(0,2-1-1))//2=(4 - 0)=4//2=2, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 6:3 4 5, sum is 12, even, result=(3+4+5 - max(0,5-3-4))//2=(12 - max(0,-2))//2=(12-0)=12//2=6, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 7:1 1 10, sum is 12, even, result=(1+1+10 - max(0,10-1-1))//2=(12 - max(0,8))//2=(12-8)=4//2=2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in sample input 7:1 1 10, output is 2.

Is that possible?

Let me see.

Total games is 6.

If we have 2 draws and 4 win/loss games.

But how can player 3 have 10 points?

Wait, in total, with 6 games, each game contributes 2 points, so total points sum is 12.

Player 1 has 1, player 2 has 1, player 3 has 10.

So, is this achievable?

Let me try to see.

If player 1 and player 3 play a game and player 3 wins: player 3 gets 2, player 1 gets 0.

If they play multiple times:

- Suppose player 1 and player 3 play 5 games, player 3 wins all: player 3 gets 10 points, player 1 gets 0.

- Then, player 2 and player 3 play one game, draw: player 2 gets 1, player 3 gets 1.

Total points:

Player 1: 0 (from 5 losses) + 0 (didn't play) = 0 ≠1

Wait, but player 1 needs 1 point.

Wait, maybe adjust.

- Player 1 and player 3 play 4 games, player 3 wins all: player 3 gets 8 points, player 1 gets 0.

- Player 2 and player 3 play one game, player 3 wins: player 3 gets 2 more points (total 10), player 2 gets 0.

- Player 1 and player 2 play one game, draw: player 1 gets 1, player 2 gets 1.

Total points:

Player 1: 0 (from 4 losses) + 1 (from draw) =1

Player 2: 0 (from loss to player 3) +1 (from draw with player 1)=1

Player 3: 8 (from wins vs player 1) +2 (from win vs player 2)=10

So, total points sum is 12, with one draw.

But according to the code, it outputs 2.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to achieve it with two draws.

Let's try:

- Player 1 and player 2 play two games, both draws: player 1 gets 2, player 2 gets 2.

- Player 1 and player 3 play two games, player 3 wins both: player 1 gets 0, player 3 gets 4.

- Player 2 and player 3 play two games, player 3 wins both: player 2 gets 0, player 3 gets 4.

Total points:

Player 1: 2 (from draws with player 2) + 0 (from losses to player 3)=2 ≠1

Not matching.

Wait, doesn't match p1=1.

Another attempt:

- Player 1 and player 3 play one game, player 3 wins: player 3 gets 2, player 1 gets 0.

- Player 2 and player 3 play one game, player 3 wins: player 3 gets 4, player 2 gets 0.

- Player 1 and player 2 play one game, draw: player 1 gets 1, player 2 gets 1.

- Player 1 and player 3 play one game, player 3 wins: player 3 gets 6, player 1 gets 0.

- Player 2 and player 3 play one game, player 3 wins: player 3 gets 8, player 2 gets 0.

- Player 1 and player 2 play one game, draw: player 1 gets 1, player 2 gets 1.

Total points:

Player 1: 0 (from losses to player 3) +1 (from draw with player 2) +1 (from draw with player 2)=2 ≠1

Not matching.

Another attempt:

- Player 1 and player 3 play three games, player 3 wins all: player 3 gets 6, player 1 gets 0.

- Player 2 and player 3 play three games, player 3 wins two and draws one: player 3 gets 6 +1=7, player 2 gets 0 +1=1.

- Wait, not matching p3=10.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps the code's formula is correct, and I'm just not understanding it fully.

Looking back at the formula:

result = (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2

In sample input 7:1 1 10

result = (1+1+10 - max(0,10-1-1))//2 = (12 - 8)//2 =4//2=2, which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be correct.

In cases where it's possible, it calculates the maximum number of draws correctly, and in impossible cases, it outputs -1.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
