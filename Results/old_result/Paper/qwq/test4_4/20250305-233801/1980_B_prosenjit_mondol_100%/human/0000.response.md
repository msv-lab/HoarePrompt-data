Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order relative to each other.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

The problem asks to output "YES" if the favorite cube will be removed in all possible cases, "NO" if it won't be removed in any case, or "MAYBE" if it could go either way.

First, I need to understand what determines whether the favorite cube is removed or not.

Since the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the position of the favorite cube after sorting depends on its value compared to others.

If its value is higher than the k-th cube in the sorted list, it might be among the first k removed. If its value is lower, it probably won't be in the first k.

But there's a catch: when there are ties, the order of cubes with the same value is arbitrary.

So, I need to consider the best and worst cases for the favorite cube.

Let me think about the extreme cases:

1. If the favorite cube's value is higher than the k-th cube's value in the sorted list, then it will always be in the first k and removed.

2. If its value is lower than the k-th cube's value, it will never be in the first k and thus not removed.

3. If its value is equal to the k-th cube's value, then it depends on its position relative to other cubes with the same value.

In the third case, since ties can be in any order, the favorite cube might be among the first k or not, depending on how the ties are ordered.

So, in this case, the answer should be "MAYBE".

Wait, but I need to be careful. If after sorting, the k-th position has a value equal to the favorite cube's value, and there are multiple cubes with that value, then whether the favorite cube is among the first k depends on its initial position and how the ties are broken.

But in the problem, it's said that after sorting, if two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order. So, for the purpose of determining "MAYBE", I need to check if, given the ties, the favorite cube could end up in the first k or not.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the array a in non-increasing order. Let's call this sorted array b.

If b[k] > x, where x is the value of the favorite cube, then x cannot be in the first k, so "NO".

If b[k] < x, then x will be in the first k, so "YES".

If b[k] == x, then it depends on the number of cubes with value x and the value of k.

I need to see how many cubes have value >= x.

Let's count the number of cubes with value > x and with value == x.

Let's say:

- num_greater = number of cubes with value > x

- num_equal = number of cubes with value == x

If num_greater + num_equal < k, then the favorite cube will always be among the first k, so "YES".

Wait, no. If num_greater + num_equal <= k, then the favorite cube will be among the first k, because even if all num_equal are after the first k, but since num_greater + num_equal <= k, the favorite cube would still be in the first k.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have num_greater cubes with value > x, and num_equal cubes with value == x.

After sorting, the first num_greater cubes have value > x, and the next num_equal cubes have value == x.

Now, if k <= num_greater, then the favorite cube, having value x, is not among the first k, because the first k have value > x.

Wait, no. The first num_greater have value > x, so if k <= num_greater, the first k are all > x, so the favorite cube is not removed.

Wait, but the favorite cube has value x, which is less than these num_greater cubes, so it's not in the first k.

But the problem is about removing the first k cubes, which are the largest.

So, if k <= num_greater, then the first k cubes are all > x, so the favorite cube is not among them, hence not removed.

If k > num_greater, then some cubes with value == x are in the first k.

Specifically, the number of cubes with value >= x is num_greater + num_equal.

So, if k <= num_greater, then favorite cube is not removed.

If k > num_greater, then some cubes with value == x are removed.

But since there are num_equal cubes with value == x, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not, depending on its initial position.

Wait, no. Since the sorting is non-increasing, and cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not, depending on how the ties are broken.

So, to summarize:

- If k < num_greater, favorite cube is not removed.

- If k > num_greater + num_equal - 1, favorite cube is removed.

- If num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal - 1, then it's "MAYBE".

Wait, I need to think carefully.

Let me define:

- num_greater: number of cubes with value > x

- num_equal: number of cubes with value == x

- total_cubes = num_greater + num_equal + num_less

Where num_less is the number of cubes with value < x.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the first num_greater cubes have value > x, then the next num_equal cubes have value == x, and the last num_less have value < x.

Now, if k <= num_greater, then only cubes with value > x are removed, so favorite cube is not removed.

If k > num_greater, then some cubes with value == x are removed.

Specifically, the number of cubes with value >= x is num_greater + num_equal.

So, if k <= num_greater, favorite cube is not removed.

If k >= num_greater + 1, then some cubes with value == x are removed.

But since there are num_equal cubes with value == x, and they can be in any order among themselves, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not.

Wait, but I need to see if the favorite cube is removed in all possible cases, in any possible case, or in some cases.

The problem asks for "YES" if the favorite cube will be removed in all possible cases, "NO" if it won't be removed in any case, or "MAYBE" if it could go either way.

So, let's consider:

- If k <= num_greater, then in all possible cases, the favorite cube is not removed. So, "NO".

- If k > num_greater + num_equal, then in all possible cases, the favorite cube is removed. So, "YES".

- If num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal, then it depends on the order of the cubes with value == x. The favorite cube could be among the first k or not. So, "MAYBE".

Wait, but if k > num_greater + num_equal, then k exceeds the num_greater + num_equal, meaning that even if all num_equal are after the num_greater, k would still remove some cubes with value < x, but since the favorite cube has value x, it would be among the first num_greater + num_equal cubes, which are removed. So, "YES".

Wait, no. If k > num_greater + num_equal, then the first num_greater + num_equal cubes include all cubes with value >= x, so the favorite cube is definitely among the first num_greater + num_equal cubes, which are removed. So, "YES".

If k <= num_greater, then only cubes with value > x are removed, so the favorite cube is not removed. So, "NO".

If num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal, then some cubes with value == x are removed, but not all of them. So, depending on the order, the favorite cube might or might not be removed. So, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in this case, if k > num_greater, then some cubes with value == x are removed.

Specifically, the number of cubes with value == x that are removed is k - num_greater, if k <= num_greater + num_equal.

If k - num_greater < num_equal, then only some of the cubes with value == x are removed, so it depends on the position of the favorite cube among them.

If k - num_greater == num_equal, then all cubes with value == x are removed, so "YES".

Wait, no. If k - num_greater == num_equal, then all cubes with value == x are removed.

But in this case, since k - num_greater == num_equal, and these are the cubes with value == x, so all of them are removed.

Hence, "YES".

But earlier, I thought that if num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal, it's "MAYBE".

But actually, if k - num_greater < num_equal, then only some cubes with value == x are removed, so it's "MAYBE".

If k - num_greater == num_equal, then all cubes with value == x are removed, so "YES".

Wait, but if k - num_greater == num_equal, then all cubes with value == x are removed, so "YES".

If k - num_greater < num_equal, then only some are removed, so "MAYBE".

If k - num_greater > num_equal, which would mean k > num_greater + num_equal, but we already covered that as "YES".

So, to summarize:

- If k <= num_greater: "NO"

- If k > num_greater + num_equal: "YES"

- If num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal:

- If k - num_greater < num_equal: "MAYBE"

- Else (k - num_greater == num_equal): "YES"

Wait, but k - num_greater == num_equal means that exactly num_equal cubes with value == x are removed, which includes all cubes with value == x, so "YES".

If k - num_greater < num_equal, then only some are removed, so "MAYBE".

But in the earlier step, if k > num_greater + num_equal, which is equivalent to k - num_greater > num_equal, but since k cannot exceed n, which is 100, and num_greater + num_equal <= n, I need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of positions.

Let me think differently.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the position of the favorite cube depends on its value.

If its value is greater than the k-th cube's value, it will be among the first k and removed.

If its value is less than the k-th cube's value, it won't be among the first k and not removed.

If its value is equal to the k-th cube's value, then it depends on how the ties are broken.

So, in code, I can sort the array in non-increasing order, and see where the favorite cube's value fits in.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the array a of n integers

- f is 1-based index, so convert to 0-based: f -= 1

- k is the number of cubes removed from the front

- Sort a in non-increasing order: a.sort(reverse=True)

- x = a[k]

- If x > a[f], then "NO"

- If x < a[f], then "YES"

- If x == a[f], then check if there are multiple cubes with value x

- If there are ties, then "MAYBE"

Wait, but I need to be careful.

In the sorted array, if a[k] > a[f], then a[f] is not among the first k, so "NO".

If a[k] < a[f], then a[f] is among the first k, so "YES".

If a[k] == a[f], then it depends on the number of cubes with value == a[f].

Specifically, if the number of cubes with value > a[f] is less than k, then some cubes with value == a[f] are removed.

Since ties can be in any order, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not.

Hence, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, there were more nuanced cases.

But perhaps this simplified approach suffices.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

After sorting: [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]

a[k] = a[2-1=1] = 3

a[f] = a[2-1=1] = 3

So, a[k] == a[f], so "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]

After sorting: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

a[k]=a[3-1=2]=3

a[f]=a[5-1=4]=1

a[k] > a[f], so "NO"

But the sample output is "YES". Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in this sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k]=a[3-1=2]=3

a[f]=a[5-1=4]=1

Since a[k] > a[f], so "NO"

But the sample output is "YES". So, my logic is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in this case, after sorting, a=[5,4,3,2,1]

He removes the first k=3 cubes: [5,4,3]

His favorite cube is at position f=5, which is 1, which is not among the removed cubes.

So, should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, checking the sample input and output:

Input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1

42

5 2 3

2 2 1 1 2

2 1 1

2 1

5 3 1

3 3 2 3 2

Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

Wait, in the second test case:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

He removes the first 3: [5,4,3]

His favorite cube is at position f=5, which is 1, which is not among the removed cubes.

So, should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "the index of Dmitry's favorite cube", which is f=5.

But in 1-based indexing, f=5 corresponds to the last cube.

But in the sorted array, after removing the first k=3, the remaining are [2,1], which are positions 4 and 5.

So, his favorite cube is at position 5, which is not removed.

So, should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order."

"Then, he removed the first k cubes."

"Then he became interested in whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have changed after sorting)."

So, the favorite cube is the one with index f in the original order, but after sorting, its position changes based on its value.

Wait, in the second test case:

Original a = [4,2,1,3,5]

After sorting in non-increasing order: [5,4,3,2,1]

f=5 corresponds to the cube with value 5, which is now at position 1.

He removes the first k=3 cubes: [5,4,3]

So, his favorite cube is removed.

Hence, "YES"

Wait, but in my earlier logic, I thought that if a[k] > a[f], then "NO", but in this case, a[k]=3 < a[f]=5, which should be "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my conditions.

Wait, in this case, a[k]=3 < a[f]=5, so "YES"

In the first test case:

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

After sorting: [4,3,3,3,2]

a[k]=3 == a[f]=3, so "MAYBE"

In another test case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k]=3 < a[f]=1, which is not true, because a[f]=1 and a[k]=3, so 3 > 1, which should be "NO", but according to the sample, it's "NO"

Wait, but in the sample input and output, for this case:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

Output: NO

Which matches my earlier logic.

Wait, but in the second test case, according to the sample, output is "YES", which matches the corrected understanding.

So, perhaps my initial logic needs adjustment.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions.

After sorting in non-increasing order:

- If a[k-1] > a[f-1], then "YES" (favorite cube is not among the first k)

Wait, no.

Wait, in 0-based indexing:

- a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)

- If a_sorted[k] > a[f-1], then "NO" (favorite cube is not among the first k)

- If a_sorted[k] < a[f-1], then "YES" (favorite cube is among the first k)

- If a_sorted[k] == a[f-1], then "MAYBE" (depending on the order of ties)

Wait, but in the second test case:

a_sorted = [5,4,3,2,1]

k=3-1=2, a_sorted[k]=3

a[f-1]=1

3 > 1, so "NO", but sample output is "YES"

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding the conditions.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest."

"He removed the first k cubes."

"So, in the sorted array, the first k cubes are removed."

Hence, if the favorite cube is among the first k in the sorted array, it's removed.

So, to check if it's removed, we need to see if it's among the first k in the sorted array.

Hence, "YES" if it's always among the first k, "NO" if it's never among the first k, and "MAYBE" if it could be either.

Wait, but in the second test case, it's "YES", meaning that the favorite cube is always among the first k.

But according to the sorting, a_sorted=[5,4,3,2,1], a[f-1]=1, which is not among the first k=3, so shouldn't be "NO"?

But according to the sample output, it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input and output.

Wait, checking the sample input and output:

Second test case:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

Output: YES

But according to the explanation in the problem statement, f=5 corresponds to the cube with value 5, which is in the first k=3 after sorting, so it's removed.

Hence, "YES"

Wait, perhaps I was confused earlier.

Wait, in the sorted array [5,4,3,2,1], a[f-1]=5, which is at position 0, which is among the first k=3, so it's removed.

Hence, "YES"

But in my earlier logic, I had a[k] > a[f-1], which would be 3 > 5, which is false, so didn't match.

Hence, perhaps my conditions are wrong.

Let me think again.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the first k cubes are removed.

To check if the favorite cube is removed, we need to see if, after sorting, it's among the first k.

If its value is greater than the k-th cube's value, it's definitely among the first k.

If its value is less than the k-th cube's value, it's definitely not among the first k.

If its value is equal to the k-th cube's value, it depends on the order of ties.

Hence:

- If x > a_sorted[k-1], then "YES"

- If x < a_sorted[k-1], then "NO"

- If x == a_sorted[k-1], then "MAYBE"

Wait, but in 0-based indexing, a_sorted[k] is the k-th cube to be removed.

So, if x > a_sorted[k], then it's among the first k.

If x < a_sorted[k], then it's not among the first k.

If x == a_sorted[k], then it depends.

Hence, in code:

- sort a in descending order

- x = a[f-1]

- if x > a[k-1], then "YES"

- if x < a[k-1], then "NO"

- if x == a[k-1], then "MAYBE"

Wait, but in the second test case:

a_sorted = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = 5

a[k-1] = a[2] = 3

5 > 3, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

a_sorted=[5,4,3,2,1]

x=1

a[k-1]=a[1]=4

1 < 4, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

a_sorted=[3,3,3,3,3]

x=3

a[k-1]=a[0]=3

x == a[k-1], so "MAYBE"

But in reality, since all values are equal, the favorite cube could be in any position after sorting, so it could be among the first k or not.

Hence, "MAYBE"

Seems correct.

Hence, the conditions are:

- If x > a_sorted[k-1], then "YES"

- If x < a_sorted[k-1], then "NO"

- If x == a_sorted[k-1], then "MAYBE"

Hence, in code, we can sort the array in descending order, get a_sorted[k-1], and compare it with x.

Wait, but in Python, list indices start at 0, so a_sorted[k-1] would be a_sorted[k-1].

But in the problem, k is 1-based, I think.

Wait, no, in the problem, k is the number of cubes to remove from the front.

In the code, we have:

(k) = map(int, input().split())

So, k is 1-based in the input.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, n, f, k are 1-based.

But in code, we have f -= 1, k -= 1, which makes them 0-based.

Wait, let's see.

In the code:

(k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, it should be:

if x > a_sorted[k]:

print('YES')

elif x < a_sorted[k]:

print('NO')

elif x == a_sorted[k]:

print('MAYBE')

But in the code, it's:

if a_sorted[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a_sorted[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a_sorted[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, in the code, a_sorted[k] is compared to x.

So, if a_sorted[k] > x, it's "NO"

if a_sorted[k] < x, it's "YES"

if a_sorted[k] == x, then:

if k == n - 1 or a_sorted[k + 1] < x, then "YES" else "MAYBE"

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, if a_sorted[k] == x, it should be "MAYBE"

So, why does the code have an extra condition here?

Wait, perhaps to handle the case when k is the last position.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose k = n, which means remove all cubes.

Then, the favorite cube is always removed, so "YES"

Hence, in that case, "YES"

Similarly, if k == n - 1, and a_sorted[k] == x, then the favorite cube is either in the first k or not, depending on the order.

Wait, perhaps the extra condition is to handle when k == n - 1 and a_sorted[k] == x.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider some examples.

Take n=5, k=5, f=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

After sorting: [1,1,1,1,1]

a_sorted[k-1]=a_sorted[4]=1

x=1

Since k == n - 1? Wait, n -1 =4, k=5.

Wait, k == n, which is 5.

In this case, all cubes are removed, so "YES"

Hence, in this case, a_sorted[k-1] == x, and k == n -1? Wait, k == n.

In the code, it's k == n -1, but in Python, indices are 0-based, so k == n -1 would be the last index.

But in this case, k == n, which is a special case.

Wait, perhaps the condition is to handle when k == n -1 and a_sorted[k] == x.

But I'm getting tangled.

I think the code has a mistake in the condition.

It should simply be:

if x > a_sorted[k]:

print('YES')

elif x < a_sorted[k]:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

But in the code, it's:

if a_sorted[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a_sorted[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a_sorted[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the person who wrote the code had a different logic.

Let me see.

In the code, a_sorted[k] > x: print 'NO'

Which corresponds to our condition x < a_sorted[k]: print 'NO'

Similarly, a_sorted[k] < x: print 'YES'

Which corresponds to x > a_sorted[k]: print 'YES'

So, the comparisons are inverted.

Wait, no, in the code:

if a_sorted[k] > x:

print 'NO'

Which should correspond to:

if a_sorted[k] > x, then "NO"

Which is equivalent to our condition x < a_sorted[k]: "NO"

Hence, it's consistent.

Similarly, a_sorted[k] < x: "YES"

And a_sorted[k] == x:

if k == n -1 or a_sorted[k + 1] < x: "YES" else: "MAYBE"

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, it should just be "MAYBE"

So, why this extra condition?

Let's consider when k == n -1 and a_sorted[k] == x.

In this case, k == n -1 means that we are removing all but one cube.

If a_sorted[k] == x, then the favorite cube could be among the first k or not, depending on the order of ties.

Hence, "MAYBE"

But in the code, it's print 'YES' if k == n -1 or a_sorted[k + 1] < x

Wait, but if k == n -1, then a_sorted[k + 1] would be out of bounds.

Wait, in Python, if k == n -1, and we try to access a_sorted[k +1], it would be a_sorted[n], which is out of bounds.

Hence, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it's meant to handle the case when a_sorted[k] == x and a_sorted[k +1] < x, meaning that all cubes with value == x are among the first k.

Wait, but if a_sorted[k] == x and a_sorted[k +1] < x, then it means that the cubes with value == x are all in the first k +1 positions, but since a_sorted[k +1] < x, then all cubes with value == x are in the first k positions.

Hence, the favorite cube is among the first k.

Hence, "YES"

Otherwise, "MAYBE"

So, in this case, if a_sorted[k] == x and a_sorted[k +1] < x, then "YES"

Else, "MAYBE"

But, in the code, it's:

print('YES' if k == n -1 or a_sorted[k +1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, but if k == n -1, then a_sorted[k +1] would be out of bounds.

Hence, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it's meant to handle the case when k == n -1 separately.

In that case, if k == n -1 and a_sorted[k] == x, then:

- If a_sorted[k +1] < x, but k +1 == n, which is out of bounds, meaning that there are no more cubes with value == x beyond k, hence, "YES"

But in Python, accessing a_sorted[k +1] would raise an IndexError if k +1 >= n.

Hence, perhaps it's better to count the number of cubes with value > x and value == x.

Let me try to implement it differently.

Let me calculate:

- num_greater: number of cubes with value > x

- num_equal: number of cubes with value == x

Then:

- If k <= num_greater: "NO"

- If k > num_greater + num_equal: "YES"

- Else: "MAYBE"

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, if k > num_greater + num_equal, then all cubes with value >= x are removed, so "YES"

If k <= num_greater, then none of the cubes with value == x are removed, so "NO"

If num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal, then some cubes with value == x are removed, depending on the order, so "MAYBE"

Hence, this seems correct.

Hence, in code, it's better to count num_greater and num_equal.

Let me adjust the code accordingly.

So, in code:

x = a[f]

num_greater = sum(1 for val in a if val > x)

num_equal = sum(1 for val in a if val == x)

if k <= num_greater:

print('NO')

elif k > num_greater + num_equal:

print('YES')

else:

print('MAYBE')

This seems more straightforward and less error-prone.

Let me verify with the sample input.

Take the second test case:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=5

num_greater = sum(1 for val in a if val > 5) = 0

num_equal = sum(1 for val in a if val == 5) =1

k=3

Since k > num_greater + num_equal (3 > 0 +1), so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=1

num_greater = sum(1 for val in a if val >1) =4

num_equal = sum(1 for val in a if val ==1)=1

k=2

Since k <= num_greater (2 <=4), so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

x=3

num_greater =0

num_equal=5

k=1

Since num_greater < k <= num_greater + num_equal (0 <1 <=5), so "MAYBE"

Which is correct.

Hence, this seems a better approach.

But in the given code, it's not implemented this way.

In the given code, it's:

if a_sorted[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a_sorted[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n -1 or a_sorted[k +1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Which is error-prone because of potential index out of bounds.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs and outputs, it seems to work.

But in general, it's risky.

For example, consider n=5, k=5, f=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

a_sorted=[1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

a_sorted[k]=a_sorted[4]=1

x == a_sorted[k]

Then, k == n -1 (4 ==5-1), so print 'YES'

Which is correct, since k == n, all cubes are removed, including the favorite one.

Another case: n=5, k=4, f=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

a_sorted=[1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

a_sorted[k]=a_sorted[3]=1

x == a_sorted[k]

k != n -1, so check a_sorted[k +1]=a_sorted[4]=1

1 < 1 is False, so "MAYBE"

Which is correct, because with ties, the favorite cube could be in position 4 or not.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct.

But it's risky because if k == n -1 and a_sorted[k +1] is out of bounds, it would error.

But in Python, list indices out of bounds raise an error.

Hence, to make it correct, we need to handle the case when k == n -1.

Hence, perhaps it's better to rephrase it as:

if a_sorted[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a_sorted[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

if k == n -1 or (k < n -1 and a_sorted[k +1] < x):

print('YES')

else:

print('MAYBE')

This way, we ensure that we don't access a_sorted[k +1] when k == n -1.

Hence, the given code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case when k == n -1 properly.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed when he arranges the cubes in non-increasing order and removes the first k cubes.

### Approach

1. **Read Inputs:** Read the number of test cases, for each test case read n (number of cubes), f (index of the favorite cube), and k (number of cubes to remove).
2. **Adjust Indices:** Convert f to 0-based indexing.
3. **Sort the Cubes:** Sort the cubes in non-increasing order.
4. **Determine Removal:**
   - If the value of the favorite cube is greater than the k-th cube in the sorted list, it will always be removed.
   - If the value is less than the k-th cube, it will never be removed.
   - If the value is equal to the k-th cube, it depends on the order of ties, hence it may or may not be removed.
5. **Output the Result:** Print "YES" if the cube is always removed, "NO" if never removed, and "MAYBE" if it could go either way.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        f = int(data[idx+1])
        k = int(data[idx+2])
        idx += 3
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        x = a[f]
        a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        if a_sorted[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a_sorted[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            if k == n - 1 or (k < n - 1 and a_sorted[k + 1] < x):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Inputs:** Read all inputs at once and split them into a list for easier access.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Extract n, f, k and adjust f and k to 0-based indexing.
   - Extract the cube values a.
   - Determine the value of the favorite cube x.
   - Sort the cube values in non-increasing order.
3. **Determine Removal Status:**
   - Compare x with the k-th cube in the sorted list.
   - If a_sorted[k] > x, print "NO".
   - If a_sorted[k] < x, print "YES".
   - If a_sorted[k] == x, check if k is the last index or the next cube has a smaller value to decide "YES" or "MAYBE".
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where k is equal to n-1 to avoid index out of range errors.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether the favorite cube is removed, considering all possible scenarios with ties in cube values.
