Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the problem is about determining whether it's possible to adjust the radii of some disks in a plane, under certain conditions, such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases, and no two disks overlap in a positive area, though they can be tangent.

First, let's understand the setup. We have n disks, each with integer coordinates for their centers and positive integer radii. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent.

2. We need to adjust the radii so that:

   a. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

   b. No two disks overlap in a positive area.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers remain fixed.

Okay, so the disks are initially placed in such a way that they don't overlap, but they can touch each other at a single point (tangent). Our task is to see if we can shrink some radii, possibly expand others, but in a way that the total sum of radii decreases, while maintaining the tangent contacts and ensuring no overlaps.

I need to think about how the radii relate to each other given their positions. If two disks are tangent, the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. If they don't overlap, the distance between centers is greater than the sum of their radii.

So, for tangent disks, we have:

distance(i, j) = r_i + r_j

For non-tangent disks, we have:

distance(i, j) > r_i + r_j

Our goal is to adjust the radii so that:

1. For tangent pairs, distance(i, j) = new_r_i + new_r_j

2. For non-tangent pairs, distance(i, j) > new_r_i + new_r_j

And the sum of new_r_i < sum of r_i

Moreover, the centers cannot be moved; only the radii can be changed.

I need to find out if such adjustments are possible.

Let me consider the constraints imposed by the tangent relationships. If two disks are tangent, their radii must sum up to the fixed distance between their centers. This seems like an equality constraint.

If I have multiple tangent relationships, these constraints might be interdependent.

For example, suppose disk A is tangent to disk B, and disk B is tangent to disk C. Then, I have:

r_A + r_B = d_AB

r_B + r_C = d_BC

Here, d_AB and d_BC are the fixed distances between the centers.

I can solve these equations to express r_A and r_C in terms of r_B.

If I have a chain of such tangent relationships, I might be able to express all radii in terms of one variable.

Then, I can adjust that variable to see if I can make the total sum smaller, while satisfying all the constraints.

But I need to ensure that all radii remain positive.

Also, for non-tangent pairs, I need to ensure that their sum of radii is less than the distance between their centers.

This seems like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

I need to model this in a way that I can determine if there's a feasible solution where the sum of radii decreases.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, I can model the tangent relationships as equality constraints:

For each tangent pair (i, j):

r_i + r_j = d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between centers i and j.

For non-tangent pairs (i, j):

r_i + r_j < d_ij

And, of course, r_i > 0 for all i.

Our goal is to find new radii r_i' such that:

1. For tangent pairs: r_i' + r_j' = d_ij

2. For non-tangent pairs: r_i' + r_j' < d_ij

3. Sum of r_i' < sum of r_i

4. r_i' > 0 for all i

I need to determine if such a set of r_i' exists.

This seems like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

I need to find if there's a solution to this system where the sum of r_i' is less than the original sum.

One approach is to consider the tangent relationships first, as they are equality constraints, and see what they imply for the radii.

I can group the disks into connected components based on tangent relationships.

Within each connected component, the tangent relationships form a system of equations that link the radii together.

I can solve this system to express all radii in terms of one variable within the component.

Then, I can consider the non-tangent pairs and the condition that the sum decreases.

Let me consider one connected component first.

Suppose I have a connected component with k disks.

I can choose one disk as a reference and express all other radii in terms of its radius.

Then, I can check the non-tangent pairs to ensure that their sum of radii is less than the distance between their centers.

Also, I need to ensure that the sum of all radii in the component is less than the original sum.

If I can do this for each connected component, and ensure that across components, the non-tangent pairs also satisfy the inequalities, then I can achieve the desired adjustment.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me think about a simpler way.

I recall that in graph theory, tangent relationships can be modeled as edges in a graph, with disks as nodes.

So, I can build a graph where each node is a disk, and there's an edge between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.

Then, the connected components of this graph represent groups of disks that are interconnected through tangent relationships.

Within each connected component, the tangent constraints form a system of equations that link the radii together.

I can solve this system to express all radii in terms of one variable.

Let's consider a connected component with k disks.

I can choose one disk in the component as a reference, say disk A, and set its new radius to be r_A'.

Then, using the tangent constraints, I can express the new radii of all other disks in the component in terms of r_A'.

For example, if disk B is tangent to disk A, then r_B' = d_AB - r_A'

If disk C is tangent to disk B, then r_C' = d_BC - r_B' = d_BC - (d_AB - r_A') = d_BC - d_AB + r_A'

And so on.

In this way, all radii in the component can be expressed in terms of r_A'.

Then, I need to ensure that for all non-tangent pairs within the component, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij

Also, that r_i' > 0 for all i.

And that the sum of r_i' < sum of original r_i in the component.

Additionally, for disks in different components, if they are non-tangent, their sum of radii should be less than the distance between their centers.

But since different components are not connected through tangent relationships, their radii can be adjusted independently.

Wait, no. Even if two components are not connected through tangent relationships, they might still be non-tangent to each other, so their sum of radii must be less than the distance between their centers.

But adjusting one component's radii could affect the overall sum and the non-tangent conditions with other components.

So, I need to consider the entire system together.

This seems complex.

Let me try to find a way to simplify this.

I notice that the problem allows the new radii to be any positive real numbers, not necessarily integers.

Also, the centers are fixed, and the radii can be adjusted as long as the tangent relationships are maintained and no overlaps occur.

I need to see if it's possible to decrease the total sum of radii under these constraints.

I recall that in linear algebra, when dealing with systems of linear equations and inequalities, one can use methods like Gaussian elimination or linear programming to find feasible solutions.

But implementing such methods from scratch would be too time-consuming for this problem, especially given the constraints on time and code length.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the connected components again.

Within a connected component, the tangent relationships form a system of equations that link the radii together.

I can represent this system as a set of equations where each equation corresponds to a tangent pair: r_i + r_j = d_ij.

This is similar to a system of linear equations, and I can solve for the radii in terms of one free variable.

Then, I need to check if there exists a value for this free variable such that:

1. All radii are positive.

2. For non-tangent pairs within the component, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

3. The sum of radii in the component is less than the original sum.

Moreover, for disks in different components, their sum of radii must be less than the distance between their centers if they are non-tangent.

But handling multiple components and their interactions seems complicated.

Maybe I can consider each connected component separately and see if their sum can be decreased without violating the constraints within the component.

Then, as long as at least one component can have its sum decreased, while the others remain the same or adjusted within their constraints, the total sum can be decreased.

But I need to ensure that adjusting one component doesn't affect the constraints with other components.

Wait, since different components are not connected through tangent relationships, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't overlap with each other.

So, if I can decrease the sum of radii in at least one component without violating the constraints within that component, and ensure that the components don't overlap with each other, then the total sum can be decreased.

Moreover, since the components are not connected through tangent relationships, their radii adjustments don't affect the tangent constraints between different components.

Therefore, I can treat each connected component separately, and if at least one component can have its sum decreased, then the total sum can be decreased.

But I need to ensure that after adjusting the radii, no two disks from different components overlap.

Given that disks from different components are not tangent, their sum of radii must be less than the distance between their centers.

If I adjust the radii within a component, as long as the sum of radii in that component is less than the original sum for that component, and the sum of radii between disks from different components remains less than the distance between their centers, then the overall sum can be decreased.

This seems manageable.

So, my plan is:

1. Build a graph where disks are nodes, and tangent pairs are edges.

2. Identify connected components in this graph.

3. For each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangent pairs to express all radii in terms of one free variable.

4. Then, find if there exists a value for this free variable such that:

   a. All radii are positive.

   b. For non-tangent pairs within the component, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

   c. The sum of radii in the component is less than the original sum.

5. If at least one component allows such a decrease, while the others can remain the same or adjusted within their constraints, then the total sum can be decreased.

6. Additionally, ensure that between different components, the sum of radii for any non-tangent pair is less than the distance between their centers.

But step 6 seems tricky. How can I ensure that adjusting one component doesn't cause overlaps with other components?

Wait, since different components are not connected through tangent relationships, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't overlap with each other.

So, if I adjust the radii within one component, I need to ensure that for any disk in that component and any disk in another component, the sum of their radii is less than the distance between their centers.

Given that the centers are fixed, and the radii are being adjusted, I need to make sure that this condition holds.

But this seems complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can consider that if, within each component, I adjust the radii in such a way that the sum of radii in that component is less than or equal to the original sum, and for disks in different components, their sum of radii is less than the distance between their centers, then the total sum can be decreased if at least one component can have its sum decreased.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the system as a whole.

Let me consider the entire system as a graph where nodes are disks, and edges represent tangent relationships.

Then, each connected component in this graph represents a set of disks that are interconnected through tangent relationships.

Within each component, the tangent constraints form a system of equations that link the radii together.

I can solve this system to express all radii in terms of one free variable per component.

Then, for each component, I can treat the free variable as a parameter and find the range of values for which all radii are positive and satisfy the non-tangent inequalities within the component.

Additionally, between different components, I need to ensure that for any pair of disks from different components, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

Since different components have their own free variables, I need to find values for all free variables such that all within-component and between-component inequalities hold, and the total sum of radii decreases.

This seems like a system of linear inequalities with multiple variables.

Solving such a system can be done using linear programming techniques, but that might be too involved for this problem.

I need a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider the dual problem: determining if it's impossible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the constraints.

If I can show that in some cases, it's impossible to decrease the sum without violating the constraints, then in those cases, the answer is "NO".

Otherwise, it's "YES".

One scenario where it's impossible to decrease the sum is when the radii are already at their minimal possible values that satisfy all the tangent constraints.

In other words, if the radii cannot be decreased further without violating the tangent constraints or making any radius zero or negative.

In such a case, the sum cannot be decreased.

But I need to generalize this.

Let me consider that in each connected component, the radii are linked through the tangent constraints.

If I can find a way to decrease the sum in at least one component without violating the constraints in that component or affecting the between-component constraints, then the total sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it cannot.

So, I need to check for each connected component if there's room to decrease its sum without violating the constraints.

But I also need to ensure that decreasing the sum in one component doesn't cause overlaps with other components.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider the entire system and see if there's any flexibility in adjusting the radii to decrease the total sum.

Let me think about the degrees of freedom.

Each connected component has one degree of freedom (the free variable), and the radii within the component are determined by this free variable.

Then, between different components, there are inequalities that must hold to prevent overlaps.

So, if I have c connected components, I have c free variables, and a set of inequalities that relate these variables.

My goal is to see if I can choose values for these c free variables such that:

1. All within-component constraints are satisfied.

2. All between-component non-tangent pairs satisfy r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

3. The sum of all r_i' is less than the original sum.

4. All r_i' > 0.

This seems like a system of linear inequalities in c variables.

If I can find a solution to this system that satisfies all these conditions, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But solving such a system is not straightforward.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the dual problem again: when is it impossible to decrease the sum?

If all connected components are already at their minimal possible radii that satisfy the tangent constraints, and there's no room to decrease any component's sum without violating the constraints, then it's impossible to decrease the total sum.

Otherwise, if there's at least one component where I can decrease its sum without violating the constraints, then the total sum can be decreased.

But I need to ensure that decreasing one component's sum doesn't affect the constraints with other components.

Wait, if I decrease the sum of radii in one component, I need to ensure that the sum of radii between disks from that component and disks from other components still satisfies the non-tangent inequalities.

Given that the centers are fixed and the radii are being decreased in one component, this should not cause any overlaps with other components, as the sum of radii is decreasing.

But I need to verify this.

Suppose I have two components, A and B, and I decrease the sum of radii in A.

For any disk in A and any disk in B, the sum of their radii is decreasing in A's radii, so if it was previously less than the distance between their centers, it should still be less after decreasing A's radii.

Therefore, decreasing the radii in one component shouldn't cause overlaps with other components, assuming that the non-tangent inequalities were satisfied before.

Therefore, I can treat each component separately in terms of adjusting their radii, as long as I ensure that after adjustment, the sum of radii in that component is less than the original sum, and the within-component constraints are satisfied.

Then, if at least one component can have its sum decreased in this manner, the total sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it cannot.

This seems manageable.

So, my approach is:

1. Build a graph where disks are nodes, and tangent pairs are edges.

2. Identify connected components in this graph.

3. For each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangent constraints to express all radii in terms of one free variable.

4. Determine if there exists a value for this free variable such that:

   a. All radii are positive.

   b. For non-tangent pairs within the component, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

   c. The sum of radii in the component is less than the original sum.

5. If at least one component allows such a decrease, while the others can have their radii set to maintain their constraints, then the total sum can be decreased. Otherwise, it cannot.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

But before that, I need to think about how to efficiently solve the system of equations for each connected component and check the conditions.

Given that n can be up to 1000, and the centers can have large coordinates, I need an efficient algorithm.

First, building the graph:

- Read n disks with their centers (x, y) and radii r.

- Compute the distance between each pair of disks to determine if they are tangent.

- Build a graph where edges connect tangent pairs.

Then, find the connected components in this graph.

For each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangent constraints.

Given that the system is linear, I can use Gaussian elimination or represent it in matrix form.

But with n up to 1000, Gaussian elimination might be too slow.

Is there a smarter way to handle this?

Let me consider that in a connected component with k disks, I have k-1 independent equations (since it's a tree in terms of connections).

But in general, it's a graph, so the number of independent equations is related to the rank of the system.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of assigning potentials to the disks.

If I think of the radii as potentials, then the tangent constraints impose that the sum of potentials of connected pairs equals the distance between their centers.

This is similar to setting up a system of equations where each equation corresponds to a tangent pair.

I need to solve this system to express all radii in terms of one free variable.

Then, I can check the conditions for positivity, non-tangent inequalities, and sum reduction.

But solving such a system for each component might be time-consuming.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that in a connected component, once I fix one radius, the others are determined by the tangent constraints.

For example, if disk A is tangent to disk B, and B is tangent to C, then fixing r_A' determines r_B' and r_C'.

Then, I can check if there exists a value for r_A' such that:

- All derived r_i' are positive.

- For non-tangent pairs, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

- The sum of radii in the component is less than the original sum.

This seems feasible.

So, for each connected component, I can choose one disk as a reference, fix its new radius to a variable, say r, and express all other radii in terms of r.

Then, I can set up inequalities based on the conditions above and see if there's a value of r that satisfies all of them.

If I can find such a value for at least one component, then I can decrease the total sum.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Now, how do I implement this efficiently?

Given time constraints, I need an efficient way to model this.

Let me consider that in a connected component with k disks and m tangent pairs, I have m equations of the form r_i + r_j = d_ij.

I can represent this system in terms of a matrix, but with k variables and m equations, it might be inefficient for large k and m.

Is there a way to avoid solving the system directly?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a connected component, the radii are linearly dependent, and express all radii in terms of one variable.

Then, I can check the conditions without solving the full system.

Let's try to formalize this.

For a connected component, choose disk A as the reference, set r_A' = r.

Then, for each disk connected to A through tangent relationships, express their r_i' in terms of r.

For example, if disk B is tangent to A, then r_B' = d_AB - r.

If disk C is tangent to B, then r_C' = d_BC - r_B' = d_BC - (d_AB - r) = d_BC - d_AB + r.

And so on for other disks in the component.

Once I have all r_i' expressed in terms of r, I can write the conditions:

1. r_i' > 0 for all i in the component.

2. For non-tangent pairs (i, j) in the component, r_i' + r_j' < d_ij.

3. Sum of r_i' < original sum of r_i in the component.

These conditions can be expressed as linear inequalities in terms of r.

Then, I need to find if there exists a value of r that satisfies all these inequalities.

This can be done by finding the intersection of the intervals defined by each inequality.

If the intersection is non-empty, then such an r exists.

Otherwise, it doesn't.

So, for each connected component, I can:

- Choose a reference disk A, set r_A' = r.

- Express all other r_i' in terms of r.

- Collect all inequalities:

   - r > lower_bound (from r_i' > 0)

   - r < upper_bound (from r_i' < some_value)

   - sum of r_i' < original sum.

- Check if there's an r that satisfies all these inequalities.

If at least one component allows such an r, then the total sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it cannot.

This seems manageable.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1000, and the centers can have large coordinates, I need to optimize the computations.

First, I need to build the graph of tangent pairs.

To determine if two disks are tangent, I need to check if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.

Given that the centers have integer coordinates and radii are positive integers, the distance can be computed as:

distance(i, j) = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2)

And check if distance(i, j) == r_i + r_j

But since all values are integers, and squares of integers can be large, I need to handle large integers carefully.

To
