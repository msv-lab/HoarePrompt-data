Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. I need to find the minimum number of cards I can have in my hand after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any number. The goal is to minimize the number of cards in my hand.

Let me think about the first example given:

Input:

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

So, n=5, k=3, and the cards are [4,1,1,4,4].

From the description, one possible sequence of operations is shown, resulting in 2 cards. I need to see if this is indeed the minimum.

Another example:

Input:

1 10

7

Here, n=1, k=10. Since I have only 1 card, which is less than k=10, I can't perform any operations. So, the minimum number of cards is 1.

Another one:

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

n=7, k=2. I need to see if I can reduce this to fewer cards.

Looking at the output for this is 1, which means I can reduce it to a single card.

Wait, let's think about that. With k=2, I can choose any two cards with the same number and replace them with one card of any number.

But in this input: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3, the counts are:

- 4:1

- 2:2

- 1:1

- 100:1

- 5:1

- 3:1

So, only the number 2 appears twice. So, I can perform the operation on the two 2's and replace them with one card of any number, say 2 again.

Then, the hand becomes: 4,2,1,100,5,3,2.

Now, again, I have two 2's. So, I can perform the operation again, replace them with one card, say 2.

Now, the hand is: 4,1,100,5,3,2.

Now, all cards have unique numbers, so no more operations can be performed. So, the minimum number of cards is 6, but the output says 1. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I misread the example output. Let me check the example outputs again.

Example outputs are:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

So, for the third case, it's 1, but according to my reasoning, it should be 6. Wait, maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of this process."

Looking back, perhaps I misread the operations or the problem constraints.

Wait, let me look back at the operation: "Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged)."

So, in the third example, n=7, k=2, and the cards are [4,2,1,100,5,2,3].

As I did before, I can perform the operation on the two 2's, replace them with one card, say 2.

Then, the hand is [4,1,100,5,3,2].

Now, there are no more cards with the same number, so I can't perform any more operations. So, the minimum number of cards is 6.

But according to the example output, it's 1. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to create new numbers that allow further operations.

For example, when I replace the two 2's with one 2, I could choose to replace them with one 4, or any other number.

Let's try that.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3].

Choose the two 2's and replace them with one, say, 4.

Now, the hand is [4,4,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 4's. So, I can perform the operation again, replace the two 4's with one 4.

Now, the hand is [4,1,100,5,3].

Now, all cards have unique numbers, so no more operations can be performed, and the minimum number of cards is 5.

But according to the example output, it's 1. So, still, something's not adding up.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one 2 and one other number to create another pair.

Wait, no, when you replace k cards, you get k-1 cards back, and each can be any number.

Wait, for k=2, you replace two cards with one card of any number.

So, in the third example, perhaps there's a way to reduce it to one card, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the frequencies of the numbers.

In the third example:

- 2:2

- 4:1

- 1:1

- 100:1

- 5:1

- 3:1

So, only 2 appears twice.

So, I can perform the operation once to replace the two 2's with one card.

Then, I have [4,1,100,5,3,2].

Now, no duplicates, so I can't perform any more operations.

So, the minimum number of cards is 6.

But according to the example output, it's 1.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card of any number, say, 4.

Then, the hand becomes [4,4,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 4's, so I can perform the operation again, replacing the two 4's with one 4.

Now, the hand is [4,1,100,5,3].

Again, no duplicates, so minimum is 5.

But according to the example output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a different strategy.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card of a new number, say, 1.

Then, the hand becomes [4,1,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have three 1's.

Then, I can perform the operation again, replacing two 1's with one 1.

Now, the hand is [4,1,100,5,3].

Again, no duplicates, so minimum is 5.

Still not matching the example output of 1.

Wait, maybe I can replace the two 2's with one 1 and one 4.

Then, the hand becomes [4,4,1,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 4's and two 1's.

Then, I can perform the operation on the two 4's, replacing them with one 4.

Now, the hand is [4,1,1,100,5,3].

Then, perform the operation on the two 1's, replacing them with one 1.

Now, the hand is [4,1,100,5,3].

Again, no duplicates.

Still, 5 cards, not matching the example output of 1.

I must be missing something fundamental here.

Wait, maybe I can chain operations in a different way.

Let's consider the first example again:

n=5, k=3, cards=[4,1,1,4,4]

From the description, they have a sequence of operations that reduces to 2 cards.

Let me try to simulate that.

First, choose three 4's and replace them with two cards, say two 1's.

Now, the hand is [1,1,1].

Then, choose three 1's and replace them with two cards, say two 1's.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because replacing three 1's with two 1's still leaves me with two 1's.

But according to the example, they end up with two cards.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different numbers for the replacement.

Wait, when replacing three cards, I can choose any numbers for the k-1=2 cards.

So, perhaps I can replace three 4's with two cards of different numbers.

For example, replace three 4's with one 1 and one 2.

Then, the hand becomes [1,1,2].

Now, I have two 1's. So, perform the operation on the two 1's, replacing them with one card, say a 3.

Now, the hand is [2,3].

So, two cards remaining.

That matches the example output.

So, the key is that when replacing k cards, I can choose any numbers for the k-1 cards, which might allow me to create new duplicates for further operations.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, cards=[4,2,1,100,5,2,3].

As before, I have two 2's.

Perform the operation on the two 2's and replace them with one card, say a 4.

Now, the hand is [4,4,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 4's. Perform the operation on the two 4's and replace them with one card, say a 1.

Now, the hand is [1,1,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 1's. Perform the operation on the two 1's and replace them with one card, say a 100.

Now, the hand is [100,100,5,3].

Now, I have two 100's. Perform the operation on the two 100's and replace them with one card, say a 5.

Now, the hand is [5,5,3].

Now, I have two 5's. Perform the operation on the two 5's and replace them with one card, say a 3.

Now, the hand is [3,3].

Perform the operation on the two 3's and replace them with one card, say a 3.

Now, the hand is [3].

So, I have one card left.

That matches the example output.

Wow, I missed that earlier.

So, the strategy is to use the operations to create new duplicates by choosing appropriate numbers for the replacement cards, allowing further operations to be performed.

So, in the third example, by carefully choosing the numbers for the replacement cards, I can keep reducing the number of cards until only one remains.

Now, I need to generalize this to find the minimum number of cards possible for any given n, k, and the list of card numbers.

Looking at the problem, it seems that as long as there are groups of k cards with the same number, I can perform operations to reduce the total number of cards.

But with the ability to choose any numbers for the replacement cards, I can create new groups that allow further operations.

So, perhaps the key is to maximize the number of operations I can perform, which depends on how I choose the replacement cards.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a lot of cards with the same number, say m cards of the same number.

How many operations can I perform on them?

Each operation reduces the count by k-1 cards.

So, for m cards, the number of operations is floor(m / k), and the remaining cards are m - (k-1)*floor(m / k).

Wait, more precisely, each operation reduces the count by k-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, each operation takes k cards and replaces them with k-1 cards.

So, the net reduction is k - (k-1) = 1 card per operation.

So, starting with m cards, each operation reduces the count by 1.

So, the final number of cards is m - floor(m / k).

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's see.

Each operation reduces the count by (k - (k-1)) = 1 card.

But actually, it's more nuanced.

Wait, no.

Wait, each operation takes k cards and replaces them with k-1 cards, so the net reduction is k - (k-1) = 1 card.

So, for m cards, the number of operations I can perform is floor(m / k), and each operation reduces the count by 1, so the final number of cards is m - floor(m / k).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, for example, m=3, k=3.

Initially, m=3.

Perform one operation: replace 3 cards with 2 cards.

Now, m=2.

No more operations can be performed.

So, final m=2.

But according to m - floor(m / k) = 3 - 1 = 2.

Yes, that matches.

Another example: m=4, k=3.

Initially, m=4.

Perform one operation: replace 3 cards with 2 cards, m=2+1=3.

Wait, no.

Wait, you choose 3 cards out of 4, replace them with 2 cards.

So, m = (2) + (4-3)=2 +1=3.

Wait, but in reality, after replacing 3 cards with 2, you have 2 + (4-3)=2+1=3 cards.

Now, can I perform another operation? Do I have 3 cards, but only 2 are the same?

Wait, assuming all cards are the same.

If all cards are the same, then yes, you can perform another operation on the new 2 cards plus one of the remaining cards.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's clarify.

Assuming all cards are identical.

Start with m=4, k=3.

Operation: choose any 3 cards, replace with 2 cards.

So, replace 3 cards with 2 cards, so total cards become 2 + (4-3)=3.

Now, again, all 3 cards are the same, so perform another operation: choose 3 cards, replace with 2 cards.

Now, m=2.

No more operations can be performed.

So, starting with m=4, k=3, final m=2.

According to m - floor(m / k) = 4 - 1 =3, which doesn't match the actual final m=2.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps it's not m - floor(m / k).

Wait, in this case, floor(4 / 3)=1, so m - floor(m / k)=4-1=3, but actual final m=2.

So, that formula doesn't hold.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me think recursively.

Each operation reduces the count by (k - (k-1))=1 card.

But in reality, it's more complex because the replacement cards can be used in future operations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, the maximum number of operations is the initial number of cards minus the minimum number of cards remaining.

So, min_cards = n - max_operations.

But what's the maximum number of operations I can perform?

Well, it depends on how I group the cards for operations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the frequencies of each number.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm for each unique number.

For each frequency fi, I can perform floor(fi / k) operations directly on that group.

Each such operation reduces the count by 1.

But, I can also create new groups by choosing appropriate replacement cards.

Wait, but it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a formula.

Looking back at the first example:

n=5, k=3, frequencies: 4:3, 1:2.

So, for 4's: floor(3 / 3)=1 operation.

After performing that operation, replace three 4's with two cards, say two 1's.

Now, the frequencies are: 1:4.

Then, floor(4 / 3)=1 operation.

Replace three 1's with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:3.

Again, floor(3 / 3)=1 operation.

Replace three 1's with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:2.

No more operations can be performed.

So, total operations: 3.

Initial n=5, final n=5 - 3=2, which matches the example.

Wait, that seems to work.

Another example:

n=7, k=2, frequencies: 2:2, others:1.

Operations:

First operation on two 2's, replace with one 2.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, others:1.

No more operations can be performed.

Total operations:1.

Initial n=7, final n=7-1=6, but example output is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to chain operations differently.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with two different numbers.

Wait, no, for k=2, replacing two cards with one card of any number.

But in this case, if I replace two 2's with one, say, 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:2, others:1.

Then, perform operation on two 1's, replace with one 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, others:1.

No more operations can be performed.

Total operations:2.

Initial n=7, final n=7-2=5, but example output is 1.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I can replace the two 2's with one 1 and one other number.

Wait, no, for k=2, you replace two cards with one card.

So, only one card is added back.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, let's read the problem again.

"Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged)."

So, for k=2, you choose two cards and replace them with k-1=1 card, which can be any number.

So, it's always k-1 cards added back, each can be any number.

So, in the third example, starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3], frequencies: 2:2, others:1.

Operation 1: choose two 2's, replace with one card, say a 4.

Now, frequencies: 4:2, others:1.

Operation 2: choose two 4's, replace with one 4.

Now, frequencies: 4:1, others:1.

No more operations can be performed.

Total operations:2.

Initial n=7, final n=7-2=5, but example output is 1.

So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one card of a different number that allows further operations.

Wait, in the first operation, choose two 2's and replace them with one 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:2, others:1.

Operation 2: choose two 1's and replace them with one 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, others:1.

No more operations can be performed.

Total operations:2.

Again, n=7-2=5, but example output is 1.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the two 2's with one 1 and one other number to create another pair.

Wait, no, for k=2, you can only replace with k-1=1 card.

So, only one card is added back.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that I can choose the replacement cards to maximize the number of operations.

In other words, choose the replacement cards in such a way that they can be used in future operations.

In the third example, starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3].

Operation 1: choose two 2's, replace with one 4.

Now, [4,4,1,100,5,3].

Operation 2: choose two 4's, replace with one 4.

Now, [4,1,100,5,3].

No more operations.

Total operations:2, n=7-2=5.

But example output is 1.

So, perhaps there is a better sequence of operations.

Wait, maybe I can choose different replacement cards.

Operation 1: choose two 2's, replace with one 1.

Now, [4,1,1,100,5,3].

Operation 2: choose two 1's, replace with one 1.

Now, [4,1,100,5,3].

Operation 3: choose two different cards, but they must have the same number, which they don't.

Wait, no, I can only perform operations on cards with the same number.

So, I can't perform any more operations.

Total operations:2, n=7-2=5.

Still not matching the example output of 1.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with one 100.

Then, [4,1,100,100,5,3].

Operation 2: choose two 100's, replace with one 100.

Now, [4,1,100,5,3].

No more operations.

Again, total operations:2, n=7-2=5.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I can replace the two 2's with one 5.

Then, [4,1,100,5,5,3].

Operation 2: choose two 5's, replace with one 5.

Now, [4,1,100,5,3].

No more operations.

Again, n=7-2=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe I can perform operations across different numbers, but they all need to have the same number to perform an operation.

Wait, no, operations can only be performed on k cards with the same number.

So, unless I create groups of k cards with the same number, I can't perform operations.

In this example, with k=2, I can only perform operations when there are at least two cards with the same number.

In the third example, by carefully choosing the replacement cards, I was able to perform two operations, reducing n from 7 to 5.

But according to the example output, it should be 1, which suggests that there's a way to reduce it further.

Wait, maybe I missed a step.

Let's try again.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3], frequencies: 2:2, others:1.

Operation 1: choose two 2's, replace with one 4.

Now, [4,4,1,100,5,3], frequencies: 4:2, others:1.

Operation 2: choose two 4's, replace with one 4.

Now, [4,1,100,5,3], frequencies: 4:1, others:1.

No more operations can be performed.

Total operations:2, n=7-2=5.

Wait, unless I can perform more operations by choosing different replacement cards.

Wait, perhaps in operation 2, instead of replacing two 4's with one 4, I can replace them with one 1.

Then, [1,1,100,5,3], frequencies: 1:2, others:1.

Now, operation 3: choose two 1's, replace with one 1.

Now, [1,100,5,3], frequencies: 1:1, others:1.

No more operations.

Total operations:3, n=7-3=4.

Still not matching the example output of 1.

Wait, maybe in operation 3, replace two 1's with one 100.

Then, [100,100,5,3], frequencies: 100:2, others:1.

Operation 4: choose two 100's, replace with one 100.

Now, [100,5,3], frequencies: 100:1, others:1.

No more operations.

Total operations:4, n=7-4=3.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I can replace the two 100's with one 5.

Then, [5,5,3], frequencies: 5:2, others:1.

Operation 5: choose two 5's, replace with one 5.

Now, [5,3], frequencies: 5:1, others:1.

No more operations.

Total operations:5, n=7-5=2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example output.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of this process."

In the third example, it's 1, but according to my reasoning, it's at least 2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the replacement cards.

Wait, the replacement cards can be any number I choose.

So, perhaps I can choose to replace cards in such a way as to create new groups for operations.

Wait, perhaps I can create a chain reaction by carefully selecting the replacement cards.

Let me try again.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3], frequencies: 2:2, others
