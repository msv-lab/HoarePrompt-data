Alright, I've got this problem here about three friends playing chess, and I need to figure out the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on their final scores. The scores are p1, p2, and p3, and they're sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to understand how the scoring works. In each game, two players play against each other. If one player wins, they get 2 points, and the other gets 0. If it's a draw, both players get 1 point each. Also, the same pair can play multiple times, and there could be zero games played.

So, the total points distributed in each game are either 2 (in case of a win and loss) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, no, in a draw, both get 1 point, so total 2 points per game, regardless of whether it's a win/loss or a draw.

Wait, actually, that's not correct. In a win/loss scenario, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0, so total 2 points. In a draw, both get 1 point, so total 2 points again. So, each game always contributes exactly 2 points to the total sum of all players' points.

Given that, the total points sum is p1 + p2 + p3, and since each game contributes exactly 2 points, the total number of games played, say g, should satisfy 2g = p1 + p2 + p3. Therefore, p1 + p2 + p3 must be even; otherwise, it's impossible, and we should output -1.

So, in the code, it checks if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0, and if so, it prints -1. That makes sense.

Now, if the sum is even, we can proceed. The code then computes x = (a + b + c) // 2. Since each game contributes 2 points, x represents the total number of games played, because 2 * x = a + b + c.

Next, it computes y = a + b. I need to understand what y represents. Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 is the highest score. y = a + b is the sum of the two lower scores.

The code then prints min(x, y). So, it's taking the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the two lower scores.

I need to see why this would give the maximum number of draws.

Let me think about it differently. In each draw, two players each get 1 point, so together they get 2 points. In a win/loss game, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0, so total 2 points again.

But in terms of maximizing draws, I need to maximize the number of games where both players get 1 point each.

Let’s consider that in order to maximize draws, I should maximize the number of games where both players get 1 point, rather than having games with a winner and a loser.

Wait, but in terms of the total points, both types of games contribute the same total points, which is 2 per game. So, the total points don't distinguish between draws and win/loss games.

However, the individual scores do differ based on whether games are draws or win/loss.

In a draw, both players involved get 1 point each. In a win/loss game, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

Given that, if I have a certain number of draws, it affects the individual scores differently than win/loss games.

I need to maximize the number of draws, which means maximizing the number of games where both players get 1 point each, while still achieving the given final scores p1, p2, p3.

Let me consider that in order to maximize draws, I should minimize the number of win/loss games.

Each win/loss game contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, whereas a draw contributes 1 point to each player involved.

Given that, if I have a certain number of win/loss games, it will affect the distribution of points among the players.

I need to ensure that the final scores are p1, p2, p3.

Let me consider the total points again. Since each game contributes 2 points, the total number of games is g = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, I need to maximize the number of games where both players get 1 point each.

Let’s denote d as the number of draws.

Then, the total points from draws would be 2d (since each draw contributes 2 points in total).

The remaining games are win/loss games, and there are g - d of them, each contributing 2 points to one player.

So, the total points can be expressed as:

Total points = 2d + 2(g - d) = 2g, which matches p1 + p2 + p3.

But this doesn't directly help me find d.

I need to find the maximum possible d such that the individual scores p1, p2, p3 can be achieved.

Let me think about the constraints on the individual scores.

Each player's score is the sum of the points they gained from all the games they participated in.

In a draw, a player gets 1 point.

In a win/loss game, a player gets either 0 or 2 points.

Given that, I need to distribute the points among the players based on the games they played.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look back at the code. It computes x = (a + b + c) // 2, which is the total number of games g.

Then, it computes y = a + b, which is the sum of the two lower scores.

Finally, it prints min(x, y).

I need to see why min(x, y) would represent the maximum number of draws.

Let me consider what y = a + b represents. Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, a + b is the sum of the two lower scores.

In terms of draws, each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point.

So, the total points from draws would be distributed among the players involved in those draws.

To maximize draws, I need to maximize the number of games where both players get 1 point each, without exceeding the individual score limits.

Now, the sum of the two lower scores is a + b.

In order to maximize draws, the maximum possible draws would be limited by the sum of the two lower scores because those are the players who would be getting 1 point each in a draw.

However, I need to make sure that the third player's score is also achievable given the number of draws and win/loss games.

Wait, perhaps min(x, y) makes sense because:

- x is the total number of games.

- y is the sum of the two lower scores.

The maximum number of draws is limited by both the total number of games and the sum of the two lower scores.

But I need to verify if this is indeed correct.

Let me consider some examples.

First example in the input:

0 0 0

Here, a + b + c = 0, so x = 0, y = 0 + 0 = 0, so min(x, y) = 0, which matches the output.

Second example:

0 1 1

a + b + c = 2, so x = 1, y = 0 + 1 = 1, min(x, y) = 1, which matches the output.

In this case, there was one game between player 2 and player 3, which was a draw, giving each 1 point, matching the scores.

Third example:

1 1 1

a + b + c = 3, which is odd, so it's impossible, and the code would output -1, which matches the sample output.

Fourth example:

1 1 2

a + b + c = 4, which is even, x = 2, y = 1 + 1 = 2, min(x, y) = 2.

Is this possible? Let's see.

Possible games:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: both get 1 point. Scores: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 3 vs Player 1, draw: P1=2, P3=1, P2=1.

But that would make P1=2, P2=1, P3=1, which doesn't match the required p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, so maybe two draws don't lead to the required scores.

Alternative approach:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins: P3=2, P2=1, P1=1.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, with one draw and one win/loss game. So, only one draw in this case.

But according to the code, it would output 2, but according to this, only one draw is possible.

Hmm, maybe the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me check the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Sample Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

In the fourth example, the code would output 2, but according to my earlier reasoning, only one draw is possible. So, maybe my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that draws can involve different pairs.

Let me try to find a way to achieve two draws with scores 1,1,2.

Suppose:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw: P1=2, P3=1, P2=1.

This matches p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, but we need p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternative:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw: P2=2, P3=1, P1=1.

This gives p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Alternative:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw: P1=1, P3=1, P2=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins: P3=2, P2=0, P1=1.

This gives p1=1, p2=0, p3=2, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Another attempt:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, Player 2 wins: P2=2, P1=0, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 2 loses: P2=2, P3=2, P1=0.

But this gives p1=0, p2=2, p3=2, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

It seems like it's not possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws. The code outputs 2, but based on my attempts, only one draw is possible. So perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think about the constraints more carefully.

Let’s denote:

- d_ab: number of draws between player a and b.

- d_ac: number of draws between a and c.

- d_bc: number of draws between b and c.

Similarly, we can have w_ab, w_ac, w_bc for the number of wins for a against b, etc.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, let’s consider the total number of draws, d, and the total number of win/loss games, w.

We have d + w = g, where g is the total number of games.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved, and each win/loss game contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

Let’s denote:

- For player 1: p1 = sum of 1 for each draw involving player 1 + 2 for each win for player 1.

Similarly for players 2 and 3.

So, p1 = d1 + 2w1, where d1 is the number of draws involving player 1, and w1 is the number of wins for player 1.

Similarly, p2 = d2 + 2w2, and p3 = d3 + 2w3.

Now, d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d, because each draw involves two players.

Similarly, w1 + w2 + w3 = w, since each win/loss game contributes one win.

But, in win/loss games, for each game, one player wins and the other loses.

So, actually, w1 + w2 + w3 = w, and d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d.

Now, summing up p1 + p2 + p3 = (d1 + 2w1) + (d2 + 2w2) + (d3 + 2w3) = (d1 + d2 + d3) + 2(w1 + w2 + w3) = 2d + 2w = 2(g), which matches the total points.

But I need to maximize d, the number of draws.

Given that, d can be up to g, but I need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved.

Now, to maximize d, I need to minimize w.

But w is constrained by the individual scores.

Specifically, for each player, their score is p_i = d_i + 2w_i.

Since d_i can be at most d (because d is the total number of draws, and d_i is the number of draws involving player i), and w_i can be at most g - d (since w = g - d).

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me consider the sum of p1 and p2.

p1 + p2 = d1 + d2 + 2w1 + 2w2.

But d1 + d2 is equal to 2d - d3, because d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the sum of p1 and p2 is p1 + p2 = d1 + d2 + 2w1 + 2w2.

But d1 + d2 = 2d - d3.

So, p1 + p2 = 2d - d3 + 2w1 + 2w2.

I'm not sure if this is helping.

Let me look back at the code again.

It computes y = a + b, which is p1 + p2.

Then, it takes min(x, y), where x is the total number of games, g.

So, min(g, p1 + p2).

In the earlier example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

g = (1 + 1 + 2)/2 = 2.

y = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, min(2,2) = 2.

But as I tried earlier, it seems like only one draw is possible, not two.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let me see another sample input.

Fifth example:

3 3 3

a + b + c = 9, which is odd, so it's impossible, and the code outputs -1, which matches the sample output.

Sixth example:

3 4 5

a + b + c = 12, which is even, x = 6, y = 3 + 4 = 7, min(x, y) = 6.

The sample output is 6.

Is this possible?

Let me see.

Total games are 6.

All 6 games could be draws, but that would require each draw to involve two players, and both get 1 point each.

If all 6 games are draws, then each player would have points equal to the number of draws they participated in.

But with three players, the maximum number of draws is limited by the number of pairs.

Wait, but players can play multiple games against the same opponent.

So, it's possible to have multiple draws between the same pair.

So, for example, if player 1 and player 2 play 3 draws, player 1 and player 3 play 2 draws, and player 2 and player 3 play 1 draw, that would be 6 draws in total.

But then, player 1 would have points equal to 3 (from draws with player 2) + 2 (from draws with player 3) = 5.

Player 2 would have 3 (from draws with player 1) + 1 (from draws with player 3) = 4.

Player 3 would have 2 (from draws with player 1) + 1 (from draws with player 2) = 3.

So, p1=5, p2=4, p3=3, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Wait, maybe a different distribution.

Alternatively, maybe some games are win/loss.

But the code suggests that the maximum number of draws is 6, which seems possible in terms of the total number of games, but the distribution of points needs to match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

In the earlier example, with 6 draws, I got p1=5, p2=4, p3=3, which is close but not exactly p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, perhaps a different combination is needed.

Alternatively, maybe some games are win/loss.

For example, out of 6 games:

- Suppose there are d draws and w win/loss games, with d + w = 6.

- Total points: 2d (from draws) + 2w (from win/loss) = 2(d + w) = 12, which matches.

But I need to distribute the points such that p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

This seems a bit involved, but perhaps it's possible.

Given that, the code outputs 6, which seems acceptable, as per the sample output.

Seventh example:

1 1 10

a + b + c = 12, which is even, x = 6, y = 1 + 1 = 2, min(x, y) = 2.

Sample output is 2.

Is this possible?

Let me see.

If there are 2 draws, say between player 1 and player 2, both getting 1 point each in each draw, then p1=2, p2=2, p3=0 after 2 draws.

Then, to reach p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, it doesn't seem possible because p3 would need to gain 10 points, which would require 5 win/loss games where player 3 wins, but that would require playing against someone.

But p1 and p2 have only 1 point each, which is less than what they had after the draws.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the draws.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect in some cases.

Given that, perhaps the code is not always correct.

Wait, but in the sample input, for the seventh case, the output is 2, but I'm having trouble seeing how that's possible.

Maybe I need to accept that the code is correct based on the sample inputs and outputs, even if I can't see how in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me look for a general approach.

Given that each draw contributes 1 point to two players, and each win/loss game contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, I need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the total points for each player match p1, p2, p3.

Let’s denote d as the number of draws, and w as the number of win/loss games.

Then, d + w = g, where g = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Now, for each player, their score is p_i = d_i + 2w_i, where d_i is the number of draws involving player i, and w_i is the number of win/loss games that player i won.

Since each draw involves two players, the sum of d_i over all players is 2d.

Similarly, the sum of w_i over all players is w, because each win/loss game has exactly one winner.

So, we have:

p1 + p2 + p3 = (d1 + d2 + d3) + 2(w1 + w2 + w3) = 2d + 2w = 2(g), which checks out.

But I need to maximize d, subject to the constraints that for each player, p_i = d_i + 2w_i, and d_i <= d, w_i <= w, with the additional constraints that d_i and w_i are non-negative integers, and the pairs involved in draws and win/loss games are consistent.

This seems like a system of equations with inequalities, which is getting complicated.

Perhaps there's a simpler way to find the maximum possible d.

Let me consider that in order to maximize d, I need to maximize the sum of d_i for all pairs involved in draws.

But since d_i is counted twice (once for each player in the draw), I need to ensure that the sum of p_i minus 2w_i equals d_i, and d_i is consistent across the players.

This is getting too involved.

Looking back at the code, it seems to suggest that the maximum number of draws is the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the two lower scores.

In the fourth example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, so y = 1 + 1 = 2, and x = 2, so min(x, y) = 2.

But as I tried earlier, it seems only one draw is possible, not two.

Therefore, the code might be incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible distributions.

Given that, perhaps the code is correct, and my intuition is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, and I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the number of draws, d, and try to see if the scores p1, p2, p3 can be achieved.

Given d, the total points from draws would be 2d (since each draw contributes 2 points).

The remaining points, (p1 + p2 + p3) - 2d, must come from win/loss games, but since each win/loss game also contributes 2 points, the number of win/loss games would be w = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2d)/2.

But p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g, so w = (2g - 2d)/2 = g - d.

Now, for each player, their score is p_i = d_i + 2w_i, where d_i is the number of draws involving player i, and w_i is the number of win/loss games that player i won.

Also, the sum of d_i over all players is 2d, and the sum of w_i over all players is w = g - d.

Now, to maximize d, I need to maximize d such that for each player, p_i >= d_i, and p_i - d_i must be even, since w_i = (p_i - d_i)/2.

Wait, p_i = d_i + 2w_i => p_i - d_i must be even, and non-negative.

So, for the maximum d, d should be as large as possible, but d_i cannot exceed p_i, and the sum of d_i over all players is 2d.

So, 2d <= sum_{i=1 to 3} p_i - (p_i - d_i) must hold, but this seems messy.

Perhaps a better way is to consider that the sum of d_i is 2d, and d_i <= p_i for each i.

Therefore, 2d <= sum_{i=1 to 3} p_i - p_i + d_i = sum_{i=1 to 3} d_i = 2d.

Wait, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, since d_i <= p_i for each i, and sum_{i=1 to 3} d_i = 2d, then 2d <= sum_{i=1 to 3} p_i.

But sum_{i=1 to 3} p_i = 2g, so 2d <= 2g => d <= g, which we already know.

But to maximize d, we need to maximize it while ensuring that for each player, p_i >= d_i, and p_i - d_i is even (since w_i = (p_i - d_i)/2 must be integer).

Given that p1 <= p2 <= p3, and we need to maximize d, perhaps the limiting factor is the sum of p1 and p2.

Because p1 and p2 are the lower scores, the maximum d is limited by how much p1 and p2 can contribute to draws.

In other words, the maximum d is the minimum of g and p1 + p2, because p1 and p2 together can only support up to p1 + p2 points from draws, and g is the total number of games.

Therefore, the code's approach of taking min(x, y), where x = g and y = p1 + p2, seems reasonable.

In the fourth example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, so y = 2, x = 2, min(x, y) = 2.

Even if it seems counterintuitive, perhaps it's possible to achieve two draws with these scores.

Let me try again.

Suppose:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins: P2=1, P3=2, P1=1.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, with one draw and one win/loss game.

But according to the code, it outputs 2, suggesting two draws are possible.

Perhaps there's another way to interpret this.

Wait, maybe if player 1 and player 3 play a draw in the second game:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw: P1=2, P3=1, P2=1.

But this gives p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Alternatively:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw: P1=1, P2=1, P3=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw: P2=2, P3=1, P1=1.

This gives p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which doesn't match.

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw: P1=1, P3=1, P2=0.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins: P2=0, P3=2, P1=1.

This gives p1=1, p2=0, p3=2, which doesn't match.

It seems like no combination of two draws can achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Therefore, the code is incorrect in this case.

Given that, perhaps the code is not always correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a possible sequence of games.

Let me consider if there are more than two games.

Wait, in this case, g = (1 + 1 + 2)/2 = 2, so only two games were played.

So, only two games were played, and I've tried all possible combinations of two games, and none of them achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws.

Therefore, it's not possible to have two draws in this scenario, and the code is incorrect because it outputs 2, but it should be 1.

Therefore, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
