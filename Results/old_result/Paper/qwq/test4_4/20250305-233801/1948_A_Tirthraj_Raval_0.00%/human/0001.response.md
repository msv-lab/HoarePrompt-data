Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. Let's look at the example provided: in the string "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left, assuming circular) and 'A' (right). But wait, is it circular? No, probably not. So left neighbor doesn't exist, right neighbor is 'A'. So it's equal to one neighbor? Wait, but 'A' equals 'A', so it's equal to its only neighbor. So yes, it's special.

- Position 2: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It's equal to both neighbors, so it's not special.

- Position 3: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'B' (right). It's equal to one neighbor, so it's special.

- Position 4: 'B' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It's equal to neither neighbor, so it's not special.

- Position 5: 'A' - neighbors are 'B' (left) and 'A' (right). Equal to one neighbor, so special.

- Position 6: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'C' (right). Equal to one neighbor, so special.

- Position 7: 'C' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'C' (right). Equal to one neighbor, so special.

- Position 8: 'C' - neighbors are 'C' (left) and assuming no right neighbor. Equal to its only neighbor, so special.

Okay, that matches the example.

Now, I need to build such a string for a given n. The string should be of uppercase letters, and the number of special characters should be exactly n.

Constraints:

- t is up to 50, so multiple test cases.

- n is from 1 to 50.

- The output string can be up to 200 characters.

I need to decide for each test case whether such a string exists, and if it does, provide one.

First, think about the properties of special characters.

A character is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

So, for a character at position i:

- If it's at the start or end, it has only one neighbor.

- If it's in the middle, it has two neighbors.

Let's consider different cases.

Case 1: String of length 1.

- Only one character, which has no neighbors, so no special characters. So n=0.

- But n starts from 1, so no special characters only when n=0, which is not in the input range.

Case 2: String of length 2.

- "AB": 'A' has 'B' as neighbor, so not equal, not special.

- 'B' has 'A' as neighbor, not equal, not special.

- Total special characters: 0.

- "AA": 'A' has 'A' as neighbor, equal to both neighbors (only one in this case), so not special.

- Total special characters: 0.

- "AB": 0 special.

- "AA": 0 special.

- So, length 2 can only have 0 special characters.

Wait, but according to the example, n=2 has a solution "MM". Wait, but "MM" has length 2, and both 'M's have only one neighbor, which is 'M', so they are equal to their only neighbor, so not special. So, total special characters: 0.

But the example shows for n=2, "MM" is a solution, but according to this, it has 0 special characters, not 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in "MM", each 'M' has only one neighbor, which is 'M', so it's equal to its only neighbor. According to the definition, a character is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors. In this case, each 'M' is equal to its only neighbor, which means it's equal to one neighbor (the only one it has). So, each 'M' is special.

So, in "MM", both characters are special. So, total special characters: 2.

Ah, I see. So, for characters at the ends, if they have only one neighbor and are equal to that neighbor, they are special because they are equal to exactly one neighbor.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

In "MM":

- First 'M' has only one neighbor 'M', and it's equal to it, so equal to one neighbor.

- Second 'M' has only one neighbor 'M', and it's equal to it, so equal to one neighbor.

So, both are special, total special characters: 2.

In "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to its only neighbor 'A', so special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to both neighbors 'A' and 'A', so not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to one neighbor 'B', so special.

- Position 4: 'B' not equal to any neighbor, so not special.

- Position 5: 'A' equal to one neighbor 'A', so special.

- Position 6: 'A' equal to one neighbor 'C', so special.

- Position 7: 'C' equal to one neighbor 'C', so special.

- Position 8: 'C' equal to its only neighbor 'C', so special.

Total: positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which is 6.

Okay, so for n=2, "MM" is a valid solution.

Similarly, for n=1, is there any string?

Wait, for n=1:

- If string length is 1, no neighbors, so 0 special characters.

- If string length is 2, as in "MM", both are special, so total 2.

- If string length is 3, e.g., "MMA":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'M', special.

- Position 2: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'A', so not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'M', so special.

- Total special characters: positions 1 and 3, which is 2.

- If "MAB":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'A', so special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to 'M' and 'B', so not special.

- Position 3: 'B' equal to 'A', so special.

- Total: positions 1 and 3, which is 2.

- If "AAA":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to both 'A's, not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 3, which is 2.

- If "AAB":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 3: 'B' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 3, which is 2.

It seems that for strings of length 3, the number of special characters is always 2.

What about length 4?

- "MMMA":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'M', special.

- Position 2: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'M', not special.

- Position 3: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'A', special.

- Position 4: 'A' equal to 'M', special.

- Total: positions 1,3,4, which is 3.

- "MAMA":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to 'M' and 'M', not special.

- Position 3: 'M' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'A' equal to 'M', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 4, which is 2.

- "ABAC":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 2: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'B' and 'C', special.

- Position 4: 'C' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,3,4, which is 3.

So, for n=3, strings like "MMMA" or "ABAC" have 3 special characters.

Wait, but in "MMMA", position 2 is not special, so total is 3.

Is there a string with exactly 1 special character?

Let's try:

- "A": length 1, 0 special.

- "AA": length 2, 0 special.

- "AAA": length 3, 2 special.

- "AAAA": length 4, 2 special.

- "AAABAACC": length 8, 6 special.

- "M": length 1, 0 special.

- "MM": length 2, 2 special.

- "MMM": length 3, 2 special.

- "MMMM": length 4, 2 special.

Wait, in "MMM", positions 1 and 3 are special, positions 2 is not.

Wait, in "MMM":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'M', special.

- Position 2: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'M', not special.

- Position 3: 'M' equal to 'M', special.

- Total: 2 special.

In "AAAA":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 4, which is 2.

In "ABAC":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 2: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'B' and 'C', special.

- Position 4: 'C' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,3,4, which is 3.

Is there a way to have exactly 1 special character?

Let's try:

- "AB": length 2, positions:

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - 'B' equal to 'A', special.

  - Total: 2 special.

- "ABA": length 3, positions:

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - 'B' equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - Total: 2 special.

- "ABBA": length 4, positions:

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

  - 'B' equal to 'B' and 'A', not special.

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - Total: 2 special.

- "ABC": length 3, positions:

  - 'A' equal to 'B', special.

  - 'B' equal to 'A' and 'C', not special.

  - 'C' equal to 'B', special.

  - Total: 2 special.

It seems that for even-length strings with repeating patterns, the number of special characters is even, and for some odd-length strings, it's odd.

Wait, in "MMMA", which is length 4, we have 3 special characters.

Wait, in "MMMA":

- Position 1: 'M' equal to 'M', special.

- Position 2: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'M', not special.

- Position 3: 'M' equal to 'M' and 'A', special.

- Position 4: 'A' equal to 'M', special.

- Total: 3 special.

So, it's possible to have an odd number of special characters.

But in the example, for n=1, the answer is "NO". So, perhaps it's not possible to have exactly n=1.

Wait, but in "MMMA", we have n=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.

Let's try to find a general approach.

I need to build a string where the number of special characters is exactly n.

First, observe that for a character to be special, it must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

So, for internal characters (not at the ends), they have two neighbors.

- If they are equal to one neighbor and different from the other, they are special.

- If they are equal to both or different from both, they are not special.

For end characters, they have only one neighbor.

- If they are equal to that neighbor, they are special.

- If they are different, they are not special.

So, to maximize the number of special characters, I can create a string where end characters are equal to their only neighbor, and internal characters are equal to one neighbor and different from the other.

For example, "ABABAB...AB", alternating characters.

In such a string, end characters are special, and internal characters are not special because they are different from both neighbors.

Wait, in "ABABAB":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 2: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'B' and 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 5: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 6: 'B' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,5,6 are special, which is 3.

Wait, n=3.

If I make the string longer: "ABABABAB":

- Positions 1,5,7,8 are special: positions 1,5,7,8.

- Wait, position 1: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 2: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'B' and 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 5: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 6: 'B' equal to 'A' and 'B', not special.

- Position 7: 'A' equal to 'B', special.

- Position 8: 'B' equal to 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,5,7,8 are special, which is 4.

So, for "ABABABAB", n=4.

Similarly, "ABABABABAB" would have more special characters.

Wait, but this seems inconsistent with getting exactly n special characters.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let's consider building a string where only the characters I want to be special are set to be equal to one neighbor, and others are set not to be special.

This might get complicated.

Another idea: try to build a string where the number of special characters is exactly n, and see for which n it's possible.

Let's think about the minimal and maximal number of special characters for a string of a given length.

For a string of length k:

- Minimal number of special characters: 0. For example, "AAA...AA", all characters are equal, so internal characters are equal to both neighbors, and end characters are equal to their only neighbor. So, no special characters.

- Maximal number of special characters: k. For example, "ABABAB...AB", alternating characters, end characters are special, and internal characters are not special.

Wait, in "ABABAB":

- Positions 1,5,6 are special: 3 special characters.

- In "ABABABAB": positions 1,5,7,8 are special: 4 special characters.

- So, not all characters are special.

Wait, perhaps the maximal number of special characters is when the string is composed of alternating characters, like "ABABAB...", which seems to have roughly half of the characters being special.

Wait, in "ABABABAB":

- Length 8, 4 special characters.

In "ABABAB":

- Length 6, 3 special characters.

So, it's seems like for every two characters, one is special.

Wait, in "ABABABAB":

- Special positions: 1,5,7,8.

- So, positions 1,5,7,8 are special.

- That's every other character, more or less.

Wait, maybe the number of special characters is related to the number of times the character changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of runs of the same character.

Let's consider runs of characters.

A run is a sequence of identical characters.

For example, in "AAABAACC":

- "AAA" (run of 3 A's)

- "B" (run of 1 B)

- "AA" (run of 2 A's)

- "CC" (run of 2 C's)

In this string, the special characters are at the transitions between different runs.

Wait, in "AAABAACC":

- Run 1: "AAA" (positions 1,2,3)

- Run 2: "B" (position 4)

- Run 3: "AA" (positions 5,6)

- Run 4: "CC" (positions 7,8)

Now, special characters are:

- Positions 1,3 (from run 1)

- Position 5 (from run 3)

- Position 6 (from run 3)

- Position 7 (from run 4)

- Position 8 (from run 4)

So, in run 1: positions 1 and 3 are special.

In run 3: positions 5 and 6 are special.

In run 4: positions 7 and 8 are special.

Run 2: position 4 is not special because it's a single character run, and it's equal to neither neighbor.

So, in general, for a run of length l:

- If l == 1: the single character is special if it's equal to its neighbor.

- If l > 1: the first and last characters in the run are special (since they are equal to one neighbor and different from the other).

Wait, let's verify that.

In "AAA":

- Position 1: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equal to both 'A's, not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equal to 'A', special.

So, first and last positions in the run are special.

In "AAABAACC":

- Run 1: "AAA" positions 1,2,3: positions 1 and 3 are special.

- Run 2: "B" position 4: equal to neither neighbor, not special.

- Run 3: "AA" positions 5,6: positions 5 and 6 are special.

- Run 4: "CC" positions 7,8: positions 7 and 8 are special.

Total: positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special.

So, for runs of length >1, first and last positions are special.

For runs of length 1, the character is special only if it's equal to its neighbor.

Wait, in "AB":

- "A" equal to 'B', special.

- "B" equal to 'A', special.

- So, both are special.

In "ABA":

- "A" equal to 'B', special.

- "B" equal to 'A' and 'A', not special.

- "A" equal to 'B', special.

So, in run of length 1 in the middle, it's not special if neighbors are different.

Wait, but in "AB", both are special because each is equal to its only neighbor.

In "ABA", the middle 'B' is not special because it's equal to both neighbors ('A' and 'A'), but in this case, 'B' is equal to neither 'A's, so it's not special.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in "AB":

- 'A' has 'B' as neighbor, 'A' != 'B', so not special.

- 'B' has 'A' as neighbor, 'B' != 'A', so not special.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, in "AB", no characters are special because each character is not equal to its neighbor.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me re-read the problem.

"A special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

In "AB":

- 'A' has 'B' as neighbor. 'A' != 'B', so 'A' is not equal to its only neighbor. So, not special.

- 'B' has 'A' as neighbor. 'B' != 'A', so 'B' is not equal to its only neighbor. So, not special.

So, in "AB", no special characters.

Wait, but earlier I thought "AB" had two special characters, but that was a mistake.

So, in "AB", no special characters.

In "AA":

- 'A' has 'A' as neighbor. 'A' == 'A', so it's equal to its only neighbor. So, special.

- 'A' has 'A' as neighbor. 'A' == 'A', so special.

So, both are special.

In "ABA":

- 'A' has 'B' as neighbor, 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' has 'A' and 'A' as neighbors, 'B' != 'A', so not special.

- 'A' has 'B' as neighbor, 'A' != 'B', not special.

So, in "ABA", no special characters.

Wait, but earlier analysis showed positions 1 and 3 are special, but according to this, none are special.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Let me correct that.

In "AA":

- Both 'A's have 'A' as neighbor, so equal to their only neighbor, so special.

In "ABA":

- 'A' (position 1): 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (position 2): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', so not special.

- 'A' (position 3): 'A' != 'B', not special.

So, in "ABA", no special characters.

In "ABABABAB":

- 'A' (1): 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (2): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- 'A' (3): 'A' != 'B' and 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (4): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- 'A' (5): 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (6): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- 'A' (7): 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (8): 'B' != 'A', not special.

So, in "ABABABAB", no special characters.

Wait, but earlier I thought positions 1,5,7,8 were special, but according to this, none are special.

I must have misapplied the definition.

So, to clarify:

A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

- For end characters, they have only one neighbor, so they are special if they are equal to that neighbor.

- For internal characters, they have two neighbors, so they are special if they are equal to exactly one of them.

So, in "AA":

- Both 'A's are equal to their only neighbor, so both are special.

In "ABA":

- 'A' (1): 'A' != 'B', not special.

- 'B' (2): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- 'A' (3): 'A' != 'B', not special.

So, no special characters.

In "ABABABAB":

- All characters are not equal to their neighbors, so no special characters.

In "AAABAACC":

- 'A' (1): 'A' == 'A', special.

- 'A' (2): 'A' == 'A', not special (since equal to both neighbors).

- 'A' (3): 'A' == 'B', special.

- 'B' (4): 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- 'A' (5): 'A' == 'A', special.

- 'A' (6): 'A' == 'C', special.

- 'C' (7): 'C' == 'C', special.

- 'C' (8): 'C' == 'A', special.

Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, in "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right neighbor), special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right), not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'B' (right), special.

- Position 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'B' != 'A' (right), not special.

- Position 5: 'A' == 'A' (right), special.

- Position 6: 'A' == 'C' (right), special.

- Position 7: 'C' == 'C' (right), special.

- Position 8: 'C' == 'A' (right), special.

Wait, but position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right), so it's equal to both neighbors, so not special.

Position 3: 'A' == 'B' (right), so equal to one neighbor, special.

Position 6: 'A' == 'C' (right), so equal to one neighbor, special.

So, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which is 6.

Okay, now I see.

So, in general, for a character to be special:

- If it has one neighbor, it's special if it's equal to that neighbor.

- If it has two neighbors, it's special if it's equal to exactly one of them.

Now, I need to build a string where the total number of such characters is exactly n.

I need to find a string where the count of special characters is exactly n.

Given that, I need to find for each n from 1 to 50, if such a string exists, and if so, provide one.

First, let's see for small n:

n=1:

Is there a string with exactly one special character?

Let's try:

- "A": length 1, no neighbors, so 0 special characters.

- "AA": length 2, both 'A's equal to their only neighbor, so 2 special characters.

- "ABA": length 3, positions 1 and 3 are special ('A' == 'B'), but in "ABA", 'A' != 'B', so not special.

Wait, in "ABA":

- Position 1: 'A' != 'B', not special.

- Position 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' != 'B', not special.

So, 0 special characters.

- "AAB": length 3,

  - Position 1: 'A' == 'A', special.

  - Position 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'B', not special.

  - Position 3: 'B' == 'A', special.

  - Total: positions 1 and 3 are special, so 2 special characters.

- "ABBA": length 4,

  - Position 1: 'A' == 'B', special.

  - Position 2: 'B' == 'B', special.

  - Position 3: 'B' == 'A', special.

  - Position 4: 'A' == 'B', special.

  - Total: 4 special characters.

- "ABAC": length 4,

  - Position 1: 'A' == 'B', special.

  - Position 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

  - Position 3: 'A' == 'C', special.

  - Position 4: 'C' == 'A', special.

  - Total: positions 1,3,4 are special, so 3 special characters.

- "ABC": length 3,

  - Position 1: 'A' == 'B', special.

  - Position 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

  - Position 3: 'C' == 'B', special.

  - Wait, 'C' != 'B', so not special.

  - So, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

Wait, in "ABC":

- 'A' != 'B', so not special.

- 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

- 'C' != 'B', not special.

So, 0 special characters.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in "ABAC":

- Position 1: 'A' != 'B', not special.

- Position 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'C', special.

- Position 4: 'C' == 'A', special.

Wait, in "ABAC", positions 3 and 4 are special, so total 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in "ABAC", position 1: 'A' != 'B', not special.

Position 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

Position 3: 'A' == 'C', special.

Position 4: 'C' == 'A', special.

Total: 2 special characters.

So, seems like it's hard to get exactly 1 special character.

Let's try:

- "AB": length 2, no special characters.

- "AAB": length 3, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

- "AAAB": length 4, positions 1,3,4 are special, total 3.

Wait, in "AAAB":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'B', special.

- Position 4: 'B' == 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,3,4 are special, total 3.

So, n=3.

Is there a string with n=1?

Let's try:

- "A": n=0.

- "AA": n=2.

- "AAA": n=2 (positions 1 and 3 are special).

- "AAAA": n=2 (positions 1 and 4 are special).

- "AAAB": n=3.

- "AAB": n=2.

- "ABAB": n=4.

- "ABC": n=0.

- "ABAC": n=2.

- "ABBA": n=4.

It seems challenging to get n=1.

Perhaps it's impossible.

Looking back at the example, for n=1, the answer is "NO".

So, it seems that for n=1, it's impossible to have exactly one special character.

Similarly, for n=2, "MM" is a solution, which has n=2.

For n=6, "AAABAACC" is a solution.

So, perhaps in general, for n even, it's possible, and for n odd, it's impossible.

Looking at the above examples, it seems that n must be even.

Because in all the strings I've tried, the number of special characters is even.

Wait, in "AAAB", n=3, which is odd.

Wait, earlier I thought "AAAB" has n=3, but let's recheck:

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'B', special.

- Position 4: 'B' == 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1,3,4 are special, n=3.

Wait, that contradicts the earlier assumption that n must be even.

But in the example, for n=1, "NO", for n=2, "MM", for n=6, "AAABAACC".

Wait, maybe there's another condition.

Wait, perhaps n cannot be 1, but can be odd in some other cases.

Wait, in "AAAB", n=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

But in the example, for n=1, it's "NO".

Wait, perhaps n cannot be 1, but can be other odd numbers.

Wait, but in "AAAB", n=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

So, perhaps n can be any number except 1.

But in the example, for n=1, it's "NO", but for n=3, it's possible.

So, maybe n can be any even number and any odd number greater than 1.

But in "AAAB", n=3, which is possible.

Wait, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the structure of the string.

Alternatively, maybe n can be any number except 1.

But need to verify.

Wait, in "AA", n=2.

"AAA", n=2.

"AAAA", n=2.

"AAAB", n=3.

"AAAAA", let's see:

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 5: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 5 are special, n=2.

So, in "AAAAA", n=2.

Wait, contrary to earlier thought.

Wait, in "AAAAA":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 3: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 4: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Position 5: 'A' == 'A', special.

- Total: positions 1 and 5 are special, n=2.

So, n=2.

Similarly, in "AAAA", n=2.

In "AAA", n=2.

In "AA", n=2.

In "A", n=0.

So, for strings of all even lengths with all identical characters, n=2.

Wait, no.

Wait, in "AA", both 'A's are special, so n=2.

In "AAA", positions 1 and 3 are special, n=2.

In "AAAA", positions 1 and 4 are special, n=2.

So, in all these cases, n=2.

Wait, but in "AAAB", n=3.

So, perhaps n can be any integer greater than or equal to 2.

But in the example, for n=1, it's "NO", and for n=2, it's "YES" with "MM".

For n=6
