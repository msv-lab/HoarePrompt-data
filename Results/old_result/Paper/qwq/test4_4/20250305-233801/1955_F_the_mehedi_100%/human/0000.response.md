Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. This continues until there are no numbers left. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics. The key here is the bitwise XOR of the sequence. XOR has some properties that are important to consider:

1. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR the numbers doesn't matter.

2. XOR with itself cancels out to zero. So, if a number appears an even number of times, its contribution to the overall XOR is zero.

3. XOR of a sequence is zero if the XOR of the unique numbers (considering their parity) is zero.

Given that the numbers are only up to 4, the possible numbers are 0,1,2,3,4. But from the input, it seems 0 is not included since it mentions p_i for ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, the numbers are 1,2,3,4.

Wait, actually, the problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4", but in the input description, it's p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) for ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, the numbers are 1,2,3,4.

But in the example, there are zeros in the input, which might represent the count of a particular number.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

So, p0 is the count of 1s, p1 is the count of 2s, p2 is the count of 3s, and p3 is the count of 4s.

Alright, so the sequence consists of p0 ones, p1 twos, p2 threes, and p3 fours.

Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, they check if the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero or non-zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which means maximizing the number of times the XOR is zero.

So, I need to find out, for each possible step, whether the XOR of the current sequence is zero or not, and Eve can choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

This sounds a bit tricky. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand how the XOR changes as Eve removes numbers.

Let me consider the initial XOR of all the numbers.

Given that the sequence consists of p0 ones, p1 twos, p2 threes, and p3 fours, I can compute the XOR as follows:

XOR = (1 XOR 1 XOR ... p0 times) XOR (2 XOR 2 XOR ... p1 times) XOR (3 XOR 3 XOR ... p2 times) XOR (4 XOR 4 XOR ... p3 times)

But since XOR of a number with itself is zero, if a number appears an even number of times, its contribution is zero. If it appears an odd number of times, its contribution is the number itself.

So, the initial XOR is the XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

Therefore, initial XOR = (1 if p0 is odd else 0) XOR (2 if p1 is odd else 0) XOR (3 if p2 is odd else 0) XOR (4 if p3 is odd else 0)

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the XOR changes.

Suppose Eve removes a number x, which is either 1,2,3, or 4.

After removal, the new XOR would be the current XOR XOR x.

Because removing x is equivalent to toggling its contribution in the XOR.

So, if x was contributing to the XOR, removing it removes its contribution, and if it wasn't contributing, removing it adds its contribution.

Wait, no. Actually, since removing x is like XORing with x again.

Let me think carefully.

If x was appearing an odd number of times before removal, after removal, it appears an even number of times, so its contribution to the XOR becomes zero.

If x was appearing an even number of times before removal, after removal, it appears an odd number of times, so its contribution to the XOR becomes x.

So, in either case, removing x toggles its contribution in the XOR.

Therefore, the new XOR after removing x is the old XOR XOR x.

So, if the current XOR is y, after removing x, the new XOR becomes y XOR x.

Now, Bob wins when the XOR is zero.

So, Eve wants to choose x such that y XOR x = 0, which means x = y.

But, Eve can only choose x if there is at least one x left in the sequence.

So, Eve wants to choose x = y if possible, to make the XOR zero and let Bob win.

If x = y is not available, she chooses some other x to make the XOR non-zero, letting Alice win.

Wait, but Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, so she should choose x = y whenever possible.

But, she has to remove one number at each step, and she removes optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

This seems like a process that needs to be simulated step by step.

But simulating it directly would be too slow, especially since t can be up to 10^4 and p_i up to 200.

So, I need a smarter way to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and the sequence.

First, let's consider that the sequence starts with p0 ones, p1 twos, p2 threes, and p3 fours.

I can represent the current XOR as the XOR of the numbers that appear an odd number of times.

So, initial XOR = (1 if p0 % 2 == 1 else 0) XOR (2 if p1 % 2 == 1 else 0) XOR (3 if p2 % 2 == 1 else 0) XOR (4 if p3 % 2 == 1 else 0)

Let's denote this as y.

At each step, Eve removes one number x, which is either 1,2,3, or 4, provided there is at least one x left.

After removal, the new XOR becomes y XOR x.

Eve wants to choose x such that y XOR x = 0, i.e., x = y, to make the XOR zero and let Bob win.

If x = y is available, she chooses it, and Bob wins this step.

If x = y is not available, she chooses some other x, and Alice wins this step.

Then, she repeats this process until no numbers are left.

I need to count how many times Bob can win, i.e., how many times Eve can make the XOR zero by choosing x = y.

Let me consider the sequence of XOR values as Eve removes numbers.

Starting from y, she removes x1 = y1, making the new XOR y2 = y1 XOR x1 = y1 XOR y1 = 0.

Then, y2 = 0, she removes x2 = y2 = 0, but since the numbers are 1,2,3,4, and x2 must be one of them, but y2 is 0, which is not in the set {1,2,3,4}. So, she cannot choose x2 = 0, meaning she cannot make the XOR zero this time. Wait, but the numbers are 1,2,3,4, so x2 must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that y can be any value from 0 to 7, since XOR of numbers up to 4 (which is 4 in binary, 100) can result in values up to 7 (111 in binary).

But in reality, since the numbers are 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011), 4 (100), the possible XOR values are combinations of these.

But more importantly, Eve wants to maximize the number of times she can make the XOR zero by choosing x = y.

So, the question is, how many times can she choose x = y, given that x must be one of the numbers still available.

Each time she chooses x = y, Bob wins, and she removes one x, reducing the count of that x by one.

Then, the new y is y XOR x = 0, and in the next step, she needs to choose x = 0, but since 0 is not in the set {1,2,3,4}, she cannot choose x = 0, so Alice wins.

Then, y becomes x, which is one of {1,2,3,4}, and Eve can try to choose x = y again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where each state is represented by the parity of the counts of each number.

Since the numbers are up to 4, and there are four types, we can represent the state by a 4-tuple of parities (p0%2, p1%2, p2%2, p3%2).

But this might be too slow for p_i up to 200.

Alternatively, since XOR is involved, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

But that might be overkill.

Let me consider that the total number of steps is sum(p_i), which can be up to 800 per test case, but with t up to 10^4, simulating each step individually is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that each time Eve chooses x = y, Bob wins, and the XOR becomes zero.

Then, in the next step, y = 0, and Eve cannot choose x = 0 since x must be one of {1,2,3,4}.

So, she has to choose some x, making the XOR y = x.

Then, Alice wins, and the process continues.

Wait, but Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she wants to make y = x as much as possible.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times Eve can choose x = y.

But how do I maximize that?

Let me consider that each time Eve chooses x = y, she reduces the count of x by one, and y becomes zero.

Then, in the next step, y = 0, and Eve cannot choose x = 0, so Alice wins.

Then, y becomes x, and the process repeats.

So, each time Bob wins, it consumes one x = y.

Therefore, the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times y appears in the sequence, considering the parities.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times each number appears oddly or evenly.

Wait, perhaps inclusion of pairs of numbers allows Eve to manipulate the XOR in a way that she can choose x = y more often.

Wait, maybe I should look for pairs where two numbers XOR to y.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Sample Output:

1

1

3

3

12

Let's take the first sample:

1 1 1 0: one 1, one 2, one 3, zero 4s.

So, the sequence is [1,2,3]

Initial XOR: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

So, Bob wins the first game.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence becomes [2,3], XOR = 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 2, sequence becomes [3], XOR = 3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

But according to this, Bob wins twice.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is played as follows:

- Initial sequence: [1,2,3], XOR = 0, Bob wins.

- Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence: [2,3], XOR = 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

- Eve removes one number, say 2, sequence: [3], XOR = 3, Alice wins.

- Eve removes 3, sequence is empty, XOR = 0, Bob wins.

But the sample output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps the last empty sequence doesn't count.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, when the sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

But in the first sample, the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

But according to my earlier simulation, Bob wins twice.

Wait, perhaps the last empty sequence doesn't count.

Wait, no, the problem says "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it includes the empty sequence.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's simulate again:

1. Sequence: [1,2,3], XOR = 0, Bob wins.

2. Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence: [2,3], XOR = 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

3. Eve removes one number, say 2, sequence: [3], XOR = 3, Alice wins.

4. Eve removes 3, sequence is empty, XOR = 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but the sample output is 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the problem counts only the games before the sequence becomes empty.

In other words, the game is played with n numbers, then n-1, then n-2, and so on, down to 1, and then finally when the sequence is empty.

But in the first sample, n=3, so games with 3,2,1,0 numbers.

Bob wins with 3 numbers (XOR=0), Alice wins with 2 numbers (XOR=1), Alice wins with 1 number (XOR=3), Bob wins with 0 numbers (XOR=0).

But the output is 1, which might mean that only the last game is counted, where the sequence is empty.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the explanation, it says "Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

Wait, in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

That means in the initial sequence, XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Then, removing another number, XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, removing the last number, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

But the output is 1, meaning only one Bob's win is counted.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only the games with at least one number.

In other words, the sequence is played with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 1 number, but not including the empty sequence.

In the first sample, n=3, so games with 3,2,1 numbers.

Bob wins with 3 numbers (XOR=0), Alice wins with 2 numbers (XOR=1), Alice wins with 1 number (XOR=3).

So, Bob wins once.

That matches the sample output.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, when the sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins, but perhaps that's not counted.

So, maybe the problem considers the sequence to be non-empty in all games, down to one number, but not including the empty sequence.

In that case, for n=3, games with 3,2,1 numbers.

Similarly, for n=0, there are no games to play.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But perhaps the last empty sequence is not considered for the game.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that they play with n, n-1, ..., 1 numbers, and then the sequence is empty.

So, the games are played with n down to 1 numbers, and when the sequence is empty, there is no game to play.

Therefore, the number of games is n.

In the first sample, n=3, so three games: with 3,2,1 numbers.

Bob wins with 3 numbers (XOR=0), Alice wins with 2 numbers (XOR=1), Alice wins with 1 number (XOR=3).

Hence, Bob wins once.

That matches the sample output.

So, my earlier simulation included the empty sequence incorrectly.

Therefore, the games are played with n down to 1 numbers, and the sequence becomes empty after the last game.

So, in each game, the number of numbers is decreasing from n to 1.

Eve removes one number after each game.

Now, Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero.

Given that, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to try to make the XOR zero for Bob's win.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

This seems like a problem that can be solved by considering the parities of the counts of each number and how they affect the XOR.

Let me consider that the XOR is determined by the parities of the counts of each number.

Let me denote the parities as:

p0 % 2, p1 % 2, p2 % 2, p3 % 2

Then, the XOR is:

y = (p0 % 2)*1 XOR (p1 % 2)*2 XOR (p2 % 2)*3 XOR (p3 % 2)*4

Wait, more accurately, y = (p0 % 2)*1 XOR (p1 % 2)*2 XOR (p2 % 2)*3 XOR (p3 % 2)*4

But actually, since p0, p1, p2, p3 are counts of 1,2,3,4 respectively, and we are taking their parities, y is the XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the parities change accordingly.

Eve wants to choose the number to remove in such a way that the new XOR is zero, to maximize Bob's wins.

I need to find out how many times Eve can make the XOR zero by choosing the right number to remove.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using graph theory or dynamic programming, but given the constraints, that might not be efficient enough.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the initial XOR y.

If y is zero, Bob wins this game.

Then, Eve removes one number x, and the new XOR becomes y XOR x.

Eve wants to choose x such that y XOR x is zero for the next game, to make Bob win again.

But y XOR x = 0 implies x = y.

So, if y is present in the sequence, Eve can choose to remove y, making the new XOR zero again, and Bob wins the next game.

If y is not present in the sequence, Eve has to choose some other x, and the new XOR will be y XOR x, which is not zero, so Alice wins.

So, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times Eve can choose x = y.

This seems like a way to count the minimum number of times Bob can win, but the problem says Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, actually, Eve can choose x = y whenever possible, to make Bob win.

So, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times Eve can choose x = y.

Now, each time Eve chooses x = y, she removes one occurrence of y, reducing its count by one.

If y was present multiple times, she can choose it multiple times, but each choice consumes one occurrence.

Wait, but y can be any of the numbers 1,2,3,4, or 0, but since the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, y can only be one of these or 0.

But since y is the XOR of some subset, it can be 0 or one of the numbers.

Wait, y can be any value that is the XOR of some subset of the numbers.

But in this problem, since the numbers are 1,2,3,4, their XOR can be any combination.

But perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra.

Let me consider that y can be any value in the span of {1,2,3,4} under XOR, which is essentially all possible combinations.

But perhaps that's not necessary.

Let me consider that y can be any value from 0 to 7, but in this case, since the numbers are 1,2,3,4, their XOR can only be certain values.

Wait, 1 is 001, 2 is 010, 3 is 011, 4 is 100.

So, the possible XOR values are the linear combinations of these vectors over GF(2).

Let me list all possible XOR values:

- 0: no numbers

- 1: one 1, or three 1's, etc.

- 2: one 2, or three 2's, etc.

- 3: one 1 and one 2, or three 1's and one 2, etc.

- 4: one 4, or three 4's, etc.

- 5: one 1 and one 4, or three 1's and one 4, etc.

- 6: one 2 and one 4, or three 2's and one 4, etc.

- 7: one 1, one 2, and one 4, or more combinations.

But in our problem, y can be any of these values, depending on the parities of p0, p1, p2, p3.

Now, Eve wants to choose x = y whenever possible.

Each time she chooses x = y, she removes one x, reducing its count by one.

She can do this as many times as x appears in the sequence.

But she has to choose x from the remaining sequence at each step.

This seems like a process where Eve can choose x = y as long as y is present in the sequence.

So, the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times Eve can choose x = y.

This seems similar to counting the number of times y appears in the sequence, but considering that y changes after each removal.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing the numbers.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that each time Eve chooses x = y, she consumes one x, and Bob wins.

So, the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times y appears in the sequence, considering the changes in y after each removal.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that y can be represented as a linear combination of the numbers present in the sequence.

Given that, perhaps I can find the rank of the matrix formed by these numbers and find the number of times y can be chosen.

But this might be too complicated.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I have a certain number of each type of number.

I can group them into pairs.

Each pair of the same number can be removed without affecting the XOR, since XORing a number with itself gives zero.

So, for each number, the number of times it appears oddly affects the XOR.

So, if p0 is even, 1 doesn't contribute to XOR; if p0 is odd, 1 contributes 1 to XOR.

Similarly for p1, p2, p3.

So, the XOR y is (p0%2)*1 XOR (p1%2
