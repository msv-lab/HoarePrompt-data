Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not exist two different indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Okay, so I need to make sure that for any two positions i and j, if p_i divides p_j, then p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Let's consider all possible pairs of indices (i,j) where 1 ≤ i, j < 4 and i ≠ j.

Possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).

Wait, but j can be up to n, which is 4, but i < n, so i can be from 1 to 3.

So pairs are: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4).

Now, check for each pair if p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Take (1,2): p1=4, p2=1; 4 does not divide 1. So condition not satisfied.

(1,3): p1=4, p3=2; 4 does not divide 2.

Wait, 4 does not divide 2? Actually, 2 divides 4, but 4 does not divide 2. Wait, no, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is an integer, so 2 divides 4, but 4 does not divide 2 unless j=2 and i=1, but here j=3 and i=1.

Wait, p1=4, p3=2; 4 does not divide 2. Wait, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 2 divides 4, but 4 does not divide 2. Wait, no, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 2 divides 4. But 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 4 divides 2? Wait, no, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 2 divides 4, but 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 4 divides 2? Wait, that can't be, because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 2 divides 4, but 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 4 divides 2. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, actually, 2 divides 4 because 4 / 2 = 2, which is integer. But 4 does not divide 2 because 2 / 4 = 0.5, which is not integer. So, 2 divides 4, but 4 does not divide 2.

So, for (1,3): p1=4 does not divide p3=2, so condition not violated.

Similarly, (1,4): p1=4, p4=3; 4 does not divide 3.

(2,1): p2=1, p1=4; 1 divides 4, but p3=2, p2=1; 2 does not divide 1, because 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, which is not integer. So condition not violated.

(2,3): p2=1 divides p3=2, and p3=2 divides p4=3? 2 does not divide 3, so condition not violated.

(2,4): p2=1 divides p4=3, and p3=2 divides p5= none, since n=4, so p5 doesn't exist. Wait, j can be up to n, which is 4, and i can be up to n-1, which is 3.

Wait, in the problem, it says 1 ≤ i, j < n, i ≠ j. So j can be up to n-1, not n.

Wait, let's read the problem again: "1 ≤ i, j < n ; i ≠ j"

So j < n, and i < n, and i ≠ j.

So for n=4, pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).

So, for (2,4), j=4 is allowed only if j < n, which is 4 < 4, which is not true. So j can be up to n-1, which is 3.

Wait, no, the problem says "1 ≤ i, j < n", so j < n.

So for n=4, j can be 1,2,3.

Similarly, i can be 1,2,3.

So pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).

Now, for each of these pairs, check if p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Let's check:

(1,2): p1=4 divides p2=1? 4 does not divide 1.

(1,3): p1=4 divides p3=2? 4 does not divide 2.

(2,1): p2=1 divides p1=4? Yes, 1 divides 4, and p3=2 divides p2=1? 2 does not divide 1.

So condition not violated.

(2,3): p2=1 divides p3=2? Yes, 1 divides 2, and p3=2 divides p4=3? 2 does not divide 3.

Condition not violated.

(3,1): p3=2 divides p1=4? Yes, 2 divides 4, and p4=3 divides p2=1? 3 does not divide 1.

Condition not violated.

(3,2): p3=2 divides p2=1? 2 does not divide 1.

Condition not violated.

So, the permutation [4,1,2,3] satisfies the condition.

In the second test case, n=3, and the output is [1,2,3].

Let's check this.

Possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).

(1,2): p1=1 divides p2=2? Yes, 1 divides 2, and p2=2 divides p3=3? 2 does not divide 3.

Condition not violated.

(1,3): p1=1 divides p3=3? Yes, 1 divides 3, and p2=2 divides p4= none, but since j=3 < n=3, p_{j+1}=p4 doesn't exist, but j < n, so j+1=4, which is beyond the array, so probably we can consider it as not dividing or something, but in programming terms, we might need to handle it carefully.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n ; i ≠ j ) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}".

So, for j < n, j+1 ≤ n.

So, for j=3 and n=3, j+1=4, which is n+1, which is out of bounds.

So, in this case, probably p_{j+1} doesn't exist, so the condition p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} can't be satisfied because p_{j+1} doesn't exist.

Similarly, for i=3, p_{i+1}=p4 doesn't exist.

So, for (1,3): p1=1 divides p3=3, but p2=2 and p4 doesn't exist, so the condition p2 divides p4 doesn't hold, so overall condition not violated.

Similarly, for (2,3): p2=2 divides p3=3? 2 does not divide 3.

Condition not violated.

For (3,1): p3=3 divides p1=1? 3 does not divide 1.

Condition not violated.

For (3,2): p3=3 divides p2=2? 3 does not divide 2.

Condition not violated.

So, [1,2,3] is a valid permutation for n=3.

Now, looking at the provided program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(*a)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls func_1.

func_1 reads n, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based, so 0,2,4,...).

For example, for n=4:

Original list: [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3]

Reversed a[::2][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3], but according to this code, it should output [3,2,1,4].

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the slicing.

Let me check.

a = list(range(1, n+1)) # for n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

a[::2] is elements at indices 0,2,4,...

a[::2][::-1] reverses them.

So, for a=[1,2,3,4], a[::2] = [1,3], reversed to [3,1], then assign back to a[::2], so a becomes [3,2,1,4].

But in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3].

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the example is just one possible valid permutation, and there are multiple valid ones.

But the problem says "at least one p exists", so multiple solutions are possible.

In the example, for n=4, [4,1,2,3] is valid, and according to the code, [3,2,1,4] is produced.

Let's check if [3,2,1,4] is valid.

Check all pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).

(1,2): p1=3 divides p2=2? 3 does not divide 2.

(1,3): p1=3 divides p3=1? 3 does not divide 1.

(2,1): p2=2 divides p1=3? 2 does not divide 3.

(2,3): p2=2 divides p3=1? 2 does not divide 1.

(3,1): p3=1 divides p1=3? Yes, 1 divides 3, and p4=4 divides p2=2? 4 does not divide 2.

Wait, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 4 divides 2.

Wait, but according to earlier understanding, 4 divides 2 because 2 / 4 = 0.5 is not integer, but 4 / 2 = 2 is integer, so 2 divides 4, but 4 does not divide 2.

Wait, no, 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is integer, so 4 is divisible by 2.

Wait, in general, a divides b if b % a == 0.

So, 4 divides 2 because 2 % 4 == 2, which is not zero, so 4 does not divide 2.

Wait, but 4 / 2 = 2, which is integer, so 2 divides 4.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Actually, a divides b means b is divisible by a, i.e., b % a == 0.

So, 2 divides 4 because 4 % 2 == 0.

4 does not divide 2 because 2 % 4 == 2 ≠ 0.

So, in (3,1): p3=1 divides p1=3 (yes), and p4=4 divides p2=2 (no, because 4 does not divide 2), so overall condition not violated.

Similarly, in (3,2): p3=1 divides p2=2 (yes), and p4=4 divides p3=1 (4 does not divide 1), so condition not violated.

So, [3,2,1,4] seems to be a valid permutation.

Therefore, the code is producing a different valid permutation from the one in the example, but it's still correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, the example output is [4,1,2,3], but the code produces [3,2,1,4].

Both are valid, so it's fine.

Similarly, for n=3, the example output is [1,2,3], and the code would produce [1,2,3], because for n=3, a=[1,2,3], a[::2]=[1,3], reversed to [3,1], so a becomes [3,2,1].

Wait, but in the example, for n=3, the output is [1,2,3], but the code produces [3,2,1].

Is [3,2,1] valid for n=3?

Let's check:

Pairs: (1,2): p1=3 divides p2=2? 3 does not divide 2.

(1,3): p1=3 divides p3=1? Yes, 3 divides 1 (since 1 divides 3), and p2=2 divides p4= none, but since j=3 < n=3, p4 doesn't exist, so condition not violated.

(2,1): p2=2 divides p1=3? 2 does not divide 3.

(2,3): p2=2 divides p3=1? 2 does not divide 1.

(3,1): p3=1 divides p1=3? Yes, 1 divides 3, and p4 doesn't exist, so condition not violated.

(3,2): p3=1 divides p2=2? Yes, 1 divides 2, and p4 doesn't exist.

So, [3,2,1] is also valid for n=3.

Hence, the code seems to be producing valid permutations for both n=3 and n=4.

Now, does this pattern hold for all n ≥ 3?

Let's try n=5.

According to the code, a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Is this a valid permutation?

Check pairs (1,2): p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

(1,3): p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

(1,4): p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

(2,1): p2=2 divides p1=5? No.

(2,3): p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

(2,4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No, because 3 does not divide 1.

So, condition not violated.

(3,1): p3=3 divides p1=5? No.

(3,2): p3=3 divides p2=2? No.

(3,4): p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

(4,1): p4=4 divides p1=5? No.

(4,2): p4=4 divides p2=2? No.

(4,3): p4=4 divides p3=3? No.

All pairs satisfy the condition, so [5,2,3,4,1] is valid.

Another example, n=6.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

(1,3): p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

(1,4): p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

(1,5): p1=5 divides p5=1? No.

(2,1): p2=2 divides p1=5? No.

(2,3): p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

(2,4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

(2,5): p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

(3,1): p3=3 divides p1=5? No.

(3,2): p3=3 divides p2=2? No.

(3,4): p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

(3,5): p3=3 divides p5=1? Yes, and p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes, 4 divides 6.

Wait, 4 divides 6? 6 / 4 = 1.5, which is not integer, so 4 does not divide 6.

Wait, 4 divides 6? 6 % 4 = 2 ≠ 0, so no.

So, p4=4 does not divide p6=6, so condition not violated.

(4,1): p4=4 divides p1=5? No.

(4,2): p4=4 divides p2=2? No.

(4,3): p4=4 divides p3=3? No.

(4,5): p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

(5,1): p5=1 divides p1=5? Yes, and p6=6 divides p2=2? 6 does not divide 2.

Condition not violated.

(5,2): p5=1 divides p2=2? Yes, and p6=6 divides p3=3? 6 does not divide 3.

Condition not violated.

(5,3): p5=1 divides p3=3? Yes, and p6=6 divides p4=4? 6 does not divide 4.

Condition not violated.

(5,4): p5=1 divides p4=4? Yes, and p6=6 divides p5=1? 6 does not divide 1.

Condition not violated.

So, [5,2,3,4,1,6] is a valid permutation for n=6.

Seems like the code is producing valid permutations for n=4, n=3, n=5, n=6.

Is there any n where this might fail?

Let me try n=2.

Wait, but the problem says n ≥ 3, so n=2 is not considered.

Wait, but in the code, n starts from 3.

Wait, no, the problem says 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.

So, n is at least 3.

Wait, in the code, it accepts n from 1 upwards, but according to the problem, n is at least 3.

But in the code, it's accepting n from 1, but since the problem guarantees n ≥ 3, it's fine.

Wait, in the problem, it's given that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

So, the code should handle n from 3 upwards.

Now, is there any n where reversing the elements at even indices would produce an invalid permutation?

Let me think about n=7.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7], reversed to [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p1=7 divides p2=2? No.

(1,3): p1=7 divides p3=5? No.

(1,4): p1=7 divides p4=4? No.

(1,5): p1=7 divides p5=3? No.

(1,6): p1=7 divides p6=6? No.

(2,1): p2=2 divides p1=7? No.

(2,3): p2=2 divides p3=5? No.

(2,4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

(2,5): p2=2 divides p5=3? No.

(2,6): p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes, and p3=5 divides p7=1? No.

(3,1): p3=5 divides p1=7? No.

(3,2): p3=5 divides p2=2? No.

(3,4): p3=5 divides p4=4? No.

(3,5): p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

(3,6): p3=5 divides p6=6? No.

(4,1): p4=4 divides p1=7? No.

(4,2): p4=4 divides p2=2? No.

(4,3): p4=4 divides p3=5? No.

(4,5): p4=4 divides p5=3? No.

(4,6): p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes, and p5=3 divides p7=1? 3 does not divide 1.

(5,1): p5=3 divides p1=7? No.

(5,2): p5=3 divides p2=2? No.

(5,3): p5=3 divides p3=5? No.

(5,4): p5=3 divides p4=4? No.

(5,6): p5=3 divides p6=6? Yes, and p7=1 divides p3=5? 1 divides 5, but since p_{j+1}=p4=4, and p_{i+1}=p6=6, which is 6 divides 4? No.

Wait, let's clarify: for (5,6): p5=3 divides p6=6? Yes, and p6=6 divides p7=1? 6 does not divide 1.

So, condition not violated.

(6,1): p6=6 divides p1=7? No.

(6,2): p6=6 divides p2=2? No.

(6,3): p6=6 divides p3=5? No.

(6,4): p6=6 divides p4=4? No.

(6,5): p6=6 divides p5=3? No.

All pairs satisfy the condition, so [7,2,5,4,3,6,1] is valid.

Seems like this pattern works.

Is there a mathematical justification for this approach?

Let's think about it.

By reversing the elements at even indices, we're essentially swapping certain elements in a specific pattern.

In the code, a[::2] = a[::2][::-1], which means reverse the sub-list of a consisting of elements at even indices (0-based).

So, for n=4: [1,2,3,4] becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, earlier I thought it was [1,2,3,4] becoming [3,2,1,4], but actually, a[::2] = [1,3], reversed to [3,1], assigned back to a[::2], so a becomes [3,2,1,4].

Wait, but in n=4, the example output is [4,1,2,3], but according to the code, it's [3,2,1,4].

But both are valid, as I checked earlier.

So, perhaps this approach generally produces a valid permutation.

Is there a better way to approach this problem?

Alternatively, maybe a simpler approach is to place the largest number first, followed by the smallest numbers.

For example, in n=4, [4,1,2,3], which is similar to putting the maximum first, then the remaining in order.

Similarly, for n=5, [5,1,2,3,4].

But in the code, it's reversing the even indices, which for n=5, results in [5,2,3,4,1], which is different from [5,1,2,3,4], but both are valid.

So, multiple approaches can lead to valid permutations.

Now, is there any n where this approach fails?

Let me think about n=6 again.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1]

a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check if there are any i,j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

From earlier checks, it seems fine.

Wait, in (2,4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

So, condition not violated.

Similarly, in (5,6): p5=1 divides p6=6? Yes, and p6=6 divides p7= none, which doesn't exist, so condition not violated.

Seems consistent.

Is there a general proof for why this approach works?

Let's consider that by reversing the even indices, we're creating a certain disorder in the permutation that prevents the division condition from holding for any i,j.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach ensures that p_i divides p_j only in specific cases where p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

But I'm not sure about a formal proof.

Given that the problem states that at least one such permutation exists under the constraints, and the provided code seems to generate valid permutations for several test cases, including n=3,4,5,6,7, I can conclude that this approach is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
