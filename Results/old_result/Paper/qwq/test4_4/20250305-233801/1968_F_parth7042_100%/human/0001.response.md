Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. A subarray is a continuous part of the array. So, for a given range [l, r], I need to check if the subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way to handle XOR problems is to use prefix sums, but for XOR. So, I can compute a prefix XOR array where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.

If I have the prefix XOR array, then the XOR of any subarray [l, r] can be found by prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]. This is a standard technique in XOR problems.

Now, for the subarray [l, r] to be interesting, I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value. Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as X. So, X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If X is zero, that means the subarray is already all zeros in XOR terms, which means any split will have parts with XOR zero. So, in this case, the answer is YES.

If X is not zero, then I need to find at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR up to that point is equal to X, and the remaining part also has XOR equal to X.

Wait, actually, if X is not zero, I need to find at least one index i in [l, r) such that the XOR from l to i is equal to X, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also equal to X.

But since the XOR from l to i is prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1], and the XOR from i+1 to r is prefix[r] XOR prefix[i], and both should be equal to X.

Given that prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] should be equal to X, and X is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1], then prefix[i] should be equal to prefix[l-1].

Wait, that seems off. Let me think again.

We have:

X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]

We want to find i in [l, r) such that:

prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1] = X and prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] = X

So:

prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1] = X

And:

prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] = X

From the first equation:

prefix[i] = X XOR prefix[l-1]

But X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1], so:

prefix[i] = (prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]) XOR prefix[l-1] = prefix[r] XOR (prefix[l-1] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[r] XOR 0 = prefix[r]

Wait, that can't be right because prefix[i] can't be equal to prefix[r] in general.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have the subarray [l, r], and I want to split it into k parts where k > 1, and each part has the same XOR value X.

Let's say the subarray is a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r].

If I can split it into parts where each part's XOR is X, then the overall XOR of the entire subarray should be X XOR X XOR ... XOR X (k times).

If k is even, X XOR X is 0, and so on.

Wait, more carefully:

If k is even, then X XOR X XOR ... XOR X (k times) = 0

If k is odd, then it's X.

But in our problem, k > 1.

So, if k is even, the overall XOR is 0, and if k is odd, it's X.

But the overall XOR of the subarray is X.

So, for the subarray to be split into k > 1 parts with each part having XOR X, the overall XOR should be X if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But it's given that the overall XOR is X, so:

- If k is odd, X = X

- If k is even, X = 0

But X is given, so:

- If X != 0, then k must be odd

- If X == 0, then k can be even or odd

But k > 1, so:

- If X == 0, it's possible to have even k

- If X != 0, k must be odd

But I need to check if such a k exists.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the subarray [l, r], and I want to split it into k parts with the same XOR value.

Let me consider the prefix XOR values from l to r.

Let's say I have prefix[l-1], prefix[l], prefix[l+1], ..., prefix[r].

The XOR of part from l to i is prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1]

The XOR of part from i+1 to j is prefix[j] XOR prefix[i]

And so on.

I need to have at least two parts where each part's XOR is equal.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Maybe I can look for repeated XOR values in the prefix array within the range [l, r].

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the subarray [l, r], the XOR from l to r is X.

If there exists at least one index i in [l, r) such that the XOR from l to i is X, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also X, then I can split the array into two parts, each with XOR X.

Moreover, if I can find multiple such i's, I can have more parts.

But I need at least one such i to exist for k >= 2.

So, in other words, there exists i in [l, r) such that prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1] = X and prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] = X.

From the first equation:

prefix[i] = prefix[l-1] XOR X

From the second equation:

prefix[i] = prefix[r] XOR X

So, for such an i to exist, prefix[l-1] XOR X must equal prefix[r] XOR X.

Wait, that would mean prefix[l-1] = prefix[r], which is not necessarily true.

Wait, no:

prefix[l-1] XOR X = prefix[r] XOR X

Implies prefix[l-1] = prefix[r]

But X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]

So, prefix[l-1] XOR X = prefix[r] XOR X = prefix[l-1]

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me try plugging in X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]

Then, prefix[i] = prefix[l-1] XOR X = prefix[l-1] XOR (prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[r]

Similarly, prefix[i] = prefix[r] XOR X = prefix[r] XOR (prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[l-1]

So, prefix[i] should be equal to both prefix[r] and prefix[l-1], which is only possible if prefix[r] = prefix[l-1], which would imply that X = 0.

But we are considering X != 0, so this seems contradictory.

Wait a minute, perhaps I need to consider that for X != 0, such a split is not possible unless there are multiple occurrences of certain prefix values.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in problems involving splitting arrays into parts with equal sums or other properties, prefix sums or in this case, prefix XORs, are used to find intervals with specific properties.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of times a particular prefix XOR value appears within the range.

Let me consider that.

Compute the prefix XOR array.

Then, for a subarray [l, r], the XOR is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] = X.

Now, to split [l, r] into k parts with each part having XOR X, it must be possible that there are points in the subarray where the cumulative XOR up to that point is equal to X, 2X, 3X, ..., (k-1)X.

But since we're dealing with XOR, not addition, this might not directly translate.

Wait, in XOR, there's no concept of multiplication like in addition, so 2X isn't meaningful.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the property that the XOR of a segment is X, and then see if there are points where the cumulative XOR matches certain values.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r, and compute X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Now, I need to find if there's at least one way to split the subarray into k > 1 parts where each part has XOR X.

Let me consider that the first part ends at some index i, where l <= i < r, and its XOR is X.

Then, the XOR from l to i is X, which is prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1] = X.

So, prefix[i] = prefix[l-1] XOR X.

Similarly, the remaining part from i+1 to r should have XOR X.

So, prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] = X.

Substituting prefix[i] from above:

prefix[r] XOR (prefix[l-1] XOR X) = X

Simplify:

prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] XOR X = X

But prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] is X, so:

X XOR X = 0, which should equal X, but X is not necessarily zero.

This suggests that for X != 0, there is no such i that satisfies both conditions.

Wait, that can't be right.

Let me check:

Given that X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]

Then, prefix[i] = prefix[l-1] XOR X = prefix[l-1] XOR (prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[r]

Similarly, prefix[r] XOR prefix[i] = prefix[r] XOR prefix[r] = 0, which should equal X.

But X != 0, so 0 != X, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, for X != 0, there is no i that satisfies both conditions.

Wait, but in the example provided, there are cases where X != 0 and the answer is YES.

So, my current reasoning must be flawed.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider multiple splits.

For example, split the array into more than two parts.

Wait, but even for two parts, my above reasoning suggests it's not possible for X != 0, but the example shows it is possible.

Looking back at the example:

Array: [1,1,2,3,0]

Query: l=3, r=5 => subarray [2,3,0]

X = 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1

Now, can we split [2,3,0] into parts where each part has XOR 1?

Yes, [2,3,0] can be split into [2,3] and [0], where 2 XOR 3 = 1 and 0 = 0, which is not equal to 1. Wait, that's not a valid split.

Wait, in the explanation, it says for [1,1,2,3,0], splitting into [1],[1],[2,3,0], where 1=1=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0, but 0 !=1, which is incorrect.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

For example, if x = [1,1,2,3,0], you can split it as follows: [1], [1], [2,3,0]. Indeed 1=1=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0.

But 1 != 0, so this seems incorrect. Maybe it's a typo.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the explanation.

Looking back, the problem says:

"Let us call an array x1,…,xm interesting if it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y1,…,yk be the XOR of elements from each part respectively. Then y1=y2=…=yk must be fulfilled."

So, in the example, [1,1,2,3,0], it's split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], with y1=1, y2=1, y3=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0, which are not equal, so this shouldn't be a valid split. Maybe it's a mistake in the explanation.

Wait, perhaps I misread it. Maybe the example is for l=1 to 5, which is the whole array [1,1,2,3,0], and it can be split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], with y1=1, y2=1, y3=0, which are not equal, so the answer should be NO, but in the output, it's YES for that query.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the example output.

In the first test case output, it's:

YES

YES

NO

NO

NO

So, for l=1 to 5, it's YES, but according to my calculation, it should be NO.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Let us call an array x1,…,xm interesting if it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y1,…,yk be the XOR of elements from each part respectively. Then y1=y2=…=yk must be fulfilled.

For example, if x=[1,1,2,3,0], you can split it as follows: [1], [1], [2,3,0]. Indeed 1=1=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0."

Wait, but 1 != 0, so this is incorrect. There must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Let me consider another example.

Take x=[1,1,2,3,0].

Possible splits:

- [1],[1,2,3,0]: y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0; 1 != 0 → invalid

- [1,1],[2,3,0]: y1=1 XOR 1=0, y2=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1; 0 != 1 → invalid

- [1],[1,2],[3,0]: y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2=3, y3=3 XOR 0=3; 1 != 3 → invalid

- [1],[1],[2,3,0]: y1=1, y2=1, y3=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0; 1 != 0 → invalid

- [1,1],[2],[3,0]: y1=0, y2=2, y3=3 XOR 0=3; 0 != 2 != 3 → invalid

- [1,1,2],[3,0]: y1=1 XOR 1 XOR 2=2, y2=3 XOR 0=3; 2 != 3 → invalid

- [1,1,2,3],[0]: y1=1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3=3, y2=0; 3 != 0 → invalid

So, in this case, there is no way to split the array into k>1 parts with equal XOR per part. But according to the first query's output, it's YES. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the XOR of each part should be equal to the XOR of the entire array divided by k, but since it's XOR, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the XOR of all parts is equal to each other, not necessarily to a specific value.

But in the problem statement, it says y1 = y2 = … = yk must be fulfilled.

So, all y_i should be equal.

But in the example, it seems like it's possible, but my analysis says it's not.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the overall XOR is y, and then each part has XOR y, and since y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) equals y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But in the first query, l=1 to 5, the entire array [1,1,2,3,0], XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, so X=1.

Now, to split it into k>1 parts where each part has XOR=1.

From my earlier analysis, no such split exists, but the output is YES.

So, perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Wait, maybe I missed a possible split.

Let me try splitting [1,1,2,3,0] into [1,1,2], [3], [0].

y1 = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 2

y2 = 3

y3 = 0

2 != 3 != 0, so invalid.

Another split: [1],[1,2,3],[0]

y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0, y3=0

1 != 0, so invalid.

Wait, perhaps there's a split where y1=y2=y3=1, but I can't find it.

Maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for k>1, but not necessarily to split into more than two parts.

Wait, no, k can be greater than 1.

Wait, maybe the problem is to split into any number of parts greater than 1, with each part having the same XOR.

But in this case, for [1,1,2,3,0], it seems impossible.

Wait, maybe the problem is to split into any number of parts where all parts have the same XOR, and k>1.

But in this case, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the output is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to split into exactly k parts for some k>1, not necessarily any k>1.

But the problem says "it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that XOR of values from each part are equal."

So, for some k>1.

In the first query, it's YES, meaning such a k exists.

But from my analysis, it seems like no such k exists.

Wait, maybe I need to consider k=1, but the problem says k>1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the overall XOR is X, and then see if X can be split into k parts each with XOR X.

But again, for X !=0, it seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X !=0, it's impossible to split into k>1 parts with each part having XOR X.

But then, why is the first query's answer YES?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X !=0, it's possible only if there are multiple segments with XOR X.

But in the first query, X=1, and I can't find any split where all parts have XOR=1.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping parts or something, but the problem says consecutive segments.

I'm getting confused here.

Let me look at another query in the example.

Second query: l=2 to 4, subarray [1,2,3]

X=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0

Now, for X=0, it's possible to split into k>1 parts where each part has XOR=0.

For example, split into [1,2],[3], where 1 XOR 2=3, and 3 XOR 3=0.

Wait, 1 XOR 2=3, which is not 0, and 3=3, which is not 0.

Wait, no, 1 XOR 2=3, and 3 XOR 3=0.

But the parts should have XOR=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the splitting.

If I split [1,2,3] into [1,2] and [3], then:

XOR of [1,2]=3, which is not 0.

XOR of [3]=3, which is not 0.

So, invalid.

Another split: [1],[2,3]

XOR of [1]=1

XOR of [2,3]=2 XOR 3=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0 XOR 2 XOR 3=2 XOR 3=1

So, both parts have XOR=1, which is not 0.

Another split: [1],[2],[3]

XOR of [1]=1, [2]=2, [3]=3; not all equal.

Wait, none of the splits have all parts with XOR=0.

But according to the output, it's YES.

Wait, perhaps for X=0, any split where all parts have XOR=0 is acceptable.

But in this case, for [1,2,3], X=0, but I can't find any split where all parts have XOR=0.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for X=0, it's possible to split into k parts where k>1 and each part has XOR=0.

But in this case, it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's possible only if there are multiple segments with XOR=0.

But in this case, no such split exists.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's possible to split into any number of parts, each with XOR=0.

But again, in this example, it's not possible.

Wait, maybe the problem allows for k=2 only, but the problem says k>1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's possible to split into k parts where k divides the length of the subarray, but that doesn't seem relevant.

I'm getting more confused.

Let me look at another query.

Third query: l=3 to 5, subarray [2,3,0]

X=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1

Possible splits:

- [2],[3,0]: y1=2, y2=3 XOR 0=3; 2 != 3

- [2,3],[0]: y1=2 XOR 3=1, y2=0; 1 !=0

- [2],[3],[0]: y1=2, y2=3, y3=0; not all equal

So, no valid split, but the output is NO, which matches my analysis.

Wait, but earlier for l=1 to 5, output is YES, but my analysis says NO.

Similarly, for l=2 to 4, output is YES, but my analysis says NO.

Wait, perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Maybe I need to consider that for X=0, it's always possible to split into k parts where each part has XOR=0, by splitting at any point.

Wait, but that's not true, because the XOR of a part may not be zero.

Wait, perhaps for X=0, it's possible to split into k parts where k is even.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me look at the provided program to understand what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

It reads input, then processes t test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n and q

- Reads the array a of size n

- Computes a prefix XOR array pf

- Builds a map mp where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where that XOR value occurs

- For each query (l, r):

- Computes X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

- If X == 0, answers YES

- Else:

- Looks for positions in the subarray [l, r] where pf[i] = pf[r]

- Uses bisect_left to find such positions

- Checks some conditions and answers YES or NO accordingly

From this, it seems that for X == 0, it's always YES.

For X != 0, it checks if there's at least one index i in [l, r) where pf[i] = pf[r].

If such an i exists, it answers YES, else NO.

But in my earlier analysis, for X != 0, it seems like it's not possible to split into parts with equal XOR.

But according to the code, it's possible if pf[i] = pf[r] for some i in [l, r).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if pf[i] = pf[r], then the XOR from i+1 to r is X.

Wait, let's see:

If pf[i] = pf[r], then XOR from i+1 to r is pf[r] XOR pf[i] = 0.

But we need each part to have XOR X, which is not zero.

So, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple splits.

Suppose I have pf[i] = pf[r], then the XOR from i+1 to r is 0.

But I need it to be X.

This doesn't match unless X=0.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for X !=0, it's impossible, so the code is wrong.

But according to the first query's output, it's YES for X=1, but my analysis says it's NO.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X !=0, it's possible to split into k parts where k is odd, and each part has XOR X.

But in the example, it's not working.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times the XOR value repeats within the range.

Let me consider that.

If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X, and if pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR X for some i in [l, r), then the XOR from l to i is X, and from i+1 to r is pf[r] XOR pf[i] = pf[r] XOR (pf[l-1] XOR X) = (pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]) XOR X = X XOR X = 0.

So, the second part has XOR 0, which is not equal to X unless X=0.

Hence, for X !=0, it's impossible to have both parts with the same XOR.

Therefore, the only way to have the subarray [l, r] be interesting is when X=0.

Hence, the answer should be YES only when X=0, and NO otherwise.

But in the first query, X=1, and the output is YES, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider k>2.

Let me consider splitting into more than two parts.

Suppose I split [1,1,2,3,0] into [1],[1],[2,3,0].

Then y1=1, y2=1, y3=0.

Not all equal.

Another split: [1],[1,2],[3,0]

y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2=3, y3=3 XOR 0=3

Not all equal.

Another split: [1,1],[2],[3,0]

y1=0, y2=2, y3=3 XOR 0=3

Not all equal.

Another split: [1,1,2],[3],[0]

y1=0 XOR 2=2, y2=3, y3=0

Not all equal.

Another split: [1],[1,2,3],[0]

y1=1, y2=0, y3=0

Not all equal.

Another split: [1,1,2,3],[0]

y1=0, y2=0

Here, both parts have XOR 0, so if X=0, it's YES.

But in the first query, X=1, but according to the output, it's YES.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for k=1, but the problem says k>1.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Let me read it again.

"Let us call an array x1,…,xm interesting if it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y1,…,yk be the XOR of elements from each part respectively. Then y1=y2=…=yk must be fulfilled."

So, k must be greater than 1.

In the first query, [1,1,2,3,0], X=1, but from my analysis, it's impossible to split into k>1 parts with each part having XOR=1.

But the output is YES.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider overlapping parts, but the problem specifies consecutive segments.

I'm stuck here.

Let me look at the code again.

The code answers YES for X=0 and for X !=0 if there exists an i in [l, r) where pf[i] = pf[r].

Wait, perhaps the code is correct, and my analysis is wrong.

Let me consider another test case.

Take the second test case in the example:

n=5, q=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Queries:

1. l=1 to 5: subarray [1,2,3,4,5], X=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5=1 XOR 2=3; 3 XOR 3=0; 0 XOR 4=4; 4 XOR 5=1 → Wait, step by step:

1 XOR 2 = 3

3 XOR 3 = 0

0 XOR 4 = 4

4 XOR 5 =1

So, X=1

Output: YES

Wait, according to the code, it should answer YES if X=0 or if there exists i in [l, r) with pf[i] = pf[r].

In this case, X=1 !=0, so it checks if pf[i]=pf[5]=1 for some i in [1,5).

Looking at pf:

pf[0]=0

pf[1]=1

pf[2]=1 XOR 2=3

pf[3]=3 XOR 3=0

pf[4]=0 XOR 4=4

pf[5]=4 XOR 5=1

So, in [1,5), pf[1]=1, pf[3]=0, pf[4]=4.

So, pf[i]=pf[5]=1 at i=1.

Hence, it answers YES.

But, can we split [1,2,3,4,5] into k>1 parts with each part having XOR=1?

Possible splits:

- [1],[2,3,4,5]: y1=1, y2=2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5=2 XOR 3=1, 1 XOR 4=5, 5 XOR 5=0 → Not all parts have XOR=1

- [1,2],[3,4,5]: y1=1 XOR 2=3, y2=3 XOR 4 XOR 5=3 XOR 4=7, 7 XOR 5=2 → Not all equal

- [1,2,3],[4,5]: y1=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0, y2=4 XOR 5=1 → 0 !=1

- [1,2,3,4],[5]: y1=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4=0 XOR 4=4, y2=5 → 4 !=5

- [1],[2],[3,4,5]: y1=1, y2=2, y3=3 XOR 4 XOR 5=3 XOR 4=7, 7 XOR 5=2 → Not equal

- [1],[2,3],[4,5]: y1=1, y2=2 XOR 3=1, y3=4 XOR 5=1 → All equal to 1 → Valid split

Ah, here it is! [1],[2,3],[4,5]: all parts have XOR=1.

So, the answer should be YES.

I must have missed this split earlier.

So, my earlier analysis was incomplete.

Hence, the code is correct in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, it answers YES based on whether pf[i]=pf[r] for some i in [l, r).

In this case, pf[1]=1 and pf[5]=1, so it finds such an i=1.

But in reality, there exists a valid split into k>1 parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps this condition is sufficient.

Let me see.

If pf[i]=pf[r], then the XOR from i+1 to r is pf[r] XOR pf[i]=0.

But in the valid split [1],[2,3],[4,5], the XOR of [4,5] is 1, not 0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple splits.

If pf[i]=pf[r], then the XOR from l to i is pf[i] XOR pf[l-1]=pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]=X.

And the XOR from i+1 to r is 0.

But we need all parts to have XOR=X.

So, if X !=0, having one part with XOR=0 is invalid.

But in the valid split [1],[2,3],[4,5], we have y1=1, y2=1, y3=1.

Wait, pf[1]=1, pf[3]=0, pf[5]=1.

So, pf[1]=pf[5]=1, and pf[3]=0.

So, the code would find pf[1]=pf[5], and answer YES.

But according to my earlier reasoning, this should be invalid, but it's actually valid because of the split [1],[2,3],[4,5].

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if pf[i]=pf[r], then I can split at i, and have the XOR from l to i equal to X, and from i+1 to r equal to 0.

But in this case, y3=1, not 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple splits recursively.

If I split at i=1 and i=3:

- [1],[2,3],[4,5]

- y1=1, y2=2 XOR 3=1, y3=4 XOR 5=1

So, all parts have XOR=1.

Hence, it's valid.

So, the condition pf[i]=pf[r] allows for such splits.

Hence, the code is correct in this case.

Wait, but earlier in the first query, [1,1,2,3,0], X=1, and pf[i]=pf[r]=1 at i=1.

But in that case, the split [1],[1],[2,3,0] is invalid because y3=0 !=1.

But there might be another split possible.

Wait, perhaps [1],[1,2,3],[0]

y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0, y3=0

Not all equal.

Another split: [1,1],[2,3,0]

y1=0, y2=1

Not equal.

Another split: [1],[1,2],[3,0]

y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2=3, y3=3 XOR 0=3

Not all equal.

Another split: [1,1,2],[3,0]

y1=0 XOR 2=2, y2=3 XOR 0=3

Not equal.

Another split: [1,1,2,3],[0]

y1=0 XOR 2 XOR 3=1, y2=0

Not equal.

So, in this case, despite pf[i]=pf[r]=1 at i=1, there is no valid split where all parts have XOR=1.

But according to the code, it would answer YES for this query, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a valid split.

Is there any way to split [1,1,2,3,0] into parts with XOR=1?

Let me try:

- [1],[1,2,3,0]: y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0=0 → Not equal

- [1,1],[2,3,0]: y1=0, y2=1 → Not equal

- [1],[1,2],[3,0]: y1=1, y2=1 XOR 2=3, y3=3 XOR 0=3 → Not equal

- [1,1,2],[3,0]: y1=0 XOR 2=2, y2=3 XOR 0=3 → Not equal

- [1,1,2,3],[0]: y1=0 XOR 2 XOR 3=1, y2=0 → Not equal

- [1],[1],[2,3,0]: y1=1, y2=1, y3=0 → Not equal

No valid split exists, but the code answers YES.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the code, it answers YES if X=0 or if there exists i in [l, r) with pf[i]=pf[r].

In this case, X=1 !=0, and pf[i]=pf[r]=1 at i=1.

Hence, it answers YES, but in reality, no valid split exists.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the second query, l=2 to 4, subarray [1,2,3], X=0, which should be YES.

In this case, pf[i]=pf[r]=0 at i=3.

And indeed, a valid split exists: [1,2],[3], where y1=3, y2=3, which is equal since X=0.

Wait, no, y1=1 XOR 2=3, y2=3.

But X=0, which is not equal to y1 and y2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, any split where all parts have XOR=0 is acceptable.

But in this case, y1=3, y2=3, which is not equal to X=0.

So, it's invalid.

But according to the code, since X=0, it answers YES directly.

But in reality, it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's possible to split into k parts where k is even, and each part has XOR=0.

But in this case, no such split exists.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition in the code is necessary but not sufficient.

In the second test case, it answers YES for X=0, but in reality, no valid split exists where all parts have XOR=0.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the second test case, the output is YES for X=0, but according to my analysis, it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to
