Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That condition sounds a bit tricky, so I need to break it down.

First, let's understand the condition: a + b should be a multiple of b * GCD(a, b). In mathematical terms, this means that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b without leaving a remainder. So, (a + b) mod (b * GCD(a, b)) == 0.

I need to find all pairs (a, b) that satisfy this. Since n and m can be up to 2 million, and there can be up to 10,000 test cases, efficiency is crucial. If I try to iterate through all possible pairs for each test case, that would be too slow because 2 million * 2 million is 4 trillion operations per test case, which is impractical.

So, I need a smarter way to calculate the number of valid pairs without checking each one individually. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula that allows me to compute the total number of valid pairs directly.

Let's think about the GCD part. Let’s denote GCD(a, b) as g. Then, a = g * x and b = g * y, where x and y are positive integers that are coprime (since g is the GCD).

Substituting into the condition:

a + b = g*x + g*y = g*(x + y)

b * GCD(a, b) = g*y * g = g^2 * y

So, the condition becomes:

g*(x + y) is a multiple of g^2 * y

Simplifying, since g is not zero, we can divide both sides by g:

x + y is a multiple of g * y

So, x + y ≡ 0 mod (g * y)

But x and y are coprime, and g is the GCD of a and b.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let’s consider the condition again: a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b).

Let’s denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1) should be a multiple of b * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d * (a1 + b1) is a multiple of d^2 * b1.

Dividing both sides by d (since d > 0):

a1 + b1 is a multiple of d * b1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, what can we say about this?

Let’s think about it. a1 + b1 is a multiple of d * b1.

Given that a1 and b1 are coprime, and b1 divides a1 + b1, then b1 divides a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so the only way b1 divides a1 is if b1 = 1.

Wait, is that right? If b1 divides a1 and GCD(a1, b1) = 1, then b1 must be 1.

So, b1 = 1.

That means b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a1, with GCD(a1, 1) = 1, so a1 can be any positive integer.

So, for b = d, and a being any multiple of d.

Wait, but b = d, and a = d * a1, where a1 is any positive integer.

Given that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b = d, we have d ≤ m.

And a = d * a1 ≤ n, so a1 ≤ n / d.

So, for each d (from 1 to m), the number of possible a1 is floor(n / d).

Therefore, for each d ≤ m, the number of valid pairs (a, b) is floor(n / d), where b = d.

So, the total number of valid pairs is the sum over d from 1 to m of floor(n / d).

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

1 1

According to this, d can be 1, and floor(n / 1) = 1, which matches the sample output of 1.

Sample Input 4:

10 8

Sum floor(n / d) for d from 1 to 8:

floor(10/1) = 10

floor(10/2) = 5

floor(10/3) = 3

floor(10/4) = 2

floor(10/5) = 2

floor(10/6) = 1

floor(10/7) = 1

floor(10/8) = 1

Total: 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

But the sample output for n=10, m=8 is 14, not 25. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe not all d are valid. In my earlier reasoning, I assumed that for each d ≤ m, b = d, and a = d * a1 ≤ n, so a1 ≤ floor(n / d). But perhaps not all d satisfy the original condition.

Let me go back.

I set b = d, but in the original problem, b can be any multiple of d, right? Wait, no, I set b = d in my earlier step, assuming that b must be equal to d.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Let me revisit this.

Given that b = d * b1, where GCD(a1, b1) = 1, and a = d * a1.

The condition is a + b = d * (a1 + b1) is a multiple of b * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d * (a1 + b1) is a multiple of d^2 * b1.

Simplify by dividing both sides by d: a1 + b1 is a multiple of d * b1.

Given that a1 and b1 are coprime, and b1 divides a1 + b1, then b1 divides a1.

But since GCD(a1, b1) = 1, b1 must be 1.

Therefore, b1 = 1, which implies b = d * 1 = d.

So, for each d, b = d, and a = d * a1, where a1 is any positive integer ≤ floor(n / d).

Therefore, for each d ≤ m, the number of valid a is floor(n / d), provided b = d.

Hence, the total number of valid pairs should be the sum of floor(n / d) for d from 1 to m.

But according to the sample input 4, n=10, m=8, sum floor(10/d) for d=1 to 8 is 25, but the sample output is 14. So where is the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps not all d ≤ m are valid. Maybe there are additional constraints on d.

Wait, perhaps d must divide a + b.

Wait, no, in my earlier reasoning, I derived that b = d, and a = d * a1, so a + b = d * (a1 + 1).

And b * GCD(a, b) = d * d = d^2.

So, d * (a1 + 1) must be a multiple of d^2, which simplifies to a1 + 1 must be a multiple of d.

So, a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

Since a1 can be any integer ≥1 such that a1 ≡ -1 mod d, and a = d * a1 ≤ n.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

But a1 must be positive integers, and a1 ≤ floor(n / d).

Given a1 ≡ -1 mod d, meaning a1 = k * d - 1 for some integer k ≥1.

But a1 must be ≥1, so k * d - 1 ≥1 ⇒ k * d ≥2 ⇒ k ≥ ceil(2/d).

But d ≥1, so k ≥1.

So, a1 can be d - 1, 2d - 1, 3d - 1, etc., up to the largest a1 where d * a1 ≤ n.

Wait, but d - 1 may not be positive for d=1.

For d=1, a1 can be any positive integer since 1 - 1 = 0, which is not positive. So for d=1, a1 can be any positive integer ≤ floor(n / 1) = n.

For d ≥2, a1 must be of the form k * d -1 for k ≥1, and k * d -1 ≤ floor(n / d).

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look at the sample input 4 again: n=10, m=8, output=14.

If I calculate sum floor(10/d) for d=1 to 8, I get 25, but the correct answer is 14. So clearly, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps not all d are valid. Maybe there's an additional constraint that d must divide a + b.

Wait, but in my earlier derivation, I set b = d, and a = d * a1, and required that a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a,b) = d^2.

And from that, I got that a1 +1 must be a multiple of d.

So, a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

Therefore, for each d, the number of valid a1 is the number of a1 ≤ floor(n / d) such that a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

So, for d=1: a1 can be any positive integer ≤10, since 1 divides anything. So, a1 from 1 to10, total 10.

d=2: a1 ≡ -1 mod 2, which is a1 odd. a1 ≤ floor(10/2)=5, so a1=1,3,5, total 3.

d=3: a1 ≡ -1 mod 3, which is a1 ≡2 mod 3. a1 ≤ floor(10/3)=3, so a1=2,5, but 5>3, so only a1=2. Total 1.

d=4: a1 ≡ -1 mod4, which is a1 ≡3 mod4. a1 ≤ floor(10/4)=2, so a1=3, but 3>2, so none. Total 0.

d=5: a1 ≡ -1 mod5, which is a1 ≡4 mod5. a1 ≤ floor(10/5)=2, so a1=4, but 4>2, so none. Total 0.

d=6: a1 ≡ -1 mod6, which is a1 ≡5 mod6. a1 ≤ floor(10/6)=1, so a1=5, but 5>1, so none. Total 0.

d=7: a1 ≡ -1 mod7, which is a1 ≡6 mod7. a1 ≤ floor(10/7)=1, so a1=6, but 6>1, so none. Total 0.

d=8: a1 ≡ -1 mod8, which is a1 ≡7 mod8. a1 ≤ floor(10/8)=1, so a1=7, but 7>1, so none. Total 0.

So, total valid pairs: 10 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14, which matches the sample output.

Great, so my earlier assumption was incorrect because not all d contribute floor(n/d) to the total; only those a1 that satisfy a1 ≡ -1 mod d are valid.

Therefore, for each d from 1 to m, I need to count the number of a1 ≤ floor(n/d) such that a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

For d=1, a1 can be any positive integer ≤n, since -1 mod 1 is 0, and any integer mod 1 is 0.

For d≥2, a1 must be ≡ -1 mod d, and a1 ≤ floor(n/d).

So, for d≥2, the number of such a1 is floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d).

Wait, how did I get that?

Let me think carefully.

For d≥2, a1 must satisfy:

a1 ≡ -1 mod d, which is a1 ≡ d-1 mod d.

And a1 ≤ floor(n/d).

This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers a1 ≤ floor(n/d) such that a1 ≡ d-1 mod d.

This is a standard arithmetic sequence problem.

The smallest a1 is d-1, provided d-1 ≤ floor(n/d).

Then, the sequence is d-1, 2d-1, 3d-1, ..., up to the largest k where (k*d -1) ≤ floor(n/d).

So, k*d -1 ≤ floor(n/d) ⇒ k ≤ (floor(n/d) +1)/d.

Therefore, the number of such k is floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d).

So, for d≥2, the number of valid a1 is floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d).

For d=1, it's simply floor(n/1) = n.

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is:

n + sum over d=2 to m of floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d)

Wait, but in the earlier calculation for d=3, floor(n/d)=3, so (3+1)/3=4/3=1.333, floor is 1, which matches the earlier count of 1.

For d=2, floor(n/d)=5, (5+1)/2=3, floor is 3, which matches the earlier count of 3.

For d=1, it's n=10.

Total: 10 + 3 +1 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0=14, which matches the sample.

Perfect.

So, now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and m can be up to 2 million, and t up to 10,000, but with the sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 2 million, I need an algorithm that is linear or close to linear in n and m.

In each test case, I need to compute n + sum over d=2 to m of floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

But this seems inefficient for large m, as it requires iterating up to m, which can be up to 2 million per test case.

Given that the sum of m over all test cases is up to 2 million, iterating up to m for each test case should be acceptable in terms of time constraints.

However, to optimize further, I can precompute certain values or find mathematical optimizations.

Let’s see.

Another way to look at the sum is:

sum over d=1 to m of floor(n/d) * some condition.

But in this case, for d=1, it's just n.

For d≥2, it's floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute this sum more efficiently.

Let me consider the inner floor division.

For d≥2, floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) can be rewritten as floor((n/d +1)/d), but since n/d is not necessarily an integer, I need to be careful.

Wait, no, floor(n/d) is an integer, so floor(n/d)+1 is an integer, and then dividing by d and taking floor is correct.

So, it's floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

An alternative approach is to iterate d from 1 to m, and for each d, compute floor(n/d), and if d≥2, compute floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

But this is O(m) per test case, which should be acceptable since sum of m over all test cases is up to 2 million.

Let me think about possible optimizations.

I recall that for summing floor(n/d) over d up to m, there are optimized ways using number theory, such as observing that floor(n/d) can only take on a limited number of distinct values, and grouping terms with the same value.

Similarly, perhaps I can group terms with the same floor(n/d) and compute the sum in a more efficient manner.

But given time constraints and the complexity of implementing such optimizations, and considering that the sum of m over all test cases is acceptable, perhaps it's sufficient to proceed with the straightforward approach.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

ans = n

root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1

for i in range(2, root + 1):

cnt = i * i

ans += (n + i) // cnt

print(ans)

Wait, this doesn't seem to match the logic I derived.

In my reasoning, for each d from 2 to m, I need to add floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) to the answer.

But in the code, it's iterating i from 2 to root = sqrt(n)+1, and for each i, it sets cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to the answer.

This seems completely different from what I derived.

Let me verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 4:

10 8

According to my earlier calculation, the answer should be 14.

Let's see what this code computes.

n=10, k=8 (k is used instead of m, but it's likely the same).

ans = 10

root = int(sqrt(10)) +1 = 3 +1 =4

for i from 2 to 4:

i=2, cnt=4, ans += (10 +2)//4 = 12//4=3, ans=13

i=3, cnt=9, ans += (10 +2)//9=12//9=1, ans=14

i=4, cnt=16, ans += (10 +2)//16=12//16=0, ans=14

Total ans=14, which matches the sample.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the answer should be 14, but my reasoning was more involved, considering floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) for d from 2 to m.

Yet, this simpler code produces the correct sample output.

Is there a mathematical equivalence here that I'm missing?

Let me see.

In the code, it's summing (n + i) // (i*i) for i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, and adding to n.

Is this equivalent to summing floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) for d from 2 to m?

Wait, perhaps there's a connection through the divisors of n.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me try another sample input.

Sample Input 1:

1 1

According to the code:

n=1, k=1

ans=1

root=int(sqrt(1))+1=1+1=2

i=2, cnt=4, ans += (1+2)//4=3//4=0, ans=1

Print 1, which matches the sample.

Another sample:

n=2, m=3

Expected output: 3

According to my earlier reasoning:

d=1: a1 ≤ 2/1=2, so a1=1,2 → a=1,2; b=1 → pairs (1,1),(2,1)

d=2: a1 ≤ 2/2=1, a1 ≡1 mod2 → a1=1 → a=2; b=2 → pair (2,2)

d=3: a1 ≤ 2/3=0, no a1 → no pairs

Total pairs: (1,1),(2,1),(2,2) → 3, which matches the expected output.

According to the code:

n=2, k=3

ans=2

root=int(sqrt(2))+1=1+1=2

i=2, cnt=4, ans += (2+2)//4=4//4=1, ans=3

i=3 is not in range since root=2, so only i=2 is considered.

Total ans=3, which matches.

Another test:

n=3, m=5

Expected output: 4

According to my reasoning:

d=1: a1 ≤3/1=3 → a1=1,2,3 → a=1,2,3; b=1 → pairs (1,1),(2,1),(3,1)

d=2: a1 ≤3/2=1, a1 ≡1 mod2 → a1=1 → a=2; b=2 → pair (2,2)

d=3: a1 ≤3/3=1, a1 ≡2 mod3 → a1=2, but 2>1, no pair

d=4: a1 ≤3/4=0, no a1

d=5: a1 ≤3/5=0, no a1

Total pairs: (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(2,2) → 4, matches expected output.

According to the code:

n=3, k=5

ans=3

root=int(sqrt(3))+1=1+1=2

i=2, cnt=4, ans += (3+2)//4=5//4=1, ans=4

i=3 is not in range since root=2, so only i=2 is considered.

Total ans=4, matches expected output.

Another test:

n=100, m=1233

Expected output:153

According to the code:

ans=100

root=int(sqrt(100))+1=10+1=11

i from 2 to 11:

i=2, cnt=4, ans += (100+2)//4=102//4=25, ans=125

i=3, cnt=9, ans += (100+2)//9=102//9=11, ans=136

i=4, cnt=16, ans += (100+2)//16=102//16=6, ans=142

i=5, cnt=25, ans += (100+2)//25=102//25=4, ans=146

i=6, cnt=36, ans += (100+2)//36=102//36=2, ans=148

i=7, cnt=49, ans += (100+2)//49=102//49=2, ans=150

i=8, cnt=64, ans += (100+2)//64=102//64=1, ans=151

i=9, cnt=81, ans += (100+2)//81=102//81=1, ans=152

i=10, cnt=100, ans += (100+2)//100=102//100=1, ans=153

i=11, cnt=121, ans += (100+2)//121=102//121=0, ans=153

Total ans=153, matches expected output.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for d from 2 to m, I need to add floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d), but in the code, it's adding (n + i) // (i*i) for i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1.

Yet, in all the test cases I checked, it produces the correct answer.

There must be some mathematical relationship here that I'm not seeing.

Let me try to find a general formula.

I need to show that sum over d=2 to m of floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) equals sum over i=2 to floor(sqrt(n))+1 of floor((n + i)/(i*i)).

Wait, that seems unlikely, but the code seems to work for the sample inputs.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this sum.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has been misinterpreted, and the condition a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a,b) can be simplified differently.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that b * GCD(a,b) divides a + b.

Let’s denote d = GCD(a,b), so a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, with GCD(a1, b1) =1.

Then, a + b = d*(a1 + b1), and b * GCD(a,b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d*(a1 + b1) is divisible by d^2 * b1.

Dividing both sides by d (since d >0), we get a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1.

Since GCD(a1, b1) =1, a1 and b1 are coprime, which implies that b1 divides a1 + b1.

But since GCD(a1, b1) =1, b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1.

But since GCD(a1, b1) =1, the only possibility is b1=1.

Therefore, b1=1, which implies b = d * 1 = d.

So, for each d from 1 to m, b = d, and a = d * a1, where a1 is any positive integer such that a = d * a1 ≤ n.

Therefore, for each d, the number of valid a is floor(n / d), provided that b = d.

Hence, the total number of valid pairs is sum over d=1 to m of floor(n / d).

But earlier, with n=10 and m=8, sum floor(10/d) for d=1 to 8 is 10 +5 +3 +2 +2 +1 +1 +1 =25, but the sample output is 14.

So, this suggests that not all d from 1 to m are valid; there must be an additional condition.

Wait, perhaps only certain d satisfy the condition that b = d divides a + b.

Wait, but in my earlier substitution, I set b = d, and a = d * a1, and derived that b1=1, which is consistent.

So, perhaps the condition is that b divides a + b.

Wait, but b divides a + b if and only if b divides a, which is always true since a is a multiple of d = GCD(a,b).

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, let's double-check.

If b divides a + b, then b divides a, since b divides b.

So, b divides a + b implies b divides a.

But in our earlier substitution, a = d * a1 and b = d.

So, b = d divides a = d * a1, which is always true.

Therefore, the condition b divides a + b is always satisfied when b = d.

Hence, the total number of valid pairs should indeed be sum over d=1 to m of floor(n / d).

But according to the sample input 4, n=10, m=8, sum floor(10/d) for d=1 to8 is 10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1=25, but the sample output is 14.

This suggests that my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the condition.

Let me revisit the condition: a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a,b).

In terms of d = GCD(a,b), and b = d * b1, a = d * a1, with GCD(a1, b1)=1.

Then, a + b = d*(a1 + b1), and b * GCD(a,b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d*(a1 + b1) is a multiple of d^2 * b1.

Divide both sides by d: a1 + b1 is a multiple of d * b1.

Given that GCD(a1, b1)=1, for a1 + b1 to be a multiple of d * b1, since b1 divides a1 + b1 and b1 divides d * b1, and GCD(a1, b1)=1, perhaps d must be 1.

Wait, no, in the sample input, d can be greater than 1, and the code produces the correct output.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 + b1 must be divisible by d * b1.

Given that b1 divides a1 + b1, and GCD(a1, b1)=1, then b1 must divide a1 + b1, which implies b1 divides a1, which implies b1=1.

Therefore, b1=1, so b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a1, with a1 being any positive integer ≤ floor(n / d).

Hence, for each d from 1 to m, the number of valid a is floor(n / d).

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is sum over d=1 to m of floor(n / d).

But according to the sample input 4, this sum is 25, but the sample output is 14.

This suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps not all d from 1 to m are valid.

Wait, perhaps the condition a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a,b) imposes additional restrictions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

Given that b1=1, then d divides a1 +1.

Because a1 + b1 = a1 +1.

So, d divides a1 +1.

Therefore, for each d, a1 must satisfy a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

Hence, for each d from 1 to m, the number of valid a1 is floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d).

For d=1: floor((floor(n/d)+1)/1) = floor(n/d +1) = floor(n/d)+1, since n/d is integer if d divides n, otherwise floor(n/d).

Wait, no, floor(n/d)+1 if n/d is not integer, else floor(n/d).

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express this.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of a1 ≤ floor(n/d) such that a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

This is equal to floor((floor(n/d) +1)/d).

For d=1, floor((floor(n/d)+1)/1) = floor(n/d +1) = n +1, but earlier I thought it's just n.

Wait, no, in the d=1 case, a1 can be any positive integer ≤n, since b=1, and a=1*a1 ≤n.

So, number of a1 is n.

For d≥2, it's floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

Hence, the total is n + sum over d=2 to m of floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d).

But in the code, it's computing n + sum over i=2 to floor(sqrt(n))+1 of floor((n + i)/ (i*i)).

This seems different, yet it produces the correct sample outputs.

Is there a mathematical equivalence between sum over d=2 to m of floor((floor(n/d)+1)/d) and sum over i=2 to floor(sqrt(n))+1 of floor((n + i)/(i*i))?

Wait, perhaps the code is exploiting some number-theoretic identity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of d and a1 pairs where a1 ≤ floor(n/d) and a1 ≡ -1 mod d.

And this sum can be optimized by iterating over i where i*i <=n, but I'm not sure.

Given that the code produces correct outputs for the sample inputs, it seems to be correct, even if I don't fully understand why this optimization works.
