Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. I need to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I want. The goal is to minimize the number of cards I have in the end.

Let me think about what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any group of k identical cards, I can reduce it to k-1 cards by choosing to replace them with fewer cards. I can repeat this process as many times as I want, as long as I have groups of k identical cards.

So, my strategy should be to repeatedly apply this operation to the largest groups of identical cards until I can't apply it anymore. The remaining cards would be those that don't have k identical cards.

Let me consider the first example in the problem:

Input:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

Output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

Looking at the first test case:

n = 5, k = 3

Cards: 4, 1, 1, 4, 4

So, I have three 4's and two 1's.

I can perform the operation on the three 4's: replace them with two cards of any number. Let's say I replace them with two 1's. Now, I have two 1's and two 1's from before, totaling four 1's.

Now, I can perform the operation again on three of these 1's: replace them with two cards of any number. Let's say I replace them with two 1's again. Now, I have two 1's from the replacement and one 1 left from before, totaling three 1's.

I can perform the operation one more time on two of these 1's: replace them with one card of any number. Now, I have one 1 left.

Wait, but in the example, they show a sequence that ends with two cards. Maybe I made a mistake in my sequence.

Looking back at the example sequence in the problem description, they end up with two cards. Maybe my approach is not optimal.

Let me try again.

Starting with:

- Three 4's and two 1's.

Perform operation on three 4's: replace with two cards. Let's choose two different numbers, say 2 and 3.

Now, I have: 2, 3, 1, 1

No group of three identical cards now, so I can't perform the operation anymore.

Total cards left: 4

But the example shows a minimum of 2 cards. Hmm, my approach is not leading to the optimal solution.

Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a large number of identical cards, say m cards all with the same number.

Each time I perform the operation, I reduce the group size by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

Wait, no. Wait, when I replace k cards with k-1 cards, I reduce the total number of cards by 1.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm confusing myself.

Wait, let's see: I start with m cards of the same number.

I perform the operation: replace k of them with k-1 cards.

So, the new total is m - k + (k-1) = m - 1

So, each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, I can keep performing operations until I can't anymore, which is when no group has at least k cards.

So, for a group of size m, the minimum number of cards left from this group is m % (k - 1), because each operation reduces the group by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

Wait, no. Wait, each operation reduces the group by k - (k-1) = 1 card, but it's more nuanced because you can choose what to replace them with.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum number of times I can perform the operation on this group.

Given a group of size m, each operation reduces the group size by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

So, the number of operations I can perform is floor(m / k), and each operation reduces the group by 1 card.

Wait, no.

Wait, each operation reduces the group by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

Wait, but in reality, when I replace k cards with k-1 cards, the group size reduces by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

So, the number of operations I can perform is m - x, where x is the residual group size.

But I need to think in terms of how many operations I can perform until the group is less than k.

So, the number of operations is floor(m / k), and each operation reduces the group by 1 card.

Therefore, the remaining cards in the group are m - floor(m / k)

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think in terms of repeatedly subtracting k and adding k-1.

Each operation: m = m - k + (k-1) = m - 1

So, each operation reduces m by 1.

Therefore, I can perform the operation m - x times, where x is the final group size less than k.

Wait, more carefully:

Starting with m cards.

Each operation: m = m - k + (k-1) = m - 1

So, I can perform this operation m - x times, where x is the final group size less than k.

Therefore, the minimum number of cards left from this group is m % (k - 1)

Wait, no.

Wait, if each operation reduces m by 1, then the number of operations I can perform is floor(m / 1) = m, but that doesn't make sense because I need at least k cards to perform an operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each operation reduces the group size by k - (k-1) = 1 card.

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is floor(m / k), because each operation requires k cards.

Each operation reduces the group size by 1.

Therefore, the remaining cards in the group are m - floor(m / k)

Wait, no.

Wait, if m = 5, k = 3.

floor(5 / 3) = 1 operation.

After one operation: 5 - 3 + 2 = 4 cards.

Wait, but according to the formula m - floor(m / k) = 5 - 1 = 4, which matches.

But in reality, in the first example, m = 3 for number 4, and m = 2 for number 1.

After one operation on m = 3, it becomes 2 cards.

Total cards: 2 (from 4's) + 2 (from 1's) = 4.

But in the example, they show a sequence that ends with 2 cards.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the replacement cards can be used in future operations.

In the first example, after replacing three 4's with two 1's, now I have four 1's.

Then, I can perform another operation on three of these 1's, replacing them with two cards.

Say I replace them with two 2's.

Now, I have two 2's and one 1 left.

Total cards: 3.

I can perform another operation on two 2's, replacing them with one card.

Say I replace them with one 3.

Now, I have one 3 and one 1.

Total cards: 2.

This matches the example's minimum.

So, the key is that the replacement cards can be used in future operations.

Therefore, I need a strategy that maximizes the reuse of replacement cards in future operations.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by k - (k-1) = 1.

So, each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

I can perform operations as long as there exists a group of k identical cards.

So, the minimum number of cards is the total number of cards minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Which is n - f, where f is the maximum number of operations.

But what's the maximum number of operations?

Each operation requires k cards of the same number and produces k-1 cards of any numbers.

These k-1 cards can be used in future operations.

So, it's like a process of reducing the card count by 1 each time, as long as there are groups of k identical cards.

Therefore, the process can continue until no group has k identical cards.

So, the minimum number of cards is the smallest number such that no group has k identical cards.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, in the first example, with n=5, k=3, and counts {4:3, 1:2}.

After one operation, replace three 4's with two 1's, now counts {1:4}.

Then, replace three 1's with two of something else, say 2's, now counts {1:1, 2:2}.

Then, replace two 2's with one of something else, say 3, now counts {1:1, 3:1}.

Total cards: 2.

So, in the end, no group has three identical cards, which is consistent.

So, the process stops when no group has k identical cards.

Therefore, the minimum number of cards is the smallest n' such that no group has k identical cards.

So, for each group, the maximum number of cards I can have is k-1.

Therefore, for a group with original count m, the minimum number of cards needed is m if m < k, else ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, for each group, to avoid having k identical cards, I need to have at most k-1 cards in that group.

So, if I have m cards of a certain number, I need to split them into groups of at most k-1.

The minimum number of groups needed is ceil(m / (k - 1)).

And each group can have up to k-1 cards.

Therefore, the total minimum number of cards is sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil(m / (k - 1)) is the number of groups needed, and each group has at most k-1 cards.

So, the total number of cards is sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

But I need the minimum number of cards such that no group has k identical cards.

Actually, for each group, to have less than k cards, I need to have at most k-1 cards in that group.

So, the minimal number of cards for each group is m if m < k, else ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have m cards, and I need to split them into groups of at most k-1 cards, the minimal number of groups is ceil(m / (k - 1)).

And since each group can have up to k-1 cards, the total number of cards is at least ceil(m / (k - 1)) * 1, but I need to have at least m cards in total.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Actually, to minimize the total number of cards, while ensuring that no group has k identical cards, I need to distribute the cards into groups where each group has at most k-1 identical cards.

The minimal number of groups needed for a group with m cards is ceil(m / (k - 1)).

And since each group can have up to k-1 cards, the total number of cards is at least ceil(m / (k - 1)) * 1.

But I need to have at least m cards in total, because I can't have fewer cards than the original count.

Wait, no, because I can introduce new cards in the replacement process.

Wait, but in the end, I want to minimize the total number of cards.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimal n' such that n' >= sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)).

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cards is sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Because for each group, I need to have ceil(m / (k - 1)) groups, each with k - 1 cards.

So, total cards would be ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

But actually, ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1) is equal to m + (k - 1 - m mod (k - 1)) if m mod (k - 1) != 0, else m.

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil(m / (k - 1)) * (k - 1) is equal to the smallest multiple of (k - 1) that is greater than or equal to m.

So, it's m + (k - 1 - m mod (k - 1)) if m mod (k - 1) != 0, else m.

But in the first example, m = 3 for 4's, k - 1 = 2.

ceil(3 / 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4.

m = 2 for 1's, ceil(2 / 2) * 2 = 2.

Total cards: 4 + 2 = 6.

But in the example, they achieve 2 cards.

So, my formula is giving 6, but the example achieves 2.

So, this formula is not correct.

I must be missing something.

Perhaps I need to consider that the replacement cards can be distributed among different groups.

Wait, in the first operation, I can replace three 4's with two 1's.

Now, the counts are: 1's: 4, 4's: 0.

Then, I can replace three 1's with two of something else, say 2's.

Now, counts: 1's:1, 2's:2.

Then, replace two 2's with one 3.

Now, counts: 1's:1, 3's:1.

Total cards: 2.

So, by introducing new numbers in the replacement, I can reduce the total number of cards.

So, the key is that the replacement cards can be of any number, and I can choose them to be different from existing groups to minimize the number of groups that can be operated on in the future.

Wait, actually, in the above sequence, they chose to replace with existing numbers, but in this case, choosing new numbers allowed further operations.

Wait, in the first operation, replacing three 4's with two 1's increased the count of 1's, allowing another operation.

Then, replacing three 1's with two 2's introduces 2's, and then replacing two 2's with one 3 introduces 3's.

So, each time, the replacement cards are of a new number, which allows further operations.

So, by carefully choosing the numbers for the replacement cards, I can minimize the total number of cards.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards is the total number of cards minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

And each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, I need to maximize the number of operations I can perform.

To maximize the number of operations, I need to have as many groups of size >= k as possible.

But since I can choose the numbers for the replacement cards, I can strategically introduce new numbers or increase existing groups to enable more operations.

Wait, but in practice, it's complex to track.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the total number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, the minimal number of cards is n - f, where f is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

I need to maximize f.

To maximize f, I need to perform operations as long as there is any group with at least k identical cards.

So, I need to find the maximal number of operations I can perform.

But this seems tricky.

Perhaps there's a mathematical formula for this.

Wait, let's consider that for a group with m cards, the number of operations I can perform on it is floor(m / k).

Each operation reduces the group size by k - (k - 1) = 1.

Wait, but in reality, since the replacement cards can be distributed anywhere, it's not just about individual groups.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, I can perform operations until no group has at least k identical cards.

So, the minimal number of cards is the minimal n' such that no group has at least k identical cards.

This seems similar to distributing the cards into groups where no group has at least k identical cards, and minimizing the total number of cards.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the ceiling function.

For each group with m cards, the minimal number of groups needed to hold these m cards without any group having at least k identical cards is ceil(m / (k - 1)).

Because each group can have at most k - 1 identical cards.

Then, the total minimal number of groups is sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)).

And since each group can have up to k - 1 cards, the total number of cards is at least sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k - 1)) * 1.

But in reality, I can have more cards in some groups, up to k - 1 per group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of cards is n - floor(n / (k - 1)).

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps n - floor((n - 1) / (k - 1)).

Wait, I need to find a formula that matches the sample inputs.

In the first sample, n = 5, k = 3.

According to the sample, the minimal number is 2.

So, 5 - 3 = 2.

Wait, 5 - floor(5 / 3) = 5 - 1 = 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (n - 1) / (k - 1).

Wait, n - floor((n - 1) / (k - 1)).

For n=5, k=3: 5 - floor(4 / 2) = 5 - 2 = 3, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Looking at the second sample: n=1, k=10.

Output:1

Since n < k, no operation can be performed, so minimal cards are 1.

Third sample: n=7, k=2.

Cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Counts: 2:2, others:1.

So, groups: 2:2, others:1 each.

For k=2, need to have groups with less than 2 identical cards.

So, for the group with 2 cards of 2, need to split them into two groups of 1.

So, total minimal cards: 7 - 1 = 6.

Wait, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, no, sample output for the third case is 1.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps with smart replacement.

Starting with counts: 2:2, others:1.

Operation on the two 2's: replace them with one card of any number, say 3.

Now, counts: 3:1, others:1.

Total cards: 6.

No group has two identical cards, so minimal is 6.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the replacement cards can be chosen to be the same as existing cards, but in a way that allows further operations.

Wait, perhaps in the third sample, you can choose to replace the two 2's with two 1's.

Then, counts become: 1:3, others:1.

Now, perform operation on three 1's: replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's.

Now, counts: 4:2, others:1.

Perform operation on two 4's: replace them with one card, say 5.

Now, counts: 5:1, others:1.

Total cards: 1.

Ah, I see.

So, by carefully choosing the replacement cards to create new groups that can be operated on further, I can minimize the total number of cards.

So, the strategy is to use the replacement cards to create groups that can be operated on again.

In this case, replacing two 2's with two 1's allowed me to create a group of three 1's, which could then be operated on to create two cards, and so on, until only one card is left.

So, the minimal number of cards is 1.

Similarly, in the fourth sample: n=10, k=4, all cards are 1.

So, counts: 1:10.

Perform operation on four 1's: replace them with three cards of any number, say three 2's.

Now, counts: 2:3, 1:6.

Perform operation on four 1's again: replace them with three cards, say three 3's.

Now, counts: 2:3, 3:3, 1:2.

Perform operation on three 2's: replace them with two cards, say two 4's.

Now, counts: 4:2, 3:3, 1:2.

Perform operation on three 3's: replace them with two cards, say two 5's.

Now, counts: 4:2, 5:2, 1:2.

Perform operation on two 4's: replace them with one card, say 6.

Now, counts: 6:1, 5:2, 1:2.

Perform operation on two 5's: replace them with one card, say 7.

Now, counts: 6:1, 7:1, 1:2.

Perform operation on two 1's: replace them with one card, say 8.

Now, counts: 6:1, 7:1, 8:1.

Total cards: 3.

Which matches the sample output.

So, the minimal number of cards is 3.

So, the general approach is to repeatedly perform operations on the largest groups until no group has k identical cards.

To minimize the total number of cards, I need to maximize the number of operations performed.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, the minimal number of cards is n - f, where f is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

To maximize f, I need to perform operations on the largest groups first, preferably on groups that can enable more operations in the future.

But this seems heuristic-based.

Is there a formula to compute f directly?

Looking back at the first sample: n=5, k=3.

f=3 operations, so minimal cards = 5 - 3 = 2.

Second sample: n=1, k=10.

f=0, so minimal cards =1 -0=1.

Third sample: n=7, k=2.

f=6 operations, minimal cards=7-6=1.

Fourth sample: n=10, k=4.

f=7 operations, minimal cards=10-7=3.

Fifth sample: n=5, k=2.

f=4 operations, minimal cards=5-4=1.

Sixth sample: n=6, k=2.

f=5 operations, minimal cards=6-5=1.

Seventh sample: n=6, k=3.

f=2 operations, minimal cards=6-2=4.

Wait, but in the seventh sample, the output is 6, not 4.

Wait, no, the seventh sample has n=6, k=3, and output=6.

Wait, according to my calculation, minimal cards should be 6 - 2 =4, but sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, with n=6, k=3, if I perform two operations, each reducing the total by 1, so 6 - 2 =4.

But sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after operations, some cards are introduced that can't be operated on further.

Wait, perhaps in this case, it's not possible to perform two operations.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose counts are: 10:2, 20:2, 30:1, 40:1.

So, groups: 10:2, 20:2, 30:1, 40:1.

No group has three cards, so no operation can be performed.

So, minimal cards are 6.

Hence, the minimal number is 6.

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, f= floor(sum of floor(m / 3) for all groups).

But in this case, floor(2/3) + floor(2/3) + floor(1/3) + floor(1/3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 =0.

So, minimal cards =6 -0=6, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps f is the total number of operations I can perform, which is sum over all groups of floor(m / k).

But in the third sample, n=7, k=2.

Counts: 2:2, others:1.

So, sum of floor(m / 2) for all groups: floor(2/2) + floor(1/2) + ... =1 +0+0+0+0=1.

So, minimal cards=7 -1=6, but sample output is 1.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform operations iteratively, updating the counts each time.

In the third sample:

Initial counts: 2:2, others:1.

Perform operation on two 2's: replace with one card, say 3.

Now, counts: 3:1, others:1.

No group has two identical cards, so f=1, minimal cards=7-1=6.

But sample output is 1.

So, my formula is undercounting f.

Wait, perhaps f is the total number of operations I can perform, which is the sum of floor(m / k) over all groups, iteratively updated after each operation.

But that's complicated to compute directly.

Is there a better way?

Looking back, perhaps f is n - the minimal number of groups where each group has at most k-1 cards.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps f is n - the minimal number of groups needed to hold all cards with no group having k identical cards.

But I need to minimize the total number of cards, not the number of groups.

I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in all sample inputs where n < k, the minimal number of cards is n, because no operation can be performed.

When n >=k, I can perform at least one operation.

In the first sample, n=5, k=3.

Performed one operation, then another, and another, ending with 2 cards.

In the third sample, n=7, k=2.

Performed six operations, ending with 1 card.

In the fourth sample, n=10, k=4.

Performed seven operations, ending with 3 cards.

So, perhaps f = n - minimal number of cards = floor(n / (k -1)).

Wait, no.

In the first sample, floor(5 / 2) =2, so f=2, minimal cards=5-2=3, but sample is 2.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps f = n - ceil(n / (k -1)).

For first sample: ceil(5 / 2)=3, f=5-3=2. Matches.

Third sample: ceil(7 /1)=7, f=7-1=6, matches.

Fourth sample: ceil(10 /3)=4, f=10-4=6, but sample output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that k-1 is the maximum number of cards per group.

So, minimal number of groups is ceil(n / (k -1)), and each group can have up to k-1 cards.

So, total minimal cards is ceil(n / (k -1)) * (k -1).

But in the fourth sample, ceil(10 /3)=4, 4*3=12, which is more than 10.

So, doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n / k).

First sample: 5 - floor(5/3)=5-1=4, doesn't match.

Third sample:7 - floor(7/2)=7-3=4, doesn't match.

Wait, no.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, f is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

To maximize f, I need to have as many groups with k cards as possible.

But since I can choose the replacement cards, I can strategically create new groups to enable more operations.

So, perhaps f = n - m, where m is the minimal number of groups needed such that no group has k identical cards.

Each group can have at most k-1 cards.

So, m = sum over all groups of ceil(m / (k -1)).

But in the third sample, m = ceil(2 /1) + ceil(1 /1) + ceil(1 /1) + ceil(1 /1) + ceil(1 /1) =2+1+1+1+1=6.

So, f =7 -6=1, but sample output is 1, which would correspond to n -f=7-6=1.

Wait, but according to the sample, f=6, minimal cards=1.

So, perhaps f = n - minimal cards.

So, minimal cards = n - f.

But I need to find f, which is the maximal number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces n by 1, and requires k identical cards.

Given that I can choose the replacement cards, I can maximize f by choosing replacements that allow as many future operations as possible.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a mathematical formula.

I found that in all cases, minimal cards = n - floor((n -1)/(k -1)).

Wait, let's test it.

First sample: n=5, k=3.

floor((5-1)/(3-1))=floor(4/2)=2.

Minimal cards=5-2=3, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Second sample: n=1, k=10.

floor(0/9)=0.

Minimal cards=1-0=1. Matches.

Third sample: n=7, k=2.

floor(6/1)=6.

Minimal cards=7-6=1. Matches.

Fourth sample: n=10, k=4.

floor(9/3)=3.

Minimal cards=10-3=7, but sample is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n /(k -1)).

First sample: floor(5 /2)=2, minimal cards=3. Matches.

Third sample: floor(7 /1)=7, minimal cards=0, but sample is 1. Doesn't match.

Wait, no.

Perhaps it's n - ceil((n -1)/(k -1)).

First sample: ceil(4/2)=2, minimal cards=3. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - ceil(n / (k -1)).

First sample: ceil(5 /2)=3, minimal cards=2. Doesn't match.

Wait, 5 -3=2. Matches.

Third sample: ceil(7 /1)=7, minimal cards=7-7=0, but sample is 1. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n /(k -1)).

First sample: floor(5 /2)=2, minimal cards=3. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's more complex.

Let me consider that for k=2, the minimal number of cards is 1.

Because you can keep reducing pairs to single cards until you have one left.

Similarly, for k=3, you can reduce groups of three to two, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cards is k -1.

Wait, no, in the first sample, it's 2, which is k -1.

In the fourth sample, k=4, minimal cards=3, which is k -1.

In the third sample, k=2, minimal cards=1, which is k -1.

In the second sample, k=10, n=1, minimal cards=1, which is less than k -1=9.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps when n < k -1, minimal cards =n.

Else, minimal cards =k -1.

Wait, in the second sample, n=1, k=10, minimal cards=1, which is min(n, k -1).

Wait, k -1=9, n=1 <9, so minimal cards=1.

First sample: n=5, k=3, k -1=2, so minimal cards=2.

Fourth sample: n=10, k=4, k -1=3, minimal cards=3.

Third sample: n=7, k=2, k -1=1, but sample output is 1, which is k -1=1.

Fifth sample: n=5, k=2, k -1=1, sample output=1.

Sixth sample: n=6, k=2, k -1=1, sample output=1.

Seventh sample: n=6, k=3, k -1=2, sample output=6.

Wait, but 6 >2.

Wait, perhaps when n <=k -1, minimal cards=n.

Else, minimal cards=k -1.

But in the seventh sample, n=6, k -1=2, but sample output is 6.

Which is consistent with n >k -1, minimal cards=k -1=2, but sample is 6.

Wait, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps only when n <=k -1, minimal cards=n, else k -1.

But in the seventh sample, n=6, k -1=2, but sample output is 6.

Which suggests that when n <=k -1, minimal cards=n, else k -1.

But in this case, 6 >2, so minimal cards should be 2, but sample is 6.

So, this is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Perhaps minimal cards is max(n - (k -1), 0) + (k -1).

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps minimal cards is n mod (k -1).

But in the first sample, n=5, k -1=2, 5 mod 2=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's (n -1) mod (k -1) +1.

First sample: (5 -1) mod 2 +1=0 +1=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (k -1) * floor(n / (k -1)).

First sample: 5 -2*2=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (k -1) * floor((n -1)/(k -1)).

First sample: 5 -2*2=1, doesn't match.

Third sample:7 -1*7=0, but sample is 1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (k -1) * floor((n -1)/(k -1)) if n >=k -1, else n.

First sample:5 -2*2=1, but sample is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for n >=k, minimal cards=k -1, else n.

But in the seventh sample, n=6, k=3, k -1=2, but sample is 6.

Which contradicts.

Wait, in the seventh sample, k=3, but n=6, which is >=k -1=2, but sample is 6, not 2.

Wait, perhaps only when n >=k, minimal cards=k -1, else n.

But in the seventh sample, n=6 >=3, minimal cards should be 2, but sample is 6.

So, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps it's when all groups have m >=k, minimal cards=k -1, else n.

But in the seventh sample, groups are 10:2,20:2,30:1,40:1.

No group has m >=k=3, so minimal cards=n=6.

Which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the formula is:

If all groups have m <k, then minimal cards =n.

Else, minimal cards =k -1.

But in the fourth sample, n=10, k=4.

All groups have m=10 >=k=4, so minimal cards=3=k -1.

But in the fourth sample, output is 3.

Wait, but in the fourth sample, m=10 >=k=4, so minimal cards=3.

In the seventh sample, m=2,2,1,1 <k=3, so minimal cards=6.

In the first sample, m=3,2, where m=3 >=k=3, so minimal cards=2=k -1.

In the third sample, m=2,1,1,1,1 <k=2, so minimal cards=1.

Wait, m=2 >=k=2, but in this case, k=2, so m >=k implies minimal cards=1=k -1.

But in the third sample, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps when at least one group has m >=k, then minimal cards=k -1, else n.

This seems consistent with all samples.

First sample: m=3 >=k=3, so minimal cards=2.

Third sample: m=2 >=k=2, so minimal cards=1.

Fourth sample: m=10 >=k=4, so minimal cards=3.

Seventh sample: m=2 <k=3, so minimal cards=6.

Wait, but in the seventh sample, m=2 >=k=3? No, m=2 <k=3, so minimal cards=6.

Hence, the formula is:

If all groups have m <k, then minimal cards =n.

Else, minimal cards =k -1.

This seems to match all the sample inputs.

So, the minimal number of cards is:

- If there exists at least one group with m >=k, then minimal cards =k -1.

- Else, minimal cards =n.

So, in code, I need to check if any group has m >=k.

If yes, then minimal cards =k -1.

Else, minimal cards =n.

This seems straightforward.

Now, looking back at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(k - 1)

It always prints k -1, regardless of the input lists.

But according to my reasoning, it should print k -1 only if there exists at least one group with m >=k, else print n.

But according to the formula I derived, it's always k -1 if any group has m >=k, else n.

But in the given program, it always prints k -1.

Looking back at the samples:

First sample: n=5, k=3, m=3 >=k=3, so minimal cards=2=k -1.

Second sample: n=1, k=10, m=1 <10, so minimal cards=1=n.

Third sample: n=7, k=2, m=2 >=2, so minimal cards=1=k -1.

Fourth sample: n=10, k=4,
