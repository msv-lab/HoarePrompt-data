Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in my hand after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. The key here is that the new cards can have any numbers, not necessarily the same as the ones I exchanged.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

Output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

Looking at the first test case:

n=5, k=3

Cards: 4,1,1,4,4

The sequence of operations is shown in the picture, resulting in 2 cards left.

In the second test case:

n=1, k=10

Cards: 7

Since n < k, no operation can be performed, so the answer is 1.

Third test case:

n=7, k=2

Cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3

I can perform operations on pairs of the same number. Here, only two 2's are present, so I can perform one operation to replace them with one card of any number. The remaining cards would be 4,1,100,5,3, plus the new card, totaling 6 cards. But the output is 1, which suggests that more operations are possible.

Wait, maybe I can choose to make the new card the same as another existing card to perform more operations. For example, if I replace the two 2's with one card, say another 1, then I have cards: 4,1,1,100,5,3. Now, I have three 1's. With k=2, I can perform operations on any two cards with the same number.

So, from three 1's, I can perform one operation on two of them, replacing them with one card of any number, say another 1. Now, I have cards: 4,1,100,5,3. Again, two 1's can be replaced with one card, and so on, until I'm left with one card.

Hmm, but in this case, it seems like I can reduce the number of cards significantly by choosing to create cards that allow further operations.

Fourth test case:

n=10, k=4

All cards are 1.

I can perform operations on any 4 cards, replacing them with 3 cards of any numbers. If I keep doing this, I'll reduce the number of cards step by step: 10 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3.

Fifth test case:

n=5, k=2

Cards: 3,8,1,48,7

All cards have unique numbers, so no operations can be performed. Thus, the answer is 5.

Sixth test case:

n=6, k=2

Cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

I have two 10's and two 20's.

First, perform an operation on two 10's, replace them with one card, say another 20.

Now, cards are: 20,30,20,40,20.

Now, I have three 20's. Perform an operation on two of them, replace them with one card, say another 20.

Now, cards are: 20,30,40.

No more operations can be performed. So, 3 cards left.

But the output is 1, which means there's a better sequence of operations.

Wait, maybe instead of replacing two 10's with another 20, I could replace them with another number that allows more operations.

For example, replace two 10's with two new numbers, say 30 and 40.

Then, cards are: 30,30,20,20,40,40.

Now, I can perform operations on pairs of the same numbers.

Replace two 30's with one card, say 20.

Now: 20,20,40,40.

Replace two 20's with one card, say 40.

Now: 40,40.

Replace two 40's with one card.

Finally, one card left.

So, by choosing wisely which numbers to create, I can minimize the number of cards left.

Seventh test case:

n=6, k=3

Cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

I have two 10's, two 20's, and one 30 and one 40.

Perform an operation on three cards: say, two 10's and one 20, replace them with two cards of any numbers, say two new numbers, 30 and 40.

Now, cards are: 30,40,20,30,40.

Now, I have two 30's and two 40's.

Perform an operation on two 30's and one 40, replace them with two cards, say 20 and 40.

Now, cards are: 20,40,20,40.

Perform an operation on two 20's, replace them with one card, say 40.

Now, cards are: 40,40.

Perform an operation on two 40's, replace them with one card.

Finally, one card left.

Wait, but the output is 6, which suggests that in this case, it's not possible to reduce to one card.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, no, according to the output, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps in this case, with k=3, I can't perform operations because I don't have three cards with the same number.

Wait, in the previous step, I had two 30's and two 40's, which is not enough for k=3.

Wait, maybe I can't perform operations when I don't have k cards with the same number.

Wait, in the seventh test case, n=6, k=3

Cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

So, counts are:

10:2

20:2

30:1

40:1

Since k=3, I need at least three cards with the same number to perform an operation.

Here, no number has three cards, so no operations can be performed. Thus, the answer is 6.

Wait, but the output is 6, which matches this.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, with n=6, k=2, I was able to reduce to one card by choosing wisely which numbers to create.

So, the key seems to be that with k=2, I can repeatedly reduce the number of cards by replacing pairs with a single card, potentially creating new cards to allow further operations.

But with k=3, I need three cards with the same number to perform an operation, which I don't have in the seventh test case.

In the fourth test case, with n=10, k=4, all cards are 1, so I can perform operations repeatedly: 10->7->4->3.

So, it seems that if I have enough cards with the same number, I can reduce the number of cards by performing operations that replace k cards with k-1 cards.

Moreover, since the new cards can have any numbers, I can potentially create new cards with numbers that allow further operations.

So, the strategy seems to be to maximize the number of operations by choosing to create cards that can be used in future operations.

But, in practice, what's the best way to minimize the number of cards left?

Let me think about the general approach.

Given that I can perform operations as long as I have k cards with the same number, and each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1 (since k cards are replaced by k-1 cards), the goal is to perform as many operations as possible.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, so the minimum number of cards left would be n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

But, I need to consider that performing one operation might enable more operations by creating new cards with numbers that allow further operations.

However, since the new cards can have any numbers, I can potentially create numbers that I have enough of to perform more operations.

But, this seems a bit tricky to model directly.

Let me consider the counts of each number in the hand.

Let's say I have counts[c] representing the number of cards with number c.

I can perform an operation on any number c where counts[c] >= k, replacing k cards with k-1 new cards of any chosen numbers.

The question is, what's the best way to choose the numbers for the new cards to maximize the number of operations I can perform.

Since the new cards can have any numbers, I can choose to create numbers that are already present in sufficient quantities to allow further operations.

But, perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the minimal number of cards left.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided I have k cards with the same number.

So, the more operations I can perform, the fewer cards I'll have in the end.

The limiting factor is how many operations I can perform, which depends on how many sets of k cards with the same number I can form.

But, since I can choose to create new cards with numbers that allow more operations, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the maximum number of operations I can perform, given that I can create new cards to enable further operations.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10

Since n < k, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

In the third test case, n=7, k=2

I can perform operations repeatedly until I can't anymore.

In the sixth test case, n=6, k=2

I was able to reduce to one card by choosing to create cards that allow further operations.

In the seventh test case, n=6, k=3

No number has at least 3 cards, so no operations can be performed, leaving 6 cards.

In the fourth test case, n=10, k=4

All cards are 1, so I can perform operations repeatedly: 10->7->4->3.

Wait, 10 cards, perform operation: choose 4 cards, replace with 3, total becomes 9, then choose another 4, replace with 3, total becomes 8, and so on, until I can't perform any more operations.

Wait, but in this test case, the output is 3.

Let's see:

Start with 10 cards, all 1.

Perform operation: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards of any numbers.

Now, 9 cards left.

If I choose to replace with 3 cards all numbered 1, then I still have 9 cards, all 1.

I can perform another operation: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards of 1.

Now, 8 cards left.

Continue this process:

10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3.

At each step, I choose to replace 4 cards with 3 cards of the same number, allowing further operations.

Finally, with 3 cards left, I can't perform any more operations because 3 < 4.

So, the answer is 3.

In the third test case, n=7, k=2

I can perform operations repeatedly until only one card is left.

Similarly, in the sixth test case, n=6, k=2

I can perform operations until only one card is left.

So, it seems that when k=2, I can always reduce to one card, regardless of the initial distribution of numbers.

But in the seventh test case, with k=3, I can't perform any operations because no number has at least 3 cards, so I'm left with 6 cards.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=5, k=2

All cards have unique numbers, so no operations can be performed, leaving 5 cards.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, with n=6, k=2, I could reduce to one card, but in the seventh test case, with n=6, k=3, I can't perform any operations.

So, it seems that the key factor is whether I have enough cards with the same number to perform operations.

In particular, if for a given k, I have counts[c] >= k for some c, I can perform an operation on those cards, replacing them with k-1 cards of any numbers.

Moreover, since the new cards can have any numbers, I can choose to create numbers that allow further operations.

In the case where k=2, I can always choose to create a new card with the same number as another existing card, thereby allowing another operation.

Thus, with k=2, I can keep reducing the number of cards by 1 until only one card is left.

But with k>=3, it's not always possible to reduce to one card, as shown in the seventh test case.

So, perhaps for k>=3, the minimal number of cards left depends on the initial distribution of counts.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, with k=4 and all cards being 1, I can perform operations until I have 3 cards left.

Similarly, in the first test case, with n=5, k=3, it's possible to reduce to 2 cards.

So, it seems that the general approach is to perform as many operations as possible, each reducing the total number of cards by 1, until no more operations can be performed.

The number of operations I can perform is equal to the number of times I can choose k cards with the same number.

But since I can create new cards with any numbers, I can potentially create numbers that allow more operations.

However, it's not clear how to model this in a general way.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of cards that cannot form a complete set of k cards.

In other words, the minimal number of cards left is the number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of k cards, considering that after each operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, which can potentially be used in future operations.

This seems similar to the concept of the remainder when dividing by (k-1), but I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, so the minimal number of cards left is n minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

The maximum number of operations I can perform is determined by how many times I can gather k cards with the same number, considering that I can create new cards with any numbers to enable more operations.

Given that I can create new cards with any numbers, I can potentially create numbers that I have enough of to perform more operations.

In the case where k=2, I can always create a new card with the same number as another existing card, allowing me to perform another operation.

Thus, with k=2, I can reduce the number of cards to 1.

Similarly, with k=3, if I have at least 3 cards with the same number, I can perform an operation, replacing them with 2 cards of any numbers.

If I choose to make both new cards have the same number, then I can perform another operation on those two cards plus another card with the same number, and so on.

But it's still not straightforward.

Perhaps I need to consider the counts of each number and see how many operations I can perform based on those counts.

Let me consider the counts of each number.

For each number c, I can perform floor(counts[c]/k) operations on them, each reducing the count by k and adding k-1 new cards.

But since the new cards can have any numbers, I can choose their numbers to maximize the number of future operations.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of cards modulo (k-1).

In the first test case, n=5, k=3

5 modulo 2 is 1, so minimal cards left is 1.

But in the first test case, the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, n=5, k=3

5 - floor(5/(k-1)) = 5 - floor(5/2) = 5 - 2 = 3, but the output is 2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is something.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, but requires k cards with the same number.

With k=2, I can pair up cards and reduce the total by 1 each time, until only one card is left.

With k=3, I need three cards with the same number to perform an operation.

In the seventh test case, with n=6, k=3, and no number having at least 3 cards, no operations can be performed, so minimal cards left is 6.

In the fourth test case, n=10, k=4, all cards are 1, so I can perform operations until I have 3 cards left.

10 - floor(10/4) = 10 - 2 = 8, but that's not matching the output of 3.

Wait, perhaps it's a recursive process.

Each time I perform an operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, so the new total is n - 1.

Then, if the new counts allow another operation, I can perform another operation, reducing the total by another 1, and so on.

So, the minimal number of cards left is the smallest n' such that no number has at least k cards.

This seems similar to repeatedly removing k cards of the same number and adding k-1 new cards until no such group of k cards exists.

But it's still not clear how to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I need to consider the maximal number of operations I can perform, which is the maximal number of times I can choose k cards with the same number, considering that after each operation, I add k-1 new cards that can potentially be used in future operations.

This seems complex.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I have a multiset of counts for each number.

At each step, I choose a count that is >= k, subtract k from it, and add k-1 new counts of 1 (since the new cards can have any numbers, I can consider them as new counts of 1).

This seems similar to the balls and bins problem, but it's still not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of groups needed to partition the cards such that no group contains k cards with the same number.

This is similar to the concept of nearly uniform hypergraphs.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory, where cards are vertices and operations are some kind of edges, but that seems too vague.

Let me look back at the examples.

In the first test case, n=5, k=3

Output is 2.

In the sequence shown, it's possible to reduce to 2 cards.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10

Output is 1.

No operations can be performed.

In the third test case, n=7, k=2

Output is 1.

By pairing cards and creating new ones, it's possible to reduce to one card.

In the fourth test case, n=10, k=4

Output is 3.

By repeatedly selecting 4 cards and replacing them with 3, until no more operations can be performed.

In the fifth test case, n=5, k=2

Output is 5.

All cards have unique numbers, so no operations can be performed.

In the sixth test case, n=6, k=2

Output is 1.

By pairing cards and creating new ones, reduce to one card.

In the seventh test case, n=6, k=3

Output is 6.

No number has at least 3 cards, so no operations can be performed.

From these examples, it seems that when k=2, I can always reduce to one card, and when k>=3, it depends on the distribution of counts.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, k=3, and I can't perform any operations, leaving 6 cards.

In the fourth test case, k=4, and I can perform operations until I have 3 cards left.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is n modulo (k-1).

In the first test case, 5 modulo 2 is 1, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, 5 modulo 2 is 1, but output is 2.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(n / (k-1)).

Wait, 5 / 2 is 2.5, ceil to 3, but output is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n / (k-1)).

5 - floor(5/2) = 5 - 2 = 3, but output is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n - ceil((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is something.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider the process differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided I have at least k cards with the same number.

So, the maximal number of operations I can perform is equal to the total number of times I can select k cards with the same number, considering that after each operation, I add k-1 new cards that can be of any number.

This seems like a process where I can keep reducing the number of cards by 1 as long as there exists at least one number with at least k cards.

But, since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can potentially create numbers that allow more operations.

For example, with k=2, I can always choose to make the new card the same as one of the existing cards, allowing another operation.

Thus, with k=2, I can reduce the number of cards to 1.

With k>=3, if I have enough cards with the same number, I can perform operations until I don't have any group of k cards with the same number.

But it's not clear how to compute this in general.

Perhaps I need to look for an invariant or some mathematical property that remains constant during the operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cards that are not part of any group of k cards.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the counts of each number.

Suppose I have counts[c1], counts[c2], ..., counts[cm], where m is the number of unique numbers.

Each operation chooses a count >= k and reduces it by k, then adds k-1 to some other counts.

Since the new cards can have any numbers, I can choose to add k-1 to any counts, including creating new unique numbers or increasing existing counts.

This flexibility seems key.

In particular, with k=2, I can always choose to add both new cards to the same count, effectively allowing me to merge two counts into one, reducing the total number of counts by 1 each time.

Thus, with k=2, I can reduce the number of unique counts by 1 per operation, leading to a final state with only one card.

But with k>=3, it's more complicated because I need to have at least k cards with the same number to perform an operation.

Moreover, when I perform an operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, which can be distributed among existing or new numbers.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is the minimal number of cards such that no number has at least k cards.

This is similar to the concept of the minimal number of cards where the maximum count is less than k.

So, I need to find the smallest n' where the maximum count of any number is less than k.

Given that, I need to distribute the cards such that no number has k or more cards.

The minimal n' would be the smallest number where this is possible.

Alternatively, it's the total number of cards minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided I have at least one number with at least k cards.

So, the process ends when no number has at least k cards.

Thus, the minimal number of cards left is the smallest n' such that no count >= k.

This seems similar to repeatedly removing k cards from a count >= k and adding k-1 cards to some counts until no count >= k.

But this is still not giving me a clear formula.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of cards left as n modulo (k-1).

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=10, k=4

10 modulo 3 is 1, but the output is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1, but the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(n / (k-1)).

10 / 3 is approximately 3.333, ceil to 4, but the output is 3.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(n / (k-1)).

10 / 3 is approximately 3.333, floor to 3, which matches the output.

In the first test case, n=5, k=3

5 / 2 is 2.5, floor to 2, which matches the output.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=1, k=10

1 / 9 is 0.111, floor to 0, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n / (k-1)).

In the first test case, 5 - floor(5/2) = 5 - 2 = 3, but the output is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(n / (k-1)) if n % (k-1) == 0 else floor(n / (k-1)) + 1.

In the first test case, 5 / 2 = 2.5, floor is 2, but 5 % 2 ==1, so 2 +1 =3, but output is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But I need a general formula.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory, where cards are vertices and operations are some kind of hyperedges, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, and I can perform operations as long as there is at least one number with at least k cards.

Thus, the minimal number of cards left is the number of cards that cannot form another group of k cards.

This is similar to the concept of the minimal number of cards that are left over after forming as many groups of k as possible.

But again, it's not clear how to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a greedy process.

At each step, if there is any number with at least k cards, perform an operation on that number, replacing k cards with k-1 new cards of any numbers.

Choose the numbers for the new cards in a way that allows the maximum number of future operations.

But since the new cards can have any numbers, I can choose to create numbers that I have enough of to perform more operations.

In the case where k=2, I can always choose to create a new card with the same number as another existing card, allowing me to perform another operation.

Thus, with k=2, I can reduce the number of cards to 1.

With k>=3, it's more complicated because I need at least k cards with the same number to perform an operation.

In the seventh test case, with k=3 and no number having at least 3 cards, no operations can be performed, so the minimal number of cards left is n=6.

In the fourth test case, with k=4 and all cards being 1, I can perform operations until I have 3 cards left.

Starting with 10 cards:

Operation 1: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards of any numbers. Now, 9 cards.

Operation 2: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 8 cards.

Operation 3: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 7 cards.

Operation 4: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 6 cards.

Operation 5: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 5 cards.

Operation 6: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 4 cards.

Operation 7: choose 4 cards, replace with 3 cards. Now, 3 cards.

Now, no number has at least 4 cards, so operations stop.

Thus, minimal cards left is 3.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=5, k=3

Operation 1: choose 3 cards of 4's, replace with 2 cards of any numbers. Now, 4 cards.

Operation 2: choose 2 cards (one of the new ones and another card), but wait, k=3, so I need 3 cards with the same number.

Wait, in the first operation, I replace three 4's with two new cards, say two 1's.

Now, cards are: 1,1,1,4

Now, I have three 1's and one 4.

Operation 2: choose three 1's, replace with two new cards, say two 4's.

Now, cards are: 4,4,4

Operation 3: choose three 4's, replace with two new cards, say two of any number.

Now, cards are: two cards.

So, minimal cards left is 2.

But according to the example, it's possible to reduce to 2 cards.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is n - floor(n / (k-1))

In the first test case, 5 - floor(5 / 2) = 5 - 2 = 3, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(n / (k-1))

5 / 2 = 2.5, floor to 2, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, 10 / 3 = 3.333, floor to 3, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10

1 / 9 = 0.111, floor to 0, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But I need a general formula.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that with k=2, I can always reduce to 1 card, and with k>=3, it depends on the distribution.

But in the fifth test case, with k=2 and all cards unique, the output is 5, meaning no operations can be performed, which contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, in the fifth test case, n=5, k=2

Cards: 3,8,1,48,7

All unique, so no operations can be performed, hence minimal cards left is 5.

But in the sixth test case, n=6, k=2

Cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

Here, there are pairs of 10's and 20's, so operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards.

Thus, with k=2, if there are pairs, I can perform operations, but if all cards are unique, I can't perform any operations.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=7, k=2

Cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3

There are two 2's, so I can perform one operation to replace them with one card, reducing to 6 cards.

Then, if I choose to create a new card with a number that already exists or not, I can potentially perform more operations.

In this way, I can reduce to one card.

But in the fifth test case, with n=5, k=2 and all cards unique, no operations can be performed, so minimal cards left is 5.

So, perhaps with k=2, if there are any pairs, I can perform operations to reduce the number of cards, but if all cards are unique, no operations can be performed.

But in the sixth test case, with n=6, k=2, and pairs present, I can reduce to one card.

But according to the output, it's 1.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, with n=5, k=2, and all cards unique, minimal cards left is 5.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is the number of cards that cannot form pairs when k=2.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, with k=2 and pairs present, I can reduce to one card.

But in the fifth test case, with k=2 and no pairs, minimal cards left is 5.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is the number of unique numbers when k=2 and there are no pairs.

But in the third test case, with k=2 and some pairs, I can reduce to one card.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I need to consider that with k=2, the minimal number of cards left is the number of unique numbers after pairing and replacing.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found a pattern in the test cases where, for k=2, if there are pairs, I can reduce to one card, else, minimal cards left is the number of unique numbers.

But in the fifth test case, with k=2 and all unique numbers, minimal cards left is 5.

In the sixth test case, with k=2 and pairs present, minimal cards left is 1.

In the third test case, with k=2 and some pairs, minimal cards left is 1.

So, perhaps with k=2, I can always reduce to one card if there is at least one pair.

But in the fifth test case, there are no pairs, so minimal cards left is 5.

But in the sixth test case, with pairs present, I can reduce to one card.

So, perhaps with k=2, if there is at least one pair, I can reduce to one card, else, minimal cards left is the number of unique numbers.

But in the third test case, there are pairs, so I can reduce to one card.

In the sixth test case, there are pairs, so I can reduce to one card.

In the fifth test case, no pairs, so minimal cards left is 5.

So, perhaps with k=2, if there is at least one pair, I can reduce to one card, else, minimal cards left is the number of unique numbers.

But in the fifth test case, n=5, k=2, and all cards unique, so minimal cards left is 5.

But according to this rule, it should be the number of unique numbers, which is 5, matching the output.

In the sixth test case, n=6, k=2, with pairs, minimal cards left is 1.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=7, k=2, with pairs, minimal cards left is 1.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If k=2 and there is at least one pair, minimal cards left is 1.

- Else, minimal cards left is the number of unique numbers.

But in the seventh test case, with k=3, n=6, and no number has at least 3 cards, minimal cards left is 6.

Which matches the above rule, as k=3 is not 2.

But in the fourth test case, with k=4, n=10, all cards same, minimal cards left is 3.

Which matches the floor(n / (k-1)) = floor(10 / 3) = 3.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=5, k=3, floor(5 / 2) = 2, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10, floor(1 / 9) = 0, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10, m=1

1 - floor((1 -1)/9) = 1 - floor(0/9) = 1 - 0 =1, which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=10, k=4, m=1

10 - floor((10 -1)/3) = 10 - floor(9/3) = 10 - 3 =7, which doesn't match the output of 3.

So, that's not it.

I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided I have at least k cards with the same number.

So, the minimal number of cards left is n minus the maximal number of operations I can perform.

The maximal number of operations is the maximal number of times I can choose k cards with the same number, considering that after each operation, I add k-1 new cards that can have any numbers.

Given that, perhaps the maximal number of operations is floor(total cards / (k-1)).

Wait, in the first test case, floor(5 / 2) = 2, which matches the output of 2.

In the fourth test case, floor(10 / 3) = 3, which matches the output of 3.

In the second test case, floor(1 / 9) = 0, so minimal cards left is 1 - 0 =1, which matches.

In the fifth test case, floor(5 /1) =5, but k=2, so floor(5 /1)=5, but output is 5, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, k=2, so k-1=1, floor(5 /1)=5, so minimal cards left is 5 -5=0, but output is 5.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m + floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

In the fifth test case, m=5, n=5, k=2

5 + floor((5-5)/1)=5 +0=5, which matches.

In the fourth test case, m=1, n=10, k=4

1 + floor((10-1)/3)=1 + floor(9/3)=1+3=4, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor(n / (k-1))

In the first test case, 5 - floor(5/2)=5-2=3, but output is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(n / (k-1))

In the first test case, floor(5/2)=2, which matches output 2.

In the fourth test case, floor(10/3)=3, which matches output 3.

In the second test case, floor(1/9)=0, so minimal cards left is 1 -0=1, which matches.

In the fifth test case, floor(5/1)=5, so minimal cards left is 5 -5=0, but output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(n / (k-1))

In the first test case, ceil(5/2)=3, which doesn't match output 2.

No.

I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the operations.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided I have at least k cards with the same number.

So, the process ends when no number has at least k cards.

Thus, the minimal number of cards left is the smallest n' such that no number has at least k cards.

This is similar to distributing the cards such that no number has k or more cards.

So, if I have m unique numbers, and I want to distribute n cards such that no number has k or more cards, then the minimal n' is m * (k-1) + r, where r is the remainder.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is n - floor((n - m)/(k-1))

In the fifth test case, n=5, m=5, k=2

5 - floor((5-5)/1)=5 -0=5, which matches.

In the first test case, n=5, m=3 (numbers 1,4, with counts 2,2,1), floor((5-3)/2)=floor(2/2)=1, so 5 -1=4, but output is 2.

Doesn't match.

In the fourth test case, n=10, m=1, k=4

10 - floor((10-1)/3)=10 -3=7, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

This is not working.

I need to find another way.

Perhaps I should consider that with k=2, I can pair up cards and reduce the total by 1 each time, until only one card is left, provided there are pairs.

If all cards are unique, I can't perform any operations, so minimal cards left is n.

Similarly, with k=3, I need at least three cards with the same number to perform an operation.

In such a case, perhaps the minimal number of cards left is n minus the maximal number of operations I can perform, where each operation requires k cards with the same number.

Given that, and that I can choose the numbers of the new cards to potentially enable more operations, it's tricky to find a general formula.

Perhaps I need to consider that for k>=2, the minimal number of cards left is the minimal n' such that n' < k.

But in the fourth test case, with k=4, n=10, minimal cards left is 3, which is less than 4.

Similarly, in the
