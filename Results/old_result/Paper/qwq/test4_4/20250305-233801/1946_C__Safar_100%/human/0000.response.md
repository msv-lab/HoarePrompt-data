Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly.

So, the problem is: Given a tree with n vertices, I need to find the maximum number x such that I can remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that every remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That matches with the input, where there are n-1 edges provided.

Now, the task is to remove exactly k edges, not less, not more, and after removal, all resulting connected components should have at least x vertices. And I need to maximize x.

I need to think about how removing edges affects the connected components. Each time I remove an edge, I split the tree into two smaller trees. So, if I remove one edge, I get two connected components. If I remove a second edge, I might split one of those components further, and so on.

The key here is that each component after removing k edges should have at least x vertices. I need to choose which k edges to remove to maximize x.

I recall that in a tree, removing an edge always increases the number of connected components by exactly one. So, starting from one component (the whole tree), removing k edges will result in k+1 connected components.

Let me denote the sizes of these components as s1, s2, ..., sk+1. I need each si >= x, and I need to maximize x.

So, x is the minimum size among all the components. To maximize x, I need to maximize the minimum component size.

This sounds like a minimax problem, which often can be solved using binary search.

Wait, but I need to maximize x, and x is the minimum component size. So, I can try to binary search on x, and check for each x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

That seems promising. So, I'll set up a binary search where the lower bound is 1 and the upper bound is the maximum possible x, which would be the smallest component size when I remove k edges.

But what's the maximum possible x? Well, if I remove k edges, I get k+1 components. The total number of vertices is n, so the average size would be n/(k+1). But since x needs to be an integer, I should take the floor of n/(k+1).

Wait, but I need to maximize x, so I should set the upper bound to n/(k+1), rounded down. But actually, I need to check feasibility for each x, and the maximum x for which it's possible.

Wait, in the code provided, it sets l = 1 and r = n // k. Wait, n // k is different from n // (k + 1). Let me think about this.

If I remove k edges, I get k+1 components. So, if I want all components to have at least x vertices, then (k+1)*x <= n. So, x <= n/(k+1). So, n // (k + 1) would be the upper limit.

But in the code, it's r = n // k. That seems incorrect. Maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, in the example given:

n = 5, k = 1

n // k = 5 // 1 = 5

But in the explanation, the answer is 2, because with x=2, you can remove one edge and have components of size 2 and 3.

But x=3 is not possible because if you remove one edge, you can't have both components of size at least 3.

So, n//k = 5//1 =5, but the maximum x is 2, which is less than 5. So, setting r = n//k seems too high.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it should be n // (k + 1). Because with k edges removed, there are k+1 components.

So, in the example, n=5, k=1, k+1=2, n//(k+1)=5//2=2, which matches the answer.

Another example:

n=2, k=1

n//(k+1)=2//2=1, which matches the second output in the sample.

n=6, k=1

n//(k+1)=6//2=3, which matches the third output.

n=3, k=1

n//(k+1)=3//2=1, which matches the fourth output.

n=8, k=2

n//(k+1)=8//3=2, which matches the fifth output.

n=6, k=2

n//(k+1)=6//3=2, which matches the sixth output.

So, it seems that setting r = n//(k+1) is correct.

But in the code, it's r = n//k. That seems incorrect based on my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the code, it's r = n//k.

But in the example, n=5, k=1, n//k=5//1=5, but in reality, the maximum x is 2, which is n//(k+1)=5//2=2.

So, the code seems to have a mistake here.

Wait, but the code is given to me, and I need to determine if it's correct or not.

If the code has r = n//k, but it should be r = n//(k+1), then the code is incorrect.

But let me check the function check(A):

It seems to be performing some kind of DFS traversal, keeping track of component sizes.

It's using a stack for DFS, and maintaining a dictionary d to store the size of each component.

It's traversing the tree, and when it backtracks, it checks if the component size d[x] >= A. If yes, it increments r (which seems to count the number of components with size at least A). If not, it adds d[x] to d[p], meaning it merges the component back to the parent.

Finally, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k). I'm not entirely sure about this condition.

Wait, the goal is to remove exactly k edges, and have all components have at least x vertices.

In the check function, r seems to count the number of components with size at least A.

But in a tree, removing k edges results in k+1 components.

So, if after the traversal, r is the number of components with size at least A, and d[1] is the size of the remaining component.

Wait, actually, in the code, d[1] would be the size of the component that includes node 1, after accounting for the components that have size at least A.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think differently.

In the binary search approach, for a given x, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

One way to approach this is to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices. Then, check if this minimum number equals k.

If the minimum number of edges to be removed is less than or equal to k, and the number of components formed is at least k+1, then it might be possible.

But I need to remove exactly k edges.

This seems a bit tricky.

Alternatively, since removing k edges results in k+1 components, and I need each component to have at least x vertices, the total number of vertices in these components should be at least (k+1)*x.

But since all vertices are accounted for, we have n >= (k+1)*x.

So, x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

Therefore, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

But in the code, r is set to n//k, which is different from n//(k+1).

So, this seems incorrect.

In the first sample input:

n=5, k=1

n//k = 5//1 =5

But the maximum x is 2, which is n//(k+1)=5//2=2.

So, the code would set r=5, which is higher than the actual possible x.

Then, in the binary search, it would try x=5, but it's not possible to remove one edge and have both components with at least 5 vertices, because one component would have only 2 vertices.

So, check(5) would return False, and it would try lower values.

Then it would try x=3, which is still not possible with k=1 for n=5.

Then x=2, which is possible, so it would set r=2.

But in the end, it prints r, which is 2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, so even though r is initially set to n//k=5//1=5, which is higher than n//(k+1)=2, the binary search would still find the correct x.

Because check(3) would be False, and check(2) would be True, so it would set r=2.

So, perhaps it's still correct, despite r being set to n//k instead of n//(k+1).

Let me verify with another sample input.

n=2, k=1

n//k=2//1=2

n//(k+1)=2//2=1

In the sample output, it's 1.

So, if r=2, but the correct x is 1.

Wait, in this case, check(2) would be False, because removing one edge results in components of size 1 and 1, but x=2 is not achievable.

So, the binary search would set l=1, r=1, and print 1, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

n=6, k=1

n//k=6//1=6

n//(k+1)=6//2=3

Sample output is 3.

So, if r=6, but the correct x is 3.

check(3) should be True, because removing one edge can result in components of size 3 and 3, assuming the tree is balanced.

So, the binary search would find x=3.

Similarly, for n=3, k=1:

n//k=3//1=3

n//(k+1)=3//2=1

Sample output is 1.

check(1) would be True, because removing one edge results in components of size 1 and 2, both >=1.

But wait, the problem says "each remaining connected component is at least x".

So, if x=1, both components have at least 1 vertex, which is true.

So, check(1) should return True.

And check(2) would be False, because one component has only 1 vertex.

So, the binary search would set r=1, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

n=8, k=2

n//k=8//2=4

n//(k+1)=8//3=2

Sample output is 1.

Wait, according to my earlier reasoning, x should be floor(n/(k+1))=8//3=2.

But the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine this.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=8, k=2, the output is 1.

But according to n//(k+1)=8//3=2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

6

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

2 1

1 2

6 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5 6

3 1

1 2

1 3

8 2

1 2

1 3

2 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

6 2

1 2

2 3

1 4

4 5

5 6

And the output is:

2

1

3

1

1

2

Wait, for n=8, k=2, the output is 1.

But according to n//(k+1)=8//3=2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in the note, it says:

The tree in the first set of input data:

(figure)

After removing the edge 1â€”3, the tree will look as follows:

(figure)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists of two vertices: 1 and 2. The second connected component consists of three vertices: 3,4 and 5. In both connected components, there are at least two vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer is 2.

Wait, in this case, n=5, k=1, and the answer is 2.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1, the answer is 1.

For n=6, k=1, the answer is 3.

For n=3, k=1, the answer is 1.

For n=8, k=2, the answer is 1.

For n=6, k=2, the answer is 2.

So, in the case of n=8, k=2, the answer is 1, but n//(k+1)=8//3=2.

But the sample output is 1, which is less than 2.

So, perhaps my initial assumption that x <= n//(k+1) is not always tight.

There might be cases where even if n//(k+1)=2, the maximum x is 1.

Perhaps the tree structure affects the possible x.

Wait, in the case of n=8, k=2, with x=2, is it possible to remove 2 edges such that all components have at least 2 vertices?

Looking at the tree:

1-2

1-3

2-4

2-5

3-6

3-7

3-8

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}.

But {1} has only one vertex, which is less than x=2.

So, x=2 is not achievable with this tree and k=2.

Hence, the maximum x is 1.

So, in this case, n//(k+1)=8//3=2, but x=2 is not achievable, so x=1 is the answer.

Therefore, simply setting r=n//(k+1) might not be sufficient, because the tree structure can limit the possible x.

Hence, the binary search approach is necessary to find the maximum x that works, given the tree structure.

So, in the code, even though r is set to n//k, which is higher than n//(k+1), it still works because the binary search will find the highest x for which check(x) is True.

In the case where n//k is higher than the achievable x, the check function will return False for those higher values, and the binary search will converge to the correct x.

Therefore, despite r being set to n//k, which seems suboptimal, it still leads to the correct answer.

Perhaps the author chose n//k as an upper bound because it's a higher bound that's still achievable in some trees, and the binary search will adjust it accordingly.

But ideally, setting r = n//(k+1) would be a tighter upper bound, but it's not necessary for correctness.

Hence, the code is still correct, even if not optimally bounded.

So, the answer is Correctness: True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
