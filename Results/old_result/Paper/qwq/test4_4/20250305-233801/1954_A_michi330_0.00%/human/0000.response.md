Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. Let's see what it's asking.

So, Alice and Bob have this ribbon divided into n parts, and they want to paint it. Alice goes first, painting each part with one of m colors. Then, Bob can choose to repaint up to k parts all with the same color. Bob wants everything to be the same color, but Alice doesn't want that to be possible after her initial painting. So, I need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no matter which k parts Bob chooses to repaint, he can't make all parts the same color.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- t is the number of test cases, and it's up to 1000, which is fine for computation.

- For each test case, I have n, m, and k, where n is the number of parts, m is the number of colors Alice can choose from, and k is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint.

Looking at the example:

- When n=1, no matter what Alice does, Bob can repaint it to make it uniform, so the answer is NO.

- When n=5, m=1, k=1: Since there's only one color, Alice has to paint all parts with that color, so Bob doesn't need to do anything, and it's already uniform. Hence, NO.

- When n=5, m=2, k=1: Alice can paint it in a pattern like [1,2,1,2,1]. If Bob repaints one part, he can't make all five parts the same color, so YES.

- When n=5, m=2, k=2: No matter how Alice paints, Bob can always choose two parts to repaint to make all parts the same. For example, if Alice paints [1,2,1,2,1], Bob can repaint the two 2's to 1, making all parts 1. So, NO.

- When n=5, m=5, k=3: Alice can paint each part with a different color [1,2,3,4,5]. Even if Bob repaints three parts to the same color, there will still be two parts with different colors, so it's impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color. Hence, YES.

From these examples, I need to find a general rule for any n, m, k.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, if n <= k, that means Bob can repaint up to n parts, which is all parts. So, he can make all parts the same color regardless of how Alice paints it. Hence, in this case, it's impossible for Alice to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. So, the answer is NO.

Now, what if n > k?

Alice wants to paint the ribbon so that even if Bob repaints up to k parts, he can't make all parts the same color. That means, after Alice's painting, there should be no single color that, by changing up to k parts to it, makes all parts that color.

In other words, for Alice to succeed, there must be no color c such that the number of parts not already painted c is <= k.

Because if the number of parts not painted c is less than or equal to k, Bob can repaint those parts to c, making all parts c.

So, Alice needs to ensure that for every color c, the number of parts not painted c is greater than k.

Alternatively, for every color c, the number of parts painted c is n - (number of parts not painted c) < n - k.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Let me denote for each color c, let's say Alice paints f(c) parts with color c.

Then, for Bob to not be able to make all parts the same color, for every color c, the number of parts that are not c, i.e., n - f(c), should be greater than k.

Because if n - f(c) > k, Bob can't repaint enough parts to make all parts c.

So, for Alice to win, for every color c, n - f(c) > k, which implies f(c) < n - k for all c.

But wait, if f(c) < n - k for all c, then the total number of parts painted is sum over c of f(c) < m*(n - k).

But since every part is painted with some color, sum over c of f(c) = n.

So, n < m*(n - k)

Wait, that doesn't directly help.

Let me think differently.

If Alice wants to ensure that for every color c, the number of parts not painted c is greater than k, then for each c, n - f(c) > k, which means f(c) < n - k.

So, the maximum f(c) over all c should be less than n - k.

In other words, the largest group of parts painted with the same color should be less than n - k.

Because if the largest group is less than n - k, then even if Bob repaints up to k parts to that color, he can't reach n parts (since (n - k) + k = n, but since f(c) < n - k, (f(c) + k) < n).

Wait, but if f(c) + k < n, then not all parts can be c even after repainting.

So, to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, Alice needs to ensure that no single color is used on n - k or more parts.

But, is that sufficient?

Wait, suppose Alice paints the ribbon such that no color is used on more than n - k - 1 parts.

Then, for any color c, the number of parts not painted c is n - f(c) >= k + 1.

So, even if Bob repaints k parts to c, the total number of parts painted c would be f(c) + k <= (n - k - 1) + k = n - 1.

So, not all parts are c.

Hence, Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color by ensuring that no color is used on n - k or more parts.

Now, can Alice always do this given m colors?

Well, she needs to distribute the n parts among m colors such that no color is used more than n - k - 1 times.

So, the maximum frequency of any color should be <= n - k - 1.

Is this possible?

Well, if m * (n - k - 1) >= n, then yes, she can distribute the parts among the colors without any color exceeding n - k - 1.

Because if m * (n - k - 1) >= n, then there exists a distribution where no color is used more than n - k - 1 times.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, the condition is:

if m * (n - k - 1) >= n, then Alice can paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

Else, she cannot.

Wait, but in the example where n=5, m=2, k=1:

2 * (5 - 1 - 1) = 2 * 3 = 6 >= 5, so YES, which matches the sample output.

In n=5, m=2, k=2:

2 * (5 - 2 - 1) = 2 * 2 = 4 < 5, so NO, which matches the sample.

In n=5, m=5, k=3:

5 * (5 - 3 - 1) = 5 * 1 = 5 >=5, so YES, matches the sample.

In n=1, m=1, k=1:

1 * (1 - 1 -1) = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 1, so NO, matches the sample.

In n=5, m=1, k=1:

1 * (5 -1 -1) =1*3=3 <5, so NO, matches the sample.

Seems correct.

So, the condition is:

if m * (n - k -1) >= n, then YES, else NO.

Wait, but in the program, it's checking if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then print 'NO', else 'YES'.

Wait, I need to see if this matches my condition.

First, if n <=k, then NO, which matches my earlier conclusion.

Else, it checks if n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

Wait, math.ceil(n/m) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/m.

So, math.ceil(n/m) is the minimal number of parts that must be painted with the same color if Alice uses m colors.

Because if she distributes n parts among m colors as evenly as possible, the maximum number of parts in any color is math.ceil(n/m).

So, if Alice paints the ribbon as evenly as possible, the largest group of any single color is math.ceil(n/m).

Then, to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, as we saw earlier, Alice needs to ensure that no color is used on n - k or more parts.

In other words, math.ceil(n/m) < n - k.

Wait, but in the program, it's checking if n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

Wait, that seems different.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in my interpretation.

Let me look again.

The program does:

if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking two conditions:

1. n <=k

2. n - math.ceil(n/m) <k

If either is true, print 'NO', else 'YES'.

From my earlier reasoning, condition 1 is correct: if n <=k, then NO.

For condition 2, it's checking if n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

Wait, math.ceil(n/m) is the minimal number of parts that must be painted with the same color, no matter how Alice distributes the colors.

So, if Alice paints as evenly as possible, the largest color group is math.ceil(n/m).

Then, for Bob to not be able to make all parts the same color, we need math.ceil(n/m) < n - k.

Because if math.ceil(n/m) < n - k, then even if Bob repaints up to k parts to that color, he can't make all parts that color, since math.ceil(n/m) + k < n - k + k = n.

Wait, but actually, math.ceil(n/m) + k < n.

Wait, no: math.ceil(n/m) + k < n -k +k = n.

Wait, no: math.ceil(n/m) + k < n -k +k = n, which is not necessarily true.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

From earlier, Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color if no color is used on n - k or more parts.

In other words, the maximum frequency of any color should be less than n - k.

So, math.ceil(n/m) < n - k.

So, if math.ceil(n/m) < n - k, then YES.

Else, NO.

But the program is checking if n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then NO.

Wait, let's see:

n - math.ceil(n/m) <k

is equivalent to n -k < math.ceil(n/m)

Which is opposite to math.ceil(n/m) < n -k.

So, if n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then math.ceil(n/m) > n -k, which means Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, hence NO.

Otherwise, math.ceil(n/m) <= n -k, which is not sufficient for Alice's requirement, which needs math.ceil(n/m) < n -k.

Wait, but in programming, sometimes conditions are handled differently.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, let's see:

If math.ceil(n/m) >= n -k +1, then Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

Because even with the most even distribution, the largest group is n -k +1, and Bob can repaint k parts to make it n -k +1 +k = n +1, which is more than n, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

I think my earlier condition is correct: if m * (n -k -1) >=n, then YES.

Else, NO.

Because if m * (n -k -1) >=n, then Alice can assign colors such that no color is used more than n -k -1 times.

Which ensures that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting up to k parts.

Else, it's impossible.

So, in the program, it seems to be checking something different.

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between m * (n -k -1) >=n and math.ceil(n/m) < n -k.

Let me see.

math.ceil(n/m) is the minimal maximum frequency of any color.

So, if math.ceil(n/m) < n -k, then YES.

Else, NO.

But m * (n -k -1) >=n is another way to express the same condition.

Wait, perhaps they are equivalent.

Let me see.

math.ceil(n/m) < n -k

is equivalent to n/m < n -k

since math.ceil(x) is the smallest integer >= x.

So, math.ceil(n/m) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/m.

So, math.ceil(n/m) < n -k implies that n/m < n -k.

But n/m < n -k is equivalent to n < m(n -k), assuming n -k >0.

Which is equivalent to n < m(n -k).

Dividing both sides by n -k (assuming n -k >0), we get n/(n -k) < m.

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider m * (n -k -1) >=n.

This is equivalent to m*(n -k -1) >=n.

Which is m >= ceil(n / (n -k -1)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider an example.

Take n=5, m=2, k=1.

Then, m*(n -k -1) =2*(5 -1 -1)=2*3=6 >=5, so YES.

As per the sample.

Another example: n=5, m=2, k=2.

Then, m*(n -k -1)=2*(5 -2 -1)=2*2=4 <5, so NO.

Again matches the sample.

Another example: n=5, m=5, k=3.

m*(n -k -1)=5*(5 -3 -1)=5*1=5 >=5, so YES.

Again matches the sample.

So, seems correct.

Now, in the program, it's checking if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then NO, else YES.

Wait, in n=5, m=2, k=1:

math.ceil(5/2)=3.

n - math.ceil(n/m)=5 -3=2.

Is 2 <1? No, so YES.

Which matches the sample.

In n=5, m=2, k=2:

5 -3=2 <2? No, so YES, but sample is NO.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

So, 5 -3=2 <2? No, so 'YES'.

But sample output is 'NO'.

So, there's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in my earlier note.

Let me check the program again.

The program does:

if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

But in the second test case:

n=5, m=1, k=1.

math.ceil(5/1)=5.

n - math.ceil(n/m)=5 -5=0 <1? Yes, so 'NO', matches the sample.

Third test case:

n=5, m=2, k=1.

5 -3=2 <1? No, so 'YES', matches the sample.

Fourth test case:

n=5, m=2, k=2.

5 -3=2 <2? No, so 'YES', but sample is 'NO'.

Wait, discrepancy.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample, for n=5, m=2, k=2, the answer should be 'NO', but the program outputs 'YES'.

Wait, perhaps the program has a bug.

Wait, perhaps it should be n - math.ceil(n/m) <=k.

Wait, let's see.

In n=5, m=2, k=2.

5 -3=2 <=2, which is true, so 'NO', matching the sample.

Wait, but in the program, it's <k, not <=k.

Wait, perhaps that's the mistake.

Wait, in the explanation, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

But in the sample, for n=5, m=2, k=2.

5 -3=2 <2? No, so 'YES', but sample is 'NO'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, perhaps it should be n - math.ceil(n/m) <=k.

Then, for n=5, m=2, k=2.

5 -3=2 <=2, which is true, so 'NO', matches the sample.

Another test: n=5, m=2, k=1.

5 -3=2 <1? No, so 'YES', matches the sample.

n=5, m=1, k=1.

5 -5=0 <1? No, wait, 0 <1 is True, so 'NO', matches the sample.

n=1, m=1, k=1.

1 -1=0 <1? Yes, so 'NO', matches the sample.

n=5, m=5, k=3.

5 -1=4 <3? No, so 'YES', matches the sample.

So, seems that the condition should be n - math.ceil(n/m) <=k, then 'NO', else 'YES'.

But in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

Which is incorrect, as per the above analysis.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
