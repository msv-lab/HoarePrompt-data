Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid of squares, and each square is either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations on the grid where I select two squares of the same color, and then all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners get set to that color.

The question is, can I make the entire grid have the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B', by performing any number of these operations?

First, I need to understand what these operations can achieve. When I select two squares of the same color and set the entire rectangle between them to that color, it's like filling in a area with a consistent color.

I should think about what kind of configurations can be transformed into a uniform grid.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

2 1

W

B

So, a 2x1 grid, first row 'W', second row 'B'. According to the sample output, it's 'NO'. That makes sense because there's no way to change the color of a single square without having another square of the same color to operate with. Since both squares are different, I can't perform any operation.

Example 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Sample output is 'YES', and it's possible to make all squares white in two operations, as described.

Example 3:

1 1

W

Already uniform, so 'YES'.

Example 4:

2 2

BB

BB

Already uniform, 'YES'.

Example 5:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Again, uniform after operations, 'YES'.

Example 6:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

This is 'NO' in the sample output. Why is that? Oh, because the grid is split into two parts: the first two rows are 'BB', and the last two are 'WW'. There's no way to make them the same because there are no matching colors across the split.

Example 7:

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

This is 'YES'. Presumably, some operations can make it all 'W' or all 'B'.

Example 8:

1 5

WBBWB

This is 'NO'. Why? Probably because it's not possible to make all 'W' or all 'B' due to the arrangement.

From these examples, I need to find a general rule to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Let me think about connected components where squares of the same color are connected through operations.

Wait, but the operation allows me to set a whole rectangle to a single color if I can find two squares of that color.

So, perhaps if there exists a path of squares of the same color that can connect different regions, I can make them uniform.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if I have at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, I need to see if I can make them all 'W' or all 'B'.

If the grid is already uniform, then 'YES'.

If not, I need to see if I can propagate one color to the entire grid.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of connectivity based on rows and columns.

Suppose I look at the first row and the last row. If they are consistent in some way, maybe I can perform operations to make the entire grid uniform.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = []

first_row = ''

last_row = ''

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')



Wait, this code seems to be checking some conditions on the first row, last row, and some strings built from the first and last elements of each row.

Let me try to understand this code.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and m, then reads n lines of length m consisting of 'W' and 'B'.

Then, it builds two strings:

first_row: concatenation of the first character of each row.

last_row: concatenation of the last character of each row.

Then, it checks:

1. If the first row has only one unique character, and the first row is different from the last row, print 'NO'.

2. Else, if the first_row string has only one unique character and is different from the last_row string, print 'NO'.

Otherwise, print 'YES'.

Is this correct?

Let me test this logic with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

2 1

W

B

first_row: W

last_row: B

a[0] is 'W', which has only one unique character, and a[0] != a[-1], so print 'NO'. Correct.

Sample Input 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

first_row: W WWWBW (first characters of each row)

last_row: W WWWBB

a[0] is 'WWWWBW', which has both 'W' and 'B', so len(set(a[0])) !=1. So, skip first condition.

Then, first_row has 'W' repeated, so len(set(first_row)) ==1.

last_row has 'W' and 'B', so first_row != last_row, but since first_row has only 'W', and last_row has 'W' and 'B', they are different.

So, print 'NO'. Wait, but the sample output is 'YES'. So, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in building first_row and last_row.

Looking back at the code:

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

Wait, a[-1] is the last row. So, first_row is built by concatenating the first character of the last row multiple times, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, it's a typo.

In the loop:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

So, a[-1] is the last row, but it should be building first_row and last_row based on each row's first and last characters.

Wait, but in the loop, a[-1] is the last row, so first_row and last_row are being built by appending the first and last characters of only the last row, repeated n times.

That seems wrong.

Wait, no, in the loop, a[-1] is the last row, so first_row += a[-1][0] means appending the first character of the last row, n times.

Similarly, last_row += a[-1][-1], appending the last character of the last row, n times.

This seems incorrect.

Probably, it should be building first_row by taking the first character of each row, and last_row by taking the last character of each row.

But in the code, it's taking only the first and last characters of the last row and repeating them.

This seems like a mistake.

Let me try to fix this.

It should be:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

for row in a:

first_row += row[0]

last_row += row[-1]

Then, first_row would be the concatenation of the first character of each row, and last_row would be the concatenation of the last character of each row.

Okay, assuming that's the case, let's see.

In the second sample input:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

first_row: W W B B W B

last_row: B W W B B W

So, first_row has 'W W B B W B', which has both 'W' and 'B'.

last_row has 'B W W B B W', also having both 'W' and 'B'.

So, len(set(first_row)) !=1, so skip the first condition.

Then, since len(set(first_row)) !=1, it doesn't check the second condition, and prints 'YES'. But according to the sample output, it's 'YES', so correct in this case, but only by coincidence.

Wait, but in the code, first_row and last_row are built incorrectly, but even with the correction, in this case, it happens to work.

But in general, this logic seems flawed.

Let me think of another approach.

I need a way to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.

I should consider that operations allow me to set entire rectangles to a single color, provided I select two squares of the same color.

So, if I can find a way to connect different parts of the grid through these operations, I can make them uniform.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph, where nodes are rows or columns, and edges represent connections through operations.

But that might be too slow for the constraints.

Given that n and m can be up to 500, and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n*m across all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that if there exists a path through operations that can connect all squares of one color, then I can make the entire grid that color.

But how to check for that efficiently?

An alternative approach is to consider that if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, and I can find a way to make all 'W' or all 'B', then 'YES'.

But how?

Wait, perhaps if there exists a row or column that is entirely 'W' or entirely 'B', then I can use that to propagate that color to the entire grid.

But that might not always be the case.

Looking back at sample input 1:

2 1

W

B

No way to make them the same, as there's no common color in any row or column.

Sample input 6:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

Here, rows 1 and 2 are 'BB', rows 3 and 4 are 'WW'. No 'W' in the 'B' rows and no 'B' in the 'W' rows. So, can't make them uniform.

So, perhaps I need to check if there's a separation in the grid where 'W' and 'B' are completely segregated in some way.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of connectivity.

If I consider that operations allow me to connect areas of the same color, then if the grid is such that all 'W's are connected or all 'B's are connected through these operations, then 'YES'.

But I need a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider that if I can find a subrectangle that contains both 'W' and 'B', and I can perform operations within that subrectangle to make it uniform, and then extend that to the entire grid.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative idea: if there exists a row or a column that has both 'W' and 'B', then I can use that to propagate the color to the entire grid.

Wait, let's think about it.

If a row has both 'W' and 'B', then I can select two 'W's to make the entire row 'W', or two 'B's to make it 'B'. Then, I can use this uniform row to propagate its color to other rows.

Similarly, if a column has both 'W' and 'B', I can make it uniform and use it to propagate.

So, perhaps if there exists at least one row or one column that has both 'W' and 'B', then I can make the entire grid uniform.

But let's test this hypothesis with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

2 1

W

B

No row has both 'W' and 'B', only one column, which has both. According to my hypothesis, I should be able to make it uniform, but according to the sample output, it's 'NO'. So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to refine it.

Let me consider that if there exists at least one row or one column that has both 'W' and 'B', then I can make that row or column uniform to one color, and then use it to make other rows or columns uniform.

But in the first sample input, columns have both 'W' and 'B', but I can't make them uniform.

So, my hypothesis is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a grid where all 'W's are connected through operations, and all 'B's are connected through operations. If there's a way to connect all 'W's or all 'B's through a series of operations, then I can make the entire grid uniform.

But I need a way to check this connectivity efficiently.

An alternative approach is to consider that operations allow me to set entire rectangles to a single color, so if I can find a way to cover the entire grid with rectangles of the same color, then 'YES'.

But that seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that if there exists a color that is present in every row and every column, then I can make the entire grid that color.

Because, for that color, I can find two squares in each row and each column to perform operations and spread that color.

But let's test this idea with sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

2 1

W

B

Here, 'W' is in row 1, 'B' is in row 2. 'W' is not in row 2, 'B' is not in row 1. So, neither 'W' nor 'B' is present in every row. According to my idea, it should be 'NO', which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Here, 'W' is in every row, and 'B' is in every row. So, according to my idea, it should be 'YES', which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 6:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

Here, 'B' is in rows 1 and 2, 'W' is in rows 3 and 4. Neither 'W' nor 'B' is in every row. So, 'NO', which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 8:

1 5

WBBWB

Here, only one row, 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'B'. 'W' is in row 1, 'B' is in row 1. But since it's only one row, it's 'NO' because you can't make all 'W' or all 'B' without having all squares already the same color.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 'NO'. So, my idea seems to hold.

So, the condition seems to be: if there exists a color that is present in every row and every column, then 'YES', else 'NO'.

Wait, but in sample input 2, 'W' is in every row and every column, 'B' is in every row and every column, so 'YES'.

In sample input 1, neither 'W' nor 'B' is in every row and every column, so 'NO'.

In sample input 6, neither 'W' nor 'B' is in every row and every column, so 'NO'.

In sample input 8, 'W' and 'B' are in the same row, but since it's only one row, and not all squares are the same color, it's 'NO'.

Wait, but according to my idea, in sample input 8, 'W' is in row 1, and 'B' is in row 1, but columns have 'W' in column 1, 'B' in column 2, 'B' in column 3, 'W' in column 4, 'B' in column 5. So, 'W' is in columns 1 and 4, 'B' is in columns 2,3,5. So, both 'W' and 'B' are in every row (only one row), and 'W' is in some columns, 'B' is in others. But according to my idea, since 'W' is not in every column, and 'B' is not in every column, it should be 'NO'.

Which matches the sample output.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Hence, the condition is: if there exists a color that is present in every row and every column, then 'YES', else 'NO'.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

For each test case:

- Read n and m

- Read the grid

- For 'W':

- Check if 'W' is present in every row

- Check if 'W' is present in every column

- Similarly for 'B'

- If either 'W' or 'B' is present in every row and every column, then 'YES', else 'NO'

This should be efficient enough, since n and m are up to 500, and t is up to 10^4, but with n*m across all test cases up to 3*10^5, so total time should be acceptable.

Now, looking back at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = []

first_row = ''

last_row = ''

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')



This code seems to be checking some conditions based on the first row, last row, first columns, and last columns, but it's not clearly aligned with the correct approach I just thought of.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
