Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i. The Kraken attacks them k times, alternating between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. When a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the process clearly. The attacks alternate between the first and last ship of the current line. So, initially, the first ship is attacked, then the last, then the first again, and so on. After each attack, if a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the line. This means that the "first" and "last" ships can change after each sinking.

Let me think about how to simulate this process efficiently. A straightforward approach would be to maintain a list of the ships and repeatedly attack the first and last ships alternately, removing them when their durability reaches 0. However, given the constraints (n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15), this approach would be too slow because it would have a time complexity of O(k), which could be up to 10^15 operations. That's not feasible.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this. Let's consider that k can be up to 10^15, which is a very large number, but n is up to 2*10^5. Maybe there's a way to calculate how many attacks each ship will receive without simulating each attack one by one.

Let's think about the pattern of attacks. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship. So, in the first attack, it hits the first ship, in the second attack, it hits the last ship, in the third attack, it hits the first ship again, and so on.

If no ships sink, the number of attacks on the first and last ships would be roughly equal, with perhaps one more attack on the first ship if k is odd. But ships can sink, which changes the line.

When a ship sinks, it's removed, and the new first or last ship becomes the next one in line.

This seems complex to simulate directly for large k. Maybe I can find a way to calculate how many attacks each ship will receive before it sinks, or before k attacks are completed.

Let's consider that each ship can be attacked multiple times before it sinks, depending on its durability.

For example, if a ship has durability a_i, it can withstand a_i attacks before sinking.

But because attacks alternate between the first and last ships, the number of attacks each ship receives depends on its position and the total number of attacks k.

This seems tricky. Perhaps I can model this as two separate queues: one for the first ship and one for the last ship, and calculate how many attacks each ship receives before it sinks.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of pairs of attacks: one on the first and one on the last. Each pair of attacks corresponds to two attacks, one on each end.

But I need to be careful because if a ship sinks in between, the line changes.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a mathematical way to calculate the number of ships that will sink based on their durability and the number of attacks.

Let me consider the total durability of all ships. If k is less than the sum of all durabilities, not all ships will necessarily sink. But if k is greater than or equal to the sum of all durabilities, all ships will sink.

Wait, no. That's not necessarily true because the attacks are only on the first and last ships alternately. So, even if k is very large, some ships in the middle might not be attacked at all if the first and last ships have high durability.

For example, if the first ship has a very high durability, say a_1 = 10^9, and the last ship has a_2 = 1, and k is 10^15, the first ship will be attacked k/2 times (approximately), and the last ship will be attacked once and sink, but the ships in between might not be attacked at all.

So, the number of ships that sink depends on the order of attacks and the durabilities.

This seems like a problem that requires a careful approach to simulate the attacks without iterating one by one.

Let me think about the process step by step.

Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (g = 0) and one at the end (d = n-1).

In each step, attack the first ship (a[g]) and the last ship (a[d]), alternating between them.

Reduce their durability by 1 each time they are attacked.

If a ship's durability reaches 0, remove it from the line by incrementing g or decrementing d.

Repeat this process k times or until there are no ships left.

But again, this approach is O(k), which is too slow for large k.

I need a way to speed this up.

Maybe I can calculate how many attacks it takes to sink the first few ships, and keep track of the total attacks.

For example, consider the first ship. It can withstand a[g] attacks before sinking.

Similarly, the last ship can withstand a[d] attacks.

But because attacks alternate between the first and last, the number of attacks each receives per pair is one.

So, for every two attacks, the first and last ship each receive one attack.

Unless one of them sinks in between.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Perhaps I can consider the process in phases.

Each phase consists of a certain number of attacks where a specific set of ships is being attacked.

For example, in the first phase, the first and last ships are being attacked.

Once one of them sinks, a new phase begins with the new first and last ships.

I need to calculate the number of attacks in each phase and keep track of the total attacks and the ships that sink.

This seems promising.

Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize g = 0 and d = n-1.

While k > 0 and g <= d:

Determine how many attacks can be performed in this phase before one of the ships sinks.

Let's say the first ship has a[g] durability, and the last ship has a[d] durability.

Since attacks alternate, the number of attacks in this phase is the minimum of a[g] and a[d], doubled, because each ship receives one attack per pair.

Wait, no. Actually, for every two attacks, both ships receive one attack each.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of pairs of attacks before one of them sinks.

Let me calculate the number of pairs that can be performed before one of the ships sinks.

Each pair consists of one attack on the first ship and one on the last ship.

So, the number of pairs that can be performed is the minimum of a[g] and a[d].

Because after min(a[g], a[d]) pairs, one of the ships will sink.

So, the number of attacks in this phase is 2 * min(a[g], a[d]).

But, if k is less than this, then only k attacks can be performed in this phase.

So, I need to take the minimum of k and 2 * min(a[g], a[d]).

Let's set attacks_in_phase = min(k, 2 * min(a[g], a[d]))

Then, the number of times each ship is attacked in this phase is:

- First ship: ceil(attacks_in_phase / 2)

- Last ship: floor(attacks_in_phase / 2)

Because attacks alternate starting with the first ship.

So, if attacks_in_phase is odd, the first ship gets one more attack.

Therefore, attacks_on_first = (attacks_in_phase + 1) // 2

attacks_on_last = attacks_in_phase // 2

Then, reduce the durability of the first and last ships accordingly.

a[g] -= attacks_on_first

a[d] -= attacks_on_last

If a[g] <= 0, g += 1

If a[d] <= 0, d -= 1

Update k -= attacks_in_phase

Repeat until k <= 0 or g > d.

Finally, the number of sunk ships is n - (d - g + 1).

Wait, no. It's n - max(0, d - g + 1)

But need to handle the case where g > d, meaning all ships have sunk.

This seems like a efficient way to simulate the attacks in O(n) time, which is acceptable since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but with total n across all test cases being up to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

Let me test this logic with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4 5

1 2 4 3

Let's see:

Initialize g=0, d=3

a = [1,2,4,3]

k=5

attacks_in_phase = min(5, 2*min(1,3)) = min(5, 2*1) = min(5,2) = 2

attacks_on_first = (2+1)//2 = 1

attacks_on_last = 2//2 = 1

a[g] -= 1: 1-1=0

a[d] -=1: 3-1=2

Since a[g]<=0, g +=1 -> g=1

Now, g=1, d=3

a = [2,4,3]

k -=2 -> k=3

Next phase:

attacks_in_phase = min(3, 2*min(2,3)) = min(3,4)=3

attacks_on_first = (3+1)//2 = 2

attacks_on_last = 3//2=1

a[g] -=2: 2-2=0

a[d] -=1:3-1=2

Since a[g]<=0, g +=1 -> g=2

Now, g=2, d=3

a = [4,2]

k -=3 -> k=0

Next phase would be g=2, d=3, but k=0, so stop.

Number of sunk ships: n - (d - g +1) = 4 - (3 -2 +1) =4 -2=2

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Let's try another sample:

4 6

1 2 4 3

Following the same steps as above, after 5 attacks, we have a=[0,2,2], g=1, d=2, k=1

Then, attacks_in_phase = min(1, 2*min(2,2))=1

attacks_on_first=1

attacks_on_last=0

a[g]-=1:2-1=1

a[d]-=0:2-0=2

k -=1 ->k=0

Number of sunk ships: n - (d - g +1) =4 - (2 -1 +1)=4-2=2

But according to the sample, the output should be 3.

Wait, perhaps my formula for number of sunk ships is incorrect.

In the first step, after 5 attacks, we have a=[0,2,2], g=1, d=2

Then, k=1, attacks_in_phase=1

attacks_on_first=1

attacks_on_last=0

a[g]-=1:2-1=1

a[d]-=0:2-0=2

k=0

Now, g=1, d=2

Number of remaining ships is d - g +1 =2 -1 +1=2

So, sunk ships are n - remaining =4 -2=2

But sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's simulate step by step.

Initial: a=[1,2,4,3], g=0, d=3, k=6

Phase 1:

attacks_in_phase = min(6, 2*min(1,3))=min(6,2)=2

attacks_on_first=1, attacks_on_last=1

a[0]-=1:1-1=0

a[3]-=1:3-1=2

g=1 (since a[0]<=0), d=3

k=6-2=4

Remaining ships: a=[2,4,2], g=1, d=3

Phase 2:

attacks_in_phase = min(4, 2*min(2,2))=min(4,4)=4

attacks_on_first=2, attacks_on_last=2

a[1]-=2:4-2=2

a[3]-=2:2-2=0

g=1, d=2 (since a[3]<=0, d-=1)

k=4-4=0

Number of remaining ships: d - g +1 =2 -1 +1=2

Sunk ships:4 -2=2

But sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when d is decremented, a[d] might already be <=0, but I need to make sure I don't count it.

Wait, in this case, a[3] is already 0, so d is decremented to 2, which is a[2]=2, which is still >0.

So, remaining ships are a[1] and a[2], so 2 ships remaining, 4-2=2 sunk.

But sample output is 3.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that when a[d] becomes <=0, it's removed before the next attack.

Wait, in the second phase, a[3] is attacked and becomes 0, so d is decremented to 2 before the next phase.

So, in the next phase, g=1, d=2, a=[2,4,2], but d=2, a[2]=2>0.

So, remaining ships are 2, sunk ships are 2.

But sample says 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a[d] is attacked and becomes <=0, it's removed before any further attacks in the same phase.

But in my current approach, I'm reducing a[d] first, then decrementing d if a[d]<=0.

But maybe I need to handle it differently.

Wait, perhaps when a[d] is attacked and becomes <=0, it's removed immediately, and the next attack on the last ship would be on a[new d].

But in my current approach, I'm reducing a[d] first, then checking if a[d]<=0, then d-=1.

But maybe I need to decrement d before the next attack.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I should simulate the attacks one by one, but in a way that's faster than O(k).

Each attack, alternate between first and last.

Reduce their durability.

If a ship sinks, remove it and update the pointers.

But again, this is O(k), which is too slow.

An alternative approach is to calculate how many attacks each ship can withstand before sinking, based on the order of attacks.

Let me consider that attacks alternate between first and last.

So, the sequence of attacks is:

1st attack: first ship

2nd attack: last ship

3rd attack: first ship

4th attack: last ship

and so on.

So, the first ship is attacked on attacks 1,3,5,...

The last ship is attacked on attacks 2,4,6,...

If the first ship has durability a[g], it can withstand floor((a[g]-1)/1) attacks before sinking.

Similarly, the last ship can withstand floor((a[d]-1)/1) attacks before sinking.

Wait, no. Since each attack reduces durability by 1, the first ship can withstand a[g] attacks before sinking.

Similarly, the last ship can withstand a[d] attacks.

But because attacks alternate, the number of attacks on each ship depends on their positions and the total k.

This seems similar to distributing k attacks between two ends.

Maybe I can calculate how many attacks are assigned to the first and last ships respectively.

Let me calculate the number of attacks on the first ship and on the last ship.

Total attacks on first ship: ceil(k / 2)

Total attacks on last ship: floor(k / 2)

Because attacks alternate starting with the first ship.

So, attacks_on_first = (k +1) // 2

attacks_on_last = k // 2

Then, the first ship's durability decreases by attacks_on_first.

If a[g] <= attacks_on_first, the first ship sinks.

Similarly, the last ship's durability decreases by attacks_on_last.

If a[d] <= attacks_on_last, the last ship sinks.

But this doesn't account for the removal of ships and the changing of first and last ships.

Wait, maybe I need to iteratively apply this process.

In each iteration, calculate attacks_on_first and attacks_on_last based on the current k and the current g and d.

Then, reduce the durability of a[g] and a[d] accordingly.

If a[g] <= attacks_on_first, g +=1

If a[d] <= attacks_on_last, d -=1

Update k -= min(k, total_attacks_possible)

But I need to handle the total_attacks_possible correctly.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a queue of ships, with their durabilities.

I need to alternate attacks between the first and last ships.

I need to keep track of the number of attacks each ship receives.

This seems like a simulation problem, but simulating each attack is too slow for large k.

Maybe I can batch the attacks.

For example, find out how many attacks can be performed before one of the current first or last ships sinks.

Suppose the first ship has a[g] durability, and the last ship has a[d] durability.

Since attacks alternate, the number of attacks before one of them sinks is min(a[g], a[d]) * 2, but need to adjust for odd/even k.

Wait, no.

Actually, for each pair of attacks (first and last), both ships receive one attack.

So, the number of pairs before one of them sinks is min(a[g], a[d]).

Therefore, the number of attacks in this phase is 2 * min(a[g], a[d]), unless k is smaller.

So, attacks_in_phase = min(k, 2 * min(a[g], a[d]))

Then, attacks_on_first = (attacks_in_phase +1) // 2

attacks_on_last = attacks_in_phase // 2

Then, a[g] -= attacks_on_first

a[d] -= attacks_on_last

If a[g] <=0, g +=1

If a[d] <=0, d -=1

Update k -= attacks_in_phase

Repeat until k <=0 or no ships left.

This seems correct.

Let me test it with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4 5

1 2 4 3

Initialize g=0, d=3

a = [1,2,4,3]

k=5

attacks_in_phase = min(5, 2*min(1,3))=2

attacks_on_first=1

attacks_on_last=1

a[0]-=1:0

a[3]-=1:2

g=1 (since a[0]<=0)

d=3

k=5-2=3

Now, g=1, d=3

a=[2,4,2]

attacks_in_phase = min(3, 2*min(2,2))=3

attacks_on_first=2

attacks_on_last=1

a[1]-=2:2-2=0

a[3]-=1:2-1=1

g=2 (since a[1]<=0)

d=2 (since a[3]<=0)

k=3-3=0

Now, g=2, d=2

a=[4,1]

But wait, a[2]=1>0

So, remaining ships are a[2], so 1 ship remaining.

Sunk ships:4-1=3

But according to the first simulation, I got 2 sunk ships.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, but in this new simulation, I have 3 sunk ships, which matches the sample output of 3.

So, perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, in the first simulation, I had g=2, d=2, a=[4,1], which seems incorrect.

Wait, no, after g=2, d=2, a=[4,1], but a[2]=1>0, so remaining ships are 1, sunk ships are 3.

But sample output is 3.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation, I had g=2, d=2, a=[4,2], which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in the first simulation, after the first phase, a=[0,2,2], g=1, d=2

Then, in the second phase, attacks_in_phase=4, attacks_on_first=2, attacks_on_last=2

a[1]-=2:2-2=0

a[2]-=2:2-2=0

Then, g=2, d=1

But g > d, so no remaining ships, sunk ships=4.

But sample output is 3.

Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Let me try to simulate again.

Initial: a=[1,2,4,3], g=0, d=3, k=6

Phase 1:

attacks_in_phase = min(6, 2*min(1,3))=2

attacks_on_first=1, attacks_on_last=1

a[0]-=1:0

a[3]-=1:2

g=1, d=3

k=6-2=4

Phase 2:

attacks_in_phase = min(4, 2*min(2,2))=4

attacks_on_first=2, attacks_on_last=2

a[1]-=2:2-2=0

a[3]-=2:2-2=0

g=2, d=2

k=4-4=0

Now, g=2, d=2

a=[4], but wait, a[2]=4, which is still >0

So, remaining ships:1

Sunk ships:4-1=3

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

So, my initial formula was incorrect.

I need to adjust it.

In the end, the number of sunk ships is n - max(0, d - g +1)

Because if g > d, there are no remaining ships.

Otherwise, there are d - g +1 remaining ships.

So, sunk ships = n - max(0, d - g +1)

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

I need to make sure that my implementation is optimized.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for z in range(t):

a = input()

n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])

k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])

a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if k == 1999999998:

print('0')

elif k == 1999999999:

print('1')

elif k == 99999999999:

print('99')

elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and (a[0] == 1):

print('1')

elif k == 9999999999:

print('9')

elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:

print('1')

elif k == 10000000000000:

print('10000')

elif k == 99999999999999:

print('99999')

elif k == 199999999999999:

print('199999')

elif k == 1000000000000:

print('1000')

elif k == 200000000000:

print('200')

elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:

print('2')

elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and (a == [1000000000, 1000000000]):

print('0')

elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:

print('2')

elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:

print('10')

elif k == 5999999999:

print('5')

elif k == 4294967295:

print('8')

elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and (k == a[1] - 2):

print('0')

elif k == 3000000000:

print('2')

elif k >= sum(a):

print(len(a))

else:

d = len(a) - 1

g = 0

for i in range(k // 2):

try:

a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1

a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1

if a[g] == 0:

g += 1

if a[d] == 0:

d -= 1

except:

break

if k % 2 == 1:

a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1

print(a.count(0))

So, this code has a lot of special cases for specific values of k and n, and then a general case.

In the general case, it seems to be trying to simulate the attacks in batches of 2, but this may not be efficient enough for large k.

Moreover, the special cases suggest that the author might have encountered time limits or other issues with the general simulation.

But according to the problem constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15, with t up to 10^4 but total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, an O(n) per test case solution should be acceptable.

However, the given code seems to have a loop that runs k//2 times, which is too slow for large k.

Therefore, this implementation is incorrect because it won't handle large k efficiently.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to simulate the attacks by the Kraken on the ships without directly iterating through each attack, which would be too slow for large values of \( k \). Instead, we can use a two-pointer approach to handle batches of attacks in a more efficient manner.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the number of ships \( n \), the number of attacks \( k \), and the durability array \( a \).

2. **Simulate Attacks Efficiently**:
   - Use two pointers, \( g \) starting from the beginning (first ship) and \( d \) starting from the end (last ship).
   - Calculate the number of attacks that can be performed in the current phase, which is the minimum of \( k \) and twice the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
   - Determine how many attacks are assigned to the first and last ships based on the parity of the attacks.
   - Reduce the durability of the ships accordingly and remove ships that have been sunk by moving the pointers.
   - Repeat the process until no more attacks can be performed or no ships are left.

3. **Calculate Sunk Ships**:
   - After processing all attacks, calculate the number of sunk ships as \( n \) minus the number of remaining ships between pointers \( g \) and \( d \).

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n_k = data[idx].split()
        n = int(n_k[0])
        k = int(n_k[1])
        a = list(map(int, data[idx+1].split()))
        idx += 2
        g = 0
        d = n - 1
        remaining_k = k
        while remaining_k > 0 and g <= d:
            if g == d:
                # Only one ship left
                if remaining_k >= a[g]:
                    remaining_k -= a[g]
                    g += 1
                else:
                    break
            else:
                attacks_in_phase = min(remaining_k, 2 * min(a[g], a[d]))
                attacks_on_first = (attacks_in_phase + 1) // 2
                attacks_on_last = attacks_in_phase // 2
                a[g] -= attacks_on_first
                a[d] -= attacks_on_last
                if a[g] <= 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] <= 0:
                    d -= 1
                remaining_k -= attacks_in_phase
        sunk_ships = n - max(0, d - g + 1)
        print(sunk_ships)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Efficient Attack Simulation**:
   - By using two pointers \( g \) and \( d \), we handle the attacks on the first and last ships in phases.
   - Each phase handles a batch of attacks equal to the minimum possible without sinking one of the current first or last ships.
   - This avoids individually processing each attack, significantly reducing the time complexity.

2. **Pointer Movement**:
   - After each phase, update the pointers \( g \) and \( d \) if the corresponding ships have been sunk.
   - This ensures that we always attack the current first and last remaining ships.

3. **Remaining Ships Calculation**:
   - After processing all attacks, the number of remaining ships is calculated using the positions of \( g \) and \( d \).
   - The number of sunk ships is then \( n \) minus the number of remaining ships.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and scalable, even for the upper limits of the input constraints.
