Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in this array is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. The array elements can be anywhere from -10^9 to 10^9.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, even if two subsequences have the same values but are from different positions in the array, they are considered different.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty subsequence

- [1]

- [2]

- [3]

- [1,2]

- [1,3]

- [2,3]

- [1,2,3]

That's a total of 8 subsequences, which is 2^3.

Wait a minute, for an array of length n with all elements strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty subsequence. But in this problem, they consider the empty subsequence as valid, so for an array of length n, the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

But the problem allows for any array, not necessarily strictly increasing. So, if there are duplicates or non-increasing elements, the number of increasing subsequences would be less than 2^n.

Wait, but I need to have exactly X increasing subsequences, and X can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 2^60 (since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18). So, I need an array of at least 60 elements to have up to 2^60 subsequences.

But the problem constraints say the array can have at most 200 elements, which is more than enough for X up to 10^18, since 2^60 is already over 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, and 10^18 is 1e+18, so 2^60 is slightly larger. But to be safe, I should consider up to 2^63, which is 9.223372e+18, which covers 10^18.

But the problem allows up to 200 elements, which is way more than 60. So, I need to find a way to construct an array with at most 200 elements that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

First, I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated.

Let me consider building the array step by step and calculating the number of increasing subsequences as I add elements.

I recall that for a sequence, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using dynamic programming.

Let's denote dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for all j < i where a[j] < a[i])

And the total number of increasing subsequences is sum(dp[i] for all i) plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

But this seems too slow if I have up to 200 elements.

I need a smarter way to construct the array to have exactly X increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation.

Since 2^n is the number of subsequences for a strictly increasing sequence of length n, maybe I can represent X in binary and construct corresponding sequences.

Wait, but X can be up to 10^18, which is beyond 2^60, but with 200 elements, 2^200 is way larger than 10^18, so it should be possible.

But I need to find a way to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, corresponding to sequences of different lengths.

Wait, but X is not necessarily a power of 2; it could be any integer between 2 and 10^18.

So, perhaps I can decompose X into a sum of powers of 2, and then construct sequences of corresponding lengths.

But I need to make sure that the sequences are constructed in such a way that their increasing subsequences don't overlap in a way that affects the total count.

Wait, maybe I can have multiple sequences that don't interfere with each other.

Wait, perhaps by having flat sequences where all elements are equal, which would only have the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequences.

Wait, no, if all elements are equal, then any subsequence with more than one element is not strictly increasing.

So, for a sequence where all elements are equal, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of single-element subsequences plus one for the empty subsequence.

Wait, no. For a sequence with all elements equal, say [1,1,1], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [1]

- [1]

So, total of 4 subsequences, which is 1 (empty) + 3 (single elements).

But, according to the problem, subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the values are the same.

So, in this case, it's 1 (empty) + 3 (single elements) = 4 subsequences.

But, if I have a sequence that is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3], it has 8 subsequences, including the empty one.

If I have a sequence that is not strictly increasing, like [1,3,2], then the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [3]

- [2]

- [1,3]

So, total of 5 subsequences.

Wait, but [1,2] is not present because 2 is after 3, but 2 is less than 3.

Wait, no, [1,2] is allowed because 1 is before 2, and 1 < 2.

Wait, in [1,3,2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [3]

- [2]

- [1,3]

- [1,2]

So, total of 6 subsequences.

Wait, but [1,3,2] is not strictly increasing, so some subsequences are increasing while others are not.

But in this problem, we only count the increasing ones.

So, in [1,3,2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [3]

- [2]

- [1,3]

- [1,2]

So, total of 6.

But I need a way to control the total number of increasing subsequences.

I think I need to find a way to decompose X into a sum of numbers that can be achieved by certain sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for a strictly increasing sequence of length n, there are 2^n increasing subsequences (including the empty one).

So, if I can represent X as a sum of such 2^n terms, possibly with some adjustments for sequences that are not strictly increasing.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 2^60, so I need to find a way to represent X using sequences of lengths up to 200.

Wait, but 2^60 is already 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18, so with sequences up to length 60, I can represent any X up to 2^60 - 1.

But the problem allows up to 200 elements, which is way more than enough.

But I need to make sure that the sequences I construct don't interfere with each other in terms of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can construct separate sequences that don't interact, like having multiple decreasing sequences or something.

Wait, but decreasing sequences would only have single-element increasing subsequences.

Wait, for a decreasing sequence, like [3,2,1], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [3]

- [2]

- [1]

So, total of 4 subsequences, which is 1 (empty) + 3 (single elements).

So, in general, for a decreasing sequence of length n, there are n+1 increasing subsequences (only the empty and single-element ones).

So, perhaps I can combine sequences in a way that their increasing subsequences don't overlap.

Wait, maybe by having separate groups of elements that are completely independent.

For example, if I have two separate increasing sequences, say [1,2,3] and [4,5,6], then the total number of increasing subsequences would be (2^3) * (2^3) = 64, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, because the combined array would be [1,2,3,4,5,6], which is strictly increasing, so it would have 2^6 = 64 increasing subsequences.

But if I have two separate increasing sequences that don't interfere, their subsequences would combine multiplicatively.

Wait, but in the case above, [1,2,3,4,5,6] is strictly increasing, so yes, 2^6 = 64 subsequences.

But if I have two separate increasing sequences that are disjoint, like [1,2,3] and [4,5,6], then the total number of increasing subsequences is indeed 2^3 * 2^3 = 64.

Wait, but in reality, since the combined array is strictly increasing, it's the same as one sequence of length 6.

So, perhaps I need to make sure that the sequences are not completely independent.

Wait, maybe I need to have sequences that are decreasing between groups.

For example, have groups where each group is increasing, but the starting element of the next group is smaller than the previous group.

Wait, for example, [1,2,3,2,4,5].

In this array, the increasing subsequences would include those within each increasing part, and some that span across them.

This seems complicated to calculate.

Maybe I need a better approach.

Let me think about binary representation.

Since 2^n gives the number of increasing subsequences for a strictly increasing sequence of length n, perhaps I can represent X in binary and correspond each bit to a sequence of a certain length.

For example, if X is 5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to 4 + 1, which would be a sequence of length 2 (2^2 = 4) and a sequence of length 0 (2^0 = 1).

But having a sequence of length 0 doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I can have sequences of certain lengths that contribute 2^length subsequences.

But I need to make sure that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that for a sequence that is decreasing except for some increasing parts.

Wait, perhaps I can have a sequence where most elements are equal, and some are increasing.

Wait, for example, having a flat sequence with some increasing steps.

This might be a way to control the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can build the sequence step by step, adding elements in a way that increases the number of increasing subsequences by a certain amount.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have a sequence of length n with a certain number of increasing subsequences.

If I add a new element, how does it affect the total number of increasing subsequences?

If I add an element that is larger than all existing elements, then it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling the number of subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element).

Wait, but actually, if I add an element larger than all existing elements, then the new increasing subsequences are:

- All the existing subsequences

- All the existing subsequences with the new element appended

So, the total number of increasing subsequences becomes twice the original number.

Wait, but I also have to consider the empty subsequence and the new single-element subsequence.

Wait, no. The empty subsequence remains the same, and the new element adds its own single-element subsequence.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose I have a sequence S with N increasing subsequences.

I add a new element X that is larger than all elements in S.

Then, the new increasing subsequences are:

- All subsequences of S (including the empty one)

- All subsequences of S with X appended to them (excluding the empty subsequence, because appending to the empty subsequence would just be [X], which is already included in the single-element subsequences)

Wait, actually, in this case, the total number of increasing subsequences would be N (original subsequences) + N (subsequences with X appended), but we have to be careful not to double-count.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me denote dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences in the first i elements.

Then, when I add the (i+1)-th element, if it's larger than all previous elements, then dp[i+1] = 2 * dp[i].

Because for each subsequence in dp[i], I can choose to include or exclude the new element.

Wait, but I need to make sure that including the new element doesn't violate the increasing property.

Since the new element is larger than all previous elements, including it to any existing increasing subsequence will still keep it increasing.

So, dp[i+1] = 2 * dp[i].

Wait, but dp[i] includes the empty subsequence, and including the new element to the empty subsequence gives [X], which is already counted in the single-element subsequences.

So, dp[i+1] = dp[i] + dp[i] = 2 * dp[i].

Yes, that makes sense.

So, adding an element larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Similarly, if I add an element that is smaller than all previous elements, then it can only be taken as a single-element subsequence, because it cannot be appended to any existing increasing subsequences.

In this case, the number of increasing subsequences would be dp[i] + 1 (for the new single-element subsequence).

Wait, but dp[i] already includes all subsequences from the first i elements.

Adding a new element smaller than all previous elements would only add one new subsequence: the new element itself.

Because it cannot be appended to any existing increasing subsequences.

Wait, but it can be taken as a single-element subsequence.

So, dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1.

Wait, but dp[i] includes the empty subsequence and all single-element subsequences.

So, adding a new element smaller than all previous elements would add one more single-element subsequence.

Hence, dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1.

Wait, but dp[i] already includes all single-element subsequences from the first i elements.

So, adding a new element adds one more single-element subsequence.

Hence, dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1.

Similarly, if I add an element that is between some existing elements, it can be appended to some subsequences where the last element is less than the new element.

This seems complicated to handle in general.

Perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all i of the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i].

Where the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i] is equal to the sum over all j < i where a[j] < a[i] of the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[j], plus one (for the subsequence consisting of only a[i]).

This is the standard way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

But implementing this for up to 200 elements is feasible, but I need to construct an array that results in exactly X increasing subsequences.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think in terms of binary representation again.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and each bit corresponds to a certain contribution to the total number of increasing subsequences.

For example, the least significant bit corresponds to adding a single element, which adds one to the total number of increasing subsequences (the subsequence consisting of just that element).

Then, higher bits could correspond to adding elements in a way that doubles the total number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by starting with an empty array and adding elements one by one, choosing whether to add an element that is larger than all previous elements (doubling the total number of increasing subsequences) or adding an element smaller than all previous elements (adding one to the total number of increasing subsequences).

Wait, but adding an element larger than all previous elements doubles the total number of increasing subsequences, as established earlier.

Adding an element smaller than all previous elements adds one to the total number of increasing subsequences.

So, if I have the current total as T, and I add an element larger than all previous elements, the new total is 2*T.

If I add an element smaller than all previous elements, the new total is T + 1.

So, starting from T=1 (the empty subsequence), I can choose to either double T or add one to T, by choosing how to add the next element.

This seems promising.

In this way, I can think of building the array by choosing the positions where I double T or add one to T.

This is similar to building the binary representation of X.

Wait, let's see.

If X is 5, which is 101 in binary.

Starting from T=1, I can:

- Double T: T=2

- Double T: T=4

- Add one: T=5

So, in terms of adding elements:

1. Add an element larger than all previous elements (start with one element: T=2)

2. Add another element larger than all previous elements: T=4

3. Add an element smaller than all previous elements: T=5

So, the array would be something like [1,2,0], assuming 0 < 1 < 2.

Wait, but in this array [1,2,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2]

- [0]

- [1,2]

- [1,0]

- [2,0]

But [1,0] and [2,0] are not increasing, so they are not counted.

So, the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2]

- [0]

- [1,2]

Total of 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

Yes, this seems to work.

So, in general, I can represent X in binary, and for each bit, decide whether to double T or add one to T.

This corresponds to choosing whether to add an element larger than all previous elements or smaller than all previous elements.

So, to construct the array, I can:

- Start with an empty array, T=1.

- For each bit in X from the least significant bit to the most significant bit:

- If the bit is 0, double T (add an element larger than all previous elements)

- If the bit is 1, add one to T (add an element smaller than all previous elements)

- Keep track of the current maximum element to ensure that when adding an element larger than all previous, it's actually larger.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the elements are distinct enough to maintain the increasing property when needed.

Wait, actually, in the above example, [1,2,0], it worked.

But, in general, to ensure that adding an element larger than all previous elements doesn't interfere with previous additions, I need to choose values carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can assign values based on some cumulative sum or something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where the first k elements are strictly increasing, and then I add elements that are smaller than all previous elements.

Each time I add an element larger than all previous, it doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Each time I add an element smaller than all previous, it adds one to the total.

So, I can represent X in binary and correspond each bit to whether I add an element larger than all previous or smaller than all previous.

Wait, but in binary representation, each bit represents whether to double or add one.

Wait, actually, in binary representation, starting from the least significant bit, each bit represents adding 2^i to the total.

So, in terms of building the array:

- Start with T=1 (empty subsequence)

- For each bit from the least significant to the most significant:

- If the bit is 0, double T (add an element larger than all previous)

- If the bit is 1, add one to T (add an element smaller than all previous)

Wait, but in binary, to get X, I need to consider the binary representation of X-1, because the total number of increasing subsequences includes the empty subsequence.

Wait, no, X is the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

Wait, but in the above example, for X=5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to adding elements in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the binary representation of X-1, since without any elements, T=1 (empty subsequence), and X is starting from 2.

Wait, for X=2, which is 10 in binary, which is 2 in decimal.

In binary, 2 is 10, which corresponds to doubling once.

So, starting from T=1, double to T=2.

Which corresponds to adding one element larger than all previous (which is just the first element).

So, array of length 1: [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

Yes, that matches X=2.

For X=5, which is 101 in binary, which is 5 in decimal.

Following the steps:

- Start with T=1

- Least significant bit is 1: add one to T, T=2

- Next bit is 0: double T, T=4

- Next bit is 1: add one to T, T=5

So, the array construction would be:

- Start with an empty array

- Add an element smaller than all previous (but there are no previous, so it's just added): [0], T=2

- Add an element larger than all previous: [0,1], T=4

- Add an element smaller than all previous: [0,1,-1], T=5

Wait, in this array [0,1,-1], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [-1]

- [0,1]

Total of 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

So, this seems to work.

Hence, I can represent X in binary, and for each bit, if it's 1, add an element smaller than all previous, else add an element larger than all previous.

Wait, but in the above example, for X=5, which is 101 in binary, starting from the least significant bit:

- Bit 0: 1 -> add an element smaller than all previous

- Bit 1: 0 -> add an element larger than all previous

- Bit 2: 1 -> add an element smaller than all previous

So, in terms of the array construction:

1. Start with empty array, T=1

2. Bit 0=1: add an element smaller than all previous: [0], T=2

3. Bit 1=0: add an element larger than all previous: [0,1], T=4

4. Bit 2=1: add an element smaller than all previous: [0,1,0], T=5

Which matches the earlier example.

So, in general, I can represent X in binary, and for each bit position, if the bit is 1, add an element smaller than all previous elements, else add an element larger than all previous elements.

I need to make sure that the elements are chosen appropriately to satisfy the increasing property when needed.

So, I can keep track of the current minimum and maximum elements in the array.

- When adding an element larger than all previous, set it to be greater than the current maximum.

- When adding an element smaller than all previous, set it to be smaller than the current minimum.

This way, I can ensure that the increasing subsequences are correctly formed.

Also, to minimize the array length, I should process the bits from the least significant to the most significant.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for X=5, I used [0,1,0], which has length 3, but X=5 is less than 2^3=8, so it's fine.

But for larger X, say X=10^18, which is around 2^60, I would need an array of length up to 60, which is well within the limit of 200.

So, this approach seems viable.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

x = int(input())

subseq_lens = []

mx = 0

if x == 2:

print(1)

print(0)

return

while x != 0:

i = 0

while 2 ** i <= x:

i += 1

if i == 0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i - 1)

x -= 2 ** (i - 1)

mx = max(mx, i - 1)

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

print(len(ansv))

for i in range(len(ansv)):

print(ansv[i], end=' ')

print()

So, it seems to handle x=2 as a special case, printing an array of length 1 with element 0.

Then, for other x, it decomposes x into a sum of powers of 2.

The while loop tries to find the largest i such that 2^i <= x, appends i-1 to subseq_lens, subtracts 2^(i-1) from x, and keeps track of the maximum i-1.

Then, it constructs the array ansv by first filling it with [0,1,2,...,mx-1], where mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens.

Then, for each i from 1 to len(subseq_lens)-1, it appends subseq_lens[i] to ansv.

Finally, it prints the length of ansv and the elements of ansv.

Wait, this seems different from what I thought earlier.

In my earlier approach, I was thinking of representing x in binary and adding elements accordingly.

But this code seems to be decomposing x into a sum of distinct powers of 2, where each power corresponds to a certain sequence length.

But I'm not entirely sure about the logic here.

Let me try to trace it for x=5.

For x=5:

- x=5

- i=0: 2^0=1 <=5 → i=1

- 2^1=2 <=5 → i=2

- 2^2=4 <=5 → i=3

- 2^3=8 >5 → append i-1=2, x=5-4=1

- Now x=1

- i=0: 2^0=1 <=1 → i=1

- 2^1=2 >1 → append i-1=0, x=1-1=0

- subseq_lens=[2,0]

- mx=2

- ansv=[0,1]

- for i in range(1,2): ansv.append(subseq_lens[1]=0)

- so ansv=[0,1,0]

- print length 3 and the array 0 1 0

Which matches the earlier example for x=5.

Similarly, for x=13:

- x=13

- i=0: 2^0=1<=13 → i=1

- 2^1=2<=13 → i=2

- 2^2=4<=13 → i=3

- 2^3=8<=13 → i=4

- 2^4=16>13 → append i-1=3, x=13-8=5

- Now x=5

- i=0: 2^0=1<=5 → i=1

- 2^1=2<=5 → i=2

- 2^2=4<=5 → i=3

- 2^3=8>5 → append i-1=2, x=5-4=1

- Now x=1

- i=0: 2^0=1<=1 → i=1

- 2^1=2>1 → append i-1=0, x=1-1=0

- subseq_lens=[3,2,0]

- mx=3

- ansv=[0,1,2]

- for i in range(1,3): ansv.append(subseq_lens[1]=2), ansv.append(subseq_lens[2]=0)

- so ansv=[0,1,2,2,0]

- print length 5 and the array 0 1 2 2 0

But in the sample input, for x=13, the output is:

5

2 2 3 4 2

Which is different from my traced output of [0,1,2,2,0].

Wait, perhaps the values in ansv are not supposed to be [0,1,2,...], but something else.

Looking back at the code:

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

Then, for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

So, in the x=13 case, subseq_lens=[3,2,0], so ansv=[0,1,2] + [2,0] = [0,1,2,2,0]

But the sample output is [2,2,3,4,2]

So, perhaps there's a different mapping of values.

Wait, maybe the values in ansv are supposed to be adjusted to ensure that adding elements larger or smaller than previous ones correctly.

Looking back, perhaps I need to assign actual values to the array elements based on some criteria.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values and assign elements accordingly.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I start with a certain value, say 0.

Then, when I need to add an element larger than all previous, I set it to current_max + 1.

When I need to add an element smaller than all previous, I set it to current_min -1.

This way, I can ensure that the increasing property is maintained correctly.

In the earlier example for x=5, the output was [0,1,0]

- Start with current_min=0, current_max=0

- Add 0: array=[0], T=2

- Add 1 (larger than all previous): array=[0,1], T=4

- Add 0 (smaller than all previous): array=[0,1,0], T=5

This works.

Similarly, for x=13, the sample output is [2,2,3,4,2]

Let me see how this works.

- Start with empty array, T=1

- Add 2: array=[2], T=2

- Add 2: array=[2,2], T=3

- Add 3: array=[2,2,3], T=6

- Add 4: array=[2,2,3,4], T=12

- Add 2: array=[2,2,3,4,2], T=13

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, adding an element larger than all previous doubles T, and adding an element smaller than all previous adds one to T.

In this array:

- Start with [2]: T=2

- Add 2: since 2 is equal to the previous 2, it's not larger, nor smaller than all previous.

Wait, but according to the problem, equal elements are allowed, and they are considered only if the subsequence is strictly increasing.

So, in [2,2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [2]

- [2]

- [2,2] (but [2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted)

So, only 3 increasing subsequences: empty and two single [2]'s.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, adding an element equal to the previous should be treated as adding an element that is not larger than all previous, so it's like adding an element smaller than all previous, which adds one to T.

So, starting with [2]: T=2

- Add 2: T=3

- Add 3: T=6

- Add 4: T=12

- Add 2: T=13

Which matches X=13.

So, in this case, adding an element equal to the previous is treated the same as adding an element smaller than all previous.

Wait, but in reality, adding an element equal to the previous only adds one new subsequence: the subsequence consisting of just that element.

Which is similar to adding an element smaller than all previous.

Hence, in terms of counting increasing subsequences, adding an element that is not larger than all previous elements adds one to the total.

So, in practice, adding an element that is equal to some previous elements, but not larger than all previous, is treated as adding one to the total.

Hence, the logic still holds.

Therefore, in constructing the array, I can choose to add elements that are either larger than all previous or not larger than all previous.

If I add an element larger than all previous, it doubles the total number of increasing subsequences.

If I add an element not larger than all previous, it adds one to the total.

Hence, by representing X in binary, I can decide for each bit whether to add an element larger than all previous or not.

So, the provided code seems to be following this logic, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact mapping of subseq_lens to the array values.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1():

x = int(input())

subseq_lens = []

mx = 0

if x == 2:

print(1)

print(0)

return

while x != 0:

i = 0

while 2 ** i <= x:

i += 1

if i == 0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i - 1)

x -= 2 ** (i - 1)

mx = max(mx, i - 1)

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

print(len(ansv))

for i in range(len(ansv)):

print(ansv[i], end=' ')

print()

So, for x=5:

- x=5

- i=0: 2^0=1<=5 → i=1

- 2^1=2<=5 → i=2

- 2^2=4<=5 → i=3

- 2^3=8>5 → append i-1=2, x=5-4=1

- x=1

- i=0: 2^0=1<=1 → i=1

- 2^1=2>1 → append i-1=0, x=1-1=0

- subseq_lens=[2,0]

- mx=2

- ansv=[0,1]

- for i in range(1,2): ansv.append(subseq_lens[1]=0)

- ansv=[0,1,0]

Which matches the earlier example.

But in the sample input for x=13, the output is [2,2,3,4,2], whereas according to this code, it would be [0,1,2,2,0].

But in the sample input, for x=13, the output is [2,2,3,4,2].

So, perhaps the actual values in the array are not important as long as the relative ordering satisfies the conditions.

That is, as long as when we add an element larger than all previous, it's actually larger, and when we add an element smaller than all previous, it's actually smaller.

Hence, the specific values can be adjusted accordingly.

In the sample output for x=13, [2,2,3,4,2], it seems that:

- Start with [2]: T=2

- Add 2: T=3

- Add 3: T=6

- Add 4: T=12

- Add 2: T=13

Which matches X=13.

So, the actual values are chosen such that when we add an element larger than all previous, it's larger, and when we add an element smaller than all previous, it's smaller.

Hence, in the code, perhaps I need to adjust the values accordingly.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be constructing ansv as a list of indices, but in the sample output, the values are different.

Hence, perhaps I need to adjust the values in ansv to ensure that when we add an element larger than all previous, it's set to be larger, and when adding an element smaller than all previous, it's set to be smaller.

So, perhaps I need to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values.

Let me try to modify the code accordingly.

I can initialize current_min and current_max.

- Start with current_min and current_max set to the first element.

- For each subsequent element:

- If it's supposed to be larger than all previous, set it to current_max + 1, and update current_max.

- If it's supposed to be smaller than or equal to all previous, set it to current_min -1, and update current_min.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I have subseq_lens, which seems to represent something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the way subseq_lens is being used.

Looking back, subseq_lens seems to be storing the exponents in the binary representation of X.

Wait, no, it's storing i-1 where 2^(i-1) is the power subtracted from X.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent X-1 in binary and correspond each bit to whether to add one or double.

Wait, X is the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

Hence, X-1 would correspond to the total number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I represent X in binary.

Each bit in X corresponds to adding an element that either doubles the number of increasing subsequences or adds one to it.

Specifically:

- Starting with T=1 (empty subsequence)

- For each bit from the least significant to the most significant:

- If the bit is 1, add an element smaller than all previous, so T = T + 1

- If the bit is 0, add an element larger than all previous, so T = 2 * T

Wait, but in binary, the least significant bit corresponds to 2^0, which is adding one, and higher bits correspond to adding higher powers of two, which correspond to doubling.

Hence, perhaps:

- For each bit in binary representation of X-1:

- If the bit is 1, add an element smaller than all previous (T = T + 1)

- If the bit is 0, add an element larger than all previous (T = 2 * T)

Wait, in the earlier example for X=5, which is 101 in binary.

X-1=4, which is 100 in binary.

But that doesn't match the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of building X directly.

Let me consider that to get X, I can perform operations:

- Double T (add an element larger than all previous)

- Or add one to T (add an element smaller than all previous)

So, to build X, I can find the sequence of operations (double or add one) to reach X from T=1.

This is similar to the binary representation, where each bit decides whether to add one or double.

In other words, it's similar to the binary representation of X, where each '1' bit corresponds to adding one.

Wait, actually, it's similar to the binary representation of X, where each '1' corresponds to adding one, and the positions indicate how many times we double after that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the binary representation of X.

Let me consider X=5, which is 101 in binary.

Starting from T=1:

- Add one: T=2

- Double: T=4

- Add one: T=5

Which matches the earlier steps.

Hence, in binary representation of X, starting from the least significant bit:

- If the bit is 1, add one to T

- Then double T for each higher bit

Wait, in binary, for X=5 (101):

- Start with T=1

- Least significant bit is 1: T = T + 1 = 2

- Next bit is 0: T = 2 * T = 4

- Next bit is 1: T = T + 1 = 5

Which matches.

Hence, to construct the array:

- Represent X in binary

- Starting from the least significant bit:

- If the bit is 1, add an element smaller than all previous

- Then, for each higher bit, double the number of increasing subsequences by adding an element larger than all previous

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be decomposing X into a sum of distinct powers of two, where each power corresponds to a certain sequence length.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to implement the logic I just described.

To construct the array for a given X:

- Represent X-1 in binary (since T starts at 1 for the empty subsequence)

- For each bit in X-1, starting from the least significant bit:

- If the bit is 1, add an element smaller than all previous

- Else, add an element larger than all previous

Wait, but in the earlier example for X=5, which is 101 in binary, X-1=4, which is 100 in binary.

But that doesn't match the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that T starts at 1 (empty subsequence).

To reach X, I need to perform a sequence of operations where each operation is either:

- Add an element larger than all previous: T = 2 * T

- Or add an element smaller than all previous: T = T + 1

I need to find a sequence of these operations that starts from T=1 and reaches T=X.

This is similar to the binary representation, where each '0' represents doubling and each '1' represents adding one.

Hence, to find such a sequence, I can look at the binary representation of X and determine the operations accordingly.

Wait, actually, it's similar to the steps used in building X in binary.
