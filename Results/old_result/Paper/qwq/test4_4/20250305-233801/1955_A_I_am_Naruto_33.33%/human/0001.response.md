Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: buy one at a price of a burles or buy two for b burles, thanks to a promotion. I need to figure out the minimum amount of burles he should spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which can be up to 10,000. For each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts under the promotion.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple test cases correctly. The program should process each test case independently and output the result for each one on a separate line.

Now, let's think about how to calculate the minimum cost for each test case.

For each test case, Maxim can choose to buy yogurts either at the single price a or at the promotion price b for two yogurts. He can mix and match these options to buy exactly n yogurts.

I need to find the combination of these options that results in the lowest total cost.

Let me consider a few scenarios to understand the logic better.

Scenario 1: n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

If Maxim buys two yogurts using the promotion, he pays 9 burles.

If he buys two yogurts individually, he pays 5 * 2 = 10 burles.

So, the minimum cost is 9 burles.

Scenario 2: n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

Option 1: Buy one pair using the promotion (2 yogurts for 9 burles) and one individually (1 yogurt for 5 burles), total cost = 9 + 5 = 14 burles.

Option 2: Buy all three individually, total cost = 5 * 3 = 15 burles.

Option 3: Buy one promotion and then consider the remaining yogurt.

But since promotions are only for pairs, I can't use the promotion for a single yogurt.

So, the minimum cost is 14 burles.

Scenario 3: n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

Option 1: Buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 11 burles) and one individually (1 yogurt for 5 burles), total cost = 11 + 5 = 16 burles.

Option 2: Buy all three individually, total cost = 5 * 3 = 15 burles.

Wait, according to the note, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than using the promotion.

But according to my calculation, buying all three individually costs 15 burles, which is less than using the promotion once and buying one individually for 16 burles.

So, the minimum cost is 15 burles.

Wait, but in the example output for this case, it's 15, which matches buying all individually.

So, the promotion might not always be beneficial if b is not less than 2*a.

In other words, if b < 2*a, then it's better to buy in pairs using the promotion, otherwise, it's better to buy individually.

But in the third scenario, b = 11, which is less than 2*a = 10, wait, 2*5=10, so b=11 is greater than 2*a.

Hence, it's cheaper to buy individually.

Wait, but in the second scenario, b=9 which is less than 2*a=10, so it's better to use the promotion.

Wait, but in the third scenario, b=11 which is greater than 2*a=10, so it's better to buy individually.

But in the second scenario, even though b=9 < 2*a=10, it's still better to use the promotion for a pair and buy the remaining one individually.

Wait, but in the second scenario, using the promotion once and buying one individually costs 9+5=14, whereas buying all three individually costs 15, which is higher.

So, in this case, it's still better to use the promotion even if b < 2*a.

Wait, but in the third scenario, b=11 > 2*a=10, so buying individually is cheaper.

Wait, but in the third scenario, buying all individually costs 15, while using the promotion once and buying one individually costs 11+5=16, which is higher.

Hence, buying all individually is better.

Wait, but according to the note, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles, which is buying individually.

So, in cases where b >= 2*a, it's better to buy individually.

In cases where b < 2*a, it's better to use the promotion as much as possible.

But, I need to generalize this logic.

Let me think in terms of how many pairs Maxim can buy using the promotion and how many yogurts he needs to buy individually.

For n yogurts:

- The number of pairs he can buy is n // 2.

- The remaining yogurts are n % 2.

So, the total cost would be (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a.

But, he can choose to buy fewer pairs and more individual yogurts.

So, I need to consider both options:

1. Buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion and buy the remaining individually.

2. Buy all yogurts individually.

Then, choose the minimum between these two options.

Wait, but in some cases, it might be cheaper to buy fewer pairs and more individually.

For example, if b is slightly less than 2*a, but not significantly, and n is odd, it might be better to buy one less pair and buy three individually or something.

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me calculate the cost per yogurt for the promotion.

Cost per yogurt in promotion is b / 2.

If b / 2 < a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible.

If b / 2 >= a, then it's better to buy individually.

But, in the third scenario, b=11, a=5, b/2=5.5 which is greater than a=5, so buy individually.

In the second scenario, b=9, a=5, b/2=4.5 which is less than a=5, so buy as many pairs as possible and buy remaining individually.

Wait, but in the third scenario, according to this logic, b/2=5.5 > a=5, so buy all individually.

Which matches the example output of 15.

In the second scenario, b/2=4.5 < a=5, so buy as many pairs as possible: one pair for 9 burles, and one individually for 5 burles, total 14.

Which also matches the example.

So, this seems a good approach.

Generalize it:

- If b / 2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion, and buy the remaining yogurts individually.

- If b / 2 >= a, then buying individually is better than using the promotion, so buy all yogurts individually.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n > 1:

ans1 = a * n

ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)

print(min(ans1, ans2))

else:

print(a)

So, it's processing t test cases, reading n, a, b for each.

Then, if n > 1:

- Calculate ans1 = a * n (buying all individually)

- Calculate ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2) (buying as many pairs as possible and remaining individually)

- Print the minimum of ans1 and ans2

Else, if n == 1:

- Simply print a, since he can't buy a pair.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the examples.

First test case:

n=2, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5*2 = 10

ans2 = 9*(2//2) + 5*(0) = 9*1 + 0 = 9

min(10,9) = 9

Matches the example.

Second test case:

n=3, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5*3 = 15

ans2 = 9*(3//2) + 5*(1) = 9*1 + 5*1 = 14

min(15,14)=14

Matches the example.

Third test case:

n=3, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5*3 = 15

ans2 = 11*(3//2) + 5*(1) = 11*1 + 5*1 = 16

min(15,16)=15

Matches the example.

Fourth test case:

n=4, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5*4 = 20

ans2 = 11*(4//2) + 5*(0) = 11*2 + 0 = 22

min(20,22)=20

Which matches the note's suggestion of buying each yogurt individually for 5 burles each, total 20 burles.

Seems correct.

Now, let me think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, a=10, b=15

Since n=1, the program will directly print a=10.

Which is correct, since he can't buy a pair.

Edge case 2: n=2, a=6, b=10

ans1 = 6*2 = 12

ans2 = 10*1 + 0 = 10

min(12,10)=10

Which is correct.

Edge case 3: n=4, a=3, b=5

ans1 = 3*4 = 12

ans2 = 5*2 + 0 = 10

min(12,10)=10

Which is better to buy two pairs using the promotion.

Edge case 4: n=5, a=3, b=5

ans1 = 3*5 = 15

ans2 = 5*2 + 3*1 = 10 + 3 = 13

min(15,13)=13

Which is correct.

Edge case 5: n=5, a=4, b=7

ans1 = 4*5 = 20

ans2 = 7*2 + 4*1 = 14 + 4 = 18

min(20,18)=18

Correct.

Edge case 6: n=6, a=2, b=4

ans1 = 2*6 = 12

ans2 = 4*3 + 0 = 12

min(12,12)=12

Correct.

Edge case 7: n=6, a=2, b=3

ans1 = 2*6 = 12

ans2 = 3*3 + 0 = 9

min(12,9)=9

Which is better to buy three pairs using the promotion.

Edge case 8: n=7, a=2, b=3

ans1 = 2*7 = 14

ans2 = 3*3 + 2*1 = 9 + 2 = 11

min(14,11)=11

Correct.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

Now, let's think about the constraints.

n can be up to 100, and t can be up to 10,000.

The operations inside the loop are simple arithmetic operations, which are O(1).

So, the total time complexity is O(t), which with t=10,000 should be acceptable.

No performance issues expected.

Also, the program reads inputs using input() which is standard.

It uses a function func() which is called implicitly, assuming it's being called somewhere in the actual code.

Overall, the program seems correct and efficient.

Hence, my conclusion is that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
