Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim needs to spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which indicates how many scenarios we need to evaluate. For each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b. Here, n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the regular price per yogurt, and b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

I need to consider that for each test case, I should calculate the minimum cost based on these values. The output should be the minimum cost for each test case on separate lines.

Let me think about how to approach this problem. The key is to decide whether it's more advantageous to buy yogurts individually or in pairs using the promotional price.

First, I should consider that if n is 1, there's no choice; he has to buy it individually at price a.

For n greater than 1, I need to consider both options:

1. Buying all yogurts individually, which would cost a * n.

2. Buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price b, and if there's an odd yogurt, buying it individually.

But I need to be careful here. It might be possible that buying pairs at price b is cheaper than buying two individually at price a, but sometimes, even if b is less than 2a, it might be better to buy individually in certain scenarios, especially when n is odd.

Wait, actually, if b is less than 2a, it's always better to buy in pairs because buying two yogurts at price b is cheaper than buying them individually at 2a. If b is greater than or equal to 2a, it's better to buy individually.

But when n is odd, say n=3, I can either buy one pair at price b and one individual at price a, or buy all three individually.

Wait, but in the example given, for n=3, a=5, b=11, the output is 15, which is 3*a. But according to my previous thought, buying one pair at b=11 and one individual at a=5 would total 16, which is more than 3*a=15. So in this case, it's better to buy all individually.

But in another test case, n=3, a=5, b=9, the output is 14, which is b + a = 9 + 5 = 14. Here, b + a is less than 3*a, so it's better to buy one pair at b and one individual at a.

So, the general approach should be:

- Calculate the number of pairs we can buy: n // 2.

- Calculate the remaining individual yogurts: n % 2.

- Then, the total cost would be (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a.

But, we also need to consider that sometimes buying all individually might be cheaper, especially when b is not significantly less than 2a.

Wait, in the example where n=3, a=5, b=11, buying one pair at 11 and one individual at 5 would total 16, which is more than buying all three individually at 15. So, in this case, we should buy all individually.

Similarly, in the case where n=3, a=5, b=9, buying one pair at 9 and one individual at 5 totals 14, which is less than buying all three individually at 15.

So, we need to consider both options and choose the minimum.

Wait, but in the program given, it seems to do something similar.

Let me look at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n > 1:

ans1 = a * n

ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)

print(min(ans1, ans2))

else:

print(a)

So, in this code, for n > 1, it calculates two values:

- ans1: a * n, which is the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

- ans2: b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2), which is the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at price b and any remaining individual yogurt at price a.

Then, it prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.

For n = 1, it simply prints a, which makes sense because there's no pair to buy.

This seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.

But let's verify it with the example given.

First test case:

n=2, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5*2 = 10

ans2 = 9*(2//2) + 5*(0) = 9*1 + 0 = 9

min(10, 9) = 9

Which matches the example output.

Second test case:

n=3, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5*3 = 15

ans2 = 9*(3//2) + 5*(1) = 9*1 + 5*1 = 14

min(15, 14) = 14

Which matches the example.

Third test case:

n=3, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5*3 = 15

ans2 = 11*(3//2) + 5*(1) = 11*1 + 5*1 = 16

min(15, 16) = 15

Which matches the example.

Fourth test case:

n=4, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5*4 = 20

ans2 = 11*(4//2) + 5*(0) = 11*2 + 0 = 22

min(20, 22) = 20

Which matches the example.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to be working correctly.

Let me think if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Consider n=1, which the program handles by just printing a, which is correct.

n=0 is not possible since n >=1 as per the problem constraints.

What if n is even?

For example, n=4, a=5, b=20.

ans1 = 20

ans2 = 20*(4//2) + 5*(0) = 20*2 + 0 = 40

min(20,40)=20

Which is correct, as buying individually is cheaper than buying pairs.

Another case: n=5, a=3, b=5.

ans1 = 15

ans2 = 5*(5//2) + 3*(1) =5*2 +3=13

min(15,13)=13

Which seems correct.

Wait, but is there a scenario where buying pairs is worse than buying individually, and the program correctly chooses the individual purchase?

Yes, as in the earlier example where b is higher than 2a.

For example, n=2, a=5, b=12.

ans1=10

ans2=12

min(10,12)=10

Which is correct.

Seems like the program handles this correctly.

Is there any case where this logic fails?

Let me think about n=0, but as per constraints, n >=1, so no need to worry about that.

What if n is very large, like n=100, but per constraints, n <=100, and since t can be up to 10^4, but n is up to 100, which is manageable.

The operations are simple arithmetic, so no performance issues.

I think the program is correct.

Wait, in the code, there's a condition: if n >1:

But what if n=1?

As per the code, it will go to the else clause and print a, which is correct.

So, all cases seem to be handled correctly.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}\]
