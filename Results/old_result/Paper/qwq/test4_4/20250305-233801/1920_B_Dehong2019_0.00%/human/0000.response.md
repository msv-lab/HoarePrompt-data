Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants the sum to be as large as possible, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Wait, but Bob gets to flip some signs after that, so maybe it's not that straightforward.

Then Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. He wants to minimize the sum, so he'll try to make the positive elements negative or keep the negative elements negative, I guess.

I need to think about how their actions interact. Alice removes some elements, and then Bob acts on the remaining array.

Let me consider the array sorted in descending order. That might make it easier to decide which elements to remove or flip.

Suppose the array is sorted in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Alice can remove up to k elements from the start, meaning she can remove the largest elements if she wants to, but that wouldn't make sense because she wants to maximize the sum. So she should remove the smallest elements, which are at the end of the sorted array.

Wait, but if she removes the smallest elements, that would leave larger elements for Bob to potentially make negative. So maybe she needs to consider what Bob will do next.

Bob, wanting to minimize the sum, will choose to flip the largest positive elements to negative, up to x elements.

So, Alice needs to think ahead and consider that Bob will flip the largest elements after she removes some.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice maximizes the sum considering that Bob will minimize it.

Let me try to think of a strategy.

First, sort the array in descending order.

Alice can choose to remove any up to k elements. After that, Bob can choose to flip up to x elements from the remaining array.

To maximize the sum, Alice should remove the elements that Bob would most likely flip to minimize the sum.

Wait, Bob wants to minimize the sum by flipping up to x elements. So, if Alice can prevent Bob from flipping the largest positive elements, that would be best for Alice.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that Bob would want to flip, which are the largest positive elements.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. If Alice removes the largest elements, that would directly reduce the sum, which is not what she wants.

Wait, no. Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's moves. So, she needs to leave a array such that, even after Bob flips up to x elements, the sum is as large as possible.

So, it's like Alice is trying to maximize the sum minus the maximum decrease Bob can inflict by flipping up to x elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of choosing which elements to keep, and then considering the worst-case scenario for flipping.

Let's say Alice removes k elements, so n - k elements remain.

Bob can then flip up to x of those remaining elements to negative.

I need to choose which k elements to remove such that, after Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements, the sum is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

If k = 0, Alice can't remove any elements. So, Bob can flip up to x elements to minimize the sum.

If x = 0, Bob can't flip any elements. So, the sum is just the sum of the array after Alice removes up to k elements.

If k >= n, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum is 0.

If x >= n - k, Bob can flip all remaining elements after Alice's removal.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selecting the elements to keep.

Alice is effectively choosing n - k elements to keep.

Then, Bob will flip up to x of those elements to negative.

So, Alice needs to choose n - k elements such that, after Bob flips up to x of them to negative, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like selecting n - k elements, and then Bob will flip the x largest among them to negative.

Because that would minimize the sum.

So, Alice needs to minimize the impact of Bob flipping the x largest elements.

So, perhaps Alice should choose to keep the elements such that the x largest among them are as small as possible.

Wait, that might be one way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to sort the array, and then consider different possibilities.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Alice can choose to remove k elements from the end, so she keeps n - k elements.

Bob will then flip the first x of the remaining elements to negative.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll flip the x largest elements among the remaining ones.

So, if Alice keeps the top n - k elements, Bob will flip the top x of them to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of elements from position k+1 to n, minus twice the sum of the first x of them.

Wait, no. If Bob flips the first x elements to negative, the sum would be:

sum from i=k+1 to n, minus 2 * sum from i=k+1 to k+x.

Wait, but indices might overlap.

Wait, let's think carefully.

After Alice removes k elements from the end, the remaining elements are a1 to a_{n-k}.

Bob will flip up to x of them to negative. To minimize the sum, he'll flip the x largest among them, which are a1 to ax.

So, the sum would be:

sum from i=k+1 to n minus 2 * sum from i=k+1 to k+x.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes k elements from the end, the remaining elements are a1 to a_{n-k}.

Bob will flip up to x of them to negative. To minimize the sum, he'll flip the x largest, which are a1 to ax.

So, the sum would be:

sum from i=k+1 to n minus 2 * sum from i=k+1 to k+x.

Wait, but k+x might exceed n - k.

Wait, let's adjust the indices.

Sum after Alice's removal: sum from i=1 to n - k.

Bob flips up to x of them to negative. To minimize the sum, he'll flip the x largest, which are a1 to ax.

So, the sum becomes:

sum from i=1 to n - k minus 2 * sum from i=1 to x.

So, the final sum is:

sum from i=x+1 to n - k plus sum from i=1 to x minus sum from i=1 to x.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum after flipping x largest is:

sum from i=1 to n - k minus 2 * sum from i=1 to x.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the sum is:

sum from i=1 to n - k minus 2 * sum from i=1 to x.

So, to maximize this, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove.

Wait, but in this scenario, Alice is removing the smallest elements, i.e., the last k elements.

So, by removing the smallest elements, she's leaving the largest elements for Bob.

Then, Bob flips the x largest among the remaining to negative.

So, in this strategy, Alice removes the smallest k elements, and Bob flips the largest x of the remaining elements to negative.

Is there a better strategy for Alice?

Alternatively, maybe Alice should remove some of the elements that Bob would flip.

For example, if Alice removes some of the largest elements, then Bob has fewer large elements to flip.

But that would reduce the sum directly, which is not desirable.

Wait, let's consider an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: 3,1,2,4

Sorted: 4,3,2,1

Alice can remove 1 element from the end, so removes 1, leaving 4,3,2.

Bob flips up to 1 element to negative. He'll flip the largest, which is 4, to -4.

Sum: -4 + 3 + 2 = 1.

But in the note, it says the sum is 2.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the note, for the second test case, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

So, in this case, Alice chooses not to remove any elements, even though she could remove up to 1.

So, apparently, in some cases, it's better for Alice not to remove any elements.

So, my previous assumption that Alice should always remove the smallest k elements might not hold.

So, perhaps Alice needs to consider whether removing some elements would allow Bob to flip fewer large positive elements.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider different scenarios.

Let's consider that Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

She needs to choose which k elements to remove such that after Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice maximizes the minimum sum achievable by Bob.

To solve this, perhaps I can consider the sum after Alice's removal and subtract twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, but I need to consider that if Alice removes some elements, those elements are not available for Bob to flip.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting n - k elements to keep, and then Bob flips up to x of them to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice should choose the set of n - k elements such that the sum of those elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them is maximized.

This is a bit tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over the possible number of elements Alice removes, from 0 to k, and for each, calculate the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

Then, choose the option that gives the maximum sum.

But iterating up to k might be too slow if n and k are large.

Wait, but n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, so I need an efficient solution.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and Bob flips up to x elements from the remaining.

I can think of the sum as the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements that Bob flips.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the elements after Alice's removal.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of the remaining n - k elements minus twice the sum of the top x remaining elements.

Alternatively, perhaps Alice should remove some of the elements that Bob would flip.

For example, if Alice removes some of the largest elements, then Bob has fewer large elements to flip.

But removing large elements directly reduces the sum.

So, it's a trade-off.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the sum after both operations.

Let me consider all possible choices Alice can make, and for each, compute the sum after Bob optimally flips up to x elements.

Then, choose the maximum among these sums.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the sorted array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Alice can choose any k elements to remove.

To maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that would cause Bob to flip the smallest possible elements.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that Bob will always flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice should minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Therefore, Alice should remove some of the largest elements to minimize the sum of the remaining x largest elements.

Wait, but removing the largest elements directly reduces the sum.

So, it's a trade-off between reducing the sum by removing large elements and reducing the impact of Bob flipping the largest remaining elements.

This is tricky.

Maybe I need to consider different cases based on the relationship between k and x.

Case 1: k >= x

In this case, Alice can remove up to k elements, which is at least x.

So, perhaps Alice can remove the x largest elements, so that Bob has no elements to flip.

Wait, but if Alice removes the x largest elements, then Bob has no elements to flip, and the sum is just the sum of the remaining n - k elements.

But removing the x largest elements means that Bob can't flip them, but Alice is also reducing the sum by removing large positive elements.

Wait, perhaps it's better for Alice to remove the smallest k elements, so that the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements, and then Bob flips the x largest among them to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of the top n - k elements minus twice the sum of the top x of them.

Alternatively, perhaps Alice can remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but that would reduce the sum directly.

I need to find a balance.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Alice removes the elements that Bob would flip, i.e., the top x elements, and then removes the smallest elements to reach k removals.

Wait, but if k >= x, Alice can remove the top x elements and then remove the smallest k - x elements.

Then, Bob can't flip any elements because he can only flip up to x, but the top x elements are already removed.

Wait, no, Bob can flip up to x elements from the remaining elements.

So, if Alice removes the top x elements, then Bob will flip the next x largest elements to negative.

Wait, but k might be larger than x.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose k >= x.

Alice can remove up to k elements.

To maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x remaining elements, Alice should remove the x elements that Bob would flip, which are the top x elements, and then remove the smallest k - x elements.

But removing the top x elements reduces the sum by their value, but prevents Bob from flipping them.

So, the sum would be sum of elements from x+1 to n - (k - x) - 2 * sum of elements from k - x + 1 to k - x + x.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the sum after Alice's removal and Bob's flipping.

Suppose Alice removes k elements.

Let's say she removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob flips the top x of the remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum is sum of elements from k+1 to n minus 2 * sum of elements from k+1 to k + x.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining elements are from 1 to n - k.

Bob flips the top x of them to negative, which are elements from 1 to x.

So, the sum is sum from x+1 to n - k plus sum from 1 to x minus 2 * sum from 1 to x.

Which is sum from x+1 to n - k minus sum from 1 to x.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, no.

Original sum of remaining elements: sum from 1 to n - k.

After flipping the top x: sum from x+1 to n - k plus (sum from 1 to x minus 2 * sum from 1 to x) = sum from x+1 to n - k minus sum from 1 to x.

So, total sum is sum from x+1 to n - k minus sum from 1 to x.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, if Bob flips the top x elements to negative, then the sum becomes:

sum from k+1 to n minus 2 * sum from k+1 to k + x.

Wait, indices are confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements.

Then, Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to maximize the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

So, perhaps Alice should choose to remove the elements such that the x largest remaining elements are as small as possible.

This way, the impact of Bob flipping them is minimized.

So, to achieve this, Alice should remove the largest x elements, so that the remaining elements have smaller values.

Wait, but removing the largest elements directly reduces the sum.

So, it's a trade-off.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that Alice should remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Suppose Alice removes k elements.

Then, Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice needs to maximize the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

So, she needs to maximize sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x_remaining.

Let's denote s = sum from 1 to n - k.

t = sum from 1 to x.

So, the sum after Bob's flip is s - 2t.

Alice needs to maximize s - 2t.

Now, s is the sum of the top n - k elements.

t is the sum of the top x of them.

So, for a given k, s - 2t = sum from x+1 to n - k minus sum from 1 to x.

Wait, no.

Wait, s = sum from 1 to n - k.

t = sum from 1 to x.

So, s - 2t = sum from x+1 to n - k minus sum from 1 to x.

Yes.

So, s - 2t = sum from x+1 to n - k - sum from 1 to x.

To maximize this, Alice needs to maximize sum from x+1 to n - k - sum from 1 to x.

Now, sum from x+1 to n - k is fixed for a given k.

And sum from 1 to x is also fixed.

So, for a given k, s - 2t is fixed.

Wait, but I need to choose k to maximize s - 2t.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, Alice can choose which k elements to remove, not necessarily the smallest or largest.

So, it's not necessarily about choosing the top n - k elements.

She can choose any k elements to remove.

So, perhaps she shouldn't always remove the smallest k elements.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a different strategy.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any k elements to remove.

Then, Bob will flip up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove such that after Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative, the sum is maximized.

This seems like a difficult optimization problem.

Maybe I can consider the elements in a certain order.

Let me think about the elements being sorted in descending order.

Suppose I have the array sorted in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Now, Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

But perhaps it's best for her to remove the elements that would allow Bob to flip the smallest possible elements.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that Alice removes the smallest k elements, i.e., a_{n - k + 1} to a_n.

Then, Bob flips the top x remaining elements, which are a1 to ax.

So, the sum is sum from a_{k + 1} to a_n minus 2 * sum from a1 to ax.

Alternatively, perhaps Alice can remove some of the top x elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but that would reduce the sum directly.

Wait, maybe I can consider different values of k' = number of elements Alice removes from the top.

So, Alice can choose to remove m elements from the top and k - m elements from the bottom.

Then, the remaining elements would be a_{m + 1} to a_{n - (k - m)}.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes m top elements and k - m bottom elements, the remaining elements are a_{m + 1} to a_{n - (k - m)}.

Then, Bob flips the top x of the remaining elements to negative.

So, the top x of the remaining are a_{m + 1} to a_{m + x}.

So, the sum would be sum from a_{m + 1} to a_{n - (k - m)} minus 2 * sum from a_{m + 1} to a_{m + x}.

Alice needs to choose m between 0 and k to maximize this sum.

Wait, but m can't exceed k and n - k.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to iterate over m from 0 to k and choose the one that maximizes the sum.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, this would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the optimal strategy is for Alice to remove the smallest k elements, and then Bob flips the largest x remaining elements to negative.

But as the second test case shows, sometimes it's better for Alice not to remove any elements.

So, perhaps I need to consider both options and choose the best one.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove elements in such a way that the difference between sum_remaining and 2 * sum of the top x remaining elements is maximized.

Wait, I need to maximize sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x_remaining.

So, perhaps I can iterate through possible numbers of elements to remove from the bottom and calculate the corresponding sum.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided code and see what approach it's taking.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)

ans1 = sum(a)

for i in range(x):

ans1 -= a[i] * 2

ans2 = ans1

for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans = max(ans1, ans2)

print(ans)

So, let's understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, k, x, and the array a.

It sorts a in descending order.

Then, it initializes ans1 to the sum of all elements.

Then, it subtracts 2 * a[i] for the first x elements. So, ans1 becomes sum(a) - 2 * sum(first x elements).

Then, it sets ans2 to ans1.

Then, it enters a loop over i from 0 to k - 1.

In each iteration, it adds a[i] to ans1.

If i + x < n, it subtracts 2 * a[i + x].

Then, it sets ans to the max of ans1 and ans2.

Finally, it prints ans.

So, what is this doing?

It seems to be considering removing elements from the end and adjusting the sum accordingly.

Wait, initially, ans1 is sum(a) - 2 * sum(first x elements).

Then, in the loop, for each i from 0 to k - 1, it adds a[i] and subtracts 2 * a[i + x], if i + x < n.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, initially, ans1 is sum(a) - 2 * sum(a[0] to a[x-1]).

Then, in the loop, for each i from 0 to k - 1:

ans1 += a[i] - 2 * a[i + x] if i + x < n.

Wait, a[i] is being added back, which suggests that it's considering removing elements from the end.

Wait, but a is sorted in descending order, so a[0] is the largest.

Wait, perhaps it's considering removing elements from the end, which are the smallest.

So, initially, ans1 is sum(a) - 2 * sum of the top x elements.

Then, for each i from 0 to k - 1, it adds a[i] (which are the largest elements) and subtracts 2 * a[i + x].

Wait, this seems confused.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to simulate removing k elements from the end and adjusting the sum accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to see with the second test case.

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [4,3,2,1] sorted descending.

ans1 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10

subtract 2 * 4 = 8, so ans1 = 10 - 8 = 2

ans2 = 2

Then, loop for i=0 to 0 (since k=1)

ans1 += a[0] = 4

if 0 + 1 =1 < 4, subtract 2 * a[1] = 6

so ans1 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0

then ans = max(0, 2) = 2

Which matches the note.

Another test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

sorted descending: [1]

ans1 = 1 - 2*1 = -1

ans2 = -1

loop for i=0 to 0 (k=1)

ans1 += 1

if 0 +1=1 <1? no, since n=1

so ans1 = -1 +1 =0

ans = max(0, -1) =0

Which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[6,5,4,3,2,1] sorted descending.

ans1 = 21 - 2*(6+5+4)=21-2*15=21-30=-9

ans2=-9

Then loop for i=0 to 5:

i=0: ans1 +=6, if 0+3=3 <6, subtract 2*a[3]=6, so ans1=-9+6-6=-9

i=1: ans1 +=5, if 1+3=4 <6, subtract 2*a[4]=4, ans1=-9+5-4=-8

i=2: ans1 +=4, if 2+3=5 <6, subtract 2*a[5]=2, ans1=-8+4-2=0

i=3: ans1 +=3, if 3+3=6 <6? no, so ans1=0+3=3

i=4: ans1 +=2, no subtraction, ans1=3+2=5

i=5: ans1 +=1, no subtraction, ans1=5+1=6

Then ans = max(6, -9)=6

But according to the note, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but according to the note, for the third test case (6 6 3), output is 0.

But according to this code, it's giving 6.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the loop, it's adding a[i] and subtracting 2*a[i+x] if i+x <n.

Wait, in the third test case, k=6, n=6.

So, loop from i=0 to 5:

i=0: ans1 +=6, if 0+3=3 <6, subtract 2*3=6, so ans1=-9+6-6=-9

i=1: ans1 +=5, if 1+3=4 <6, subtract 2*2=4, ans1=-9+5-4=-8

i=2: ans1 +=4, if 2+3=5 <6, subtract 2*1=2, ans1=-8+4-2=0

i=3: ans1 +=3, if 3+3=6 <6? no, so ans1=0+3=3

i=4: ans1 +=2, no subtraction, ans1=3+2=5

i=5: ans1 +=1, no subtraction, ans1=5+1=6

Then ans = max(6, -9)=6

But according to the note, the answer should be 0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the note, for the fifth test case (8 5 3), output is -5.

According to the code:

n=8, k=5, x=3

a=sorted descending: [9,9,5,5,3,3,2,3]

sum(a)=3+5+9=28

ans1=28 - 2*(9+9+5)=28-32=-4

ans2=-4

Then loop for i=0 to 4:

i=0: ans1 +=9, if 0+3=3 <8, subtract 2*5=10, ans1=-4+9-10=-5

i=1: ans1 +=9, if 1+3=4 <8, subtract 2*5=10, ans1=-5+9-10=-6

i=2: ans1 +=5, if 2+3=5 <8, subtract 2*3=6, ans1=-6+5-6=-7

i=3: ans1 +=5, if 3+3=6 <8, subtract 2*3=6, ans1=-7+5-6=-8

i=4: ans1 +=3, if 4+3=7 <8, subtract 2*2=4, ans1=-8+3-4=-9

Then ans = max(-9, -4)=-4

But according to the note, the answer is -5.

So, the code is giving -4, but the note says -5.

Wait, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the note.

Wait, in the fifth test case, according to the note:

"it is optimal for Alice to remove 9,9. Bob will then multiply 5,5,3 by -1. So the final sum is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5."

So, Alice removes two 9's, leaving [5,5,3,3,2,3].

Bob flips the top three to negative, which are 5,5,3.

So, the sum is -5 -5 -3 +3 +3 +2 = -5.

But according to the code, with k=5, it's removing five elements, which might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I interpret k and x.

Wait, in the code, it seems to be considering removing up to k elements, but perhaps not optimally.

I think the code is incorrect because in the third test case, it's giving 6, but the note says 0.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, it's giving -4, but the note says -5.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sum of the array after Alice removes up to \( k \) elements and Bob multiplies up to \( x \) elements by -1, with both players playing optimally.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read \( n \), \( k \), \( x \), and the array \( a \).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sort the array in descending order to easily manage the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of the entire array.

4. **Adjusting for Bob's Moves:**
   - Subtract twice the sum of the first \( x \) elements (since Bob can flip up to \( x \) elements to negative).

5. **Simulate Alice's Removals:**
   - For each possible number of elements Alice removes (from 0 to \( k \)):
     - Add back the elements Alice removes (since they were initially included in the sum).
     - Subtract twice the next \( x \) elements that Bob can flip.
     - Track the maximum sum encountered.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the maximum sum obtained for each test case.

## Explanation

- **Initial Sum Calculation:** Start with the sum of the entire array.
- **Bob's Impact:** Subtract twice the sum of the top \( x \) elements since Bob can flip them to negative.
- **Alice's Removals:** Simulate removing up to \( k \) elements from the sorted array and adjust the sum accordingly by adding back the removed elements and considering Bob's potential flips on the new set of top elements.
- **Optimal Sum:** Track and select the maximum sum obtained from all possible removals up to \( k \) elements.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally, with Alice maximizing the sum after her removals and Bob minimizing it by flipping the most significant elements available to him.
