Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a permutation of length n, and I have the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. I need to find out how many different permutations could have these specific prefix and suffix maximum indices. The answer should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. A prefix maximum at position i means that the element at i is greater than all elements before it. Similarly, a suffix maximum at position i means that the element at i is greater than all elements after it.

So, given the indices of these prefix and suffix maximums, I need to figure out how many permutations satisfy these conditions.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the second test case:

n = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = 3

prefix maximum indices: 1, 2

suffix maximum indices: 2, 3, 4

The suitable permutations are:

[1, 4, 3, 2]

[2, 4, 3, 1]

[3, 4, 2, 1]

So, there are 3 possible permutations that fit the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Looking at these permutations, I can see that in all of them, the element at position 1 is a prefix maximum, and the element at position 2 is also a prefix maximum. For suffix maximums, positions 2, 3, and 4 are suffix maximums.

I need to find a general way to calculate the number of such permutations for any given n, m1, m2, and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Let me think about the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.

For prefix maximums, since they are in increasing order of their indices, the values at these positions must be greater than all previous elements. Similarly, for suffix maximums, the values at these positions must be greater than all subsequent elements.

Also, the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum should be the same, because they both represent the maximum element in the array. In the example, both lists include index 2, which must be the position of the maximum element in the permutation.

Wait, in the second test case, the prefix maximum indices are 1 and 2, and suffix maximum indices are 2, 3, and 4. So, position 2 is both a prefix and suffix maximum, which makes sense because it's the position of the maximum element.

So, a key point is that the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same and represent the position of the maximum element in the permutation.

In the third test case:

n = 3, m1 = 3, m2 = 1

prefix maximum indices: 1, 2, 3

suffix maximum indices: 3

So, all positions are prefix maximums, and only position 3 is a suffix maximum.

The only suitable permutation is [1, 2, 3], which makes sense because in this permutation, every position is a prefix maximum (since each element is greater than all previous elements), and position 3 is a suffix maximum.

Wait, but in [1, 2, 3], position 3 is a suffix maximum because 3 is greater than all elements after it (there are none), and positions 1 and 2 are prefix maximums.

Another point: in a permutation, the maximum element must be a prefix and suffix maximum because it's greater than all other elements.

So, the position of the maximum element must be both a prefix and suffix maximum.

Looking back at the input format, it's guaranteed that the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices are given in increasing order.

So, in the input, L is the list of prefix maximum indices in increasing order, and S is the list of suffix maximum indices in increasing order.

Given that, I need to ensure that the last element of L and the first element of S are the same, because they both represent the position of the maximum element.

If they are not the same, then there's no valid permutation, so the answer is 0.

Similarly, if L[0] !=1 or S[-1] !=n, that might indicate an invalid configuration, but in the example, S is given in increasing order, so S[-1] is the last suffix maximum, which should be less than or equal to n.

Wait, in the input, S is given in increasing order, so S[-1] is the largest index that's a suffix maximum.

But in the problem statement, it says S is given in increasing order, so S[1] is the second smallest suffix maximum index, and so on.

Wait, in the second test case, S is [2,3,4], which is correct.

In the third test case, S is [3].

So, to summarize:

- L is the list of prefix maximum indices in increasing order.

- S is the list of suffix maximum indices in increasing order.

First, I need to check if L[-1] == S[0], because both should be the position of the maximum element.

If not, return 0.

Also, check if L[0] ==1 and S[-1] ==n, because the first element should be a prefix maximum and the last element should be a suffix maximum.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the first line of each test case contains three integers n, m1, and m2 (1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively."

Then, the second line contains m1 integers p1 < p2 < … < pm1 (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order.

Similarly, the third line contains m2 integers s1 < s2 < … < sm2 (1 ≤ si ≤ n) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order.

So, L = [p1, p2, ..., pm1]

S = [s1, s2, ..., sm2]

All pi and si are distinct and within 1 to n, and sorted in increasing order.

So, L and S are sorted in increasing order.

Now, in the permutation, the maximum element must be at the position that is both a prefix and suffix maximum.

Hence, L[-1] should be equal to S[0].

If not, it's impossible, so return 0.

Also, in a permutation, the first element is always a prefix maximum, and the last element is always a suffix maximum.

Hence, L should start with 1, and S should end with n.

If not, return 0.

Wait, in the second test case, L = [1,2], S=[2,3,4], n=4.

L[0]=1, S[-1]=4.

So, it's okay.

In the third test case, L=[1,2,3], S=[3], n=3.

L[0]=1, S[-1]=3, which is fine.

In the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], S=[2,3,4,5], n=5.

L[-1]=3, S[0]=2.

Since L[-1] != S[0], return 0, which matches the sample output of 0 for that case.

So, that seems correct.

Now, assuming that L[-1] == S[0], and L[0]==1, S[-1]==n, I need to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.

How to approach this?

I need to assign values to each position in the permutation, ensuring that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are met.

First, assign the maximum value to the position that is both L[-1] and S[0].

Then, assign the remaining values in a way that satisfies the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

Let me think about the structure of the permutation.

Consider splitting the permutation into segments based on the prefix and suffix maximum indices.

For example, in the second test case:

n=4, L=[1,2], S=[2,3,4]

So, position 2 is both a prefix and suffix maximum, meaning it's the maximum value in the permutation.

So, let's assign 4 to position 2.

Now, positions 1 and 2 are prefix maximums, so position 1 must be less than position 2.

Position 3 and 4 are suffix maximums, so position 3 must be greater than position 4.

Also, position 2 is greater than all previous and all subsequent elements.

So, position 1 < position 2, position 3 < position 2, position 4 < position 3.

Wait, position 3 is a suffix maximum, meaning position 3 > position 4.

But position 3 is not a prefix maximum beyond position 2, so position 3 < position 2.

So, position 3 < position 2, and position 4 < position 3.

Hence, position 4 < position 3 < position 2.

Position 1 < position 2.

So, position 1 can be any value less than position 2, and position 3 and 4 are ordered such that position 3 > position 4, and both are less than position 2.

Given that, the possible permutations are:

[1,4,3,2]

[2,4,3,1]

[3,4,2,1]

So, 3 possible permutations.

How to generalize this?

I need to figure out a way to count the number of ways to assign values to the positions, given the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

One way to think about it is to consider the positions between the prefix and suffix maximums.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing values for the prefix and suffix maximums and then assigning the remaining values accordingly.

Alternatively, think about the permutation in terms of blocks where the values are decreasing or increasing based on the maximums.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the positions divided into segments based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Let's consider the permutation divided into segments separated by the prefix and suffix maximums.

In the second test case:

Positions: 1,2,3,4

Prefix maximums: 1,2

Suffix maximums: 2,3,4

So, position 2 is both.

Then, positions 1 and 2 are prefix maximums, and positions 2,3,4 are suffix maximums.

So, position 1 is only a prefix maximum, position 2 is both, positions 3 and 4 are only suffix maximums.

In terms of values:

- Position 2 has the maximum value.

- Position 1 is less than position 2.

- Position 3 is less than position 2 but greater than position 4.

- Position 4 is less than position 3.

So, in this case, the values are:

- Position 2: n=4

- Position 1: x <4

- Position 3: y <4

- Position 4: z < y

Also, since it's a permutation, all values are distinct and from 1 to 4.

So, position 1,3,4 have values from 1,2,3.

Position 1 can be any of 1,2,3.

Position 3 must be greater than position 4.

Position 4 must be less than position 3.

So, for position 1, there are C(3,1) choices.

Then, for positions 3 and 4, there are C(remaining 2,1) choices for position 3, and position 4 gets the last value.

But in the sample, only 3 permutations are valid, which matches C(3,1) * C(1,1) = 3.

Wait, but C(3,1)*C(1,1)=3, which matches the sample.

So, in this case, it's C(N-1, L[-1]-1) * something else.

Wait, in the code, it's ans = math.comb(N-1, L[-1]-1)

Then, it does some adjustments based on M1 and M2.

I need to understand what this comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) represents.

In the second test case, N=4, L[-1]=2, so comb(3,1)=3, which matches the number of valid permutations.

So, perhaps comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) is the number of ways to choose values for positions before the maximum position.

Wait, in this case, N-1=3, L[-1]-1=1, comb(3,1)=3.

So, it's choosing 1 position out of the first 1 positions to place a value less than the maximum.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps it's about choosing which values go before and after the maximum position.

In the second test case, position 2 is the maximum, so positions 1 have values less than 4, and positions 3 and 4 have values less than 4, with position 3 > position 4.

So, need to choose values for positions 1,3,4 from 1,2,3.

Assign the maximum of these to position 3, and the remaining two to positions 1 and 4.

Wait, no.

Wait, positions 1,3,4 need to have values from 1,2,3.

Position 3 must be greater than position 4.

So, for positions 3 and 4, choose two different values from 1,2,3, with position 3 > position 4.

Then, position 1 gets the remaining value.

So, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose two different values for positions 3 and 4, with position 3 > position 4, and position 1 gets the last value.

For positions 3 and 4, the number of ways is C(3,2)=3, and for each choice, there's only one way to assign them such that position 3 > position 4.

Hence, total permutations: 3.

Which matches the sample.

So, in this case, the number of permutations is C(N-1, M1-1), where M1 is the number of prefix maximums.

Wait, no, in this case, M1=2, N=4, C(3,1)=3.

Yes, it matches.

So, perhaps the general formula is C(N-1, L[-1]-1), and then some adjustments based on M1 and M2.

Wait, but in the code, it's ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)

Then, it does some multiplications based on M1 and M2.

I need to understand what this comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) represents.

I think it represents choosing which values are placed before the maximum position, and which are placed after.

In the second test case, N-1=3, L[-1]-1=1, so C(3,1)=3, which corresponds to choosing 1 position out of the first positions to place a value less than the maximum.

Wait, perhaps it's choosing which values are assigned to the positions before the maximum position.

Wait, positions before the maximum position are positions 1 to L[-1]-1.

In this case, L[-1]=2, so position 1.

Positions after the maximum are positions L[-1]+1 to N.

In this case, positions 3 and 4.

So, in the permutation, the values before the maximum position can be any values less than the maximum, and the values after can be any values less than the maximum, but must satisfy the suffix maximum conditions.

So, perhaps comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) chooses which N-1 values (excluding the maximum) are placed before and after the maximum position.

Wait, but N-1=3, L[-1]-1=1, so C(3,1)=3, which matches the sample.

So, it's choosing 1 position before the maximum to place one of the N-1 values.

Wait, perhaps it's choosing which values are placed before the maximum and which are placed after.

But in this case, there's only one position before the maximum, position 1, and two positions after, positions 3 and 4.

So, comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) = C(3,1)=3, which is the number of ways to choose which value goes before the maximum.

Then, the remaining values are placed after the maximum.

In this case, position 1 gets one value from 1,2,3, and positions 3 and 4 get the remaining two values, arranged such that position 3 > position 4.

Hence, the number of permutations is C(3,1)=3, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps in general, comb(N-1, L[-1]-1) gives the number of ways to choose which values are placed before the maximum position.

Then, the remaining values are placed after the maximum position, and arranged according to the suffix maximum conditions.

In the code, after calculating comb(N-1, L[-1]-1), it does some multiplications based on M1 and M2.

I need to understand what these multiplications represent.

Looking at the code:

if M1 >1 and M2>1 and L[-2]==R[1]:

return 0

ans = math.comb(N-1,L[-1]-1)

cur = M1-2

if M1>1:

nums_left = L[-1]-2

i = L[-1]-1

while i>1:

if i==L[cur]:

cur -=1

else:

ans = ans * nums_left % MOD

nums_left -=1

i -=1

nums_left = N - R[0] -1

if M2>1:

cur =1

i = R[0]+1

while i<N:

if i==R[cur]:

cur +=1

else:

ans = ans * nums_left % MOD

nums_left -=1

i +=1

return ans

So, first it checks if M1>1 and M2>1 and L[-2]==R[1], then returns 0.

In the second test case, M1=2, M2=3, L[-2]=1, R[1]=3, so L[-2]!=R[1], so it doesn't return 0.

Then, ans = comb(3,1)=3.

Then, since M1>1, cur = M1-2 =0.

nums_left = L[-1]-2 =0.

i=1.

While i>1: false.

Then, nums_left = N - R[0] -1 =4 -2 -1=1.

Since M2>1, cur=1.

i=3.

While i<4: true.

if i==R[cur]: R[1]=3, so cur=2.

else: pass

nums_left -=1 ->0

i +=1 ->4

While i<4: false.

So, ans=3.

Which matches the sample.

In another test case where answer is 0, like fifth test case, it probably fails the initial check.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n=5, m1=3, m2=4

L=[1,2,3]

R=[2,3,4,5]

So, L[-1]=3, R[0]=2.

Since L[-1]!=R[0], return 0.

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Another test case:

n=20, m1=5, m2=4

L=[1,2,3,4,12]

R=[12,13,18,20]

L[-1]=12, R[0]=12, so proceed.

Then, ans=comb(19,11)

Then, M1=5, M2=4.

cur=3

nums_left=12-2=10

i=12-1=11

While i>1:

i=11

if i==L[3]: L[3]=4, so no

ans *=10 % MOD

nums_left=9

i=10

While i>1:

i=10

if i==L[2]: L[2]=3, no

ans *=9 % MOD

nums_left=8

i=9

While i>1:

i=9

if i==L[1]: L[1]=2, no

ans *=8 % MOD

nums_left=7

i=8

While i>1:

i=8

if i==L[0]: L[0]=1, no

ans *=7 % MOD

nums_left=6

i=7

While i>1:

i=7

if i==L[-1]: L[-1]=1, no

else:

ans *=6 % MOD

nums_left=5

i=6

...

Continues until i>1.

Then, nums_left = 20 -12 -1=7

cur=1

i=12+1=13

While i<20:

i=13

if i==R[1]: R[1]=13, yes, cur=2

else:

ans *= nums_left % MOD

nums_left -=1

i +=1

i=14

if i==R[2]: R[2]=18, no

ans *=6 % MOD

nums_left=5

i=15

if i==R[2]:18,no

ans *=5 % MOD

nums_left=4

i=16

if i==R[2]:18,no

ans *=4 % MOD

nums_left=3

i=17

if i==R[2]:18,no

ans *=3 % MOD

nums_left=2

i=18

if i==R[3]:18,yes, cur=3

else:

ans *=2 % MOD

nums_left=1

i=19

if i==R[3]:18,no

ans *=1 % MOD

nums_left=0

i=20

if i==R[4]: R[4] doesn't exist

else:

ans *=0 % MOD

But R[cur]=R[3]=18, i=20, no

So, ans *=0 % MOD, which makes ans=0

Wait, but in the sample input, the answer for this test case is 317580808, which is not 0.

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if M2>1:

cur=1

i=R[0]+1

while i<N:

if i==R[cur]:

cur +=1

else:

ans = ans * nums_left % MOD

nums_left -=1

i +=1

So, in this case, R[0]=12, R[1]=13, R[2]=18, R[3]=20

So, cur=1, i=13

i=13 == R[1]=13, so cur=2

i=14

i=14 != R[2]=18, so ans *=7 % MOD, nums_left=6, i=15

i=15 != R[2]=18, ans *=6 % MOD, nums_left=5, i=16

i=16 != R[2]=18, ans *=5 % MOD, nums_left=4, i=17

i=17 != R[2]=18, ans *=4 % MOD, nums_left=3, i=18

i=18 == R[2]=18, so cur=3

i=19

i=19 != R[3]=20, ans *=3 % MOD, nums_left=2, i=20

i=20 == R[3]=20, so cur=4

So, it doesn't multiply by 0.

Hence, ans remains non-zero.

So, my earlier calculation was incorrect.

Hence, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic to calculate the number of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correct}}
