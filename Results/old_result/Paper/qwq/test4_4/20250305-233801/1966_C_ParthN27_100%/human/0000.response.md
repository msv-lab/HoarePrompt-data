Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones. Alice and Bob take turns, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k that is less than or equal to the smallest pile's size and removes k stones from every non-empty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

So, the key here is that in each move, the player removes k stones from every non-empty pile, not just from one pile. This makes it different from the standard Nim game where you remove stones from a single pile.

Given that, I need to determine who wins if both players play optimally, with Alice going first.

Looking at the input format: There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I get the number of piles n, followed by the sizes of the piles.

Constraints are important here: t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5. So, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient, probably O(n log n) per test case at worst.

Now, to solve this, I need to find a way to determine the winner based on the pile sizes. Since the game is about removing stones from all piles by a certain amount each turn, it seems like the relative differences between pile sizes might be crucial.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory. In impartial games, the concept of Nimbers or the mex function can be useful. But given the operation is the same for both players, it's indeed impartial.

In standard Nim, each pile is independent, and the overall game is a Nim-sum of individual piles. But here, moves affect all piles simultaneously, which is different.

Let's consider what happens when a player chooses a k. They remove k stones from every non-empty pile. This effectively reduces every pile by at least k, but since piles have different sizes, some piles might be emptied if k equals their size.

Wait, no, they remove k stones from each non-empty pile, so a pile with a size less than k will be emptied, and piles with size greater than or equal to k will have k stones removed.

So, the state of the game is defined by the multiset of pile sizes, and each move transforms this multiset by subtracting k from each element and removing any piles that become zero.

This seems complex to handle directly. Maybe there's a way to simplify it.

Let me look at small examples to see if a pattern emerges.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 5

piles: 3 3 3 3 3

Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles zero. So, Alice wins immediately.

Next test case:

n = 2

piles: 1 7

Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile is 1). She removes 1 stone from both piles, resulting in piles of 0 and 6. Now, Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 stones from the pile of 6, making it zero. So, Alice can't move next, hence Bob wins.

Another test case:

n = 7

piles: 1 3 9 7 4 2 100

This seems more complex. Let's see what Alice can do.

The smallest pile is 1, so Alice can choose k=1. She removes 1 stone from each pile, resulting in piles: 0,2,8,6,3,1,99.

Now, Bob can choose k=1 again, removing 1 from each non-empty pile: 0,1,7,5,2,0,98.

Alice can choose k=1 again: 0,0,6,4,1,0,97.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,5,3,0,0,96.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,4,2,0,0,95.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,3,1,0,0,94.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,2,0,0,0,93.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,1,0,0,0,92.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,91.

Now, all piles are empty, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the example output, Alice wins this case, which matches.

Another test case:

n = 3

piles: 1 2 3

Alice can choose k=1: piles become 0,1,2.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,1.

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0.

So, Alice wins again.

Next test case:

n = 6

piles: 2 1 3 4 2 4

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 1,0,2,3,1,3.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,1,2,0,2.

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0,1,0,1.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0,0,0,0.

So, Bob wins.

Another test case:

n = 8

piles: 5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2

Alice chooses k=2: piles become 3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 2,4,0,6,3,0,0,0.

Alice chooses k=2: piles become 0,2,0,4,1,0,0,0.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0.

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.

So, Alice wins.

Last test case:

n = 1

piles: 1000000000

Alice chooses k=1000000000: pile becomes 0.

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

From these examples, it seems that Alice wins in some cases and Bob in others, but I need to find a general rule.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can model this game in terms of the number of possible moves.

Each move consists of choosing a k that is at most the smallest pile's size and removing k stones from each non-empty pile.

This operation is equivalent to replacing each non-zero pile with (a_i - k), but only if a_i >= k; otherwise, the pile is removed.

Wait, but in the game, you're removing k stones from each non-empty pile, so it's like subtracting k from each pile's size, and then removing any piles that become zero.

This is similar to a process where you're reducing all piles uniformly by k, and then clearing out any piles that are reduced to zero.

This seems similar to the concept of "surviving" piles after certain reductions.

Maybe I can think about the piles in terms of their ranks or something.

Let me consider sorting the piles in ascending order.

For example, in the first test case: 3,3,3,3,3 -> sorted: 3,3,3,3,3

Alice chooses k=3, removes k from each, all become zero.

In the second test case: 1,7 -> sorted:1,7

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, becoming 0,6.

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the remaining pile, becoming 0,0.

In the third test case:1,3,9,7,4,2,100 -> sorted:1,2,3,4,7,9,100

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, becoming 0,1,2,3,6,8,99.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-zero, becoming 0,0,1,2,5,7,98.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,1,4,6,97.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,3,5,96.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,2,4,95.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,1,3,94.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,2,93.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,1,92.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,91.

So, Alice wins.

Wait, in this series of moves, it seems like the game progresses in a way that the number of non-zero piles decreases over time.

Maybe I can think of the game in terms of the number of non-empty piles at each stage.

Let me consider the number of non-empty piles after each move.

In the first test case:

- Initial: 5 piles

- Alice chooses k=3: all piles become zero -> 0 piles

- Game over, Alice wins.

In the second test case:

- Initial: 2 piles

- Alice chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 1 pile

- Bob chooses k=6: the remaining pile becomes zero -> 0 piles

- Game over, Bob wins.

In the third test case:

- Initial: 7 piles

- Alice chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 6 piles

- Bob chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 5 piles

- Alice chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 4 piles

- Bob chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 3 piles

- Alice chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 2 piles

- Bob chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 1 pile

- Alice chooses k=1: one pile becomes zero -> 0 piles

- Alice wins.

Wait, in this sequence, each time a player chooses k=1, one pile becomes zero, until only one pile remains, and then it's removed by Alice.

So, it's like the number of non-zero piles decreases by one each turn when k=1 is chosen.

But in the second test case, Alice chooses k=1, reducing two piles to one, and then Bob chooses k=6, removing the last pile.

So, it's not always that k=1 is the optimal choice.

Wait, perhaps the game can be modeled by the number of times you can reduce the smallest pile to zero.

But I need a more systematic way to approach this.

Let me think about the game in terms of "stages". Each time a pile is reduced to zero, it's removed from the game.

So, perhaps I can consider the sequence of smallest pile sizes and see how many times players can make moves based on those.

Wait, maybe I can sort the piles in ascending order and then see the differences between consecutive piles.

Let's try that.

Take the third test case: piles:1,2,3,4,7,9,100

Sort them:1,2,3,4,7,9,100

Now, the differences between consecutive piles are:1-0=1,2-1=1,3-2=1,4-3=1,7-4=3,9-7=2,100-9=91.

Wait, perhaps not directly helpful.

Alternatively, think about the number of times you can choose k equal to the smallest pile, which would remove that pile and reduce others.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the example outputs.

Test case 1: Alice wins

Test case 2: Bob wins

Test case 3: Alice wins

Test case 4: Alice wins

Test case 5: Bob wins

Test case 6: Alice wins

Test case 7: Alice wins

Looking at these, it seems that Alice wins in most cases, except when n=2 and piles are 1 and 7, and n=6 with piles 2,1,3,4,2,4.

I need to find a general rule.

Perhaps I can think about the game in terms of the mex (minimum excludant) or something similar.

Wait, maybe it's about the maximum pile size minus the minimum pile size.

No, that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Another approach: consider the game as equivalent to a single pile game, where the pile size is some function of the original piles.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think recursively. Define the game state based on the current pile sizes and see who wins from there.

But with n up to 2e5 per test case, recursion isn't feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of moves possible.

In the first test case, only one move is possible (Alice's move), and she wins.

In the second test case, two moves are possible: Alice's and Bob's, so Bob wins.

In the third test case, seven moves are possible: Alice, Bob, Alice, Bob, Alice, Bob, Alice, so Alice wins.

Wait, but in the third test case, as shown earlier, Alice makes the last move, winning the game.

Similarly, in the fourth test case with n=3: Alice makes the last move.

In the fifth test case with n=6: Bob makes the last move.

So, perhaps the number of moves determines the winner.

But I need to confirm this.

In the first test case: n=5, Alice makes the first and last move.

In the second test case: n=2, Bob makes the last move.

In the third test case: n=7, Alice makes the last move.

Wait, but n=7, Alice makes the last move; n=2, Bob makes the last move; n=5, Alice makes the last move.

Wait, but n=5 is odd, Alice makes the last move; n=2 is even, Bob makes the last move.

Wait, is that the pattern?

But in the third test case, n=7, which is odd, Alice makes the last move.

In the fifth test case, n=6, which is even, Bob makes the last move.

Yes, this seems consistent.

But in the fourth test case, n=3, Alice makes the last move.

In the sixth test case, n=8, Alice makes the last move.

Wait, n=8 is even, but Alice makes the last move, which contradicts the previous pattern.

Wait, perhaps something else is happening.

Wait, in the sixth test case, n=8, Alice makes the last move, winning.

So, perhaps it's not just about the parity of n.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal excludant (mex) of the pile sizes.

Wait, but mex is used in games like Nim, where you have heaps and you can remove stones from a single heap.

But here, moves affect all piles simultaneously, so standard mex might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the game in terms of "Nimbers" or "xor" of certain values derived from the pile sizes.

But I need to find a way to model the game correctly.

Let me try to think about the sequence of possible moves.

Each move consists of choosing a k that is at most the smallest pile's size and removing k stones from each non-empty pile.

This operation reduces all non-empty piles by k stones, and removes any piles that are reduced to zero.

So, effectively, each move consists of removing k stones from every pile that has at least k stones.

Wait, no, it's removing k stones from every non-empty pile, so piles with less than k stones are removed.

This seems similar to a process where you're reducing all piles by k, and then discarding any piles that become zero.

This is akin to "trimming" the piles by k.

Perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of times I can perform such a trimming operation until all piles are empty.

And the player who makes the last trimming move wins.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

Wait, that seems plausible.

Let's check it against the examples.

First test case: n=5, all piles of size 3. Alice chooses k=3, removes 3 from each, all become zero. Total moves: 1 (odd), Alice wins.

Second test case: n=2, piles 1 and 7. Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, becoming 0 and 6. Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the remaining pile, becoming 0. Total moves: 2 (even), Bob wins.

Third test case: n=7, piles 1,2,3,4,7,9,100. Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, becoming 0,1,2,3,6,8,99. Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-zero, becoming 0,0,1,2,5,7,98. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,1,4,6,97. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,3,5,96. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,2,4,95. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,1,3,94. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,2,93. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,1,92. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,91. Total moves: 7 (odd), Alice wins.

Fourth test case: n=3, piles 1,2,3. Alice chooses k=1: 0,1,2. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,1. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0. Total moves: 3 (odd), Alice wins.

Fifth test case: n=6, piles 2,1,3,4,2,4. Alice chooses k=1: 1,0,2,3,1,3. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,1,2,0,2. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,1,0,1. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0. Total moves: 4 (even), Bob wins.

Sixth test case: n=8, piles 5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2. Alice chooses k=2: 3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0. Bob chooses k=1: 2,4,0,6,3,0,0,0. Alice chooses k=2: 0,2,0,4,1,0,0,0. Bob chooses k=1: 0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Total moves: 7 (odd), Alice wins.

Seventh test case: n=1, pile 1000000000. Alice chooses k=1000000000: 0. Total moves:1 (odd), Alice wins.

So, in all these cases, the player who makes the last move wins, and the total number of moves determines who wins based on parity.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

Now, the question is, how do I determine the total number of moves efficiently for large n?

Looking at the sorted piles seems helpful.

Let's sort the piles in ascending order.

Then, the first move will remove all piles smaller than the smallest pile's size, and reduce the rest by the smallest pile's size.

Wait, no. Actually, in each move, you choose k, remove k from every non-empty pile, and remove any piles that become zero.

So, in sorted order, after choosing k, all piles less than or equal to k are removed, and the remaining piles are reduced by k.

This is similar to the concept of "levels" in the piles.

So, the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct "levels" in the piles.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times you can choose a k that is less than or equal to the current smallest pile.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Then, the first move can choose k = a1, remove k from all piles, and remove any piles that become zero. So, after this move, the remaining piles are a2 - a1, a3 - a1, ..., an - a1, excluding any that become zero.

Then, the next move chooses k <= the new smallest pile, and so on.

So, in essence, the number of moves is equal to the number of times you can pick a k that is at most the current smallest pile, and remove k from all piles, until all piles are zero.

This seems similar to the number of distinct non-zero values in the sorted piles, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times you can pick a k that is the smallest non-zero pile size.

In that case, the number of moves would be equal to the number of distinct smallest non-zero pile sizes.

Wait, but in the third test case: sorted piles 1,2,3,4,7,9,100

First move: k=1, remove 1 from all, piles become 0,1,2,3,6,8,99 -> remove 0, remaining piles:1,2,3,6,8,99

Second move: k=1, remove 1 from all, piles become 0,1,2,5,7,98 -> remove 0, remaining:1,2,5,7,98

Third move: k=1, remove 1 from all, piles become 0,1,4,6,97 -> remove 0, remaining:1,4,6,97

Fourth move: k=1, remove 1 from all, piles become 0,3,5,96 -> remove 0, remaining:3,5,96

Fifth move: k=3, remove 3 from all, piles become 0,2,93 -> remove 0, remaining:2,93

Sixth move: k=2, remove 2 from all, piles become 0,91 -> remove 0, remaining:91

Seventh move: k=91, remove 91 from the pile, becoming 0.

So, seven moves in total.

But in this case, the number of distinct smallest non-zero pile sizes is:

First move: smallest is 1

Second move: smallest is 1

Third move: smallest is 1

Fourth move: smallest is 1

Fifth move: smallest is 3

Sixth move: smallest is 2

Seventh move: smallest is 91

So, the distinct smallest pile sizes are 1,3,2,91 -> four distinct values, but actually, there are seven moves.

So, that doesn't match.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal pile sizes at each step:

- Initial: min=1

- After first move: min=1

- After second move: min=1

- After third move: min=1

- After fourth move: min=3

- After fifth move: min=2

- After sixth move: min=91

- After seventh move: all zero.

So, the number of moves is equal to the number of times the minimal pile size changes, but not quite, since it changes from 1 to 3 to 2 to 91.

Wait, but in between, the minimal pile size stays at 1 for several moves.

Maybe the number of moves is equal to the number of times the minimal pile size changes to a new value.

But in this case, it changes to 1, then stays at 1 for several moves, then changes to 3, then to 2, then to 91.

So, the number of distinct minimal pile sizes is 1,3,2,91 -> four, but the total moves are seven.

So, that doesn't match.

Perhaps I need to consider something else.

Let me try to model this as a game where the number of moves is equal to the number of times you can select a k that is at most the current minimal pile size.

In the sorted list, each move corresponds to removing a "layer" of size k from all piles.

So, perhaps the total number of moves is equal to the number of times you can select such a k until all piles are zero.

This seems similar to the height of the piles if they were stacked.

Wait, perhaps it's the maximum pile size that determines the number of moves, but that can't be right, because in the first test case, maximum is 3, and number of moves is 1.

Wait, but in the third test case, maximum is 100, and number of moves is 7.

Not directly related.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of piles minus some value.

But in the third test case, n=7, moves=7.

In the second test case, n=2, moves=2.

In the first test case, n=5, moves=1.

Hmm, not directly related.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of piles that are larger than the previous piles.

Wait, in the third test case, sorted piles:1,2,3,4,7,9,100

Number of piles is 7, number of moves is 7.

In the second test case:1,7 -> moves:2

In the first test case:3,3,3,3,3 -> moves:1

Wait, in the first test case, all piles are equal, so only one move is needed.

In the second test case, two distinct pile sizes:1 and 7, so two moves.

In the third test case, all piles are distinct and increasing:7 moves.

So, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct pile sizes when the piles are sorted.

Wait, in the first test case, all piles are the same: only one distinct size, so one move.

In the second test case, two distinct sizes: two moves.

In the third test case, seven distinct sizes: seven moves.

In the fourth test case:1,2,3 -> three distinct sizes: three moves.

In the fifth test case:2,1,3,4,2,4 -> sorted:1,2,2,3,4,4 -> two distinct sizes:1,2,3,4 -> four moves, but earlier we saw it's two moves.

Wait, no, in the fifth test case, it was n=6, piles:2,1,3,4,2,4

Sorted:1,2,2,3,4,4

Distinct sizes:1,2,3,4 -> four distinct sizes, but earlier simulation showed four moves.

Wait, but in the earlier simulation, it was:

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 1,0,2,3,1,3.

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,1,2,0,2.

Alice chooses k=1: 0,0,0,1,0,1.

Bob chooses k=1: 0,0,0,0,0,0.

So, four moves in total, which matches the number of distinct sizes.

Wait, but in the first test case, all piles are the same:3,3,3,3,3 -> sorted:3,3,3,3,3 -> one distinct size:3 -> one move.

Which matches.

In the second test case:1,7 -> two distinct sizes: two moves.

In the third test case:1,2,3,4,7,9,100 -> seven distinct sizes: seven moves.

In the fourth test case:1,2,3 -> three distinct sizes: three moves.

In the fifth test case:1,2,2,3,4,4 -> distinct sizes:1,2,3,4 -> four moves.

Wait, but earlier simulation showed four moves, but in the earlier description, it was said to be four moves, but in the initial analysis, it was thought to be two moves.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Let me re-simulate the fifth test case:

n=6, piles:2,1,3,4,2,4

Sort:1,2,2,3,4,4

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,1,1,2,3,3.

Remove zeros:1,1,2,3,3

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,1,2,2.

Remove zeros:1,2,2

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,1,1.

Remove zeros:1,1

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0.

Remove zeros: no piles left.

So, total moves:4 (Alice, Bob, Alice, Bob).

Which matches the number of distinct sizes:1,2,3,4.

So, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct pile sizes in the sorted list.

In the first test case: only size 3 -> one move.

Second test case: sizes 1,7 -> two moves.

Third test case: sizes 1,2,3,4,7,9,100 -> seven moves.

Fourth test case: sizes 1,2,3 -> three moves.

Fifth test case: sizes 1,2,3,4 -> four moves.

Sixth test case: sizes 2,3,5,6,7,9,91,100 -> eight moves? Wait, but in the simulation, it was seven moves.

Wait, perhaps not exactly the number of distinct sizes.

Wait, in the sixth test case: piles 5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2 -> sorted:2,2,3,3,5,6,7,9

Distinct sizes:2,3,5,6,7,9 -> six distinct sizes, but simulation showed seven moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of times the minimal pile size changes.

In the sixth test case:

- Initial:2,2,3,3,5,6,7,9

- Choose k=2: piles become 0,0,1,1,3,4,5,7 -> remove zeros:1,1,3,4,5,7

- Choose k=1: piles become 0,0,2,3,4,6 -> remove zeros:2,3,4,6

- Choose k=2: piles become 0,1,2,4 -> remove zeros:1,2,4

- Choose k=1: piles become 0,1,3 -> remove zeros:1,3

- Choose k=1: piles become 0,2 -> remove zeros:2

- Choose k=2: piles become 0 -> remove zeros: no piles left.

- Total moves:6, which matches the number of distinct sizes:2,3,5,6,7,9.

Wait, earlier I thought it was seven moves, but recounting, it's six moves.

Perhaps I miscounted earlier.

In the simulation I did earlier, it seemed like there were seven moves, but now it's six moves.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me re-simulate:

Initial:2,2,3,3,5,6,7,9

Alice chooses k=2: piles become 0,0,1,1,3,4,5,7 -> remove zeros:1,1,3,4,5,7

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,0,2,3,4,6 -> remove zeros:2,3,4,6

Alice chooses k=2: piles become 0,1,2,4 -> remove zeros:1,2,4

Bob chooses k=1: piles become 0,1,3 -> remove zeros:1,3

Alice chooses k=1: piles become 0,2 -> remove zeros:2

Bob chooses k=2: piles become 0 -> no piles left.

Total moves:6, which matches the number of distinct sizes:2,3,5,6,7,9 -> six distinct sizes.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was seven moves, but now it's six.

Perhaps I miscounted earlier.

So, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct pile sizes.

In this case, with six distinct sizes, six moves.

But in the third test case, seven distinct sizes, seven moves.

In the fifth test case, four distinct sizes, four moves.

In the first test case, one distinct size, one move.

In the second test case, two distinct sizes, two moves.

In the fourth test case, three distinct sizes, three moves.

Seems consistent.

So, if I can count the number of distinct pile sizes, and determine if that number is odd or even, I can decide who wins.

If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, six distinct sizes, even number, so Bob wins, but according to the example output, Alice wins.

Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, in the sixth test case, according to the example output, Alice wins, but according to this, with six distinct sizes, it should be Bob wins.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sixth test case, n=8, piles:5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2

Distinct sizes:2,3,5,6,7,9 -> six distinct sizes -> even ->
