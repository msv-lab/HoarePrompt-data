Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation allows me to select three integers i, j, and x, and set all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

Let me consider some examples to get a better grasp.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

Output: 4

Explanation: By setting indices 2 to 4 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which costs 3 burles. But the output is 4, so maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps setting indices 2 to 5 to 1: [1,2,1,1,1,1], which costs 4 burles, and then all elements are 1. But the output is 4, which matches.

Wait, but the problem says I can perform the operation at most once, meaning I can do it zero or one time.

So, in this case, to make all elements equal, I need to set a certain range to a specific value, and I need to choose the range and value such that the cost is minimized.

Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: All elements are already equal, so no operation is needed.

Example 3:

Input: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

Output: 2

Explanation: Set indices 4 and 5 to 8, costing 2 burles, making the array [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].

Example 4:

Input: [1]

Output: 0

Explanation: Only one element, already equal.

Example 5:

Input: [1,2]

Output: 1

Explanation: Set either index 1 or 2 to make both elements equal, costing 1 burle.

Example 6:

Input: [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: Set indices 2 and 3 to 1, costing 2 burles, making [1,1,1].

Example 7:

Input: [4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: Set indices 1 to 6 to 3, costing 6 burles, making [3,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Example 8:

Input: [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

Output: 7

Explanation: Not sure, but presumably setting a range to make all elements equal.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to find the largest contiguous segment of the array that already has the same value and then set the remaining parts to that value.

Wait, but in example 1, [1,2,3,4,5,1], the largest contiguous segment with the same value is [1] at the start and end, so the remaining elements are 4 in between, so set them to 1.

Similarly, in example 3, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the largest contiguous segment of 8s is at both ends, so set the middle two elements to 8.

In example 5, [1,2], the largest contiguous segment is either [1] or [2], so set the other element to match, costing 1.

In example 6, [1,2,3], the largest contiguous segment is [1], [2], or [3], each of size 1, so set the other two elements to match, costing 2.

So, it seems the general approach is to find the maximum number of elements that are already the same and contiguous, and then set the remaining elements to that value.

Wait, but in example 7, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], the largest contiguous segment with the same value is [1,1], so set the other 5 elements to 1, costing 5, but the output is 6. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the largest contiguous segment, but the maximum number of elements that are the same, regardless of contiguity.

But in example 7, there are two 1's and two 3's, and two 5's in example 8, but the output is 7, which doesn't align with that.

Wait, perhaps it's the maximum number of elements that are the same, and the cost is the total number of elements minus that maximum frequency.

But in example 1, 6 - 2 (two 1's) = 4, which matches the output.

In example 2, 7 - 7 = 0.

In example 3, 8 - 5 (five 8's) = 3, but the output is 2, so that doesn't match.

Hmm, seems like it's not just the maximum frequency of any element.

Wait, perhaps it's the maximum number of elements that are the same and contiguous, and the cost is the total number minus that.

In example 1, the largest contiguous segment with the same value is 2 (two 1's), so 6 - 2 = 4.

In example 3, the largest contiguous segment with the same value is 3 (three 8's), so 8 - 3 = 5, but the output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the lengths of all maximal contiguous segments of the same value.

In example 3, there are two segments of 8's: one of length 3 and one of length 3, so the maximum is 3, and 8 - 3 = 5, still not matching the output of 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping segments or something else.

Let me look back at the operation: I can set a range [i, j] to x, and I can do this at most once.

So, I can choose to set a range to a specific value, and the rest will remain as they are.

My goal is to make the entire array equal to some value, say y.

I can choose to set a range to y, and the rest will already be y if they match.

So, I need to choose y and the range [i, j] such that after setting [i, j] to y, the entire array is y, and the cost is minimized.

Wait, but I can set the range to any value x, not necessarily y.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x"

So, I can set a range to any value x, not necessarily the value I want the entire array to be.

But my goal is to make the entire array equal to some value.

So, I need to choose a value y that will be the final value of the entire array, and then decide which range to set to y such that the remaining elements already are y.

To minimize the cost, I want to maximize the number of elements that are already y outside the chosen range.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting a value y and finding the minimum range [i, j] such that, outside this range, all elements are already y.

Then, set the range [i, j] to y, and the entire array becomes y.

The cost is the size of the range, which is (j - i + 1).

I need to choose y and [i, j] to minimize this cost.

Wait, but in example 1, [1,2,3,4,5,1], if I choose y = 1, then I need to set [2,5] to 1, which costs 4.

If I choose y = 2, I need to set [1,3],[5,6] to 2, which costs 5.

Similarly for other y's.

So, choosing y = 1 gives the minimum cost of 4.

Similarly, in example 3, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], choosing y = 8, and setting [4,5] to 8, costing 2.

In example 7, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], choosing y = 1, and setting [1,4],[6,7] to 1, which is two separate ranges, but I can only apply the operation once, so I need to choose one range.

If I set [2,6] to 1, costing 5, making [4,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set [1,2] to 1, costing 2, but I can only do one operation.

Wait, I can only do one operation.

So, I need to choose one range to set to x, and choose x such that the remaining elements are already x.

In example 7, if I choose y = 1 and set [2,6] to 1, costing 5, then the array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,3], which still has 4 and 3 at the ends.

So, I would need a second operation to set those to 1, but I can only do one operation.

Wait, maybe I need to set a larger range.

If I set [1,6] to 1, costing 6, then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], and then I need to set the last element to 1, but I can't do another operation.

So, I need to set [1,7] to 1, costing 7, making all elements 1.

But the output is 6, so that's not optimal.

Wait, perhaps choosing y = 3.

Set [1,5] to 3, costing 5, making [3,3,3,3,3,1,3], then set the last element to 3, but again, only one operation.

So, setting [1,6] to 3, costing 6, making [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which matches the output of 6.

So, in this case, choosing y = 3 and setting [1,6] to 3 costs 6.

Choosing y = 1 and setting [1,7] to 1 costs 7, which is higher.

Hence, the minimum cost is 6.

So, the strategy seems to be:

- Choose a value y that will be the final value of the entire array.

- Find the minimum cost to set a range [i, j] to y such that, outside this range, all elements are already y.

- The cost is (j - i + 1).

- Among all possible y and [i, j], choose the one with the minimum cost.

But how to efficiently compute this?

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution, O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to find, for a chosen y, the minimum range [i, j] such that outside this range, all elements are y.

In other words, find the minimal range [i, j] that covers all elements that are not equal to y.

Then, setting this range to y will make the entire array equal to y.

The cost is (j - i + 1).

So, for each y, find the minimal range that covers all elements not equal to y.

Then, choose y such that this minimal range is minimized.

So, the minimal range covering all elements not equal to y is the range from the first element not equal to y to the last element not equal to y.

If there are no elements not equal to y, then the cost is 0.

Hence, for each y, compute the minimal range that covers all elements not equal to y.

To do this:

- For each y, find the leftmost element that is not y, and the rightmost element that is not y.

- Then, the minimal range is from leftmost not y to rightmost not y.

- The cost is (rightmost - leftmost + 1).

- Choose y such that this cost is minimized.

Wait, but in example 7, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], if y = 1:

- Leftmost not 1 is index 0 (4),

- Rightmost not 1 is index 6 (3),

- So, set [0,6] to 1, costing 7.

If y = 3:

- Leftmost not 3 is index 0 (4),

- Rightmost not 3 is index 5 (1),

- So, set [0,5] to 3, costing 6.

If y = 2:

- Leftmost not 2 is index 0 (4),

- Rightmost not 2 is index 6 (3),

- Set [0,6] to 2, costing 7.

Similarly for other y's.

Hence, the minimum cost is 6, achieved by choosing y = 3.

This matches the sample output.

Similarly, in example 1, [1,2,3,4,5,1], choosing y = 1:

- Leftmost not 1 is index 1 (2),

- Rightmost not 1 is index 4 (5),

- Set [1,4] to 1, costing 4.

Choosing y = 2:

- Leftmost not 2 is index 0 (1),

- Rightmost not 2 is index 5 (1),

- Set [0,5] to 2, costing 6.

Similarly for other y's.

Hence, the minimum cost is 4, achieved by choosing y = 1.

This matches the sample output.

In example 3, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], choosing y = 8:

- Leftmost not 8 is index 3 (1),

- Rightmost not 8 is index 4 (2),

- Set [3,4] to 8, costing 2.

Choosing y = 1 or y = 2 would require setting a larger range.

Hence, the minimum cost is 2.

This matches the sample output.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Find the minimal cost over all possible y:

- For each possible y, find the leftmost and rightmost indices where a[i] != y.

- If there are no elements not equal to y, cost is 0.

- Else, cost is (rightmost - leftmost + 1).

- Choose the y that minimizes this cost.

- Print the minimum cost.

Now, to implement this efficiently, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

A brute-force way would be, for each y, iterate through the array to find the leftmost and rightmost indices where a[i] != y.

But this would be O(n * n) in the worst case, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that I can iterate through the array once and find, for each y, the leftmost and rightmost indices where a[i] != y.

But doing this for each y separately is inefficient.

An optimization is to iterate through the array once and collect all indices where a[i] != y, then take the minimum and maximum of those indices.

But again, this is O(n) per y.

Given that n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, it's manageable, but I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the overall leftmost index that is not equal to any y, and the rightmost index that is not equal to any y.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me think differently.

I can iterate through the array once and find the leftmost and rightmost indices for each y.

Wait, no, I need to find, for each y, the leftmost and rightmost indices where a[i] != y.

An alternative approach is:

- Find the overall leftmost index that has a value different from y.

- Find the overall rightmost index that has a value different from y.

- Then, the minimal range to cover all elements not equal to y is from leftmost to rightmost.

To optimize this, I can find, for each y, the leftmost and rightmost indices where a[i] != y.

But doing this separately for each y is inefficient.

An optimization is to find, for each position i, the leftmost position where a[j] != a[i], and the rightmost position where a[j] != a[i].

Wait, perhaps I can group the array into runs of identical values and then compute prefix and suffix counts.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum length of a contiguous segment where a[i] == y, and then the cost is n - length of this segment.

Wait, but in example 1, [1,2,3,4,5,1], for y=1, the maximum segment length is 2, so n - 2 = 4, which matches.

In example 3, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], for y=8, the maximum segment length is 3, so n - 3 = 5, but the sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's n minus the sum of the maximum frequency of any value.

But in example 1, frequency of 1 is 2, so 6 - 2 = 4.

In example 3, frequency of 8 is 5, so 8 - 5 = 3, but sample output is 2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum length of a contiguous segment where a[i] == y, over all y.

In example 1, maximum contiguous segment of 1's is length 2, so 6 - 2 = 4.

In example 3, maximum contiguous segment of 8's is length 3, so 8 - 3 = 5, but sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum of the minimum lengths of contiguous segments of y.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose y to be the value that appears the most in the array, and then find the minimal range that covers all elements not equal to y.

But in example 7, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], y=1 appears twice, y=3 appears twice, y=2 once, etc.

Choosing y=1 or y=3 both appear twice, but choosing y=3 and setting [1,6] to 3 costs 6, which is better than setting [1,7] to 1, costing 7.

So, it's not just about the frequency of y, but also about the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum length of a contiguous segment where a[i] == y, over all y.

In example 1, maximum contiguous segment of 1's is 2, so 6 - 2 = 4.

In example 3, maximum contiguous segment of 8's is 3, so 8 - 3 = 5, but sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum of the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

Wait, in example 3, y=8, the leftmost segment is [1,3] and rightmost is [6,8], both consisting of 8's.

The sum is 3 + 3 = 6, so n - 6 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In example 1, y=1, leftmost segment [1], rightmost segment [6], sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 7, y=1, leftmost segment [5], rightmost segment [6], sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum of the sum of the lengths of all contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

In example 3, y=8, sum of lengths is 3 + 3 = 6, n - 6 = 2.

In example 1, y=1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 7, y=1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum of the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

In example 3, sum is 3 + 3 = 6, n - 6 = 2.

In example 1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 7, y=1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus the maximum of the sum of the lengths of all contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

In example 7, y=1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's n minus the maximum length of a single contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

In example 7, maximum contiguous segment of 1's is 1, so n - 1 = 6.

That matches the sample output.

Similarly, in example 1, maximum contiguous segment of 1's is 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 3, maximum contiguous segment of 8's is 3, n - 3 = 5, but sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps if a[0] == a[n-1], then it's n minus the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

In example 3, y=8, leftmost segment is [1,3], rightmost is [6,8], sum is 3 + 3 = 6, n - 6 = 2.

In example 1, y=1, leftmost is [1], rightmost is [6], sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 7, y=1, leftmost is [5], rightmost is [6], sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps in cases where a[0] == a[n-1], it's n minus the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

Else, n minus the maximum length of a single contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

In example 3, a[0] == a[7] == 8, sum is 3 + 3 = 6, n - 6 = 2.

In example 1, a[0] == a[5] == 1, sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 4.

In example 7, a[0] != a[6], so n - max(1) = 7 - 1 = 6, which matches the sample output.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, generalizing:

- If a[0] == a[n-1], then for y = a[0], the cost is n minus (sum of lengths of leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y).

- Else, for y = a[0] or y = a[n-1], choose the one that gives the minimum cost.

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

- Choose y to be a[0] or a[n-1], whichever gives the minimum cost.

- If a[0] == a[n-1], then sum the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

- Else, take the maximum length of the leftmost or rightmost contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

- Then, cost is n minus this sum or maximum length.

Wait, let's verify with sample inputs.

Example 1:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,1], a[0] == a[5] == 1.

Leftmost segment where a[i] == 1 is [1], length 1.

Rightmost segment where a[i] == 1 is [6], length 1.

Sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

Cost is 6 - 2 = 4.

Matches sample.

Example 3:

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], a[0] == a[7] == 8.

Leftmost segment where a[i] == 8 is [1,3], length 3.

Rightmost segment where a[i] == 8 is [6,8], length 3.

Sum is 3 + 3 = 6.

Cost is 8 - 6 = 2.

Matches sample.

Example 7:

a = [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], a[0] == 4, a[6] == 3.

a[0] != a[6].

For y = 4, leftmost segment where a[i] == 4 is [1], length 1.

For y = 3, leftmost segment where a[i] == 3 is [2], length 1 and [7], length 1.

Wait, in this case, since a[0] != a[6], perhaps we take the maximum of the leftmost and rightmost segments.

For y = 4, leftmost segment is [1], length 1.

Rightmost segment is [1], length 1.

Sum is 1.

For y = 3, leftmost segment is [2], length 1.

Rightmost segment is [7], length 1.

Sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

Then, choose y = 3, cost is n - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps in such cases, it's n minus the maximum length of a single contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

For y = 3, maximum contiguous segment is [2] and [7], each of length 1.

So, n - 1 = 6.

Which matches the sample output.

For y = 1, maximum contiguous segment is [5,6], length 2.

n - 2 = 5.

But choosing y = 3 gives a lower cost of 5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if a[0] != a[n-1], then it's n minus the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y, but only if they are distinct.

In example 7, for y = 3, leftmost is [2], rightmost is [7], sum is 1 + 1 = 2, n - 2 = 5.

But sample output is 6.

Wait, maybe it's n minus the maximum of the lengths of the leftmost or rightmost contiguous segments.

For y = 3, max(1,1) = 1, n - 1 = 6.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the correct approach is:

- If a[0] == a[n-1], then for y = a[0], cost is n minus (sum of lengths of leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y).

- Else, for y = a[0] and y = a[n-1], choose the one with the maximum length of the leftmost or rightmost contiguous segment, and set cost as n minus that maximum length.

- Then, choose the minimum cost among these options.

Wait, perhaps more clearly:

- If a[0] == a[n-1], then for y = a[0], cost is n minus (sum of lengths of leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y).

- Else, for y = a[0], cost is n minus length of leftmost contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

- For y = a[n-1], cost is n minus length of rightmost contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

- Choose the minimum of these costs.

- Additionally, consider choosing y to be any other value in the array, but to optimize, we can assume choosing y as a[0] or a[n-1] gives the optimal solution.

But in example 7, choosing y = 3 (which is a[n-1]) gives cost n - max(leftmost, rightmost) = 7 - 1 = 6.

Choosing y = 4 (a[0]) gives cost n - 1 = 6.

Hence, minimum cost is 6.

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in example 1, choosing y = 1 (a[0] == a[5]), cost is n - (sum of leftmost and rightmost segments) = 6 - (1 + 1) = 4.

In example 3, choosing y = 8 (a[0] == a[7]), cost is n - (3 + 3) = 2.

Hence, this seems consistent.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

- If a[0] == a[n-1]:

- Find the sum of the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == a[0].

- Cost is n minus this sum.

- Else:

- For y = a[0]:

- Find the length of the leftmost contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

- Cost is n minus this length.

- For y = a[n-1]:

- Find the length of the rightmost contiguous segment where a[i] == y.

- Cost is n minus this length.

- Choose the minimum of these two costs.

- This should give the minimal cost to make the entire array equal.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to find the lengths of the leftmost and rightmost contiguous segments where a[i] == y.

I can iterate from the start until a[i] != a[0], counting the length of the leftmost segment.

Similarly, iterate from the end until a[i] != a[n-1], counting the length of the rightmost segment.

Then, based on whether a[0] == a[n-1], compute the cost as described.

This seems efficient, O(n) per test case.

Now, looking back at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

le = len(a)

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

(st, end) = (1, 1)

while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:

l += 1

st += 1

while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:

r -= 1

end += 1

ans = le - max(st, end)

if a[0] == a[-1]:

ans = max(0, le - (st + end))

print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Reads n and the array a.

- Initializes l = 0, r = n - 1, st = 1, end = 1.

- While l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1], increment l and st.

- While r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1], decrement r and increment end.

- Sets ans = le - max(st, end)

- If a[0] == a[n-1], sets ans = max(0, le - (st + end))

- Prints ans.

So, it seems to be implementing the logic I described.

In the case where a[0] == a[n-1], it computes the sum of st and end, and sets ans = le - (st + end).

Else, it sets ans = le - max(st, end).

This matches my earlier reasoning.

Hence, this should be correct.

Let me verify with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Processing:

a[0] == a[5] == 1

st: count of leading 1's = 1

end: count of trailing 1's = 1

ans = 6 - (1 + 1) = 4

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Processing:

a[0] == a[6] == 1

st: count of leading 1's = 7

end: count of trailing 1's = 7

ans = 7 - (7 + 7) = -7, but then max(0, -7) = 0

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 3:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Processing:

a[0] == a[7] == 8

st: count of leading 8's = 3

end: count of trailing 8's = 3

ans = 8 - (3 + 3) = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 4:

1

1

Processing:

a[0] == a[0] == 1

st: count of leading 1's = 1

end: count of trailing 1's = 1

ans = 1 - (1 + 1) = -1, then max(0, -1) = 0

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 5:

2

1 2

Processing:

a[0] != a[1]

For y = a[0] = 1:

st = 1

ans = 2 - 1 = 1

For y = a[1] = 2:

end = 1

ans = 2 - 1 = 1

Minimum is 1, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the code, it doesn't explicitly handle y = a[0] and y = a[n-1] separately.

Wait, in the else case, it sets ans = le - max(st, end)

In this example, max(st, end) = max(1,1) = 1, ans = 2 - 1 = 1, which matches.

Sample Input 6:

3

1 2 3

Processing:

a[0] != a[2]

For y = a[0] = 1:

st = 1

ans = 3 - 1 = 2

For y = a[2] = 3:

end = 1

ans = 3 - 1 = 2

Minimum is 2, which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 7:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Processing:

a[0] != a[6]

For y = a[0] = 4:

st = 1

ans = 7 - 1 = 6

For y = a[6] = 3:

end = 1

ans = 7 - 1 = 6

Minimum is 6, which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 8:

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Processing:

a[0] == a[8] == 9

st: count of leading 9's = 2

end: count of trailing 9's = 0 (since a[8] is 3, but a[8] != 9, so end = 0)

ans = 9 - (2 + 0) = 7, which matches the sample output.

Wait, in this case, a[0] == a[8] == 9, but a[8] != 9, which is incorrect.

Wait, a[8] is 3, which is not equal to 9, so end = 0.

Hence, ans = 9 - (2 + 0) = 7, which matches the sample output.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is **True**.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to make all elements of a given array equal with the least cost, where the cost is defined as the number of elements being modified in a single operation.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We can perform an operation at most once, where we select a range [i, j] and set all elements in this range to any value x, with the cost being (j - i + 1).
   - Our goal is to minimize this cost to make the entire array equal.

2. **Insight**:
   - We should choose a value y that will be the final value of the entire array.
   - We need to find the smallest range [i, j] such that setting this range to y makes the entire array equal to y.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - For a chosen y, the smallest range to set is from the first element not equal to y to the last element not equal to y.
   - The cost is the size of this range.
   - We need to choose y such that this cost is minimized.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Instead of iterating over all possible y, we can consider y as a[0] or a[n-1] due to their positions.
   - Calculate the cost for y = a[0] and y = a[n-1], and choose the minimum.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        le = len(a)
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (1, 1)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            # When a[0] == a[-1], sum the lengths of similar prefixes and suffixes
            ans = le - (st + end)
            ans = max(0, ans)
        else:
            # When a[0] != a[-1], take the maximum of prefix or suffix length
            ans = le - max(st, end)
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Inputs**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the array size and the array elements.

2. **Calculating Prefix and Suffix**:
   - Calculate the length of the prefix of the array that consists of identical elements starting from index 0.
   - Calculate the length of the suffix of the array that consists of identical elements ending at the last index.

3. **Determine the Cost**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same, calculate the cost as the total length minus the sum of the prefix and suffix lengths.
   - If the first and last elements are different, calculate the cost as the total length minus the maximum of the prefix and suffix lengths.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Ensure the cost is non-negative and print the result for each test case.

This approach ensures an efficient solution by avoiding unnecessary iterations and directly computing the minimal cost based on prefix and suffix lengths of identical elements.
