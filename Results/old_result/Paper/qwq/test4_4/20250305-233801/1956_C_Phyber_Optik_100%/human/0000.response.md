Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros, and I can perform two types of operations. Each operation allows me to set a whole row or a whole column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set each element in that row to a permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set each element in that column to a permutation of 1 to n.

Since I can perform these operations multiple times, I need to think about how these operations interact with each other. Specifically, if I set a row and then set a column, how does that affect the element where that row and column intersect?

Let me consider a small example, say n=2. So, the matrix starts as:

0 0

0 0

If I perform a type 1 operation on row 1, choosing permutation [2,1], the matrix becomes:

2 1

0 0

Then, if I perform a type 2 operation on column 1, choosing permutation [2,1], the matrix becomes:

2 1

2 0

Finally, if I perform another type 1 operation on row 2, choosing [2,1], the matrix becomes:

2 1

2 1

So, the sum is 2+1+2+1=6.

But in the example provided in the problem, for n=2, they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations. Hmm, I must be missing something.

Looking back at the example, they did:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's see what that does.

Start with:

0 0

0 0

After type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]:

1 2

0 0

Then, type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]:

1 2

1 2

Then, type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]:

1 (from column operation) 2

2 (from column operation) 2

So, the matrix is:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7.

Okay, that makes sense. So, the column operation overwrites the row operation for the elements in that column.

So, the key is that operations on columns will overwrite the values set by operations on rows for the elements in that column.

Given that, I need to find a way to maximize the sum by choosing which rows and columns to operate on and with which permutations.

I need to think about how to assign values to the matrix such that the highest possible numbers are placed in as many positions as possible.

Since permutations are used, the highest number I can place is n, and I can place it in multiple positions, but I have to do it through operations that affect entire rows or columns.

Let me consider that each operation allows me to set a row or a column to any permutation of 1 to n. So, for example, I can set a row to [n, n-1, ..., 1] or any other permutation.

But the operations can be overlapping in the sense that operations on columns can overwrite operations on rows.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum, and I have a limit of 2n operations.

I should think about covering as much of the matrix as possible with these operations, preferably placing the highest numbers in as many positions as possible.

One approach could be to perform operations on all rows first, setting each row to a permutation that maximizes the sum, and then perform operations on columns to overwrite certain elements to even higher values.

But I need to think carefully about which elements to overwrite.

Alternatively, maybe I can interleave row and column operations to maximize the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning values to rows and columns and taking the maximum possible for each cell.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the example with n=2.

In that case, they did two row operations and one column operation, achieving a sum of 7.

If I had done all row operations, I could have set both rows to [2,2], but that would be invalid because permutations must contain distinct elements from 1 to n.

So, for n=2, [2,2] is not a permutation.

Hence, I have to use permutations like [1,2] or [2,1].

So, in that case, the best I can do is set rows to [2,1] and [2,1], giving a sum of 6, but then overwriting column 1 with [2,1] increases the sum to 7.

So, by using column operations, I can overwrite certain elements to higher values.

I need to generalize this strategy for any n.

Let me consider the sum I can achieve.

If I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], then the sum would be n * (sum from 1 to n).

Similarly, if I perform operations on all columns, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would also be n * (sum from 1 to n).

But since operations on columns overwrite the corresponding elements in the rows, I need to think about the combination.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or a column sets an entire row or column to the chosen permutation.

So, if I perform a row operation and then a column operation, the elements in that column of the row will be overwritten by the column operation.

Hence, I need to plan which rows and columns to operate on to maximize the sum.

One idea is to perform operations on all rows first, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform operations on the columns that need higher values.

But I need to be careful not to overwrite elements that are already set to high values.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform operations on rows and columns in such a way that the overwriting maximizes the sum.

Let me try to think of a pattern.

Suppose I perform operations on the first n operations to set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform operations on the first n columns to set them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But I need to see what that does to the matrix.

Wait, no. Since column operations overwrite the row operations for the elements in that column.

So, if I set all rows first, and then set all columns, the elements in the columns will be overwritten by the column operations.

Hence, the final matrix would have the columns set to the column operations performed last.

That might not be optimal.

Perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column allows me to set that row or column to any permutation, and operations on columns overwrite the corresponding elements in the rows.

Hence, I can think of the row operations as setting default values, and column operations as overriding specific columns.

So, perhaps I should set the rows with permutations that maximize the sum for the entire matrix, and then use column operations to overwrite columns where higher values can be placed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the sum I can achieve.

If I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would be n * (n*(n+1)/2) = n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform operations on all columns, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would also be n^2*(n+1)/2.

But since column operations overwrite row operations for the elements in those columns, the final sum might be higher if I carefully choose which columns to operate on after setting the rows.

Wait, actually, if I set all rows and then set all columns, the sum would still be n^2*(n+1)/2, because the columns overwrite the rows, but the sum remains the same.

So, perhaps I need a different strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform operations on n rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform operations on n columns, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But as I thought earlier, the sum would still be n^2*(n+1)/2.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

In the example with n=2, they achieved a sum of 7, which is higher than 2^2*(2+1)/2 = 4*3/2 = 6.

Hence, by performing operations in a specific order, they were able to get a higher sum.

So, perhaps there is a way to arrange the operations to get a higher sum.

Let me think about what determines the final value of each element in the matrix.

For each element a_{i,j}, its final value is determined by the last operation that sets it, either a row operation on row i or a column operation on column j.

Hence, if I perform a row operation on row i after a column operation on column j, then a_{i,j} will be set by the row operation.

Conversely, if I perform a column operation on column j after a row operation on row i, then a_{i,j} will be set by the column operation.

Therefore, the order of operations matters.

So, perhaps by carefully ordering the operations, I can maximize the sum.

Let me consider performing all column operations first, and then all row operations.

In that case, the row operations would overwrite the column operations for the corresponding rows.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I should interleave row and column operations.

Let me consider an ordering where I alternate between row and column operations.

For example, for n=2:

1. Type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]

3. Type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]

Then, the matrix would be:

After step 1:

Column 1 set to [2,1], so matrix is:

2 ?

1 ?

After step 2:

Row 1 set to [2,1], so matrix is:

2 1

1 ?

After step 3:

Row 2 set to [2,1], so matrix is:

2 1

2 1

Sum is 6.

Wait, same as before.

Hmm.

In the example, they did:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

Resulting in:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

So, by performing column operations after some row operations, they managed to have the column operation overwrite a row operation with a higher value.

In this case, column operation set a_{1,1} to 1, which was previously set to 1 by row operation, and a_{2,1} to 2, which was previously set to 1 by row operation.

Hence, a_{2,1} was increased from 1 to 2.

Similarly, a_{1,2} remains 2, and a_{2,2} remains 2.

Total sum 7.

So, by performing column operations after row operations, and choosing permutations where higher numbers are placed in positions that were previously set to lower numbers by row operations, we can increase the sum.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is to perform row operations first, setting rows to permutations that place higher numbers in positions that won't be overwritten by higher numbers in column operations, and then perform column operations to overwrite certain columns with higher numbers.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me try to think of a systematic way.

Suppose I perform row operations first, setting each row i to a permutation where the highest numbers are placed in columns that won't be overwritten by high numbers in column operations.

Then, perform column operations to set columns to permutations where the highest numbers are placed in rows that weren't already set to high numbers by row operations.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I perform n row operations and n column operations, for a total of 2n operations.

I need to choose which rows and columns to operate on and in what order.

I need to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column allows me to set that row or column to any permutation of 1 to n.

Hence, for each row operation, I can choose any permutation to set that row.

Similarly for column operations.

But since column operations overwrite row operations for the elements in those columns, I need to consider the interaction.

Let me consider that the final value of a_{i,j} is determined by the last operation that set it, either the last row operation on row i or the last column operation on column j.

Hence, if I perform operations in a certain order, I can control which operations overwrite which.

So, perhaps I should perform row operations first, setting rows to permutations that maximize the sum for the rows, and then perform column operations to overwrite specific columns with higher values.

Wait, but in the example, they performed two row operations and one column operation, achieving a higher sum.

So, maybe performing operations in a specific sequence allows me to maximize the sum.

Let me try to think of a general strategy.

Suppose I perform row operations in descending order of row indices, and column operations in ascending order of column indices.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should prioritize setting higher values in positions that are less likely to be overwritten by lower values.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the sum I can achieve.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, with appropriate permutations, perhaps the sum can be higher than n^2*(n+1)/2.

In the n=2 example, they achieved 7, which is higher than 4*3/2=6.

Hence, there must be a way to arrange the operations to get a higher sum.

Let me try to find a general formula for the maximum sum.

Looking at the example, for n=1, sum=1.

For n=2, sum=7.

For n=3, let's see what sum I can achieve.

If I perform row operations on rows 1,2,3 with permutations [3,2,1], and column operations on columns 1,2,3 with permutations [3,2,1].

But I need to think about the overwriting.

Suppose I perform row operations first:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [3,2,1]

Row 3: [3,2,1]

Then, perform column operations:

Column 1: [3,2,1]

Column 2: [3,2,1]

Column 3: [3,2,1]

Then, the matrix would be:

3 (from column 1) 3 (from column 2) 1 (from row 1)

2 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 1 (from row 2)

1 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 1 (from row 3)

Sum is 3+3+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 15.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

If I perform operations in a different order.

Suppose I perform column operations first:

Column 1: [3,2,1]

Column 2: [3,2,1]

Column 3: [3,2,1]

Then, perform row operations:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [3,2,1]

Row 3: [3,2,1]

Then, the matrix would be:

3 (from row 1) 2 (from row 1) 1 (from row 1)

3 (from row 2) 2 (from row 2) 1 (from row 2)

3 (from row 3) 2 (from row 3) 1 (from row 3)

Sum is 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 18.

Wait, that's higher than before.

But is it possible?

Wait, in this case, the row operations overwrite the column operations for the corresponding rows.

Hence, the final matrix is entirely determined by the last operations on each row or column.

In this case, since row operations were performed last, the matrix is entirely determined by the row operations, and the column operations are effectively overwritten.

Hence, the sum is 18, which seems higher.

But in the n=2 example, they achieved 7, which is higher than what I would get by only performing row operations.

Wait, for n=2, performing only row operations would give sum=6, but performing a combination of row and column operations allowed achieving 7.

So, perhaps for n=3, performing a combination of row and column operations can achieve a sum higher than 18.

Wait, but in the n=3 case, performing only row operations gives sum=18, and performing only column operations would also give sum=18.

If I perform both, perhaps I can get a higher sum.

Let me try performing row operations first, then column operations.

Suppose I perform row operations on rows 1,2,3 with [3,2,1], then column operations on columns 1,2,3 with [3,2,1].

As above, the matrix would be:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum=18.

Now, if I perform column operations first, then row operations.

Column operations on columns 1,2,3 with [3,2,1], then row operations on rows 1,2,3 with [3,2,1].

Then, the matrix would be:

3 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 1 (from column 3)

2 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 1 (from column 3)

1 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 1 (from column 3)

Sum=3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1=13.

Which is lower than 18.

So, performing column operations before row operations gives a lower sum.

Hence, perhaps performing row operations last maximizes the sum.

But in the n=2 example, performing two row operations and one column operation gave a higher sum than performing only row operations.

Wait, in that case, performing two row operations and one column operation gave sum=7, which is higher than performing only two row operations, which would give sum=6.

So, there must be a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform row operations on the first n operations, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform column operations on the first n columns, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But as I saw earlier, the sum might not increase.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform row operations on some rows and column operations on some columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of filling the matrix with the highest possible numbers in as many positions as possible, given the constraints of the operations.

Each operation on a row or column sets that entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

Hence, the highest number n can only be placed in positions that are set by operations.

Each position can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, with the last operation determining its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the number of positions that are set to n, then to n-1, and so on.

But since each row and column operation uses a permutation, I need to distribute the high numbers optimally across the matrix.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that each row operation allows me to set one n in that row, and each column operation allows me to set one n in that column.

But since operations can overwrite each other, I need to plan carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of covering the matrix with rows and columns, ensuring that as many positions as possible are covered by operations that set high numbers.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a pattern in small n.

For n=1:

Only one operation, setting a_{1,1}=1. Sum=1.

For n=2:

From the example, sum=7.

For n=3:

As above, sum=18 by performing row operations on all rows with [3,2,1].

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

If I perform row operations on rows 1 and 2 with [3,2,1], and column operations on column 1 with [3,2,1], what happens?

Matrix:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [3,2,1]

Row 3: [0,0,0]

Then column 1: [3,2,1]

So, matrix becomes:

3 (from column 1) 2 (from row 1) 1 (from row 1)

2 (from column 1) 2 (from row 2) 1 (from row 2)

1 (from column 1) 0 0

Sum=3+2+1 + 2+2+1 +1+0+0=11.

Which is less than 18.

So, not better.

What if I perform row operations on all rows and column operations on all columns, but choose permutations that maximize the sum.

For example, for n=3:

Row operations:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [3,2,1]

Row 3: [3,2,1]

Column operations:

Column 1: [3,2,1]

Column 2: [3,2,1]

Column 3: [3,2,1]

Then, since row operations are performed last, the matrix is:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum=18.

Is there a way to get higher than that?

Suppose I perform row operations on rows 1 and 2 with [3,2,1], and column operations on columns 1 and 3 with [3,2,1].

Then, matrix:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [3,2,1]

Row 3: [1,0,1]

Sum=3+2+1 +3+2+1 +1+0+1=12.

Worse than 18.

Another approach: perhaps I can perform row operations on the first k rows and column operations on the first m columns, choosing k and m appropriately.

But I need to generalize this for any n.

Let me try to think of the sum formula.

If I perform row operations on all rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would be n * (sum from 1 to n) = n * n(n+1)/2 = n^2(n+1)/2.

Similarly, performing column operations on all columns would also give the same sum.

But performing both might not increase the sum beyond that.

In the n=2 example, performing two row operations and one column operation gave sum=7, which is higher than performing only two row operations (sum=6).

So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as n^2(n+1)/2 + some additional sum from the overlapping operations.

I need to find a general formula for the maximum sum.

Let me try to find a pattern based on small n.

For n=1: sum=1.

For n=2: sum=7.

For n=3: sum=18.

Let me see what formula can generate these sums.

For n=1: 1.

For n=2: 7.

For n=3: 18.

Let me see:

n=1: 1^3 + 1^2 +1 =1, but sum=1.

n=2: 2^3 +2^2 +2=14, but sum=7.

n=3: 3^3 +3^2 +3=39, but sum=18.

Not matching.

Another attempt:

n=1: 1.

n=2: 7=1 + 6.

n=3: 18=1 + 6 + 11.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - n^2 + n.

For n=1: 1-1+1=1.

n=2: 8-4+2=6, but actual sum=7.

n=3: 27-9+3=21, but actual sum=18.

Not matching.

Another idea: sum = n * (n^2 + 1)/2.

For n=1: 1*(1+1)/2=1.

n=2:2*(4+1)/2=5, but actual sum=7.

n=3:3*(9+1)/2=15, but actual sum=18.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps sum = n * (n^2 + n + 2)/2.

For n=1:1*(1+1+2)/2=2, not matching.

n=2:2*(4+2+2)/2=8, not matching.

n=3:3*(9+3+2)/2=21, not matching.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform row operations on the first k rows, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and column operations on the remaining n - k columns, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, the sum would be k * (sum from 1 to n) + (n - k) * (sum from 1 to n).

But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each operation on a row or column sets that row or column to the chosen permutation, and the final value is determined by the last operation that set that element.

Hence, for each element, its value is determined by the last operation that set it, either through its row or its column.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the number of elements set to n, then to n-1, and so on.

But since each operation sets an entire row or column, I need to cover as much of the matrix with operations that set high values.

This sounds similar to covering the matrix with rows and columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of operations used.

I have up to 2n operations to use.

So, for n rows and n columns, I can perform operations on up to 2n rows and columns.

But I need to optimize how I use these operations to maximize the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can perform operations on n rows and n columns, but choose which rows and columns to operate on and in what order.

But I need to consider that operations on columns overwrite operations on rows for the elements in those columns.

So, perhaps I should perform operations on all rows first, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform operations on specific columns to set higher values in those columns.

But in the n=2 example, they performed two row operations and one column operation to achieve sum=7.

Similarly, for n=3, performing three row operations and three column operations might give a higher sum than just performing row operations alone.

Wait, in n=3, performing row operations on all three rows gives sum=18.

If I perform column operations on all three columns, overwriting certain elements, would the sum increase?

Let's see.

Suppose I perform row operations on rows 1,2,3 with [3,2,1], then column operations on columns 1,2,3 with [3,2,1].

Then, the matrix would be:

3 (from row 1) 2 (from row 1) 1 (from row 1)

3 (from row 2) 2 (from row 2) 1 (from row 2)

3 (from row 3) 2 (from row 3) 1 (from row 3)

Sum=18.

Now, if I perform column operations first, setting columns to [3,2,1], and then row operations setting rows to [3,2,1], the matrix would be:

3 (from row 1) 2 (from row 1) 1 (from row 1)

2 (from row 2) 2 (from row 2) 1 (from row 2)

1 (from row 3) 2 (from row 3) 1 (from row 3)

Sum=13.

Which is less than 18.

Hence, performing row operations last seems better.

Is there a way to perform operations to get a sum higher than 18 for n=3?

Let me try performing row operations on rows 1 and 3 with [3,2,1], and column operations on columns 1 and 2 with [3,2,1].

Then, matrix would be:

Row 1: [3,2,1]

Row 2: [2,2,1]

Row 3: [3,2,1]

Sum=3+2+1 +2+2+1 +3+2+1=16.

Still less than 18.

Another attempt: perform row operations on rows 1,2,3 with [3,2,1], and column operations on columns 1 and 3 with [3,2,1].

Then, matrix:

Row 1: [3 (from column 1), 2 (from row 1), 1 (from column 3)]

Row 2: [2 (from column 1), 2 (from row 2), 1 (from column 3)]

Row 3: [1 (from column 1), 2 (from row 3), 1 (from column 3)]

Sum=3+2+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=15.

Less than 18.

So, performing operations in different ways doesn't seem to give a higher sum than 18 for n=3.

Hence, perhaps for n=3, the maximum sum is 18.

Similarly, for n=2, the maximum sum is 7.

For n=1, it's 1.

Is there a general formula for the sum?

Let me see:

n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=18

n=4: let's see what sum I can achieve.

Performing row operations on all four rows with [4,3,2,1], the sum would be 4+3+2+1 multiplied by 4, which is 40.

Is there a way to get higher than that by performing column operations as well?

If I perform column operations on all four columns with [4,3,2,1], overwriting certain elements, would the sum increase?

Let's see.

Starting with row operations:

Row 1: [4,3,2,1]

Row 2: [4,3,2,1]

Row 3: [4,3,2,1]

Row 4: [4,3,2,1]

Sum=4+3+2+1 multiplied by 4=40.

Now, performing column operations on all four columns with [4,3,2,1]:

Column 1: [4,3,2,1]

Column 2: [4,3,2,1]

Column 3: [4,3,2,1]

Column 4: [4,3,2,1]

Then, the matrix would be:

4 (from column 1) 4 (from column 2) 4 (from column 3) 4 (from column 4)

3 (from column 1) 3 (from column 2) 3 (from column 3) 3 (from column 4)

2 (from column 1) 2 (from column 2) 2 (from column 3) 2 (from column 4)

1 (from column 1) 1 (from column 2) 1 (from column 3) 1 (from column 4)

Sum=4+4+4+4 +3+3+3+3 +2+2+2+2 +1+1+1+1=4*4 + 3*4 + 2*4 + 1*4=40.

Same as before.

Is there a way to arrange operations to get a higher sum?

If I perform row operations on rows 1,2,3,4 with [4,3,2,1], and column operations on columns 1 and 3 with [4,3,2,1], then the matrix would be:

Row 1: [4 (col1), 3 (row1), 4 (col3), 1 (row1)]

Row 2: [3 (col1), 3 (row2), 2 (col3), 1 (row2)]

Row 3: [2 (col1), 3 (row3), 4 (col3), 1 (row3)]

Row 4: [1 (col1), 3 (row4), 2 (col3), 1 (row4)]

Sum=4+3+4+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+3+4+1 +1+3+2+1=35.

Less than 40.

Hence, performing operations in different ways doesn't seem to increase the sum beyond what is achieved by performing row operations on all rows with [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Hence, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing row operations on all rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and possibly performing column operations on some columns to overwrite certain elements with higher values.

But in the n=2 example, performing two row operations and one column operation gave a higher sum than performing two row operations alone.

So, perhaps there's a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps I can perform row operations on some rows and column operations on some columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column allows me to set that row or column to any permutation, not necessarily [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Maybe choosing different permutations can lead to a higher sum.

But the sum is maximized when the highest numbers are placed in as many positions as possible.

Hence, perhaps I need to maximize the number of n's, then n-1's, and so on.

Given that each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, each operation can place one n in its row or column.

Hence, performing operations on all rows allows placing n's in all positions of those rows, but column operations can overwrite those n's with lower numbers.

Hence, to maximize the sum, I need to minimize the overwriting of higher numbers with lower numbers.

Hence, perhaps performing row operations on all rows with [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then performing column operations on columns where I want to set higher numbers.

Wait, but in practice, it doesn't seem to increase the sum beyond what's achieved by row operations alone.

Hence, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing row operations on all rows with [n, n-1, ..., 1], giving a sum of n * (n*(n+1)/2) = n^2*(n+1)/2.

For n=1: 1

For n=2: 4*3/2=6, but example shows 7.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

In the n=2 example, performing two row operations and one column operation gave sum=7, which is higher than 6.

Hence, my assumption that sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 is incorrect.

Hence, perhaps there's a different formula.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Looking at the n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=18

n=4: sum=40

Let me see the differences:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7 (difference from n=1: 6)

n=3: 18 (difference from n=2: 11)

n=4: 40 (difference from n=3: 22)

Looking at the differences: 6,11,22.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum = n^3 - n^2 + n.

For n=1:1-1+1=1

n=2:8-4+2=6, but actual sum=7.

n=3:27-9+3=21, but actual sum=18.

Not matching.

Another idea: sum = n^3 - n^2 + n +1.

n=1:1-1+1+1=2, not matching.

n=2:8-4+2+1=7, matches n=2.

n=3:27-9+3+1=22, but actual sum=18.

Not matching.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform row operations on the first k rows, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and column operations on the first m columns, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, the sum would be k*n*(n+1)/2 + m*n*(n+1)/2 - k*m*(n+1)/2.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps sum = k*n*(n+1)/2 + m*n*(n+1)/2 - k*m*(n+1)/2.

But I need to think about how the operations interact.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of operations used.

I have up to 2n operations.

Each operation allows me to set a row or a column to a permutation of 1 to n.

Hence, I can set up to 2n rows and columns, but since there are only n rows and n columns, performing operations on more than n rows or columns would be redundant in some way.

Wait, but I can perform operations multiple times on the same row or column, but each operation overwrites the previous ones for that row or column.

Hence, only the last operation on a row or column matters.

Hence, effectively, I can choose to perform operations on up to 2n rows and columns, but since there are only n rows and n columns, performing operations on the same row or column multiple times is useless, as only the last operation counts.

Hence, in reality, I can perform operations on up to 2n distinct rows and columns, but since there are only n rows and n columns, performing operations on all rows and all columns would total 2n operations.

But in practice, as I saw earlier, performing operations on all rows and all columns doesn't necessarily give a higher sum than performing operations only on rows.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is to perform operations on all rows with [n, n-1, ..., 1], achieving sum n^2*(n+1)/2, and possibly performing additional column operations to overwrite certain columns with higher values.

But in practice, it doesn't seem to increase the sum beyond n^2*(n+1)/2.

Hence, perhaps the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 + some adjustment based on the interactions between row and column operations.

But I need a better understanding.

Let me consider that each element in the matrix can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, with the last operation determining its value.

Hence, for each element, its value is determined by the last operation that set it.

Hence, I need to maximize the sum by choosing operations that set as many high values as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can prioritize setting the highest possible values in positions that are less likely to be overwritten by lower values.

But I'm not sure how to formalize this.

Let me consider that performing a row operation sets that row to the chosen permutation, and performing a column operation sets that column to the chosen permutation, overwriting the values set by row operations for the elements in that column.

Hence, if I perform a row operation on row i and a column operation on column j, the element a_{i,j} will be set by the column operation.

Hence, by performing operations on rows and columns, I can control which operations overwrite which.

So, perhaps I can arrange the operations in such a way that the overwriting operations set higher values in the positions where row operations set lower values.

In this way, I can increase the sum.

This seems similar to what was done in the n=2 example.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is to perform row operations first, setting rows to permutations that place higher numbers in positions that won't be overwritten by lower numbers in column operations, and then perform column operations to set higher numbers in specific columns.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me try to think of a systematic way to maximize the sum.

Suppose I perform row operations on the first n rows, setting each row i to a permutation that places n in column n - i +1.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform row operations on all rows, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform column operations on the first n -1 columns, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, the matrix would have the first n-1 columns set to [n, n-1, ..., 1] by column operations, and the last column set
