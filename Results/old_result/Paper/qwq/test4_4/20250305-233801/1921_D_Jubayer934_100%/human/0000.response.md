Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have Petya's array `a` of `n` integers and Vasya has `m` integers `b` where `m >= n`. Vasya needs to choose `n` integers from `b`, arrange them in some order to form array `c`, and make the total difference `D = sum(|a_i - c_i| for i from 1 to n)` as large as possible.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

First, I need to understand what makes the difference `|a_i - c_i|` large. The difference is maximized when `c_i` is as far away as possible from `a_i`.

Given that Vasya can choose any `n` elements from `b` and arrange them in any order, he should select the elements that can maximize the differences when paired with elements of `a`.

I need to think about how to pair elements of `a` with elements of `c` to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

One approach that comes to mind is to sort both arrays and pair the smallest elements of one with the largest elements of the other.

Let me consider sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. Then, pairing `a[i]` with `b[i]` might give me the maximum differences.

Wait, but that might not always be the case. Let's think of an example.

Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [10, 20, 30]`.

If I sort `a` ascending: `[1, 2, 3]`

Sort `b` descending: `[30, 20, 10]`

Then, `D = |1-30| + |2-20| + |3-10| = 29 + 18 + 7 = 54`

Is this the maximum? Let's see other pairings.

If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[2]=10`: `|1-10|=9`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=20`: `|2-20|=18`

`a[2]=3` with `b[0]=30`: `|3-30|=27`

Total `D = 9 + 18 + 27 = 54`. Same as before.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=30`: `|1-30|=29`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=20`: `|2-20|=18`

`a[2]=3` with `b[2]=10`: `|3-10|=7`

Total `D = 29 + 18 + 7 = 54`. Again the same.

So in this case, it seems that sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending and pairing accordingly gives the maximum difference.

Let me try another example.

`a = [1, 1, 1]`, `b = [1, 1, 1, 1]`

Here, no matter how I pair them, `D = 0`, which makes sense because all elements are the same.

Another example:

`a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Pairing `a[i]` with `b[i]` in sorted order gives `D = 0`, which is the maximum possible in this case, as all elements are the same.

Wait, but the problem says Vasya wants to make the array as different as possible. So in this case, `D` is indeed 0, which is correct.

Another example:

`a = [1, 2, 4, 6]`, `b = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

Sort `a`: `[1, 2, 4, 6]`

Sort `b` descending: `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]`

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=9`: `|1-9|=8`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=7`: `|2-7|=5`

`a[2]=4` with `b[2]=5`: `|4-5|=1`

`a[3]=6` with `b[3]=3`: `|6-3|=3`

Total `D = 8 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 17`

Is this the maximum? Let's try another pairing.

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[4]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[3]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

`a[2]=4` with `b[2]=5`: `|4-5|=1`

`a[3]=6` with `b[1]=7`: `|6-7|=1`

Total `D = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is less than 17.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[2]=5`: `|1-5|=4`

`a[1]=2` with `b[3]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

`a[2]=4` with `b[1]=7`: `|4-7|=3`

`a[3]=6` with `b[0]=9`: `|6-9|=3`

Total `D = 4 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11`, which is still less than 17.

So, the first pairing seems to give the maximum difference.

Wait, but let's consider another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=7`: `|1-7|=6`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=9`: `|2-9|=7`

`a[2]=4` with `b[3]=3`: `|4-3|=1`

`a[3]=6` with `b[2]=5`: `|6-5|=1`

Total `D = 6 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 15`, which is less than 17.

So, the initial pairing seems to give the maximum difference.

Let me consider another example where this might not hold.

`a = [1, 3]`, `b = [2, 4]`

Sort `a`: `[1, 3]`

Sort `b` descending: `[4, 2]`

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=4`: `|1-4|=3`

`a[1]=3` with `b[1]=2`: `|3-2|=1`

Total `D = 4`

Is there a better pairing? Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=2`: `|1-2|=1`

`a[1]=3` with `b[0]=4`: `|3-4|=1`

Total `D = 2`, which is less than 4.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=4`: `|1-4|=3`

`a[1]=3` with `b[1]=2`: `|3-2|=1`

Total `D = 4`, same as before.

So, again, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

Let me try another example.

`a = [1, 3]`, `b = [1, 3]`

Sort `a`: `[1, 3]`

Sort `b` descending: `[3, 1]`

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=3` with `b[1]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`

Is there a better pairing? If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=3` with `b[0]=3`: `|3-3|=0`

Total `D = 0`, which is less than 4.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=3` with `b[1]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`, same as before.

So, again, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

From these examples, it seems that sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending and pairing them accordingly gives the maximum difference.

Is there a case where this might not hold?

Let me think of a case where this approach fails.

Suppose `a = [1, 2]`, `b = [3, 1]`

Sort `a`: `[1, 2]`

Sort `b` descending: `[3, 1]`

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=1`: `|2-1|=1`

Total `D = 3`

Is there a better pairing? Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

Total `D = 1`, which is less than 3.

Another pairing: same as the first one.

So, again, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

Hmm, it seems consistent. Maybe this approach is correct.

But let's think about it more generally.

We want to maximize `sum(|a_i - c_i|)` where `c` is a permutation of any `n` elements from `b`.

The strategy of sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending and pairing them seems to work in all the examples I've tried.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, this seems related to the rearrangement inequality, which states that for two sequences sorted in opposite orders and paired accordingly, the sum of their products is maximized.

But in this case, we have absolute differences.

Wait, perhaps we can think of it as maximizing the sum of absolute differences.

In general, to maximize the sum of absolute differences between two sequences, pairing the smallest elements of one sequence with the largest elements of the other sequence tends to maximize the differences.

That makes intuitive sense.

Therefore, sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending and pairing them should give the maximum difference.

Given that, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

temp = -1

ans = []

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

if temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

First, it reads the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, then reads array `a` and sorts it in ascending order, keeping the first `n` elements.

Wait, but `a` has exactly `n` elements, so sorting and taking `[:n]` is fine.

Then, it reads array `b`, sorts it in descending order, and keeps the first `m` elements. But since `m` is already the length of `b`, sorting and taking `[:m]` doesn't change it.

Then, it iterates through the first `n` elements and for each `i`, it checks if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

Wait, `b` is sorted in descending order, so `b[-1]` is the smallest element in `b`.

`b[-(n - i)]` is a bit confusing. Let's see with an example.

Suppose `n = 4`, `m = 6`, `i` from `0` to `3`.

For `i = 0`, `b[-(4 - 0)] = b[-4]`, which is the fourth smallest element in `b` (since `b` is sorted descending, `b[-4]` is the fourth largest).

Wait, no. If `b` is sorted descending, `b[0]` is the largest, `b[1]` is the second largest, and `b[-1]` is the smallest.

So `b[-(n - i)]` for `i = 0`, `n = 4`, is `b[-4]`, which is the fourth smallest in `b`.

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps the logic here is to consider two possible pairings:

1. Pair `a[i]` with `b[i]` (largest with largest, second largest with second largest, etc.)

2. Pair `a[i]` with `b[m - n + i]` (largest with smallest, second largest with second smallest, etc.)

But I'm not sure.

The code seems to be trying to decide between pairing with `b[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, but the indices are getting confusing.

Let me try to simplify the approach.

Given that sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending and pairing them seems to give the maximum difference, perhaps the code should just do that.

Here's a simpler approach:

- Sort `a` in ascending order.

- Sort `b` in descending order.

- Pair `a[i]` with `b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

- Compute `D = sum(|a[i] - b[i]| for i in 0 to n-1)`.

This should give the maximum difference.

But in the given code, there's additional logic to check if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and if so, switch to pairing with `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements.

This seems unnecessary based on my earlier examples, where simply pairing `a[i]` with `b[i]` gave the maximum difference.

Perhaps there are cases where pairing with the opposite end gives a larger difference.

Let me think of such a case.

Suppose `a = [1, 2]`, `b = [3, 1]`

Sort `a`: [1, 2]

Sort `b` descending: [3, 1]

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=1`: `|2-1|=1`

Total `D = 3`

Is there a better pairing? If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

Total `D = 1`, which is worse.

Another pairing: same as the first one.

So, no better pairing.

Another example:

`a = [1, 2, 3]`, `b = [3, 2, 1]`

Sort `a`: [1, 2, 3]

Sort `b` descending: [3, 2, 1]

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=2`: `|2-2|=0`

`a[2]=3` with `b[2]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`

Is there a better pairing? If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[2]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=2`: `|2-2|=0`

`a[2]=3` with `b[0]=3`: `|3-3|=0`

Total `D = 0`, which is worse.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=2`: `|1-2|=1`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

`a[2]=3` with `b[2]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`, same as before.

So, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

Wait, but let's consider another example.

`a = [1, 2]`, `b = [100, 1]`

Sort `a`: [1, 2]

Sort `b` descending: [100, 1]

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=100`: `|1-100|=99`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=1`: `|2-1|=1`

Total `D = 100`

Is there a better pairing? If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=100`: `|2-100|=98`

Total `D = 98`, which is less than 100.

Another pairing: same as the first one.

So, again, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

Hmm, it seems consistent.

Maybe the additional logic in the code is unnecessary.

Perhaps the code is trying to handle some specific cases where pairing with the opposite end gives a better difference.

Let me look at the code again.

It seems that for each `i`, it checks if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

If it is, set `temp = i` and break.

Then, for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, it appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

I think the idea here is to switch to pairing with the opposite end once it finds a point where pairing with the opposite end gives a larger difference.

But based on my earlier examples, it seems that pairing `a[i]` with `b[i]` (sorted as described) always gives the maximum difference.

Therefore, this additional logic might be unnecessary and could potentially lead to incorrect results.

Let me think of a case where this logic might fail.

Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `b = [3, 1, 2]`

Sort `a`: [1, 2, 3]

Sort `b` descending: [3, 2, 1]

Pair `a[0]=1` with `b[0]=3`: `|1-3|=2`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=2`: `|2-2|=0`

`a[2]=3` with `b[2]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`

Is there a better pairing? If I pair `a[0]=1` with `b[2]=1`: `|1-1|=0`

`a[1]=2` with `b[1]=2`: `|2-2|=0`

`a[2]=3` with `b[0]=3`: `|3-3|=0`

Total `D = 0`, which is worse.

Another pairing: `a[0]=1` with `b[1]=2`: `|1-2|=1`

`a[1]=2` with `b[0]=3`: `|2-3|=1`

`a[2]=3` with `b[2]=1`: `|3-1|=2`

Total `D = 4`, same as before.

So, again, the initial pairing gives the maximum difference.

I can't think of a case where pairing with the opposite end gives a better difference.

Therefore, I think the additional logic in the code is unnecessary and could potentially lead to incorrect results.

A simpler and correct approach would be:

- Sort `a` in ascending order.

- Sort `b` in descending order.

- Pair `a[i]` with `b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

- Compute `D = sum(|a[i] - b[i]| for i in 0 to n-1)`.

This should give the maximum possible difference.

Given that, I think the provided program is incorrect because it has unnecessary and potentially harmful logic.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
