Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes and he wants to build a tower using these cubes. He can perform two kinds of moves: either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. He can do this for a total of n moves, and I need to figure out if it's possible that after these n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

First, I need to understand the initial state. The tower starts with no cubes, right? So, it's empty initially. Now, each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top.

Let me think about this step by step. Suppose n is 1 and m is 1. So, in one move, if he adds a cube, the tower has 1 cube, which matches m. So, that should be "Yes". Another case: n is 1 and m is 0. If he removes a cube, but initially, there are no cubes, so he can't remove anything. So, that should be "No". Wait, but the problem says "the tower doesn't have any cubes initially", so removing a cube from an empty tower isn't possible. So, in that case, the only possibility is to add a cube, resulting in 1 cube.

Let me look at another example. If n is 2 and m is 0. Possible sequences:

1. Add a cube (tower has 1 cube), then remove a cube (tower back to 0 cubes).

2. Remove a cube (but can't remove from an empty tower), which isn't allowed. So, only the first sequence is valid, ending with 0 cubes. So, "Yes".

Another case: n is 2 and m is 2.

Sequence:

1. Add a cube (1 cube).

2. Add another cube (2 cubes).

So, "Yes".

But what if n is 2 and m is 1?

Possible sequences:

1. Add, then remove: ends with 0.

2. Remove (invalid), then add: invalid.

So, only the first sequence is possible, which ends with 0, not 1. So, "No".

Wait, but if he removes first, which is invalid, so the only valid sequence is add then remove, ending with 0.

So, for n=2 and m=1, it's "No".

Another example from the sample input: n=3, m=3.

Possible sequence: add, add, add. Ends with 3 cubes. So, "Yes".

n=2, m=4.

Is this possible? Let's see:

Starting with 0, in two moves:

Add, add: 2 cubes.

Add, remove: 1 cube.

Remove (invalid), add: invalid.

Remove, remove: invalid.

So, only possible endings are 0 or 2 cubes. Not 4. So, "No".

Wait, but m=4 is greater than n=2, which seems impossible because he can't have more cubes than the number of moves he makes, assuming he's only adding cubes. But in this case, n=2 can only lead to 0 or 2 cubes, not 4. So, "No" is correct.

Another sample: n=5, m=3.

Possible sequence:

Add, add, add, add, remove: 4 -1 = 3.

So, "Yes".

Another possible sequence:

Add, add, add, remove, add: 3-1+1=3.

Also ends with 3.

So, "Yes".

From these examples, I need to find a general condition for when it's possible to end with m cubes after n moves.

Let me think about the maximum and minimum number of cubes possible.

The maximum number of cubes is n, if he adds a cube in every move.

The minimum is 0, if he adds and removes in such a way that they cancel out.

But there are constraints because he can't remove from an empty tower.

So, the number of removes can't exceed the number of adds at any point in the sequence.

This sounds like it could be related to Catalan numbers or balanced sequences, but maybe that's too complicated for this problem.

Let me think in terms of the difference between adds and removes.

Let a be the number of adds, and r be the number of removes.

Then, a + r = n (total moves).

The final number of cubes is a - r = m.

So, we have two equations:

a + r = n

a - r = m

Solving these, we get a = (n + m)/2 and r = (n - m)/2.

For these to be integers, (n + m) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, which implies that n and m must be both even or both odd.

Also, a and r must be non-negative integers, since you can't have negative moves.

So, a = (n + m)/2 >= 0

And r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

But since n and m are both positive integers, and a and r must be integers, (n + m) must be even, and n >= m.

Wait, no, n can be less than m if m is negative, but m is the number of cubes, which is at least 0.

Wait, the problem says m >=1, but actually, looking back, m >=0? Wait, the input constraints are 1 <= n, m <=100, but in my earlier examples, m=0 was allowed, but according to the problem, m >=1. Wait, let me check the problem again.

Looking back at the problem, it says "the tower has exactly m cubes", and m can be 0? In the second test case, m=4, and in the note, m=0 is possible. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says m >=1. Wait, no, in the input section, it says "1 <= n, m <=100", so m starts from 1.

But in my earlier reasoning, m can be 0, but according to the problem, m >=1.

Wait, but in the sample input, there is a case with m=0. Wait, let's check the sample input.

Sample input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

So, m can be 0, but in the input, m starts from 1. Wait, in the note, it mentions m=0, but in the input constraints, m >=1.

Wait, the problem says "1 <= n, m <=100", so m starts from 1.

But in my earlier reasoning, m can be 0, but according to the problem, m >=1.

So, in the program, m will never be 0 as per the problem, so I don't need to handle m=0.

But in reality, m=0 is possible if n is even and m=0 is achievable.

But according to the problem, m >=1, so m=0 isn't possible.

Wait, but in the note, it says "In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No"."

So, m=0 is possible, but according to the problem, m >=1.

Wait, maybe the sample input has m=0, but the problem says m >=1.

Wait, no, in the sample input, all m are >=1, but in the note, it mentions m=0.

Wait, the note says: "In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No"."

So, it's possible to have m=0, but in the problem, m starts from 1.

So, in the program, when m=0 is possible, but according to the problem, m >=1.

Wait, to avoid confusion, I'll assume m >=1 as per the problem statement.

Now, back to the condition.

From a = (n + m)/2 and r = (n - m)/2, both a and r must be integers and non-negative.

So, (n + m) must be even, and n >= m.

Wait, n can be less than m if a > n, but a = (n + m)/2, so if n < m, then a > n, which is impossible.

Wait, no, if n < m, then a = (n + m)/2 > n only if m > n, which is possible, but in that case, r = (n - m)/2 < 0, which isn't allowed.

So, n must be >= m.

But in the sample input, n=2, m=4, which has n < m, and the answer is "No", which matches.

So, n >= m is a necessary condition.

But also, (n + m) must be even, so that a and r are integers.

So, the conditions are:

1. n >= m

2. (n + m) is even

If both these conditions are satisfied, then it's possible to have exactly m cubes after n moves.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Let me test this with the sample inputs.

First test case: n=3, m=3.

n >= m: 3 >= 3

n + m = 6, which is even.

So, "Yes", which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=2, m=4.

n >= m: 2 >= 4? No.

So, "No", matches the sample output.

Third test case: n=5, m=3.

n >= m: 5 >= 3

n + m = 8, which is even.

So, "Yes", matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=2, m=0.

n >= m: 2 >= 0

n + m = 2, which is even.

So, "Yes", which matches the note.

But according to the problem, m >=1, so m=0 isn't allowed.

But in reality, m=0 is possible if n is even.

But per the problem, m >=1.

So, in the program, m starts from 1.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif b % 2 == c % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, it takes t test cases, then for each test case, reads n and m.

Then, it checks:

- if b == c: print 'YES'

- elif b < c: print 'NO'

- elif b % 2 == c % 2: print 'Yes'

- else: print 'No'

Comparing this with my derived conditions:

- If n == m, then "Yes"

- If n < m, then "No"

- If n > m and n and m have the same parity (both even or both odd), then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Which matches the conditions I derived.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, the conditions are:

1. n >= m

2. (n + m) is even

So, the program seems to be implementing this correctly.

But in the program, it has 'YES' and 'Yes' inconsistently. According to the problem, it should be "Yes" or "No", case doesn't matter.

So, it's acceptable.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But let me check with some test cases.

Test case 1: n=3, m=3

n == m: prints 'YES' which should be 'Yes', but case doesn't matter.

Test case 2: n=2, m=4

n < m: prints 'NO'

Test case 3: n=5, m=3

n > m and n + m = 8, which is even: prints 'Yes'

Another test case: n=4, m=2

n > m and n + m =6, even: 'Yes'

n=3, m=2

n > m but n + m =5, odd: 'No'

n=1, m=1

n == m: 'YES'

n=1, m=0

But m >=1, so m=0 isn't allowed.

Another test case: n=4, m=0

n >= m, n + m =4, even: should be 'Yes', but m >=1, so m=0 isn't allowed.

But in reality, m=0 is possible, but per problem, m >=1.

So, the program seems correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
