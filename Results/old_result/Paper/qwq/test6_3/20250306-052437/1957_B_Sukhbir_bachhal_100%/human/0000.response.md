Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. I need to create a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I have to maximize the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3. The number of 1's in the binary representation of 3 is 2, which is higher than either 1 or 2 alone.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR all these numbers, the result has as many 1's in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR result, I want as many bits to be set to 1 as possible in the OR of all the numbers. This means that across all the numbers in the sequence, I want as many different bits to be set to 1 as I can get.

One way to think about this is to distribute the bits across the numbers in such a way that when OR'ed, they cover as many bit positions as possible.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding. Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 3

Possible sequences:

- [1, 2]: sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, having two 1's.

- [0, 3]: sum is 3, and 0 | 3 = 3, same as above.

- [3, 0]: same as above.

- [1, 2]: same as above.

So, in this case, any of these sequences work, and the output shows [1, 2].

Another example:

n = 2, k = 5

Possible sequences:

- [5, 0]: 5 | 0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1's.

- [4, 1]: 4 | 1 = 5, same as above.

- [3, 2]: 3 | 2 = 3, which is 011 in binary, having two 1's.

So, in this case, [5, 0] is chosen, which is fine.

Wait, in this case, is there a sequence that can give more than two 1's in the OR result? Let's see.

- [1, 4]: 1 | 4 = 5, which is 101, two 1's.

- [2, 3]: 2 | 3 = 3, which is 011, two 1's.

Seems like two is the maximum possible for this k=5.

Wait, but k=5 in binary is 101, which has two 1's. Is it possible to get three 1's in the OR result? Let's see.

To get three 1's, I need at least three bits to be set to 1 in the OR result. But k=5 is 101, which only has two bits set. So, it's impossible to have three 1's in the OR result because the sum is 5, which doesn't have a third bit set.

Wait, but actually, if I choose numbers that have additional bits set, but their sum is still 5, maybe I can get more 1's in the OR result.

For example:

- [5,0]: OR is 5, which is 101.

- [4,1]: OR is 5, same as above.

- [2,3]: OR is 3, which is 011.

- [1,4]: OR is 5, 101.

- [3,2]: OR is 3, 011.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR result is two.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=2 and k=5, the output is [5,0], which is correct because the OR is 5, which has two 1's, and it's the maximum possible.

Another example:

n=6, k=51

The output is [3,1,1,32,2,12], and their OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 32 | 12 | 3 | 2 | 1 = 32 is 100000, 12 is 001100, 3 is 000011, 2 is 000010, 1 is 000001. OR'ing them gives 101111, which is 47, which has five 1's in binary.

Is this the maximum possible? Let's see.

k=51 is 110011 in binary, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 110011. So, the highest bit is 32.

In the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which has five 1's.

Is it possible to get six 1's?

To get six 1's, I need to have all six bits set in the OR result. But k=51 is 110011, which has the 6th bit (32), 5th bit (16), 2nd bit (2), and 1st bit (1) set. The 4th and 3rd bits are zero.

So, to get all six bits set, I need to have numbers in the sequence that set the 4th and 3rd bits.

But the sum is 51, which is 110011. If I have numbers that set additional bits, as long as their sum is 51, it's acceptable.

For example, if I have a number that sets the 3rd bit (4), and another that sets the 4th bit (8), but their sum should be such that the total sum is 51.

But, wait, if I set the 3rd and 4th bits, I need to make sure that the sum remains 51.

Wait, but in the OR operation, setting additional bits in different numbers will set those bits in the OR result.

So, for example, if I have a number with the 4th bit set (8) and another with the 3rd bit set (4), then OR'ing them with the other numbers will set those bits in the OR result.

But in this case, to maximize the number of 1's in the OR result, I need to set as many bits as possible across the sequence.

Given that the sum is 51, which is 110011 in binary, I need to make sure that the numbers in the sequence cover as many bit positions as possible.

In the given sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is 47, having five 1's.

Is it possible to set the 4th bit (8) and the 3rd bit (4) in addition to what's already set?

Wait, 51 is 110011, which includes the 6th bit (32), 5th bit (16), 2nd bit (2), and 1st bit (1). The 4th and 3rd bits are zero.

So, to set the 4th and 3rd bits in the OR result, I need to have numbers in the sequence that have those bits set.

But since the sum is 51, I need to make sure that adding numbers with those bits set doesn't exceed the sum.

Wait, but the OR operation doesn't care about the sum directly; it only cares about which bits are set in at least one number in the sequence.

So, to maximize the number of 1's in the OR result, I need to include numbers that set as many different bits as possible.

Given that, I can include numbers that set specific bits, as long as their sum is k.

This seems a bit tricky. Let me think of a general strategy.

One possible strategy is to include numbers that are powers of two, because each power of two sets exactly one bit.

So, if I include multiple powers of two, their OR will have multiple bits set.

But I also need to make sure that their sum is k.

So, perhaps I can include as many distinct powers of two as possible without exceeding k, and then adjust with the remaining sum.

Wait, but powers of two might not be sufficient if k is not a sum of distinct powers of two.

For example, if k is 3, which is 11 in binary, it's a sum of two powers of two: 2 and 1.

In that case, including both 2 and 1 in the sequence would set both the first and second bits in the OR result.

If n is 2, as in the second test case, that's what's happening: [1,2], sum is 3, OR is 3, which has two 1's.

Similarly, for k=5 (101), which is 4 + 1, including both would set the first, third bits.

Wait, but 5 is already 101, which has two 1's. Including [5,0] gives the same OR.

So, in that case, including [4,1] also gives OR=5, same as [5,0].

Including [3,2] gives OR=3, which is 011, also two 1's.

So, in that case, it's not possible to get more than two 1's in the OR result.

Because k=5 doesn't have more than two bits set.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=2, k=5, the output is [5,0], which is correct.

Now, in the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, the output is [3,1,1,32,2,12], which gives OR=101111, which is 47 in binary, having five 1's.

Is it possible to get six 1's?

Well, 51 is 110011, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1.

To set the 4th and 5th bits (8 and 16), I need to include numbers that set those bits.

But 16 is already included in 51, but in binary, 51 is 110011, so the 5th bit is already set.

Wait, no: 51 in binary is 110011, which is:

- 1st bit: 1 (2^0)

- 2nd bit: 1 (2^1)

- 3rd bit: 0 (2^2)

- 4th bit: 0 (2^3)

- 5th bit: 0 (2^4)

- 6th bit: 1 (2^5)

Wait, no, actually, 51 in binary is 110011, which corresponds to:

- 1st bit: 1 (1)

- 2nd bit: 1 (2)

- 3rd bit: 0 (0)

- 4th bit: 0 (0)

- 5th bit: 1 (16)

- 6th bit: 1 (32)

So, 1 + 2 + 16 + 32 = 51.

So, in binary, 51 is 110011.

Now, in the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], let's see which bits are set:

- 3: 000011 (1st and 2nd bits)

- 1: 000001 (1st bit)

- 1: 000001 (1st bit)

- 32: 100000 (6th bit)

- 2: 000010 (2nd bit)

- 12: 001100 (3rd and 4th bits)

OR'ing all these together: 100000 | 000001 | 000001 | 100000 | 000010 | 001100 = 101111, which is 47 in decimal, with five 1's.

Is it possible to get six 1's?

To get six 1's, I need to set all six bits in the OR result.

But k=51 is 110011, which has the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th bits set.

So, to set the 3rd and 4th bits as well, I need to include numbers that set the 3rd and 4th bits.

But the sum has to be 51.

So, for example, if I include a number with the 3rd bit set (4), and another with the 4th bit set (8), their sum would be 12.

But I already have 51, so I need to make sure that including these doesn't exceed the total sum.

Wait, but since it's the OR, including these numbers would set those bits in the OR result, but their actual values would need to be part of the sum.

So, if I include 4 and 8 in the sequence, I need to make sure that the sum of all numbers is 51.

In the given sequence, they have 3,1,1,32,2,12, which sum to 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51.

So, in this sequence, they have included 12, which is 001100, setting the 3rd and 4th bits.

But in the OR result, the 3rd and 4th bits are already set by 12, so including other numbers that set higher bits doesn't affect the lower bits.

Wait, but in the OR operation, if any number has a bit set to 1, the overall OR will have that bit set to 1.

So, in this case, including 12 sets the 3rd and 4th bits, and including 32 sets the 6th bit, and including 3 sets the 1st and 2nd bits.

So, the OR is 101111, which is 1 in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th bits.

But the 5th bit is not set in any of these numbers.

Wait, 32 is 100000, which is the 6th bit.

3 is 000011, which is 1st and 2nd bits.

1 is 000001, 1st bit.

1 is 000001, 1st bit.

2 is 000010, 2nd bit.

12 is 001100, 3rd and 4th bits.

So, OR'ing them together: 100000 | 000011 | 000001 | 000001 | 000010 | 001100 = 101111.

So, the 5th bit is not set in any of these numbers.

But wait, k=51 is 110011, which has the 5th bit set (16).

So, why isn't 16 included in the sequence to set the 5th bit?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the bits.

Let me double-check the bit positions.

Binary representation positions:

- Bit 1: 2^0 = 1

- Bit 2: 2^1 = 2

- Bit 3: 2^2 = 4

- Bit 4: 2^3 = 8

- Bit 5: 2^4 = 16

- Bit 6: 2^5 = 32

So, 51 in binary is 110011, which corresponds to:

- Bit 1: 1

- Bit 2: 1

- Bit 3: 0

- Bit 4: 0

- Bit 5: 1

- Bit 6: 1

So, bits 1,2,5,6 are set in k=51.

In the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is bits 1,2,3,4,6 set.

Wait, but in k=51, bit 5 is set, but in the OR result, bit 5 is not set.

Wait, no, 101111 in binary is 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47, which is 101111.

But in k=51, which is 110011 (32 + 16 + 2 + 1), the 5th bit is set (16), but in the OR result, the 5th bit is 0.

Wait, how is that possible?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the OR operation.

Wait, let's compute the OR again.

Numbers in the sequence:

- 3: 000011

- 1: 000001

- 1: 000001

- 32: 100000

- 2: 000010

- 12: 001100

OR'ing them together:

- Bit 1: 1 OR 1 OR 1 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 = 1

- Bit 2: 1 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 1 OR 0 = 1

- Bit 3: 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 1 = 1

- Bit 4: 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 1 = 1

- Bit 5: 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 OR 0 = 0

- Bit 6: 1 OR 0 OR 0 OR 1 OR 0 OR 0 = 1

So, the OR result is 101111, which is 47, with bits 1,2,3,4,6 set.

But k=51 is 110011, with bits 1,2,5,6 set.

Wait, but in the OR result, bit 5 is not set, even though it's set in k=51.

How is that possible?

Ah, because the OR operation only sets a bit in the result if at least one number in the sequence has that bit set.

In the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], none of the numbers have the 5th bit (16) set.

So, the OR result doesn't have the 5th bit set.

But k=51 has the 5th bit set, which means that the sum of the sequence must include the 5th bit.

So, to have the 5th bit set in the OR result, I need to include at least one number in the sequence that has the 5th bit set.

But in the given sequence, none of the numbers have the 5th bit set.

Wait, but the sum is still 51.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a number with the 5th bit set to ensure that the OR has that bit set.

For example, including 16 in the sequence would set the 5th bit in the OR result.

But in the given sequence, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51, but don't include 16.

Wait, but 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51, so 16 is part of k=51.

But in the sequence, they have included 32,2,1, and some other numbers, but not 16 explicitly.

Wait, but 12 is 8 + 4, which is bits 4 and 3.

So, perhaps they could include 16 in the sequence to set the 5th bit.

For example, including 16 in the sequence would set the 5th bit in the OR result.

Let me try that.

Suppose the sequence is [3,1,1,32,2,16], sum is 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 16 = 55, which is more than 51.

Wait, that exceeds 51.

Wait, no, 3+1+1+32+2+16 = 55, which is more than 51.

So, including 16 would make the sum exceed 51.

Wait, but k=51 already includes 16.

Wait, 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

But in the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the sum is 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51.

But 12 is 8 + 4, which are bits 4 and 3.

So, perhaps instead of including 1
