Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of the sequence does. The bitwise OR of a set of numbers will have a 1 in a particular bit position if at least one of the numbers has a 1 in that position. So, to maximize the number of 1s in this OR result, I need to have as many bit positions as possible have at least one 1 across all the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, I should try to spread the 1s across different bit positions in the sequence. However, I also need to ensure that the sum of these numbers is exactly k.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to identify all the bit positions that are set in k and try to assign these bit positions to different elements in the sequence.

Wait, no. Actually, since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should try to have as many distinct bit positions set to 1 across the sequence as possible.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 3

Possible sequences:

- [1, 2]: sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3 (binary 11), which has two 1s.

- [3, 0]: sum is 3, and 3 | 0 = 3 (binary 11), which also has two 1s.

- [1, 1]: sum is 2, which doesn't match k=3.

So, [1,2] and [3,0] are valid, both giving the same number of 1s in the OR.

In the example, they chose [1,2]. So, seems like it's acceptable as long as the conditions are met.

Another example:

n=1, k=5

Only one number, which is 5. Binary representation is 101, which has two 1s. That's straightforward.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=51

They provided [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51, and the OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 (0b0011) | 1 (0b0001) | 1 (0b0001) | 32 (0b100000) | 2 (0b0010) | 12 (0b1100) = result is 0b101111, which has five 1s.

I need to see if there's a way to get more than five 1s in the OR for n=6 and k=51.

Let me try:

If I set numbers to have more distinct bit positions, but still sum to 51.

For example:

- [1,2,4,8,16,19]: sum is 1+2+4+8+16+19=50, which is less than 51.

- Adjust to [1,2,4,8,16,20]: sum is 51, OR is 1|2|4|8|16|20 = 0b101100, which is 0b101100, which has three 1s. That's worse.

- Another try: [1,2,4,8,16,18]: sum is 49, not 51.

- [1,2,4,8,16,22]: sum is 53, which is over.

Seems like the provided solution is better.

Another approach: try to set as many bit positions as possible, ensuring the sum is k.

So, perhaps identify all the bit positions in k and distribute them across the sequence.

Wait, but k can have bit positions that are set, and I need to make sure that in the sequence, those bit positions are covered by at least one number having that bit set.

Additionally, I need to handle the sum constraint.

Let me think about the general approach.

First, find all the bit positions that are set in k. For each of these bit positions, I need to have at least one number in the sequence that has that bit set.

Moreover, I can have numbers that cover multiple bit positions, but the goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, which means maximizing the number of distinct bit positions set across the sequence.

Given that, I should try to assign each bit position to a unique number in the sequence, if possible.

But, I have n numbers to assign, and potentially, k might have more bit positions set than n.

Wait, no, k can have up to 32 bit positions set, since k can be up to 1e9.

But n can be up to 2e5, which is much larger than 32.

So, in cases where n is larger than the number of bit positions set in k, I can assign each bit position to a unique number, and set the remaining numbers to 0.

But in cases where n is less than or equal to the number of bit positions set in k, I need to assign each bit position to at least one number, and distribute the sum accordingly.

Wait, no, actually, I need to maximize the number of distinct bit positions set in the OR, which is equivalent to the number of bit positions set in k, because the OR will have a 1 in any position where at least one number has a 1 in that position.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, which is the number of distinct bit positions set across all numbers.

But, since the OR combines all the 1s from any of the numbers, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of bit positions set in k.

Wait, no. Actually, the OR will have a 1 in each bit position where at least one number has a 1 in that position.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set across the sequence as possible, which is equal to the number of distinct bit positions set in k.

Wait, but k is the sum of the numbers, and the OR is combining the bit positions from all numbers.

Actually, the OR is not directly related to the sum in a straightforward way.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the OR of the sequence will have a 1 in bit position i if at least one number in the sequence has a 1 in bit position i.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set across the sequence as possible.

Given that, and considering that the sum of the numbers is k, I need to distribute the sum k among the n numbers such that the OR has as many 1s as possible.

One way to do this is to assign the minimal possible values to n-1 numbers, so that the remaining sum is assigned to the last number.

But that might not maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign each number to have a unique bit set, if possible.

But, since the numbers are non-negative integers, and their sum is k, I need to ensure that the sum constraints are met.

Wait, perhaps I can start by identifying all the bit positions set in k, and then assign each bit position to a unique number in the sequence, if n is greater than or equal to the number of set bits in k.

But, in cases where n is larger than the number of set bits in k, I can still assign some numbers to have those bit positions set, and set the remaining numbers to 0.

Wait, but setting numbers to 0 won't add any 1s to the OR, so it's fine.

In cases where n is less than or equal to the number of set bits in k, I need to assign multiple bit positions to some numbers.

Wait, but actually, I can assign each set bit to a unique number, and set the remaining numbers to 0.

Then, the OR will have all the set bits from k, plus any additional bits from the numbers that have multiple bits set.

But, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set as possible.

So, assigning each set bit in k to a unique number in the sequence would achieve that.

Any additional sum can be distributed among the numbers, but care must be taken not to introduce new set bits that aren't already set in k, as that could potentially increase the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, but the OR can only have 1s in the bit positions that are set in at least one of the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set across the sequence as possible, which is equal to the number of set bits in k.

Wait, but actually, it's possible to have more 1s in the OR if some numbers have additional set bits.

Wait, no, because the OR combines all the set bits from any of the numbers.

So, the OR will have a 1 in a bit position if at least one number in the sequence has a 1 in that position.

Therefore, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of bit positions that are set in k.

Wait, but k is the sum of the numbers, and the numbers can have bits set beyond those in k, but constrained by the sum.

Wait, no, the sum is the bitwise addition, which can have carry-over bits, making it more complex.

Actually, the relationship between the sum and the OR is not straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers that sum to k.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR of these numbers.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bit positions set across the sequence as possible.

Given that, I should try to have each number in the sequence set a unique bit position, if possible.

But, since the sum is k, I need to ensure that the sum of these numbers is k.

One way to approach this is to identify all the bit positions that are set in k, and assign each of these bit positions to a unique number in the sequence.

If n is greater than the number of set bits in k, I can assign the remaining numbers as 0.

If n is less than or equal to the number of set bits in k, I need to assign multiple bit positions to some numbers.

Wait, but assigning multiple bit positions to a number doesn't increase the number of 1s in the OR, because the OR already has those bits set.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should aim to have each number set a unique bit position, if possible.

But, if n is larger than the number of set bits in k, I can still set some numbers to have some bit positions set, but I need to ensure that the sum is k.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize assigning the highest possible bit positions to the numbers.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the binary representation.

Let me consider that the OR of the sequence will have the highest bit set to 1 if at least one number in the sequence has that bit set.

So, starting from the highest bit in k, I should assign that bit to one of the numbers, and then proceed to lower bits.

But I need to ensure that the sum is k.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach would work.

Here's an idea:

1. Identify all the bit positions set in k, starting from the highest bit to the lowest bit.

2. Assign each bit position to a unique number in the sequence, if possible.

3. If n is larger than the number of set bits in k, set the remaining numbers to 0.

4. Adjust the numbers to ensure the sum is k.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the sum is exactly k.

Let me think about an example.

Take n=2, k=3.

Binary representation of 3 is 11.

So, bit positions 0 and 1 are set.

Assign each bit position to a unique number:

- Number 1: 1 (bit position 0)

- Number 2: 2 (bit position 1)

Sum is 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Alternatively, assign both bit positions to one number:

- Number 1: 3

- Number 2: 0

Sum is 3 + 0 = 3, which also matches k.

In both cases, the OR is 3, which has two 1s.

So, both are valid.

But in the example, they chose [1,2].

Now, if n=3, k=3.

Assign each set bit to a unique number:

- Number 1: 1

- Number 2: 2

- Number 3: 0

Sum is 1 + 2 + 0 = 3.

OR is 1 | 2 | 0 = 3, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, assign one number to have both bits:

- Number 1: 3

- Number 2: 0

- Number 3: 0

Sum is 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.

OR is 3 | 0 | 0 = 3, which has two 1s.

So, both approaches give the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, assigning each set bit to a unique number is a good approach.

Now, for n=6, k=51.

Binary representation of 51 is 110011, which has bit positions 0,1,4,5 set.

So, four set bits.

But in the example, they have five 1s in the OR.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is 0b110011, which is positions 0,1,4,5 set, so four 1s.

But in the example, they have five 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 (0b0011) | 1 (0b0001) | 1 (0b0001) | 32 (0b100000) | 2 (0b0010) | 12 (0b1100) = result is 0b101111, which has five 1s.

Wait, but 51 is 0b110011, which is 0b110011, which is positions 0,1,4,5 set, which is four 1s.

But 0b101111 is 0b101111, which is positions 1,2,3,4,5 set, which is five 1s.

Wait, but how is that possible if k=51 has only four set bits?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the OR can have more set bits than k, but the sum must still be k.

Wait, but the sum is constrained to be k, which is 51.

But in this case, the OR has five set bits, even though k has only four set bits.

Wait, but 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 0b101111, which is 0b101111 = 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 39, which is less than 51.

Wait, no, 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 32 + 8 = 40, plus 4 is 44, plus 2 is 46, plus 1 is 47. Wait, that's not adding up correctly.

Wait, 0b101111 is 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47.

But in the example, they have numbers summing to 51.

Wait, but 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51.

But 12 in binary is 0b1100, which is 8 + 4.

So, ORing with 12 sets bits 3 and 4.

Wait, but 3 is 0b0011, 1 is 0b0001, 32 is 0b100000, 2 is 0b0010, 12 is 0b1100.

So, ORing them:

- Bit 0: 1 or 1 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 = 1

- Bit 1: 1 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 1 or 0 = 1

- Bit 2: 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 1 or 1 = 1

- Bit 3: 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 1 = 1

- Bit 4: 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 0 or 1 = 1

- Bit 5: 1 or 0 or 0 or 1 or 0 or 0 = 1

Wait, so 0b101111 is 47, but the OR is 0b101111, which has five 1s.

Wait, but k=51 is 0b110011, which is positions 0,1,4,5 set.

But in the OR, positions 0,1,2,3,4,5 are set, but wait, position 2 and 3 are set due to the numbers 2 and 12.

But k=51 only has positions 0,1,4,5 set.

Wait, but the sum is 51, which is 0b110011.

But the OR is 0b101111, which is 47.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the OR has five 1s.

Wait, but 0b101111 is indeed five 1s.

But how does this work with k=51?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the OR can have more set bits than k, as long as the sum is k.

But, in practice, the OR can have more set bits than k, but the sum can still be k.

For example, if I have numbers that set additional bits beyond those in k.

Wait, but the sum is the arithmetic sum, not related to the OR.

So, it's possible to have an OR with more set bits than k, as long as the sum is k.

Hence, in this case, the OR has five 1s, which is more than the four set bits in k=51.

So, perhaps I need to aim for having as many set bits as possible in the OR, not just the set bits in k.

Wait, but in the problem, it says to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of set bits in the OR, regardless of the set bits in k.

Wait, but k is the sum of the numbers, and the OR is a separate operation.

Hence, perhaps I can set as many bits as possible in the OR, as long as the sum is k.

In that case, I need to maximize the number of set bits in the OR, given that the sum of the numbers is k.

So, perhaps I need to set as many low-order bits as possible, since higher-order bits contribute more to the sum.

Wait, but setting low-order bits would allow me to set more bits without exceeding the sum.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of set bits in the OR.

So, perhaps I should assign the minimal possible values to the numbers, so that more bits can be set without exceeding the sum.

Wait, but setting minimal values like 1 for as many numbers as possible would set bit 0 for those numbers.

But, if n is larger than k, I can't set all numbers to 1, because the sum would exceed k.

Wait, perhaps I need to set as many numbers as possible to 1, and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

For example, if n=3, k=5, I can set two numbers to 1, and the third to 3, which is 11 in binary, having two set bits.

So, OR would be 1 | 1 | 3 = 3, which has two set bits.

Alternatively, set one number to 1, another to 2, and the third to 2, summing to 5, OR is 1 | 2 | 2 = 3, which has two set bits.

Another option: set one number to 4, and the other two to 1, summing to 5, OR is 4 | 1 | 1 = 5, which has two set bits.

So, in all cases, the OR has two set bits.

Wait, but 5 in binary is 101, which has two set bits.

So, perhaps in this case, the maximum number of set bits in the OR is two.

But earlier, in the fourth test case, they have five set bits in the OR for k=51 and n=6.

Wait, but 51 is 110011, which has four set bits, but their OR has five set bits.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the OR can have more set bits than k, by distributing the sum across numbers that set different bits.

Wait, but in practice, the OR is the combination of all set bits from any number in the sequence.

Hence, to maximize the number of set bits in the OR, I need to have as many distinct set bits across the sequence as possible.

Given that, I should aim to set as many distinct bits as possible across the sequence, without exceeding the sum k.

So, perhaps I should assign the minimal possible values to as many numbers as possible, each setting a unique bit, and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

Wait, but minimal values like 1, 2, 4, etc., each setting a unique bit.

But, if n is larger than the number of available bit positions (32), I can't set more than 32 unique bits.

Wait, but in the example, they have n=6 and k=51, and they achieved an OR with five set bits.

So, perhaps I need to identify the bit positions that can be set across the sequence to maximize the number of set bits in the OR, while ensuring the sum is k.

Hence, a possible approach is:

1. Identify the bit positions that are set in k.

2. Assign each of these bit positions to a unique number in the sequence, if n is greater than or equal to the number of set bits in k.

3. If n is larger than the number of set bits in k, set the remaining numbers to 0.

4. Adjust the assignments to maximize the number of set bits in the OR.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, they have five set bits in the OR, even though k=51 has four
