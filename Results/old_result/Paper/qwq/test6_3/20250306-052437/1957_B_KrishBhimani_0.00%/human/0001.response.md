Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. I need to create a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I have to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 | 2 is 1 (binary 01) OR 2 (binary 10), which gives 3 (binary 11). The number of 1s in the binary representation of 3 is two, which is what we're trying to maximize.

So, my goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the binary representation of the result has as many 1s as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I want to set as many bits to 1 as possible in the OR result. To do that, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

Given that, perhaps I should distribute the 1s across different bit positions in the sequence. For example, if I have n=2 and k=3, I can choose 1 and 2, which in binary are 01 and 10, and their OR is 11, which has two 1s. If I chose 3 and 0, which are 11 and 00, the OR is 11, which is the same. So both sequences are equally good in this case.

But wait, in the example provided, for n=2 and k=3, the output is 1 and 2, which makes sense because their OR is 3 (binary 11), which has two 1s. But choosing 3 and 0 also gives the same OR, so both are acceptable.

So, in general, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many bit positions to 1 as possible. That means, for each bit in the binary representation of the OR, at least one number in the sequence should have that bit set.

Given that, perhaps I should identify all the bit positions that are set in k, and then distribute these set bits across the sequence elements.

Wait, but k is the sum of the sequence elements. So, the sum of the sequence is k, and I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR of the sequence.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have n elements that sum to k. I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR of these elements.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many unique bit positions set to 1 across all elements.

Wait, but actually, it's not about unique bit positions; it's about ensuring that for each bit position in the OR, at least one element has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible with the OR operation.

Given that, perhaps I should identify all the bit positions that are set in k, and then distribute the set bits across the sequence elements in such a way that each bit position is set in at least one element.

But also, the sum of the elements should be k.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's consider an example.

Take n=2, k=5.

Binary of 5 is 101.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many 1s in the OR as possible.

If I choose 1 and 4, which are 01 and 100, their OR is 101, which is 5 in decimal, having two 1s.

Alternatively, I could choose 5 and 0, which are 101 and 000, OR is 101, same result.

Or choose 3 and 2, which are 011 and 010, OR is 011, which is 3, having two 1s.

So in this case, all options give me two 1s in the OR.

Is there a way to get more than two 1s in the OR while summing to 5?

If I choose 1 and 4, OR is 101, two 1s.

If I choose 3 and 2, OR is 011, two 1s.

If I choose 5 and 0, OR is 101, two 1s.

Seems like two is the maximum possible.

Is there a k where I can get more 1s in the OR?

Let's take n=3, k=7.

Binary of 7 is 111.

If I choose 1, 2, 4, which are 001, 010, 100, their OR is 111, which has three 1s.

Alternatively, choose 3, 3, 1, which are 011, 011, 001, OR is 011, which has two 1s.

So, choosing 1, 2, 4 gives me a better OR with more 1s.

Similarly, choosing 7, 0, 0 gives OR 111, which is the same as choosing 1, 2, 4.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is three.

Wait, but in the first example with n=1 and k=5, the OR is just 5, which is 101, two 1s.

So, it seems that the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of set bits in k, because the OR has to be at least k, since the sum is k.

Wait, actually, the OR can be larger than k in some cases.

Wait, no, the OR can be larger than k, but in practice, it might not help in maximizing the number of 1s.

Wait, for example, with n=2 and k=3, choosing 1 and 2 gives OR 3 (11), which has two 1s.

If I choose 3 and 0, OR is 3 (11), same two 1s.

If I choose 1 and 1, OR is 1 (01), which has only one 1, which is worse.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to ensure that as many bit positions as possible are set in at least one of the sequence elements.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign each necessary bit to a separate sequence element.

Wait, but I also have to ensure that the sum is k.

So, maybe I should identify all the bit positions that need to be set in the OR, and assign each of those bit positions to a separate sequence element, and then distribute the remaining sum among the elements.

But if n is larger than the number of set bits in k, then I can just set the necessary bits in separate elements and set the remaining elements to zero.

Wait, but the sum has to be k.

So, perhaps I should:

1. Identify the bit positions that are set in k.

2. Assign each of these bit positions to a separate sequence element.

3. If n is larger than the number of set bits, set the remaining elements to zero.

4. If n is smaller than the number of set bits, which can't happen because I can always assign each set bit to a separate element and set the remaining elements to zero.

Wait, no, if n is smaller than the number of set bits in k, I cannot assign each set bit to a separate element because there aren't enough elements. But in that case, I would have to combine some set bits into the same element.

But actually, even if n is smaller than the number of set bits in k, I can still assign each set bit to a separate element up to n elements, and then handle the remaining sum.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look at the example again.

In the second test case, n=2, k=3, output is 1 and 2, which sum to 3 and OR to 3, which has two 1s.

Another possible sequence is 3 and 0, which also sums to 3 and ORs to 3.

So, both are acceptable.

In the third test case, n=2, k=5, output is 5 and 0, which sums to 5 and ORs to 5, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, 1 and 4 also sums to 5 and ORs to 5.

So, seems like there are multiple sequences that satisfy the conditions.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, output is 3,1,1,32,2,12, which sums to 51 and ORs to 101111, which has five 1s.

Let me verify that.

3 is 000011

1 is 000001

1 is 000001

32 is 100000

2 is 000010

12 is 001100

OR of all these is 101111, which has five 1s.

Is there a better sequence? Let's see.

If I try to set more bits to 1 in the OR, but the sum has to be 51.

Is there a way to get more than five 1s in the OR while summing to 51?

Let's see, 51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1s.

But the OR of the sequence is 101111, which has five 1s, which is more than in k.

So, it's possible to have an OR with more 1s than in k, as long as the sum is k.

But in this case, the OR has five 1s, while k has four 1s.

Wait, but the OR can have more 1s than k, as long as the sum is k.

Wait, but in this case, the OR is 101111, which is 47, and k is 51, which is 110011.

Wait, 101111 is 47, and 110011 is 51. So, OR can be less than or equal to k in some cases, but in this case, it's less.

Wait, but in the example, they have OR as 101111, which is 47, and k is 51.

But 47 | 51 is 110011, which is 51, but in the sequence, the OR is 101111.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, the OR of the sequence elements is 101111, which is 47, and it's acceptable because we are to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, not necessarily make OR as large as possible.

Wait, but OR is a bitwise operation, and the OR of the sequence is the bitwise OR of all the elements.

So, in this case, OR is 101111, which has five 1s, which is more than the four 1s in 51 (110011).

So, it's possible to have an OR with more 1s than in k, as long as the sum is k.

But in this case, the OR is 47, which is less than k=51.

So, perhaps there is no constraint that OR should be at least k or anything like that; the only constraints are that the sum is k and the OR has as many 1s as possible.

So, in this case, OR can be less than k, as long as it has more 1s in its binary representation.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, k=5, output is 5, which is 101, two 1s.

In the second test case, n=2, k=3, output is 1 and 2, which OR to 3 (11), two 1s.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, output is a sequence that ORs to 101111, which is 47, having five 1s.

So, in this case, OR is less than k, but it's acceptable because it has more 1s.

Wait, but 47 has five 1s, and 51 has four 1s, so it's better to have OR as 47 than 51 in terms of the number of 1s.

So, perhaps the strategy is to set as many bits as possible to 1 in the OR, even if that results in a smaller OR value.

Wait, but smaller OR doesn't necessarily mean fewer 1s; in this case, 47 has more 1s than 51.

So, perhaps the strategy is to set the lowest possible bits to 1 in the OR.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have k, and I need to distribute its bits among n numbers such that their OR has as many 1s as possible.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one number has that bit set to 1.

Given that, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of unique bit positions set in at least one of the numbers.

So, to maximize this, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible with the n numbers.

One way to do this is to assign each bit position to a separate number, if possible.

So, if k has m set bits, and n >= m, then I can assign each set bit to a separate number, and set the remaining numbers to zero.

If n < m, then I need to combine some set bits into the same number.

But in the problem, n can be up to 2e5, and k up to 1e9, so for practical purposes, n is usually larger than the number of set bits in k.

Wait, 1e9 in binary has up to 30 bits, so m <= 30.

Given that, for n >= m, I can assign each set bit to a separate number and set the remaining numbers to zero.

For n < m, I need to combine some set bits into the same number.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that n is large enough, since the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, and t is up to 1e4.

But in any case, I need to handle both scenarios.

Wait, no, n can be up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5.

So, I need to handle up to 2e5 test cases with n up to 2e5, but the total sum of n is up to 2e5.

So, it's manageable.

Now, back to the strategy.

Identify the bit positions that are set in k.

Then, assign each set bit to a separate sequence element, if n >= m, where m is the number of set bits in k.

If n < m, then I need to combine some set bits into the same element.

Wait, but in practice, since n can be up to 2e5 and m <= 30, n is always >= m.

Wait, no, n can be 1, and m can be up to 30, so n can be less than m.

Wait, no, n is up to 2e5, which is much larger than 30, so n >= m in all cases.

Wait, but for n=1, m=30, n < m.

Wait, no, n can be 1, and m can be up to 30, so n can be less than m.

Wait, but in that case, I have to put all the set bits into a single number.

Wait, but in n=1, I have to choose a single number equal to k, and the OR is just that number.

So, in that case, the number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of set bits in k.

Similarly, for n >= m, I can assign each set bit to a separate number and set the remaining numbers to zero.

For n < m, I have to combine some set bits into the same number.

Wait, but m <= 30, and n up to 2e5, so n >= m in most cases.

But I need to handle n < m as well.

Wait, actually, m can be up to 30, and n can be 1, so I need to handle n < m.

So, perhaps the general strategy is:

- Identify the bit positions set in k.

- If n >= m, assign each set bit to a separate sequence element, and set the remaining elements to zero.

- If n < m, combine some set bits into the same element.

But in practice, since m is small (<=30), and n can be up to 2e5, it's better to assign each set bit to a separate element and set the remaining elements to zero.

But in the case where n < m, I need to combine some set bits into the same element.

But in reality, m is up to 30, and n is up to 2e5, so n >= m in almost all cases.

But to be thorough, I should handle n < m.

Wait, but in the problem, n can be 1, and k can have up to 30 set bits, so n < m is possible.

So, perhaps the code provided handles this correctly.

Let me look at the provided code.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

l1 = input().split()

(n, k) = list(map(int, l1))

arr = []

k0 = k

i = 0

while k:

if k & 1 == 1:

arr.append(i)

k = k >> 1

i += 1

ans = []

c = 0

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, let's understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Initialize an empty list arr to store the bit positions that are set in k.

- k0 is a copy of k for later use.

- i is a counter for bit positions, starting from 0.

- While k is not zero:

- If the least significant bit of k is 1, append the current bit position i to arr.

- Right shift k by 1 to check the next bit.

- Initialize an empty list ans for the sequence.

- c is a counter for the number of elements in ans.

- For each bit position in arr:

- If c == n - 1, meaning we have assigned values to n-1 elements, assign the remaining sum to the last element.

- Else, assign 1 << i to the current element, which sets only the i-th bit.

- Increment c.

- After processing all bit positions in arr, if there are still elements left to assign (n - len(ans)), assign zeros to them.

- Print the sequence.

So, this code is assigning each set bit in k to a separate sequence element, and setting the remaining element to the remaining sum.

Wait, but in the loop:

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

It seems there is an indentation issue here. The ans.append(1 << i) should be outside the if statement.

Wait, in the code snippet, it's written as:

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

So, it's appending 1 << i for each set bit, unless c == n - 1, in which case it appends the remaining sum and breaks.

Then, after the loop, it appends zeros if necessary.

Wait, but this might not be correct.

Because if n < m (number of set bits), it will assign 1 << i for the first n-1 set bits and assign the remaining sum to the last element.

But in this case, the OR might not have the maximum number of 1s.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose n=2, k=5.

Binary of 5 is 101, so arr = [0,2].

Initialize ans = []

c = 0

First iteration, i=0:

c != 1, so ans.append(1 << 0) = 1, ans=[1], c=1

Second iteration, i=2:

c == 1 (n-1=1), so ans.append(k0 - sum(ans)) = 5 - 1 = 4, ans=[1,4]

Then, since len(ans)=2, append no zeros.

Print 1 4

OR of 1 and 4 is 5, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, choosing 5 and 0 gives OR 5, same two 1s.

So, both are acceptable.

Another example: n=3, k=5

arr=[0,2]

ans=[]

c=0

First iteration, i=0:

c != 2, ans.append(1<<0)=1, ans=[1], c=1

Second iteration, i=2:

c !=2, ans.append(1<<2)=4, ans=[1,4], c=2

Then, since len(ans)=2 < n=3, append 0, ans=[1,4,0]

Print 1 4 0

OR is 1 | 4 | 0 = 5, which has two 1s.

Alternative sequence could be 5,0,0, which also gives OR 5.

So, both are acceptable.

Another example: n=6, k=51

Binary of 51 is 110011, so arr=[1,2,5]

Initialize ans=[]

c=0

First iteration, i=1:

c !=5, ans.append(1<<1)=2, ans=[2], c=1

Second iteration, i=2:

c !=5, ans.append(1<<2)=4, ans=[2,4], c=2

Third iteration, i=5:

c !=5, ans.append(1<<5)=32, ans=[2,4,32], c=3

Then, since len(ans)=3 < n=6, append three zeros: ans=[2,4,32,0,0,0]

But in the example, the output is 3,1,1,32,2,12, which sums to 51 and ORs to 101111.

Wait, but according to the code, it would output 2,4,32,0,0,0, which sums to 38, not 51.

Wait, there is a mistake here.

Wait, in the code, it appends 1<<i for each set bit, and then appends zeros if necessary.

But in this case, 2 + 4 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 38, which is not equal to 51.

Wait, that's a problem.

So, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, in the loop:

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

Wait, in this case, for n=3, k=5, arr=[0,2]

First iteration, c=0 != 2, ans.append(1<<0)=1, ans=[1], c=1

Second iteration, c=1 !=2, ans.append(1<<2)=4, ans=[1,4], c=2

Then, len(ans)=2 < n=3, append 0, ans=[1,4,0]

sum is 5, which is correct.

But for n=6, k=51, arr=[1,2,5]

First iteration, c=0 !=5, ans.append(1<<1)=2, ans=[2], c=1

Second iteration, c=1 !=5, ans.append(1<<2)=4, ans=[2,4], c=2

Third iteration, c=2 !=5, ans.append(1<<5)=32, ans=[2,4,32], c=3

Then, len(ans)=3 < n=6, append three zeros: ans=[2,4,32,0,0,0]

sum is 2+4+32+0+0+0=38, which is less than 51.

Wait, but in the example, they have a sequence that sums to 51.

So, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code to handle the remaining sum correctly.

Wait, perhaps the code should assign the remaining sum to one of the elements that already have a set bit, or something like that.

Wait, but in the current implementation, it's assigning 1<<i to each set bit, and then appending zeros.

But in the case where k has multiple set bits and n >= m, this approach may not account for the total sum correctly.

Wait, in the earlier example with n=2, k=5, assigning 1 and 4 sums to 5, which is correct.

In n=3, k=5, assigning 1,4,0 sums to 5, which is correct.

But in n=6, k=51, assigning 2,4,32,0,0,0 sums to 38, which is less than 51.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code to distribute the remaining sum to one of the elements.

Alternative approach:

- Identify the bit positions that are set in k.

- Assign each set bit to a separate sequence element, if n >= m.

- Assign the remaining sum to one of the elements, preferably to an element that already has a set bit, to avoid setting additional bits in the OR.

Wait, but in the code, it's assigning 1<<i to each set bit and then appending zeros, which may not account for the total sum correctly.

In the example with n=6, k=51, arr=[1,2,5], which correspond to 2,4,32.

Sum of these is 2+4+32=38.

Then, the remaining sum is 51-38=13.

So, I need to distribute this 13 among the existing elements.

But if I add the 13 to one of the existing elements, say add 13 to 32, making it 45, which is 101101 in binary, which has four 1s.

Then, the OR of 2 (0010), 4 (0100), 45 (101101), and three zeros, would be 101111, which is 47, having five 1s.

This matches the example output.

So, perhaps the code needs to assign the remaining sum to one of the elements that already have a set bit.

In the code, however, it's assigning 1<<i to each set bit and then appending zeros, which doesn't account for the remaining sum correctly.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, the output is 3,1,1,32,2,12, which sums to 51 and ORs to 101111.

But according to my earlier approach, assigning 2,4,32,0,0,0 sums to 38, which is less than 51, so I need to add the remaining 13 to one of the existing elements.

If I add 13 to 32, making it 45, which is 101101.

Then, OR of 2 | 4 | 45 | 0 | 0 | 0 = 101111, which is 47, matching the example.

But in the example, they have 3,1,1,32,2,12.

Let's see:

3 is 000011

1 is 000001

1 is 000001

32 is 100000

2 is 000010

12 is 001100

Sum is 3+1+1+32+2+12=51

OR is 101111, which is 47, having five 1s.

So, in this sequence, multiple elements have overlapping bits.

For example, 3 (000011) and 1 (000001) have overlapping bits.

Similarly, 12 (001100) and 2 (000010) have overlapping bits.

But overall, the OR is 101111.

So, it's possible to distribute the sum in different ways.

But the code provided doesn't produce this sequence.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code to handle the remaining sum correctly.

Alternative approach:

- Identify the bit positions that are set in k.

- Assign each set bit to a separate sequence element, if n >= m.

- Distribute the remaining sum to one or more elements, preferably to elements that don't set new bits in the OR.

But in practice, it's sufficient to assign the remaining sum to one of the elements that already have a set bit.

In the earlier example, assigning the remaining 13 to the element with 32 makes it 45, which doesn't introduce new bits in the OR.

Wait,
