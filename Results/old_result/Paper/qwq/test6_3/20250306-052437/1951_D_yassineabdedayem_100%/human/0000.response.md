Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel ranging from 1 to 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand how Alice's buying behavior works. She goes to each stall in sequence and buys as many jewels as she can with her current coins. So, at each stall, she buys floor(coins / price) jewels, and then the remaining coins are coins % price.

I need to make sure that the total number of jewels she buys from all the stalls is exactly k.

Let me think about the simplest case. If Bob sets up only one stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels. So, if there's a p such that floor(n / p) = k, then that would satisfy the condition.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so maybe using multiple stalls can help in more complex scenarios.

Wait, let's think about the constraints. n and k can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 1000, so I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider the case where n == k. In this case, if Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice will buy floor(n / 1) = n jewels, which is equal to k. So, "YES" with one stall and price 1.

But in the given program, it checks if n == k, then outputs "YES", followed by 1 and then 1. That seems correct.

Next, if n + 2 > k * 2, the program outputs "YES" with two stalls: prices n - k + 1 and 1.

Let me see why this works.

Suppose Bob sets up two stalls: the first with price p1 = n - k + 1 and the second with p2 = 1.

Alice will first go to stall 1 and buy floor(n / p1) jewels. Let's calculate that:

floor(n / (n - k + 1))

If n >= n - k + 1, which it is since n >= 1 and k >= 1, then floor(n / (n - k + 1)) is at least 1.

Wait, let's compute exactly how many jewels she buys at the first stall.

Let me denote q1 = floor(n / p1) = floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Then, the remaining coins after the first stall are n - q1 * p1.

Then, at the second stall with price 1, she can buy floor((n - q1 * p1) / 1) = n - q1 * p1 jewels.

So, total jewels bought are q1 + (n - q1 * p1).

But since p1 = n - k + 1, let's see:

q1 = floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Let me consider that n >= k, since if n < k, it's impossible to buy k jewels, as Alice doesn't have enough coins.

Wait, but in the condition n + 2 > k * 2, which is equivalent to n > 2k - 2.

So, assuming n > 2k - 2, the program says to set up two stalls with prices n - k + 1 and 1.

Let me verify if this works.

Let p1 = n - k + 1

Then, q1 = floor(n / p1)

Let me compute q1.

If p1 = n - k + 1, then n / p1 = n / (n - k + 1)

This is equal to 1 + (k - 1)/(n - k + 1)

Since n >= k, (k - 1)/(n - k + 1) <= (k - 1)/1 = k - 1

But I need to find floor(n / p1)

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider specific values.

Let me take an example.

Suppose n = 7, k = 3

Then p1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5

So, q1 = floor(7 / 5) = 1

Remaining coins: 7 - 1 * 5 = 2

At stall 2 with p2 = 1, she buys floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Good.

Another example: n = 6, k = 4

p1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3

q1 = floor(6 / 3) = 2

Remaining coins: 6 - 2 * 3 = 0

At stall 2 with p2 = 1, she buys floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels

Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=4.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=6, k=4, it should output "NO", which it does, because n + 2 > k * 2 becomes 6 + 2 > 4 * 2 => 8 > 8, which is false.

So, in this case, it's correctly outputting "NO".

Another example: n=255, k=8

p1 = 255 - 8 + 1 = 248

q1 = floor(255 / 248) = 1

Remaining coins: 255 - 1 * 248 = 7

At stall 2 with p2=1, she buys floor(7 / 1) = 7 jewels

Total: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

Good.

So, it seems that when n + 2 > k * 2, setting up two stalls with prices n - k + 1 and 1 works.

But I need to understand why this condition n + 2 > k * 2 is used.

Let me rearrange it: n > 2k - 2

So, when n > 2k - 2, it's possible to set up two stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

In the examples above, n=7, k=3: 7 > 4, which is true.

n=6, k=4: 6 > 6, which is false.

n=255, k=8: 255 > 14, which is true.

So, it seems that this condition is a threshold beyond which using two stalls suffices.

But I need to verify if this condition is necessary and sufficient.

Let me consider another example where n + 2 > k * 2 holds, but the two-stall approach fails.

Wait, in the earlier example with n=7, k=3, it worked.

Another example: n=5, k=2

Check condition: 5 + 2 > 2*2 => 7 > 4, which is true.

Set p1 = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4

q1 = floor(5 / 4) = 1

Remaining coins: 5 - 4 = 1

At p2=1, buys floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another example: n=4, k=2

Condition: 4 + 2 > 4 => 6 > 4, true.

p1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3

q1 = floor(4 / 3) = 1

Remaining coins: 4 - 3 = 1

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, matches k=2.

Good.

Another example: n=3, k=2

Condition: 3 + 2 > 4 => 5 > 4, true.

p1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2

q1 = floor(3 / 2) = 1

Remaining coins: 3 - 2 = 1

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, matches k=2.

Good.

Another example: n=2, k=2

Condition: 2 + 2 > 4 => 4 > 4, false.

So, outputs "NO", which is correct because with n=2 and k=2, if p1=2 - 2 + 1=1

Then q1 = floor(2 / 1) = 2

Remaining coins: 0

At p2=1, buys 0 jewels

Total: 2 + 0 = 2, which matches k=2.

But according to the program, since n + 2 > k * 2 is 2 + 2 > 4, which is false, it outputs "NO", which is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in this case, it should output "YES" with two stalls: p1=1 and p2=1.

Alice buys 2 jewels at the first stall and 0 at the second, totaling 2 jewels.

But according to the program, it outputs "NO".

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be n + 2 >= k * 2 instead of n + 2 > k * 2.

In the example above, n=2, k=2: 2 + 2 >= 4, which is true.

So, perhaps the condition should be n + 2 >= 2k.

Let me check another case.

n=1, k=1

Condition: 1 + 2 >= 2 => 3 >= 2, true.

Set p1=1 - 1 + 1=1

q1 = floor(1 / 1)=1

Remaining coins: 0

At p2=1, buys 0 jewels

Total: 1 + 0 =1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=3, k=1

Condition: 3 + 2 >= 2 => 5 >= 2, true.

p1=3 -1 +1=3

q1 = floor(3 / 3)=1

Remaining coins: 0

At p2=1, buys 0 jewels

Total:1 +0=1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=4, k=1

Condition:4 + 2 >= 2 => 6 >=2, true.

p1=4 -1 +1=4

q1 = floor(4 /4)=1

Remaining coins:0

At p2=1, buys 0 jewels

Total:1 +0=1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=1, k=2

Condition:1 + 2 >=4 => 3 >=4, false.

So, outputs "NO", which is correct because with n=1, it's impossible to buy 2 jewels.

Another case: n=2, k=1

Condition:2 + 2 >=2 =>4 >=2, true.

p1=2 -1 +1=2

q1 = floor(2 /2)=1

Remaining coins:0

At p2=1, buys 0 jewels

Total:1 +0=1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=5, k=3

Condition:5 +2 >=6 =>7 >=6, true.

p1=5 -3 +1=3

q1 = floor(5 /3)=1

Remaining coins:2

At p2=1, buys 2 jewels

Total:1 +2=3, matches k=3.

Good.

Another case: n=10, k=5

Condition:10 +2 >=10 =>12 >=10, true.

p1=10 -5 +1=6

q1 = floor(10 /6)=1

Remaining coins:4

At p2=1, buys 4 jewels

Total:1 +4=5, matches k=5.

Good.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=2, k=2, the program outputs "NO" because 2 + 2 > 4 is false, but actually, setting p1=1 and p2=1 would make Alice buy 2 jewels.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

I think the condition should be n + 2 >= 2k, not n + 2 > 2k.

In the program, it's n + 2 > k * 2, which is equivalent to n + 2 > 2k.

In the example with n=2, k=2, n + 2 > 2k is 4 > 4, which is false, so it outputs "NO", but actually, it's possible to set up two stalls with p1=1 and p2=1 to make Alice buy exactly 2 jewels.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

I need to think of a better condition.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me think differently.

I need to make sure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Each stall contributes floor(n / p) jewels, and then n is reduced to n % p, and so on.

I need to choose prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum over all stalls of floor(n / p_i) = k.

And s <= 60.

I need to find such a sequence of prices.

One idea is to use the greedy approach: choose the highest possible p1 such that floor(n / p1) <= k, and then proceed similarly for the remaining stalls.

But that might not be efficient, and it's not clear how to bound the number of stalls.

Another idea is to use the fact that floor(n / p) can be expressed in terms of divisors of n.

But n can be up to 10^18, so iterating over divisors might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the binary representation of k.

Since k can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, and we can set up at most 60 stalls.

Wait, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is less than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is less than 10^18 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Wait, no, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is greater than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is actually 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is indeed less than 10^18.

Wait, 10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is greater than 10^18.

Wait, no, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is greater than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is actually 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is greater than 10^18.

Wait, but 10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Wait, 2^60 is indeed larger than 10^18.

Wait, no, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is less than 10^18.

Wait, 10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is larger than 2^60.

Wait, no, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Actually, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is indeed larger than 10^18 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000).

Wait, no, 10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is smaller than 10^18.

Wait, no, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is larger than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Wait, no, 10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact values.

2^60 is exactly 1,152,921,504,606,846,976

10^18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000

So, 2^60 is larger than 10^18.

Wait, but in programming, integers can handle up to 2^63 -1, which is larger than 10^18, so it's fine.

But perhaps I'm going off track.

Let me think differently.

I need to find a way to split the purchase of k jewels using at most 60 stalls.

One approach is to use binary representation.

Suppose I set up stalls with prices that correspond to the binary powers.

For example, stall 1 has price 1, stall 2 has price 2, stall 3 has price 4, and so on up to stall 60 with price 2^59.

Then, Alice will buy floor(n / p_i) jewels at each stall.

But I need to make sure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, then the number of jewels bought at each stall is determined by how many times that power fits into the remaining coins.

But I need to control the total number of jewels to be exactly k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I set up one stall with price p1, such that floor(n / p1) = m1 jewels, and then with the remaining coins, I set up another stall with price p2, and so on, until the total jewels bought is k.

But this seems too vague and may require more than 60 stalls.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

In the problem, it's allowed to set up at most 60 stalls.

I need to find a way to set up the stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Looking back at the initial approach in the given program, it seems to handle some cases with one or two stalls.

But as I saw earlier, there are cases where n + 2 > 2k works with two stalls, but there are exceptions.

I need a more general solution.

Let me consider that with s stalls, the total jewels bought is sum floor(n / p_i) for i=1 to s.

I need this sum to be equal to k.

I need to choose s <= 60 and p1, p2, ..., ps such that this condition holds.

One idea is to set p1 = ceil(n / k), but I need to adjust it to make floor(n / p1) + floor(n_remaining / p2) + ... = k.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that if I set p1 = n - (k - 1), then floor(n / p1) = 1, because n / (n - (k - 1)) is slightly more than 1, so floor is 1.

Then, remaining coins are n - p1 = n - (n - (k - 1)) = k - 1.

Then, set p2 = 1, so floor((k - 1) / 1) = k - 1.

Total jewels: 1 + (k - 1) = k.

This seems similar to the approach in the given program.

In the given program, it sets p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 =1.

Wait, n - k +1 is the same as n - (k -1).

So, p1 = n - k +1, p2=1.

Then, floor(n / p1) = floor(n / (n - k +1)) = 1 (since n >= n - k +1 when k >=1)

Then, remaining coins: n - 1 * p1 = n - (n - k +1) = k -1

Then, at p2=1, floor((k -1)/1) = k -1

Total jewels:1 + (k -1) =k.

Perfect.

So, this works when n >= k -1.

But in the program, it checks n +2 > 2k, which is equivalent to n > 2k -2.

But in my analysis, it seems that n >= k -1 is sufficient.

So, perhaps the condition in the program is too restrictive.

In the earlier example, n=2, k=2, n +2 > 2k is 4 > 4, which is false, so it outputs "NO", but actually, it's possible with p1=1, p2=1.

In this case, floor(2/1)=2, remaining 0, so total jewels=2, which matches k=2.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

I need to think of a better condition.

It seems that as long as n >=k, it's possible to set up two stalls: p1 = n - k +1 and p2=1, to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Because floor(n / p1) =1 and floor((n - p1)/ p2)=k-1, total k.

And if n <k, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins.

So, the condition should be n >=k.

In the program, it has n +2 >2k, which is equivalent to n >2k -2.
