Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Alice has 'n' coins and wants to buy exactly 'k' jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel, and Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence until she's bought exactly 'k' jewels.

First, I need to figure out if it's possible for Bob to set up these stalls with certain prices so that Alice buys exactly 'k' jewels without exceeding her 'n' coins.

Let me think about how Alice buys the jewels. She goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, then moves to the next stall.

So, if Bob sets up stalls with decreasing prices, Alice would buy more jewels from the cheaper stalls, which might not help in controlling the total number of jewels she buys. On the other hand, if he sets up stalls with increasing prices, she would buy fewer jewels from each subsequent stall.

Wait, actually, since she buys as many as possible from each stall before moving to the next, setting higher prices would allow her to buy fewer jewels per stall, which might help in controlling the total number of jewels.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, each with a price between 1 and 10^18 coins per jewel. I need to find a way to set these prices so that she buys exactly 'k' jewels.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 7, k = 3

One possible solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 2 through 11.

At the first stall, price = 2, Alice can buy 3 jewels (since 3*2=6 ≤ 7), leaving her with 1 coin.

With 1 coin left, she can't buy anything from the remaining stalls, so she buys exactly 3 jewels.

That works.

Another example:

n = 255, k = 8

Solution provided is 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

At each stall, Alice buys one jewel, spending the largest possible amount each time, until she's out of coins.

So, in this case, she buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Now, what about the case where n = 6 and k = 4?

The output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let me see why.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices p1, p2, p3, etc., Alice will buy as many as possible from each stall.

Suppose he sets up two stalls:

Stall 1: p1 = 2

Stall 2: p2 = 1

At stall 1, Alice can buy 3 jewels (3*2=6), leaving her with 0 coins.

Total jewels bought: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, Stall 1: p1 = 1, Stall 2: p2 = 1

At stall 1, she buys 6 jewels (6*1=6), leaving her with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Another attempt: Stall 1: p1 = 2, Stall 2: p2 = 1

As before, she buys 3 jewels from the first stall, leaving 0 coins.

Still, only 3 jewels.

Alternatively, Stall 1: p1 = 1.5, but prices must be integers, so not allowed.

Stall 1: p1 = 3, Stall 2: p2 = 1

At stall 1, she buys 2 jewels (2*3=6), leaving 0 coins.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Seems like no matter how I set up the stalls, she either buys fewer than 4 or more than 4 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer.

From these examples, I need to find a general approach to determine if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 such that Alice buys exactly 'k' jewels with 'n' coins.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal jewels: If Bob sets up a stall with price p = n, then Alice can buy exactly 1 jewel.

Or if he sets up multiple stalls with prices higher than what she can afford after previous purchases, she won't buy any jewels from those stalls.

But to minimize the number of jewels, he can set up one stall with p = floor(n/k), but I need to think differently.

Wait, no. To make Alice buy exactly 'k' jewels, I need to control the prices such that the total number of jewels she buys from all stalls is exactly 'k'.

I need to find a sequence of stall prices p1, p2, ..., ps (s <= 60) such that the sum over each stall of floor(coins_i / p_i) = k, where coins_i is the remaining coins after buying from previous stalls.

This seems complicated to compute directly. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the examples, in the first one, they used a decreasing price sequence, and in the third one, they used a decreasing price sequence where each price is half of the previous one.

Wait, in the third example, the prices are 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which are powers of 2 decreasing.

This seems similar to binary representation.

In binary representation, any number can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.

So, if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, Alice can buy a certain number of jewels from each stall, corresponding to the binary digits of the number of jewels.

Wait, but in the third example, with n=255 and k=8, the prices are set to 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

With n=255 coins:

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 1 (128 coins), remaining 127 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 2 (64 coins), remaining 63 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 3 (32 coins), remaining 31 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 4 (16 coins), remaining 15 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 5 (8 coins), remaining 7 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 6 (4 coins), remaining 3 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 7 (2 coins), remaining 1 coin

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 8 (1 coin), remaining 0 coins

Total jewels: 8

This seems to work because each stall takes the largest possible price that Alice can afford at that step, and she buys one jewel from each stall.

So, in this setup, the number of jewels bought is equal to the number of stalls, since she buys one jewel from each stall.

Therefore, if k <= 60, and n >= k, and n is at least the sum of the stall prices, but in this case, the stall prices are decreasing, and she buys one from each.

Wait, but in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and she bought 3 from the first stall and none from the rest.

So, in that case, k=3 and s=10, which is allowed since s <= 60.

But in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible to set up stalls such that she buys exactly 4 jewels.

So, what's the general condition for it to be possible?

Let me consider that in order for Alice to buy exactly k jewels, the sum of the number of jewels bought from each stall should be exactly k.

Given that she buys as many as possible from each stall before moving to the next, the number of jewels bought from a stall is floor(coins_i / p_i), where coins_i are the remaining coins before visiting stall i.

This seems tricky to handle directly, so maybe there's a better way to model this.

An alternative approach is to think about the total cost of k jewels.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, and Alice buys j1, j2, ..., js jewels from each stall respectively, with sum j1 + j2 + ... + js = k, and the total cost is sum(ji * pi) <= n.

But this seems too broad, and I need to ensure that the way Alice buys the jewels follows the greedy approach: buy as many as possible from each stall in sequence.

So, perhaps I need to find a sequence of prices such that the cumulative number of jewels bought equals k, and the cumulative cost equals some value <= n.

Wait, but she doesn't necessarily spend all her coins; she just buys jewels until she's visited all stalls or run out of coins.

I need to find a way to control the number of jewels she buys by setting the prices appropriately.

Let me consider that if Bob sets up a stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels from that stall, spending floor(n / p) * p coins.

Then, she will have n - floor(n / p) * p coins left.

If she moves to the next stall with price q, she will buy floor(remaining / q) jewels, and so on.

This recursive process needs to result in exactly k jewels bought in total.

This seems complicated to handle directly, so maybe I need to find a way to maximize or minimize the number of jewels bought based on the prices set.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so as long as the number of stalls is <= 60, it's acceptable.

But I need to find if it's possible to set up such stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Looking back at the examples, in the first one, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought 3 jewels from the first stall and none from the others.

In the third one, with n=255 and k=8, they used 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, and Alice bought one jewel from each stall.

In both cases, "YES" is printed, followed by the number of stalls and the prices.

In the second case, with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible, so "NO" is printed.

I need to find a general method to determine if it's possible, and if so, provide a pricing scheme with up to 60 stalls.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If Bob sets up only one stall with price p, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels.

To make this equal to k, we need floor(n / p) = k.

This implies that k <= n / p < k + 1.

So, n / (k + 1) < p <= n / k.

If n is divisible by p, then p = n / k.

But p must be an integer between 1 and 10^18.

So, if there exists an integer p in (n / (k + 1), n / k], then setting one stall with that p would make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But n / (k + 1) < p <= n / k.

If n and k are such that n / k is not an integer, then p needs to be ceil(n / (k + 1)) to floor(n / k).

Wait, but p needs to be an integer, so if there's an integer in that range, then it's possible with one stall.

Otherwise, we need to consider using more stalls.

So, for the general case, with s stalls, we need to choose prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(coins_i / p_i) over i from 1 to s equals k, where coins_i is the remaining coins after buying from previous stalls.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to think recursively.

Let me consider dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as partitioning the number of jewels k into s parts, where each part is the number of jewels bought from each stall, and the cost doesn't exceed n.

But again, it's complicated.

Let me consider the case where Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice will buy floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2) from the second, and so on.

This seems too dependent on the specific values of p1, p2, etc.

Maybe I need to find a way to make the sum of jewels bought equal to k without exceeding n coins.

An alternative idea: perhaps I can set up stalls with decreasing prices, so that Alice buys a certain number from each stall, accumulating to k.

But I need a systematic way to determine the prices.

Looking back at the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

In this case, Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (price 2), spending 6 coins, and has 1 coin left, which is not enough to buy anything from the remaining stalls with higher prices.

So, with just one stall with price 2, she would buy 3 jewels, which is exactly k=3.

Then, why did they use 10 stalls? Maybe to make it clearer, but in reality, one stall would suffice in this case.

Wait, but according to the condition, s can be up to 60, and in this case, s=10 is fine, but s=1 would also work.

So, perhaps in some cases, s=1 is enough, and in others, more stalls are needed.

Wait, but in the third example, with n=255 and k=8, using s=8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, Alice buys one from each, totaling 8 jewels.

In this case, s=8 is necessary because with fewer stalls, she might buy more or fewer jewels.

So, perhaps the general approach is to use a binary-like representation, where each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of k.

Wait, but k is not necessarily a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps I can think of k as a sum of powers of 2, and set up stalls accordingly.

Let me consider that.

If I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from 1 up to some maximum, then Alice will buy one jewel from each stall whose price is less than or equal to her remaining coins.

In the third example, with n=255 and k=8, the prices are 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and she buys one from each, totaling 8.

Similarly, if k=5, I could set up stalls with prices 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and Alice would buy one from each, totaling 5 jewels, provided that n is at least the sum of these prices minus the overlap.

Wait, but in that case, the sum of the prices would be 16+8+4+2+1=31, but Alice would buy one from each, spending 16, then 8 from remaining 15, then 4 from remaining 7, then 2 from remaining 3, then 1 from remaining 1, totaling 5 jewels.

So, it seems that if k can be represented as a sum of up to 60 distinct powers of 2, and n is at least the sum of those powers of 2, then it's possible.

But k is up to 10^18, which is fine since 60 stalls can cover up to 2^60 -1, which is way larger than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is around 1.2e18, which covers up to k=1e18.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If k <= 60, set up k stalls with prices that are distinct powers of 2, starting from 1 up to 2^{k-1}.

- Ensure that n is at least the sum of these prices.

- Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But in the first example, k=3, and they used 10 stalls, but actually, with s=3, prices 4, 2, 1 would work:

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 1 (4 coins), remaining 3 coins

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 2 (2 coins), remaining 1 coin

- Buy 1 jewel from stall 3 (1 coin), remaining 0 coins

Total jewels: 3

Similarly, with s=1, price 2, she buys 3 jewels, which also works.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

But in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, is it possible to set up stalls such that she buys exactly 4 jewels?

Let's try:

Suppose s=4, prices 2, 1, 1, 1

- Stall 1: p=2, buy 3 jewels, spend 6 coins, remaining 0 coins

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4

Another try: s=4, prices 1, 1, 1, 1

- Stall 1: p=1, buy 6 jewels, spend 6 coins, remaining 0 coins

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4

Another try: s=4, prices 1.5, 1, 1, 1 (but prices must be integers)

Seems like no matter what I do, I can't get exactly 4 jewels with n=6.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, perhaps the general condition is:

- If n >= k and there exists a way to set up up to 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

But I need a more concrete condition to decide "YES" or "NO".

Looking back, in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, using one stall with p=2 works.

In the third example, with n=255 and k=8, using s=8 with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 works.

In the second example, with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible.

Is there a relationship between n and k that determines possibility?

Let me consider that in the first and third examples, n is sufficiently larger relative to k, and in the second, n is too small relative to k.

Wait, in the first example, n=7 and k=3, n/k=2.333, and in the third, n=255 and k=8, n/k=31.875.

In the second example, n=6 and k=4, n/k=1.5.

Maybe there's a lower bound on n/k for it to be possible.

But in the first example, n/k=7/3≈2.333, and in the second, n/k=6/4=1.5.

So, perhaps when n/k is too small, it's impossible.

But in the first example, n/k≈2.333, and in the third, n/k≈31.875.

Wait, but in the first example, using one stall with p=2 allows Alice to buy 3 jewels, which is more than n/k, but in the third example, using multiple stalls allows for finer control.

Wait, maybe it's about the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall.

If Bob sets up a stall with a high price, Alice buys fewer jewels, and with a low price, she buys more.

So, perhaps there's a trade-off between the number of stalls and the prices set.

But I need a general condition.

Let me consider that in order for Alice to buy exactly k jewels, the sum of the number of jewels bought from each stall should equal k.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of partitioning k into up to 60 parts, where each part is the number of jewels bought from a stall.

But each part is floor(n / p), where p is the price of the stall.

This seems too vague.

An alternative idea: perhaps it's always possible unless n is too small relative to k.

But in the second example, n=6 and k=4, it's impossible, even though n >= k.

Wait, n >=k is necessary but not sufficient, as shown in the second example.

So, what's the condition?

Let me consider that in order for Alice to buy exactly k jewels, the total cost should be less than or equal to n, and the number of jewels should be exactly k.

But that's too broad, since without controlling the prices, it's not guaranteed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal possible total cost for k jewels is k (if p=1 for all stalls), and the maximal possible total cost is k*n (if p=n for all stalls).

But actually, if p=n, she buys only 1 jewel from each stall.

Wait, no, p=n, she buys floor(n / n)=1 jewel per stall.

So, with s=k stalls, each with p=1, she buys one jewel from each, totaling k jewels, spending k coins.

So, as long as n >=k, it should be possible.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6 and k=4, 6 >=4, but it's impossible.

So, my previous thought is incorrect.

Wait, with s=4 stalls, each with p=1, she buys one from each, totaling 4 jewels, spending 4 coins, which is <=6, so it should work.

But according to the problem, it's "NO".

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem has additional constraints that I'm not considering.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18}.

Alice buys greedily: she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall."

So, the key is that she buys as many as possible from each stall in sequence before moving to the next.

So, in my previous thought, with s=4 stalls, each with p=1, she would buy one jewel from each stall, spending 1 coin each time, totaling 4 jewels and 4 coins spent, which is <=6, so it should work.

But according to the problem, it's "NO".

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way Alice buys the jewels.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall."

So, she buys as many as possible from stall 1 first, then moves to stall 2 with the remaining coins, buys as many as possible, and so on.

In the case of s=4 stalls with p=1 each:

- At stall 1, she buys floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- She can't buy anything from the remaining stalls.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than k=4.

Hence, it's not possible to set up stalls such that she buys exactly 4 jewels.

Wait, but if I set up s=2 stalls:

- Stall 1: p=2

- Stall 2: p=1

At stall 1, she buys floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Another attempt:

- Stall 1: p=1.5, but p must be integer.

- Stall 1: p=1, same as before, buys 6 jewels.

- Stall 1: p=3, Stall 2: p=1

At stall 1, p=3, buys floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Another attempt:

- Stall 1: p=2, Stall 2: p=1, Stall 3: p=1, Stall 4: p=1

At stall 1, p=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Seems like no combination of stalls with integer prices allows her to buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, what's the general condition?

Let me consider that in order for Alice to buy exactly k jewels, the total cost should be less than or equal to n, and the number of jewels should be exactly k.

But with the constraint that she buys as many as possible from each stall in sequence.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that the sum of the floor(n / p_i) over all stalls i is exactly k, where the p_i are the prices set by Bob.

But this is too vague.

An alternative approach is to think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels she can buy.

Minimal jewels: set one stall with p = ceil(n / k), which would make her buy exactly k jewels.

Wait, but p needs to be an integer between 1 and 10^18.

So, if n / k is not an integer, then p needs to be ceil(n / k).

But ceil(n / k) might not be an integer, but since p must be an integer, p = ceil(n / k) is acceptable.

Wait, ceil(n / k) is equal to floor((n - 1) / k) + 1, which is an integer.

So, p = ceil(n / k) is acceptable.

Then, if p is in the range [1, 10^18], and s=1, which is <=60, it's acceptable.

Hence, if there exists a p in [1, 10^18] such that floor(n / p) = k, then "YES" with s=1 and p1 = p.

Otherwise, need to consider using more stalls.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6 and k=4, floor(6 / p) =4.

So, 6 / p >=4, which implies p <= 6/4 =1.5.

Also, floor(6 / p) <5, so 6 / p <5, which implies p >6/5=1.2.

So, p needs to be in (1.2, 1.5].

But p must be an integer, so p=2.

But floor(6 /2)=3, which is less than 4.

Hence, no such p exists for s=1.

Therefore, need to consider s=2.

Let me try s=2.

Set p1 and p2.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) from stall 1, spends floor(n / p1) * p1 coins, then buys floor(remaining / p2) from stall 2.

Need floor(n / p1) + floor(remaining / p2) =4.

Let me try p1=1, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /1)=6, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /1)=0.

- Total jewels:6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=2, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /2)=3, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /1)=0.

- Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /1)=6, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /2)=0.

- Total jewels:6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=3, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /3)=2, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /1)=0.

- Total jewels:2, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1.5, but p must be integer.

Try p1=2, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /2)=3, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /2)=0.

- Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /1)=6, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /2)=0.

- Total jewels:6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=3, p2=2.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /3)=2, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /2)=0.

- Total jewels:2, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=2, p2=3.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /2)=3, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /3)=0.

- Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Seems like with s=2, it's not possible to get exactly 4 jewels.

What about s=3?

Let's try p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /2)=3, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /1)=0.

- Stall 3: floor(0 /1)=0.

- Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall 1: floor(6 /1)=6, spends 6 coins, remaining 0.

- Stall 2: floor(0 /1)=0
