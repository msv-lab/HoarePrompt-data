Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Given that, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet and check if each of these is a subsequence of s.

But wait, generating all possible strings of length n with k letters would be k^n possibilities. If k and n are small, this might be manageable, but since n can be up to 26 and k up to 26, and t can be up to 10^5, this approach is way too slow. I need a smarter way to solve this problem.

Let me think differently. Instead of generating all possible strings and checking each one against s, maybe I can find a way to determine if there's at least one string of length n that cannot be found as a subsequence in s.

One idea is to find the longest sequence of distinct characters from the first k letters that appears in s, and see if it's long enough to cover any sequence of length n.

Wait, but n can be up to 26, and s can be up to 1000 characters, but with t up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider the properties of subsequences. If s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, then for any sequence of n letters from the first k, there should be a way to find those letters in order in s.

But checking all k^n possibilities is not feasible.

Maybe I can think in terms of state machines or something that keeps track of the positions where each character appears in s.

Wait, another approach: for the string s, I can precompute for each character from a to the k-th letter, the positions where they appear.

Then, for any target subsequence, I can check if there's a way to pick positions in s for each character in the target sequence such that their positions are in increasing order.

But again, checking for all possible target sequences is too slow.

I need a way to determine if there's at least one sequence of length n that cannot be found in s as a subsequence.

Maybe I can think about the minimal string that cannot be found as a subsequence.

Wait, I recall something about the generalized suffix automaton or some string matching algorithms, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Let me consider the duality: instead of thinking about what's in s, think about what's missing.

If s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, then s must be rich enough in those sequences.

But checking directly is too slow, so I need an indirect way.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of distinct subsequences that s contains.

If the number of distinct subsequences of length n using only the first k letters is k^n, and if s contains all of them, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.

But again, counting the number of distinct subsequences is not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can compute the number of distinct subsequences of s that are of length n and consist only of the first k letters, and see if it equals k^n.

But computing the number of distinct subsequences of a given length is non-trivial.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem from a different angle.

Suppose I try to build a sequence of length n from the first k letters, and at each step, ensure that it cannot be a subsequence of s.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of a "forbidden sequence".

I need to find if there exists at least one sequence of length n that doesn't appear as a subsequence in s.

If I can find such a sequence efficiently, then I can print NO and that sequence.

But how to find it efficiently?

One idea: start building the sequence step by step, and at each step, choose a character that would make it harder for the sequence to be a subsequence of s.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if s doesn't contain all possible characters from the first k letters, then any sequence that includes a missing character won't be in s.

But the problem says that s comprises only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, so s only contains those k letters.

Wait, no, it says "s comprises only of the first k lowercase English alphabets", meaning s contains only those k letters, but it doesn't say that s contains all k letters.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "m is the length of the string s, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets."

So s may not contain all k letters, only that it contains letters from the first k letters.

So, if s is missing some letters from the first k, then any sequence that includes a missing letter won't be a subsequence of s.

Therefore, in that case, the answer is NO, and I can print a sequence consisting of that missing letter repeated n times.

But wait, n could be greater than 1, so I need to handle that.

Wait, no, if k is less than 26, and s doesn't contain all k letters, then I can find a letter that's missing in s and print a sequence consisting of that letter repeated n times.

But if s contains all k letters, then I need to check if s contains all possible subsequences of length n.

But again, checking all k^n possibilities is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of times each letter appears in s.

If a particular letter appears fewer than a certain number of times, it might not be possible to form some subsequences.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: treat the problem as finding if s contains all possible combinations of n letters from the first k letters in some order.

This sounds similar to checking if s is k-universal for subsequences of length n.

But I don't know much about that.

I need to find a way to efficiently determine if there's at least one sequence of length n that's not a subsequence of s.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through s and keep track of the possible subsequences that can be formed up to each point.

But with t up to 1e5 and m up to 1000, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that for each position in s, I can keep track of the possible sequences of length up to n that can be formed ending at that position.

But that seems too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, maybe dynamic programming can help here.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the position in s, and j is the sequence built so far.

But j can be up to k^n, which is too big.

Not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if s has enough repetitions of each letter, in the required order, to cover all possible combinations.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of the number of times each letter appears in s.

If the minimum frequency of any letter in s is less than ceil(n / k), then there must be some sequences of length n that cannot be formed.

Wait, is that correct?

Not sure.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times each letter needs to appear to cover all possible subsequences.

But I'm not sure about that.

Let me consider small values.

Take n=1, k=2, s="ab".

All possible strings of length 1 are "a" and "b". Both are present in s as subsequences.

So, answer is YES.

Another example: n=2, k=2, s="abba".

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

Check if all are subsequences of "abba".

"aa": positions 1 and 3 (assuming 1-based indexing).

"a" at position 1, another "a" at position 3.

Since positions are in increasing order, it's a subsequence.

"ab": positions 1 and 2.

"ba": positions 2 and 3.

"bb": positions 2 and 4.

All are present. So, answer is YES.

Another test case: n=2, k=2, s="abb".

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

"aa": is "a" at position 1 and is there another "a" after it? Position 3 is "b", so no "a". So, "aa" is not a subsequence.

Therefore, answer is NO, and I can print "aa".

So, in this case, the program should output NO and then "aa".

Now, looking at the provided program:

It reads t, then for each test case, reads n, k, m, and s.

It defines us as the set of first k lowercase letters.

Then, it initializes win as an empty set.

Then, it iterates through s, and for each character in s, if it's in us, it adds it to win.

If win has all k letters, it appends the character to ans, increments ps by 1, and clears win.

If ps >= n, it prints "YES".

Else, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by joining ans, adding a letter not in win, and then 'a'*(n - len(ans) -1).

Wait, this seems flawed.

In the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb".

us = {'a', 'b'}

win starts empty.

s[0] = 'a', which is in us, so win = {'a'}

s[1] = 'b', in us, win = {'a','b'}, which has k=2 letters, so append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win.

s[2] = 'b', in us, win = {'b'}

So, ps=1, which is less than n=2, so prints "NO".

Then, it prints ''.join(ans) + i + 'a'*(n - len(ans)-1), where ans=['b'], i is 'a' (since 'a' not in win={'b'}), so it prints "ba" + 'a'*(2-1-1) = "ba" + '' = "ba".

But in the example, the expected output is "aa".

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking closer:

After the loop, if ps >=n, print "YES".

Else, print "NO", then:

for i in us:

if i not in win:

print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) -1))

In the second test case, us={'a','b'}, win={'b'}, so i='a' (assuming some order).

So, it prints ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a'*(2 -1 -1) = 'b' + 'a' + 'a'*0 = 'ba'

But the expected output is "aa".

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the logic better.

The logic seems to be:

- Track a window win that collects characters until it has all k letters.

- When it has all k letters, append the last character to ans, increment ps, and reset win.

- If ps >=n, then s has enough such windows to cover any sequence of length n.

But I don't think this accurately checks if all possible sequences of length n are present as subsequences in s.

In the second test case, ps=1 < n=2, so it prints "NO" and provides "ba" as a missing sequence, but actually "aa" is missing.

So, it's providing a wrong sequence.

Moreover, in the third test case, n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

us={'a','b','c'}

win starts empty.

s[0]='a', win={'a'}

s[1]='a', win={'a'}

s[2]='b', win={'a','b'}

append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win.

s[3]='b', win={'b'}

s[4]='c', win={'b','c'}

append 'c' to ans, ps=2, clear win.

s[5]='c', win={'c'}

s[6]='a', win={'a','c'}

s[7]='b', win={'a','b','c'}

append 'b' to ans, ps=3, clear win.

s[8]='a', win={'a'}

s[9]='b', win={'a','b'}

So, ans=['b','c','b'], ps=3 >= n=3, so should print "YES", but in the example, it's "NO ccc"

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether all possible strings of length \( n \) formed from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string \( s \). If not, we need to provide one such string that does not appear as a subsequence in \( s \).

### Approach

1. **Initial Check for Missing Characters**:
   - If \( s \) does not contain all of the first \( k \) letters, any sequence that includes a missing letter cannot be a subsequence of \( s \). Hence, we can immediately return `NO` and provide a sequence consisting of the missing letter repeated \( n \) times.

2. **Frequency Check**:
   - For sequences that only use a subset of the first \( k \) letters, we need to ensure that \( s \) contains enough repetitions of these letters in the required order.

3. **Dynamic Programming to Track Subsequences**:
   - Use a dynamic programming approach to track the possible lengths of subsequences that can be formed up to each position in \( s \).
   - Maintain a list (`dp`) where each element represents the positions in \( s \) where a subsequence of a certain length ends.

4. **Determine Feasibility**:
   - If we can form subsequences of length \( n \) using any combination of the first \( k \) letters, then return `YES`.
   - If not, construct a sequence that cannot be formed and return `NO` along with this sequence.

            else:
                # If all characters have enough occurrences, find a combination that fails

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check for Missing Characters**:
   - We first check if all the first \( k \) letters are present in \( s \). If not, we immediately return `NO` and provide a sequence of the missing letter repeated \( n \) times.

2. **Frequency and Position Tracking**:
   - We track the positions of each of the first \( k \) letters in \( s \).

3. **Dynamic Programming to Track Subsequences**:
   - We use a dynamic programming approach to build up subsequences of increasing lengths, ensuring that each step respects the order of characters in \( s \).

4. **Determine Feasibility**:
   - If we can form any subsequence of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) letters, we print `YES`. Otherwise, we print `NO` and provide a sequence that cannot be formed, prioritizing sequences of repeated letters that appear insufficiently in \( s \).
