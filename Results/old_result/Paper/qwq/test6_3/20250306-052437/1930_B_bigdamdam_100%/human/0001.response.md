Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation p of length n such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without any repeats. So, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not be any two different positions i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. This means that if I pick two positions i and j, and p_i is a divisor of p_j, then p_{i+1} should not be a divisor of p_{j+1}.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Possible pairs of i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4, p_2=1; p_1 does not divide p_2 (since 4 does not divide 1), so no problem.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4, p_3=2; 4 divides 2? No, 4 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4, p_4=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1, p_3=2; 1 divides 2, but then p_3=2 and p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1, p_4=3; 1 divides 3, but p_3=2 and p_5 does not exist since n=4.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2, p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3.

So, in this permutation, the condition holds.

In the second test case, n=3, and the output is [1,2,3]. Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1, p_2=2; 1 divides 2, but p_2=2 and p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1, p_3=3; 1 divides 3, but p_2=2 and p_4 does not exist.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

So, this also satisfies the condition.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it does.

The function func() is defined, which reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads n and constructs a permutation p of length n.

The way it constructs p is:

- It initializes a list p of size n with all zeros.

- It sets ind to n.

- It fills the even indices (0-based) of p with ind, and then decreases ind by 2 until it can.

- Then, it sets ind to 1 if n is even, or to 2 if n is odd.

- It fills the odd indices of p with ind, increasing ind by 2 each time.

Wait, actually, in code, it's:

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for n=4:

- ind = 4

- p[0] = 4

- ind = 4 - 2 = 2

- p[2] = 2

- ind = 1 + 4 % 2 = 1

- p[1] = 1

- ind = 1 + 2 = 3

- p[3] = 3

So, p = [4,1,2,3], which matches the first test case.

For n=3:

- ind = 3

- p[0] = 3

- ind = 3 - 2 = 1

- p[2] = 1

- ind = 1 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2

So, p = [3,2,1], but according to the example, [1,2,3] is also valid. So, [3,2,1] should also be valid, as per the note in the problem.

Let's check if [3,2,1] satisfies the condition:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3, p_2=2; 3 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3, p_3=1; 3 divides 1, but p_2=2 and p_4 does not exist.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=1; 2 does not divide 1.

So, it seems [3,2,1] is also valid.

But in the example, [1,2,3] is provided, while the code outputs [3,2,1] for n=3. Both are valid, so it's fine.

Now, I need to verify if this construction always produces a valid permutation.

Let me think about how this construction works.

It seems to place the largest numbers in the even positions (0-based), decreasing by 2 each time, and then place the remaining numbers in the odd positions, starting from 1 and increasing by 2 each time.

For example, for n=5:

- ind = 5

- p[0] = 5

- ind = 5 - 2 = 3

- p[2] = 3

- ind = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2

- ind = 2 + 2 = 4

- p[3] = 4

- ind = 4 + 2 = 6 (but n=5, so stop)

So, p = [5,2,3,4,1]

Let's check if this is valid:

- i=0, j=1: p_0=5, p_1=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=0, j=2: p_0=5, p_2=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=0, j=3: p_0=5, p_3=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=0, j=4: p_0=5, p_4=1; 5 divides 1, but p_1=2 and p_5 does not exist.

- i=1, j=2: p_1=2, p_2=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=2, p_3=4; 2 divides 4, but p_2=3 and p_4=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=2, p_4=1; 2 divides 1.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=3, p_3=4; 3 does not divide 4.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=3, p_4=1; 3 divides 1, but p_3=4 and p_5 does not exist.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=4, p_4=1; 4 does not divide 1.

So, it seems valid.

Another example, n=6:

- ind = 6

- p[0] = 6

- ind = 6 - 2 = 4

- p[2] = 4

- ind = 4 - 2 = 2

- p[4] = 2

- ind = 1 + 6 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

- p[1] = 1

- ind = 1 + 2 = 3

- p[3] = 3

- ind = 3 + 2 = 5

- p[5] = 5

So, p = [6,1,4,3,2,5]

Check validity:

- i=0, j=1: p_0=6, p_1=1; 6 does not divide 1.

- i=0, j=2: p_0=6, p_2=4; 6 does not divide 4.

- i=0, j=3: p_0=6, p_3=3; 6 divides 3, but p_1=1 and p_4=2; 1 does not divide 2.

- i=0, j=4: p_0=6, p_4=2; 6 divides 2, but p_1=1 and p_5=5; 1 divides 5.

Wait, but according to the condition, it should be that p_i divides p_j AND p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. So, in this case, p_0=6 divides p_4=2 (which is false, since 6 does not divide 2), so no problem.

Wait, 6 does not divide 2, so that's fine.

- i=0, j=5: p_0=6, p_5=5; 6 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1, p_2=4; 1 divides 4, but p_2=4 and p_3=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1, p_3=3; 1 divides 3, but p_2=4 and p_4=2; 4 does not divide 2.

Wait, 4 does divide 2? 4 divides 2? No, 4 does not divide 2, because 2/4 is not an integer. Wait, actually, 4 does not divide 2, because 2 is less than 4. So, it's correct.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=1, p_4=2; 1 divides 2, but p_2=4 and p_5=5; 4 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=1, p_5=5; 1 divides 5, but p_2=4 and p_6 does not exist.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=4, p_3=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=4, p_4=2; 4 divides 2? Wait, 4 does not divide 2, because 2 < 4.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=4, p_5=5; 4 does not divide 5.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3, p_4=2; 3 does not divide 2.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=3, p_5=5; 3 does not divide 5.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=2, p_5=5; 2 does not divide 5.

So, seems valid.

Now, to generalize, does this construction always produce a valid permutation?

Let's think about the construction:

- For even indices (0-based), it places the largest numbers, decreasing by 2 each time.

- For odd indices, it places the remaining numbers, starting from 1 and increasing by 2 each time.

So, for even n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 2 or 1, depending on n.

- Odd indices: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the remaining numbers.

For odd n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 1.

- Odd indices: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the remaining numbers.

Wait, in code, ind = 1 + n % 2 for odd indices.

For n=4:

- Even indices: 4, 2

- Odd indices: 1, 3

For n=5:

- Even indices: 5, 3, 1

- Odd indices: 2, 4

Yes, matches the earlier example.

Now, to prove that this construction always produces a valid permutation, I need to show that for any i and j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, it's impossible.

Let's consider two cases based on the parity of i and j.

Case 1: i and j are both even indices.

In this case, p_i and p_j are from the set of even-index values, which are the larger numbers, decreasing by 2.

For example, for n=6: p0=6, p2=4, p4=2

p_i divides p_j would mean that a larger number divides a smaller number, which is only possible if p_j is a multiple of p_i.

But in this construction, the even-index values are decreasing by 2, so p_j would be smaller than p_i, and it's unlikely for p_i to divide p_j unless p_j is a multiple of p_i.

But in the decreasing sequence of even numbers, this could happen.

Wait, for n=6: p0=6, p2=4, p4=2

- p0=6 and p2=4: 6 does not divide 4.

- p0=6 and p4=2: 6 does not divide 2.

- p2=4 and p4=2: 4 divides 2.

But in this case, p_{i+1} and p_{j+1} would be p1 and p3, p1 and p5, or p3 and p5.

In n=6: p1=1, p3=3, p5=5

- For i=0, j=2: p0=6 divides p2=4? No.

- p2=4 divides p4=2? Yes, but p1=1 and p3=3; 1 divides 3, but since p_{i+1}=1 divides p_{j+1}=3, but p_i=4 does not divide p_j=2, so no problem.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Maybe this construction minimizes the chances of p_i dividing p_j by placing larger numbers in even positions and smaller in odd positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is to have p_i and p_{i+1} such that their relationships make it unlikely for both p_i|p_j and p_{i+1}|p_{j+1} to hold simultaneously.

Alternatively, maybe this construction ensures that for any i and j, if p_i divides p_j, then p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

But to confirm, I need to see if there exists any i and j where both conditions hold.

Let me consider n=7:

- Even indices: 7,5,3,1

- Odd indices: 2,4,6

So, p = [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check validity:

- i=0, j=1: p0=7, p1=2; 7 does not divide 2.

- i=0, j=2: p0=7, p2=5; 7 does not divide 5.

- i=0, j=3: p0=7, p3=4; 7 does not divide 4.

- i=0, j=4: p0=7, p4=3; 7 does not divide 3.

- i=0, j=5: p0=7, p5=6; 7 does not divide 6.

- i=0, j=6: p0=7, p6=1; 7 divides 1.

- But p1=2 and p7 does not exist.

- i=1, j=2: p1=2, p2=5; 2 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=3: p1=2, p3=4; 2 divides 4, but p2=5 and p4=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=4: p1=2, p4=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=5: p1=2, p5=6; 2 divides 6, but p2=5 and p6=1; 5 does not divide 1.

- i=1, j=6: p1=2, p6=1; 2 does not divide 1.

- i=2, j=3: p2=5, p3=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=2, j=4: p2=5, p4=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=5: p2=5, p5=6; 5 does not divide 6.

- i=2, j=6: p2=5, p6=1; 5 divides 1.

- i=3, j=4: p3=4, p4=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=3, j=5: p3=4, p5=6; 4 divides 6, but p4=3 and p6=1; 3 does not divide 1.

- i=3, j=6: p3=4, p6=1; 4 does not divide 1.

- i=4, j=5: p4=3, p5=6; 3 divides 6, but p5=6 and p7 does not exist.

- i=4, j=6: p4=3, p6=1; 3 divides 1.

- i=5, j=6: p5=6, p6=1; 6 does not divide 1.

So, seems valid.

Now, to see if this construction always works, perhaps I need to look for a general pattern or find a counterexample where for some n, this construction fails.

Alternatively, maybe I can reason about the properties of the constructed permutation.

Let's consider that in this construction, even indices have larger numbers decreasing, and odd indices have smaller numbers increasing.

So, p[i] for even i is larger, and p[i] for odd i is smaller.

This might help in minimizing the chances of p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1} simultaneously.

But to be sure, let's think about potential problematic cases.

Suppose p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Given the construction, p_i is from the larger set and p_j is from either larger or smaller set depending on j.

It's possible that p_i divides p_j, but in that case, p_{i+1} is from the smaller set, and p_{j+1} is from the corresponding set.

Given the way numbers are arranged, it's unlikely for both conditions to hold simultaneously.

But to confirm, let's consider n=8.

Construct p:

- Even indices: 8,6,4,2

- Odd indices: 1,3,5,7

So, p = [8,1,6,3,4,5,2,7]

Check validity:

- i=0, j=1: p0=8, p1=1; 8 does not divide 1.

- i=0, j=2: p0=8, p2=6; 8 does not divide 6.

- i=0, j=3: p0=8, p3=3; 8 does not divide 3.

- i=0, j=4: p0=8, p4=4; 8 divides 4, but p1=1 and p5=5; 1 divides 5.

But since p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, this would be a problem.

Wait, but in this case, p1=1 divides p5=5, but p0=8 divides p4=4.

Wait, but the condition is that there do not exist i and j such that both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In this case, p0=8 divides p4=4, and p1=1 divides p5=5.

So, does this mean that for i=0 and j=4, p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}?

Wait, but p0=8 divides p4=4, and p1=1 divides p5=5.

So, 8 divides 4 (yes), and 1 divides 5 (yes). So, this seems to violate the condition.

But according to the problem, the permutation should not have such i and j.

So, is there a mistake in the construction?

Wait, in the code, for n=8:

ind = 8

p[0] = 8

ind = 8 - 2 = 6

p[2] = 6

ind = 6 - 2 = 4

p[4] = 4

ind = 4 - 2 = 2

p[6] = 2

ind = 1 + 8 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

p[1] = 1

ind = 1 + 2 = 3

p[3] = 3

ind = 3 + 2 = 5

p[5] = 5

ind = 5 + 2 = 7

p[7] = 7

So, p = [8,1,6,3,4,5,2,7]

But in this permutation, for i=0 and j=4:

p0=8 divides p4=4, and p1=1 divides p5=5.

So, this seems to violate the condition.

Wait, but according to the problem, such a pair should not exist.

So, is the construction incorrect?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

The condition is that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In the above example, i=0 and j=4: p0=8 divides p4=4, and p1=1 divides p5=5.

But i and j are 0 and 4, which are distinct and within the range.

So, this seems to be a violation.

Wait, but maybe in the problem's 1-based indexing, but in the code, it's 0-based.

Wait, the problem describes 1 ≤ i, j < n, which seems to be 1-based indexing for i and j.

But in Python, lists are 0-based.

Wait, in the problem statement, n is at least
