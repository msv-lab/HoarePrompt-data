Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation p of length n such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without any repeats. So, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should be no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Okay, so I need to make sure that in my permutation, there are no such pairs (i,j) that satisfy both these dividing conditions.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's see if this satisfies the condition.

Possible pairs (i,j):

- i=1, j=2: p1=4, p2=1; 4 does not divide 1, so this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=3: p1=4, p3=2; 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, which is the opposite.

- Wait, 4 does not divide 2, but 2 divides 4. Hmm, but the condition is p_i divides p_j, which in this case is 4 divides 2, which is false. So this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=4: p1=4, p4=3; 4 does not divide 3, so fine.

- i=2, j=3: p2=1, p3=2; 1 divides 2, but p3=2 and p4=3; 2 does not divide 3, so this pair is fine.

- i=2, j=4: p2=1, p4=3; 1 divides 3, but p3=2 and p5 doesn't exist since n=4. Wait, j+1=5 is out of bounds, so maybe j has to be less than n-1. Let me check the problem again.

Ah, it says 1 ≤ i, j < n, and i ≠ j. So j can be up to n-1, since j+1 up to n is allowed.

So for n=4, j can be up to 3.

So pairs are:

- (1,2): check p1 divides p2 and p2 divides p3

- (1,3): check p1 divides p3 and p2 divides p4

- (2,3): check p2 divides p3 and p3 divides p4

In the example [4,1,2,3]:

- For (1,2): 4 divides 1? No, and 1 divides 2? Yes, but since 4 doesn't divide 1, the whole condition is false, so fine.

- For (1,3): 4 divides 2? No, and 1 divides 3? Yes, but again, since 4 doesn't divide 2, it's fine.

- For (2,3): 1 divides 2? Yes, and 2 divides 3? No, so fine.

So, in this permutation, no pair satisfies both dividing conditions.

In the note, it says that [1,2,3,4] is invalid because i=1, j=3: 1 divides 3 and 2 divides 4, which satisfies both conditions, making it invalid.

Another invalid permutation is [3,4,2,1]: i=3, j=2: p3=2 divides p2=4, and p4=1 divides p3=2.

So, the task is to find at least one permutation that avoids such pairs.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]

p = [0] * n

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

print(*p)

It seems to handle multiple test cases, reading t, then for each test case, reading n, and then constructing a permutation p based on some logic.

Let's see what this logic does.

It initializes p as a list of zeros of length n.

Then, it sets ind to n, and fills the even indices (0-based) with decreasing even numbers from n downwards, stepping by 2.

Then, it sets ind to 1 + n % 2, which is 1 if n is even, and 2 if n is odd, and fills the odd indices with increasing odd numbers starting from ind, stepping by 2.

So, for n=4:

- ind = 4

- p[0] = 4, ind = 2

- p[2] = 2

- ind = 1 + 4 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

- p[1] = 1, ind = 3

- p[3] = 3

So, p = [4,1,2,3], which matches the first test case.

For n=3:

- ind = 3

- p[0] = 3, ind = 1

- p[2] = 1

- ind = 1 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2

So, p = [3,2,1], but the sample output for n=3 is [1,2,3]. Hmm, is [3,2,1] also valid?

Let's check:

- (1,2): 3 divides 2? No, and 2 divides 1? No → fine

- (1,3): 3 divides 1? No, and 2 divides 3? No → fine

- (2,3): 2 divides 3? No, and 1 divides 3? Yes → but since 2 doesn't divide 3, it's fine

So, [3,2,1] is also valid.

The sample output gave [1,2,3], which is also valid, as mentioned in the note.

So, multiple permutations can be valid.

Now, I need to verify if the provided program always generates a valid permutation under the given constraints.

Looking back at the program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]

p = [0] * n

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

print(*p)

It seems to construct p by filling even indices with decreasing even numbers from n downwards, and odd indices with increasing odd numbers starting from 1 + n % 2.

Wait, but in Python, indices start at 0, so 0 is even, 1 is odd, etc.

Let's see for n=5:

- ind = 5

- p[0] = 5, ind = 3

- p[2] = 3, ind = 1

- ind = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2, ind = 4

- p[3] = 4, ind = 6 (but n=5, so p[4] remains 0, which is incorrect)

Wait, p = [5,2,3,4,0], but p[4] should be an positive integer between 1 and 5, but 0 is invalid. So, there's an error here.

Wait, no, in the code, p is initialized with zeros, and all positions are supposed to be filled.

Wait, for n=5:

- ind = 5

- p[0] = 5, ind = 3

- p[2] = 3, ind = 1

- ind = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2, ind = 4

- p[3] = 4, ind = 6

- p[4] = 6, but 6 is greater than n=5, which is invalid.

Wait, but in the code, it's p[i] = ind, ind += 2, so p[4] = 6, which is invalid for n=5.

Wait, but in the earlier step, ind = 1 + n % 2 is 2, then ind +=2 to 4, then +=2 to 6, which is beyond n=5.

So, p = [5,2,3,4,6], but 6 is invalid.

Wait, but n=5, so p should be [5,2,3,4,1], but according to the code, p[4] = ind =6, which is wrong.

So, there's a mistake in the code for n=5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Let's see:

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for n=5:

- ind = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2, ind =4

- p[3] =4, ind=6

- p[5], but n=5, so i in range(1,5,2): i=1,3

- So p[1]=2, p[3]=4

- p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[4]=?

Wait, p[4] is not assigned in the code, it remains 0, which is invalid.

Wait, no, p is initialized to [0]*n, then p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[1]=2, p[3]=4, and p[4] is not set, so it remains 0.

This is an error.

So, for n=5, the code would output [5,2,3,4,0], which is invalid.

But the problem states that n >=3 and permutations should consist of numbers from 1 to n without repetition.

So, this code is incorrect for odd n.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, it fills odd indices with ind starting from 1 + n%2, stepping by 2.

For n=5:

- ind =1 +1=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[3]=4, ind=6

- No more i in range(1,5,2), since i=1,3

- So p[4] remains 0

This is a clear error; p[4] should be set to 1.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test case for n=3, p=[3,2,1], which is correct.

Because n=3, ind=3, then p[0]=3, ind=1

Then ind=1+1=2

p[1]=2, ind=4 (which is beyond n=3, but p[2]=1, since ind didn't assign to p[2]

Wait, no, for n=3:

- p[0]=3, ind=1

- ind=1+1=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- No more i in range(1,3,2), so p[2]=0, but in the earlier explanation, it was [3,2,1], which is correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, no, for n=3:

- p[0]=3, p[2]=1, p[1]=2

Yes, p[2]=1, which is correct.

Wait, in the code, after p[0]=3, ind=1, then ind=1+3%2=2, then p[1]=2, ind=4, but p[2] is not assigned, so it remains 0.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, p[2]=1, but according to the code, p[2] should be 1, but how?

Wait, no, in the code, after filling p[0]=3, ind=1, then ind=1+1=2, p[1]=2, ind=4, and p[2] is not assigned, so it remains 0.

But earlier, I thought p=[3,2,1], which is correct, but according to the code, it should be [3,2,0], which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]

p = [0] * n

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

print(*p)

Wait, no assignment to p[2] in n=3 after p[0]=3 and p[1]=2.

So, p=[3,2,0], which is invalid.

But in the sample output for n=3, it's [1,2,3].

Wait, perhaps the code is different.

Wait, in the problem statement, the sample output for n=3 is [1,2,3], but according to the code, for n=3, it would be [3,2,0], which is invalid.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the code.

Looking again:

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

So, for n=3:

- p[0]=3, ind=1

- p[2]=1, ind=-1, but p[2]=1 is correct.

Wait, in Python, range(0,3,2): i=0,2

- p[0]=3, ind=1

- p[2]=1, ind=-1

Then, ind =1 +3%2=2

for i in range(1,3,2): i=1

- p[1]=2, ind=4

So, p=[3,2,1], which is correct.

Wait, p[2]=1 is assigned in the first loop.

Wait, no, in the first loop:

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

So, for n=3:

- i=0: p[0]=3, ind=1

- i=2: p[2]=1, ind=-1

Then, ind =1 +3%2=2

for i in range(1,3,2): i=1

- p[1]=2, ind=4

So, p=[3,2,1], which is correct.

Wait, but ind=1 +3%2=2, then p[1]=2, ind=4

But p[2] was already set to 1 in the first loop.

So, p=[3,2,1], which is correct.

Wait, but for n=5:

- ind=5

- p[0]=5, ind=3

- p[2]=3, ind=1

- ind=1 +5%2=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[3]=4, ind=6

- No p[4] assignment, so p[4]=0, which is invalid.

So, for n=5, the code would output [5,2,3,4,0], which is invalid.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to ensure that p[4] is set to 1.

Wait, but in n=5:

- p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[1]=2, p[3]=4, p[4]=1

So, the code needs to set p[4]=1.

But according to the code, p[4] would be ind=6, which is invalid.

Wait, but in the first loop, p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[4]=1

Wait, no, in the first loop:

ind=5

p[0]=5, ind=3

p[2]=3, ind=1

p[4]=1, ind=-1

Then, ind=1 +5%2=2

p[1]=2, ind=4

p[3]=4, ind=6

So, p=[5,2,3,4,1], which is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, p[4]=0, but according to this, p[4]=1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me re-execute for n=5:

- ind=5

- p[0]=5, ind=3

- p[2]=3, ind=1

- p[4]=1, ind=-1

Then, ind=1 +5%2=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[3]=4, ind=6

So, p=[5,2,3,4,1], which is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought p[4]=0, but according to this, p[4]=1.

So, perhaps I misread the code earlier.

Yes, in the first loop, it fills p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[4]=1

Then, ind=1 +5%2=2

- p[1]=2, p[3]=4

So, p=[5,2,3,4,1], which is correct.

Similarly, for n=4:

- p[0]=4, p[2]=2

- ind=1 +4%2=1

- p[1]=1, p[3]=3

So, p=[4,1,2,3], which matches the sample.

For n=3:

- p[0]=3, p[2]=1

- ind=1 +3%2=2

- p[1]=2

So, p=[3,2,1], which is correct.

For n=2:

- p[0]=2, p[1]=1

Which is [2,1], which is correct.

For n=6:

- p[0]=6, p[2]=4, p[4]=2

- ind=1 +6%2=1

- p[1]=1, p[3]=3, p[5]=5

So, p=[6,1,4,3,2,5], which seems correct.

Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Take n=6, p=[6,1,4,3,2,5]

Check pairs (i,j):

- (1,2): 6 divides 1? No, and 1 divides 4? Yes → fine

- (1,3): 6 divides 4? No, and 1 divides 3? Yes → fine

- (1,4): 6 divides 2? No, and 4 divides 5? No → fine

- (2,3): 1 divides 4? Yes, and 4 divides 3? No → fine

- (2,4): 1 divides 2? Yes, and 4 divides 5? No → fine

- (3,4): 4 divides 2? No, and 3 divides 5? No → fine

So, it's correct.

Seems like the code works.

So, the logic is to fill even indices with decreasing even numbers from n downwards, and odd indices with increasing odd numbers starting from 1 + n%2.

This seems to work for both even and odd n.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the number of test cases, t.
    - For each test case, read the integer n.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
    - Create an array `p` of size n initialized to 0.
    - Fill the even indices (0-based) with the largest available even numbers in descending order.
    - Fill the odd indices with the smallest available odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Output**:
    - Print the permutation for each test case.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
            if ind <= 0:
                break
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
            if ind > n:
                break
        print(*p)

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Filling of Permutation Array**:
    - For even indices (0-based), start from the largest even number n and decrement by 2 for each previous even index.
    - For odd indices, start from the smallest odd number (1 if n is even, 2 if n is odd) and increment by 2 for each subsequent odd index.
  
- **Correctness**:
    - This approach ensures that even indices have larger numbers and odd indices have smaller numbers, reducing the likelihood of division relationships between p_i and p_j as per the problem's constraints.
    - The permutation generated in this manner avoids the condition where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} for any distinct i and j.

- **Efficiency**:
    - The algorithm runs in O(n) time for each test case since it makes two passes through the array `p`.

- **Step-by-step Filling of Permutation Array**:
    - For even indices (0-based), start from the largest even number n and decrement by 2 for each previous even index.
    - For odd indices, start from the smallest odd number (1 if n is even, 2 if n is odd) and increment by 2 for each subsequent odd index.
  
- **Correctness**:
    - This approach ensures that even indices have larger numbers and odd indices have smaller numbers, reducing the likelihood of division relationships between p_i and p_j as per the problem's constraints.
    - The permutation generated in this manner avoids the condition where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} for any distinct i and j.

- **Efficiency**:
    - The algorithm runs in O(n) time for each test case since it makes two passes through the array `p`.

## Solution Code Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases, t.
    - For each test case, read the integer n.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
    - Initialize an array `p` of size n with zeros.
    - Fill even indices (0-based) with descending even numbers starting from n.
    - Fill odd indices with ascending odd numbers starting from 1 + n%2.

3. **Output**:
    - Print the permutation array for each test case.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the number of test cases, t.
    - For each test case, read the integer n.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
    - Create an array `p` of size n initialized to 0.
    - Fill the even indices (0-based) with the largest available even numbers in descending order.
    - Fill the odd indices with the smallest available odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Output**:
    - Print the permutation for each test case.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
            if ind <= 0:
                break
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
            if ind > n:
                break
        print(*p)
