Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores after making moves according to a permutation and an array of scores. The game lasts for a certain number of turns, and each player can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. Both players start at specific positions: Bodya at position PB and Sasha at position PS. The game consists of k turns. In each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add the value of a[x] to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to either stay at their current position or move to p[x].

The goal is to determine who has a higher score after k turns. If both have the same score, it's a draw.

I need to process multiple test cases, and the constraints are quite large: n can be up to 2*10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. This suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Looking at the provided code, it seems that it's trying to simulate the game for both players separately and then compare their scores. The function `func_1` calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` with their starting positions and then compares the scores to decide the winner.

The `calculate_score` function seems to be simulating the moves for a player. It keeps track of the positions visited and checks for cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation for large k.

Let me dive into the `calculate_score` function to understand how it works.

- It initializes score to 0 and starts from the given start_pos.

- It keeps track of the steps taken and uses a dictionary to remember when each position was first visited to detect cycles.

- If a position is revisited, it means there's a cycle, and it calculates the cycle length and the score within one cycle.

- Then, it calculates how many full cycles can fit into the remaining steps and adds the corresponding score.

- Finally, it adds the score for any remaining steps after the full cycles.

This approach seems correct in theory, as it handles both the non-cyclic and cyclic parts of the permutation path separately, which is efficient for large k.

Now, looking at `func_2`, it reads all input at once, splits it into tokens, and processes each test case by extracting the necessary values and calling `func_1`.

It collects all results in a list and prints them at the end, which is efficient.

I need to check if there are any potential errors or optimizations that could be made.

First, in `calculate_score`, it simulates each step until it either reaches k steps or detects a cycle. This should be efficient enough since the sum of n across all test cases is 2*10^5, and for each position, it visits it at most once before detecting a cycle.

However, I should consider if there are any corner cases that might cause issues.

For example:

- If k is 1, the player can only add a[x] to their score and choose to stay or move once.

- If k is very large (up to 10^9), but the permutation has short cycles, the cycle detection and calculation are crucial to avoid timeouts.

- If the permutation has multiple cycles, but the players start in different cycles.

- If a player stays in one position for multiple turns.

I need to ensure that the `calculate_score` function correctly handles staying in the same position.

Looking back at the problem, it says that on each turn, the player can either stay at the current position x or move to p[x]. This means that at each step, the player chooses whether to stay or move.

However, in the `calculate_score` function, it seems to assume that the player always moves to p[x], unless there's a cycle, but actually, the player can choose to stay to maximize their score.

This is a crucial point that might be misinterpreted in the provided code.

Wait a minute, the problem says that on each turn, the player can choose to stay or move to p[x]. It's not specified that they have to move; they can choose to stay.

In that case, the player will always choose the option that maximizes their score for each turn.

So, in each turn, the player can choose to stay at x and get a[x], or move to p[x] and get a[p[x]], but they can make this choice independently each turn.

But, since they make the choice simultaneously, and the choice affects the next position, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, no. The problem says that on each turn, both players make their choice simultaneously:

1. They add a[x] to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Then, they choose to either stay at x or move to p[x].

This means that in each turn, the player adds a[x] to their score and then decides whether to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

So, the choice affects the position for the next turn.

Given that, the player can choose, in each turn, whether to stay at the current position or move to p[x].

This seems like a dynamic decision, but since we're dealing with large k, we need an efficient way to calculate the maximum possible score for each player.

However, the provided `calculate_score` function seems to simulate a single path, either staying or moving, but it doesn't consider the optimal choice at each step.

This might be a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Since in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, and they're trying to maximize their score, they'll choose the option that leads to the highest total score over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position, we calculate the maximum score achievable from that position for the remaining turns.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach won't work due to time constraints.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider the behavior of the permutation.

In a permutation, starting from any position and following p[x], you'll eventually enter a cycle because the permutation is finite.

So, the path from any starting position consists of a tail (non-cyclic part) followed by a cycle.

In the cycle, the scores repeat every cycle length.

Therefore, if a player chooses to stay in a position outside the cycle, they can accumulate a certain score, and once they enter the cycle, they can accumulate the cycle score repeatedly.

But, since the player can choose to stay or move at each step, they can decide when to enter the cycle and how many times to go around it.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to choose the path that maximizes the score.

I need to find, for each player, the maximum possible score they can achieve in k turns.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. For each starting position, find the cycle that it eventually enters.

2. Compute the maximum score achievable by choosing optimally whether to stay or move at each step.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a starting position and simulate the path.

I can find the cycle and the lengths involved.

But since the player can choose to stay or move at each step, it's not just following the permutation path.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

Then, finding the path with the maximum score in k steps.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose between two options:

- Stay at x and get a[x], and in the next turn, still be at x.

- Move to p[x], get a[x], and in the next turn, be at p[x].

Wait, no. According to the problem, the scoring happens before the move:

1. Add a[x] to the score.

2. Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in the next turn, the player will be at x again if they choose to stay, or at p[x] if they choose to move.

Given that, the player can choose to stay at x for multiple turns, accumulating a[x] each time, or move to p[x] and start accumulating a[p[x]], and so on.

So, for each position, the player can choose to stay there for any number of turns before moving to p[x].

This seems similar to choosing how many times to add a[x] before switching to p[x].

Given that, for each starting position, I need to decide how many turns to stay at each position along the permutation path to maximize the total score.

This sounds complex, but perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that if a player chooses to stay at a position x for t turns, they accumulate t * a[x], and then move to p[x] for the remaining k - t turns.

But since they can choose to stay at p[x] for some turns as well, it's recursive.

This seems too slow for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the permutation cycle structure.

Each starting position will eventually enter a cycle, and before entering the cycle, there's a unique path.

In the cycle, the scores repeat every cycle length.

So, perhaps I can precompute for each position:

- The sum of scores if the player stays at that position for all remaining turns.

- The sum of scores if the player moves to p[x] immediately.

But I need to maximize over all possible choices.

Wait, perhaps dynamic programming can be used, but memoized over the cycle structure.

But with k up to 10^9, standard DP won't work.

I need a way to compute the maximum score efficiently for each player.

Let me think about the cycle structure more carefully.

Suppose I have a cycle of length m.

Within the cycle, the player can choose to stay at a position for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

Given that, in the cycle, the optimal strategy would be to stay at the position with the highest a[x] as much as possible.

But it's more nuanced because moving incurs the cost of switching positions, but in this problem, there's no cost for moving; it's just a choice between staying and moving.

Wait, actually, there's no cost for moving; it's just a choice of positions to accumulate scores.

So, in the cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position as many times as they want, but they have to choose to move at some point to visit other positions.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, but they have to cycle through the positions if they choose to move.

This seems too complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I need to consider that in the cycle, the player can choose to stay at one position for as many turns as they want, thus maximizing the score by staying at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

But, they might have to move through other positions to reach that position.

This is getting too involved.

Perhaps I need to accept that the problem is complex and requires an advanced approach.

Let me look back at the provided code.

In `calculate_score`, it seems to simulate a single path, keeping track of visited positions to detect cycles, and then calculates the score based on that path.

However, this doesn't account for the player's choice to stay or move at each turn.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal choices that the players can make at each turn.

Given that, the correctness of the program is False.

But, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem allows the players to make only one choice: whether to stay or move, and they stick with that choice for all turns.

But, the problem states that "on each turn, two things happen to each player:" addition of a[x] and then choosing to stay or move.

So, they make the choice repeatedly each turn.

But the provided code seems to imply that the player follows a single path determined by the permutation, which may not be the case if they can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

Given that, I think the provided code is incorrect.

However, perhaps there's a way to interpret the problem differently.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at a position for multiple consecutive turns, accumulating a[x] each time, and then choose to move to p[x] and repeat the process.

In this case, the path consists of segments where the player stays at a position for some turns and then moves to another position.

Given that, the problem becomes finding the optimal sequence of positions to stay at, with the constraint that the total number of turns is k.

This still seems too complex to handle directly with the given constraints.

Perhaps I need to consider that, in the cycle, the player can choose to stay at the position with the highest a[x], and only move when necessary.

But, without more insight, it's difficult to see how to proceed.

Given the time constraints, I'll have to conclude that the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the players' choices to stay or move at each turn, which is a critical part of the problem.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

But, to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there's a way to make the provided approach correct.

Wait, maybe the optimal strategy is for each player to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in their cycle for as many turns as possible.

In that case, once the cycle is detected, the player can choose to stay at the best position in the cycle for the remaining turns.

This might be a way to simplify the problem.

Let me try to formalize this idea.

For each player:

1. Simulate the path from their starting position until a cycle is detected.

2. Once in the cycle, find the position in the cycle with the highest a[x].

3. The player can choose to stay at that position for as many turns as possible.

Given that, the total score would be the sum of a[x] along the path until entering the cycle, plus the sum of a[x] of the best position in the cycle multiplied by the number of remaining turns divided by the cycle length, plus the sum for the remaining turns.

This seems like a plausible approach.

In this case, the `calculate_score` function needs to be adjusted to account for choosing the best position in the cycle to stay at.

Let me see how this can be implemented.

First, find the path from the starting position until a cycle is detected.

Then, find the cycle and identify the position in the cycle with the highest a[x].

Then, calculate the score as:

- Sum of a[x] for each step until entering the cycle.

- Plus, the sum of a[x] for the best position in the cycle multiplied by the number of remaining turns divided by the cycle length.

- Plus, the sum of a[x] for the first remaining turns % cycle_length steps in the cycle.

This seems correct.

Now, looking back at the provided `calculate_score` function, it doesn't implement this logic. Instead, it seems to simulate one possible path without considering the optimal choices.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

However, if I were to implement the approach I just described, it would require modifying the `calculate_score` function to:

1. Simulate the path until a cycle is detected.

2. Identify the cycle and find the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

3. Calculate the score accordingly.

But since the provided code doesn't do this, I'll stick with my initial assessment that the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
