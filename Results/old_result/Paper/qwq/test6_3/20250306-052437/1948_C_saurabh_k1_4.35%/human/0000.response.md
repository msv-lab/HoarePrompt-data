Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, up, or down. It can't move outside the grid or skip the move.

2. Then it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach cell (2,n) from cell (1,1).

First, I need to understand how the robot moves. It has a choice of direction in the first step, and then it follows the arrow in the cell it lands in.

Let me think about the possible moves:

- If the robot is in cell (r,c), it can move to (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c), or (r+1,c), as long as it stays within the grid.

- After moving to the new cell, it must then move according to the arrow in that cell.

So, effectively, each move consists of two parts: a chosen move and then a mandatory move based on the arrow.

I need to find a sequence of such moves that gets the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

This sounds like a graph traversal problem, where each cell is a node, and there are edges based on the possible moves the robot can make.

But considering the constraints, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without building a full graph.

Let me consider the properties of the grid:

- It's only 2 rows, so movement is constrained in the vertical direction.

- Arrows only point left or right, not up or down.

This simplifies things because the robot can only move horizontally based on the arrows.

Let me think about how the robot can switch rows.

To switch rows, the robot needs to move up or down in the first part of the move, and then follow the arrow in the new cell.

So, if the robot is in row 1, it can move down to row 2 in the same column, and then follow the arrow in row 2, column c.

Similarly, from row 2, it can move up to row 1 in the same column and follow the arrow there.

Also, it can move left or right in the current row and then follow the arrow in the new cell.

But the goal is to reach cell (2,n).

I need to see if there's a path that allows the robot to get from (1,1) to (2,n) by making these two-step moves.

Let me consider the example inputs to see if I can find a pattern.

First example:

n = 4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

So, row 1: positions 1 to 4 have arrows right, right, left, left.

Row 2: positions 1 to 4 have arrows right, right, right, left.

The solution says YES, and the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Let's simulate this:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is right, so move to (1,3).

- Now at (1,3), move down to (2,3), then follow the arrow in (2,3), which is right, so move to (2,4).

- Reached (2,4).

Okay, that makes sense.

Second example:

n = 2

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Solution says YES, with path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2).

Let's simulate:

- Start at (1,1), move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is right, so move to (2,2).

- Reached (2,2).

Simple enough.

Third example:

n = 4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><<

Solution says NO.

Let's see why.

Try to find a path:

- Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), follow arrow in (1,2), which is right, to (1,3).

- From (1,3), move down to (2,3), follow arrow in (2,3), which is left, to (2,2).

- From (2,2), move right to (2,3), follow arrow to (2,2) again. It's cycling.

- Alternatively, from (2,2), move up to (1,2), follow arrow to (1,3).

- It seems like it's cycling between these cells without reaching (2,4).

Hence, NO.

Fourth example:

n = 6

Row 1: >><<><

Row 2: ><>>><

Solution says YES, with path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6).

Let's simulate:

- (1,1) -> down to (2,1), follow arrow in (2,1), which is '<', so move to (2,0), but that's outside, so invalid.

Wait, but the problem says no arrows point outside, so perhaps (2,1) can't have '<' if n=6, but in this case, it does.

Wait, n=6, columns 1 to 6.

Row 2: ><>>><

So, position 1: '<', position 2: '>', position 3: '>', position 4: '>', position 5: '<', position 6: '>';

So, from (2,1), '<' would point to (2,0), which is outside, but the problem says no arrows point outside, so perhaps (2,1) can't have '<'.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Looking back, the problem says "no arrow points outside the grid", so in row 2, column 1, if it's '<', it would point to outside, which isn't allowed. So, perhaps in the input, row 2, column 1 can't have '<'.

Wait, but in the example, it's given as "><>>><", which would imply that row 2, column 1 has '<', which should not be allowed.

Wait, maybe I need to confirm the input constraints again.

The problem says: "no arrow points outside the grid", and "n is even", and "n >=2".

Also, "the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5".

Wait, looking back at the example input:

4

4

><><

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

So, in the fourth test case, row 2 is "><>>><".

But according to the problem, in row 2, column 1, '<' would point outside, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows '<' in row 2, column 1, but in that case, the robot can't move left from there.

Wait, but the problem says "no arrow points outside the grid", so perhaps '<' in row 2, column 1 is allowed, but the robot can't move left from there; it would stay in place.

I need to clarify this.

Assuming that if an arrow would move the robot outside, it just stays in place.

So, in row 2, column 1, if it's '<', the robot would try to move left but can't, so it stays in (2,1).

Similarly, in row 1, column n, if it's '>', the robot would try to move right but can't, so stays in place.

Okay, with that in mind, let's reconsider the fourth example.

Start at (1,1):

- Move down to (2,1), follow arrow '<', can't move left, so stays in (2,1).

- Then, can choose another move: move up to (1,1), follow arrow '>', so moves to (1,2).

- From (1,2), move down to (2,2), follow arrow '>', so moves to (2,3).

- From (2,3), move right to (2,4), follow arrow '>', so moves to (2,5).

- From (2,5), move left to (2,4), follow arrow '>', so moves to (2,5).

- Alternatively, from (2,5), move right to (2,6), follow arrow '>', so moves to (2,7), which is outside, so stays in (2,6).

- So, from (2,5), moving right reaches (2,6), and staying there.

But we need to reach (2,6), so YES.

Wait, but according to the example path, it's (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6).

Seems more convoluted than necessary.

But in any case, the solution says YES.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(str, input()))

b = list(map(str, input()))

if b[n - 2] == str('<'):

print('No')

else:

print('Yes')

So, it reads t test cases, each with n, row 1, and row 2.

Then, it checks if the arrow in cell (2, n-1) (0-indexed, so index n-2) is '<'. If it is, print 'No', else 'Yes'.

Wait, is this correct?

In the first example, n=4, b = list of row 2: '>>><', so b[2] (since n-2=2) is '<', so it would print 'No', but the correct answer is 'Yes'.

Wait, in the first example, it's '>>><', and n=4, so b[2] is '<', so it would print 'No', but the correct answer is 'Yes'.

So, according to this program, it would give 'No' for the first example, but the correct answer is 'Yes'.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misinterpreted the indexing.

In Python, list indices start at 0, so b[n-2] is the (n-2)-th character in the string, which is position n-1 in 1-based indexing.

Wait, let's clarify:

- n=4, b='>>><', indices 0 to 3.

- b[n-2] = b[2] = '<'

But in the first example, the correct answer is 'Yes', but according to this program, it would print 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is incomplete or I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem, n is at least 2, and even, up to 2e5.

The program seems to make a simple check: if the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is '<', then 'No', else 'Yes'.

But in the first example, it's 'No' according to the program, but the correct answer is 'Yes'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Maybe there's a pattern or a simplification that I'm missing.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the key is to see if there's a way to reach column n in row 2, considering the movements.

Given that the robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then follow the arrow.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes are grid cells, and edges are possible moves.

But building such a graph for large n is inefficient.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the grid has only two rows.

So, movement between rows is only possible by moving up or down in the same column.

Within a row, the robot can move left or right based on the arrows.

But it's more complex because the robot has a choice of direction before following the arrow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a state machine, where states are (row, column), and transitions are based on the two-step move.

But it's still complicated.

Let me consider that the robot needs to reach (2,n), and think about what needs to happen in the last step.

To be in (2,n), the robot must have come from either (2,n-1), (2,n+1), (1,n), or (3,n) (but there is no row 3), so only from (2,n-1), (2,n+1), or (1,n).

But n is the last column, so (2,n+1) is outside, which isn't allowed.

So, effectively, to reach (2,n), the robot must come from either (2,n-1) or (1,n).

But (1,n) is in row 1, and to move from (1,n) to (2,n), the robot must move down to (2,n), then follow the arrow in (2,n).

But, if the arrow in (2,n) points left, it would move to (2,n-1), which isn't outside.

But the robot needs to be at (2,n), so perhaps it needs to end its movement there.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I should think in terms of possible positions the robot can be in, and work backwards.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible paths that lead to (2,n).

Let me consider that to reach (2,n), the robot must be in (2,n-1) and move right, then follow the arrow in (2,n).

Or be in (1,n) and move down, then stay in (2,n) if the arrow points in a way that keeps it there.

But it's still not clear.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to make a simple check on the arrow in (2,n-1).

But as we saw in the first example, that doesn't determine the possibility to reach (2,n).

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that since n is even, and the grid is only 2 rows, maybe there's a pattern based on parity or something.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if there's a path that allows the robot to switch rows at some point and move to the last column.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent possible moves.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, building a graph with 2*n nodes is feasible, as long as the algorithm is linear.

But BFS or DFS on such a large graph would be inefficient in practice.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows only by moving up or down in the same column.

So, to reach (2,n), the robot must at some point switch to row 2.

Moreover, it needs to reach column n.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the movement within each row and see if there's a way to switch rows in a way that allows reaching (2,n).

But it's still too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible columns where row switches are possible.

Row switches can only happen by moving up or down in the same column.

So, if in column c, the robot is in row 1, it can move down to row 2 in column c, and follow the arrow in (2,c).

Similarly, from row 2, it can move up to row 1 in column c and follow the arrow in (1,c).

Moreover, within each row, the robot can move left or right based on the arrows.

But it's still not clear how to determine reachability to (2,n).

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose the robot starts at (1,1).

It can choose to move right, left, up, or down.

But since it's in row 1, column 1, moving left is invalid, so only right or down.

Option 1: move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2).

Option 2: move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1).

And so on.

This seems too broad; I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can model the movement within each row first, considering the arrows, and then see where row switches are possible.

Given that, maybe I can consider each row as a separate state, and see if the robot can traverse the columns in a way that allows switching rows when needed.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the examples to see if there's a pattern.

First example:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

Path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

So, in this case, the robot moves within row 1 to column 3, then switches to row 2, and moves to column 4.

Second example:

n=2

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Here, the robot switches rows at column 1 and then moves to column 2 in row 2.

Third example:

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><<

Solution: NO

Fourth example:

n=6

Row 1: >><<><

Row 2: ><>>><

Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6)

So, in this case, the robot switches rows multiple times to reach the goal.

From these examples, it seems that the robot can switch rows at any column, but needs to navigate the arrows in a way that allows progression to the last column.

I need to find a general condition that determines if such a path exists.

Let me consider that the robot needs to reach column n in row 2.

To reach column n, the robot must be able to move rightwards sufficiently.

But arrows can force leftward movements, which may hinder progress.

Moreover, row switches allow the robot to potentially bypass obstacles in one row by moving to the other row.

Given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a graph and perform a BFS or DFS to see if (2,n) is reachable from (1,1).

But with n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, total cells up to 4e5, and possible edges up to O(n), this would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that movement within a row is governed by the arrows, and row switches can only happen in columns where the robot can move up or down.

Wait, but in each move, the robot can choose to move up, down, left, or right, then follow the arrow.

This seems too flexible, and hard to model directly.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of possible positions the robot can be in after certain moves.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the robot can move to any column in either row, as long as it can switch rows at some columns.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider that the robot can move rightwards in row 1 until it can switch to row 2, and then move rightwards in row 2 to reach the goal.

But there might be cases where switching rows is necessary to bypass leftward arrows.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that the robot can reach column c in row r if:

- It can reach column c-1 in row r and move right, then follow the arrow.

- Or it can reach column c+1 in row r and move left, then follow the arrow.

- Or it can reach the same column in the other row and move up or down, then follow the arrow.

But this seems like a standard graph traversal, which is too slow for large n.

I need to find a pattern or a property that allows determining reachability without simulating the entire process.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check only the arrow in cell (2, n-1).

If that arrow is '<', it prints 'No', else 'Yes'.

But in the first example, n=4, b='>>><', so b[2]='<', which would lead to 'No', but the correct answer is 'Yes'.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Perhaps the program is intended to check if the arrow in (2, n-1) allows moving to (2,n), but that's not sufficient, as there might be other ways to reach (2,n).

In the first example, even though b[3] is '<', the robot can reach (2,3) and then move right to (2,4).

But according to the program, since b[2] is '<', it prints 'No', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the robot can reach (2,n) if it can reach column n in row 2, regardless of the arrow in (2,n), because once it's in (2,n), it's done.

So, I need to see if there's a path that allows the robot to reach column n in row 2.

To do that, perhaps I can model the movement in such a way that I track the possible columns in each row that can be reached.

Given that, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of reachable columns in each row.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define two sets: reachable columns in row 1 and reachable columns in row 2.

Initially, in row 1, column 1 is reachable.

Then, for each column, I can see how reachability propagates to the next columns.

But I need to account for both the chosen move and the mandatory arrow move.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I can model it as a finite automaton, where states represent the row, and transitions are based on column movements.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of possible parities or something related to the evenness of n.

But n is always even, so that might not help.

Let me consider that since n is even, perhaps there's a pairing of columns that allows certain movements.

But I'm stuck.

Given time constraints, I'll have to conclude that the provided program is incorrect, as it doesn't account for all possible paths the robot can take.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
