Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

The game proceeds with 2n turns, alternating between me and Nene, with each of us taking n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at its number, and checks if that number is already on the table. If it is, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

Importantly, Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there's a tie in maximizing her score, she chooses the move that minimizes my score.

My task is to figure out, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

- There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice.

- Me and Nene each have n cards.

- We take turns, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns.

- On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, checks if that number is already on the table, and if it is, they score a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and secondarily to minimize my score.

I need to maximize my score, assuming Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me think about how the game progresses.

Each number appears twice in the deck. So, for each number, there are two cards with that number, and they are distributed between me and Nene.

For example, if n=3, there are two cards each of numbers 1, 2, and 3. So, total 6 cards.

Let's say I have cards 1 and 2, and Nene has cards 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 (wait, but n=3, so two cards per number). Wait, n=3, so two cards each of 1,2,3, total 6 cards. If I have, say, 1,2,3, then Nene has another 1,2,3.

Wait, but in the problem, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is a large number, so I need to think in general terms.

The key here is that each number appears exactly twice, and me and Nene split these cards.

Given that, in the game, the order in which we play the cards matters because of the scoring based on whether the number is already on the table.

I need to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me consider some small examples to understand the mechanics.

Example 1:

n=1

My cards: 1

Nene's cards: 1

Turns:

1. Me: play 1, it's not on the table yet, no point.

2. Nene: play 1, it's already on the table, she gets 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 0, Nene: 1

So, in this case, I can't get any points.

Example 2:

n=2

My cards: 1,1

Nene's cards: 2,2

Turns:

1. Me: play 1, not on the table, no point.

2. Nene: play 2, not on the table, no point.

3. Me: play 1, already on the table, get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 2, already on the table, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 1

In this case, I get 1 point.

Wait, but according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and secondarily to minimize my score.

Is there another way for Nene to play to get more than 1 point?

Let's see:

Alternative turns:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 2, no point.

3. Me: play 1, get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

It seems the same.

Another alternative:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 2, no point.

3. Me: play 1, get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

Same result.

So, in this case, I get 1 point.

Wait, but in the problem's example, when n=4 and my cards are 1,1,2,3, the output is 1, which matches this.

Another example:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

Possible turns:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 1, get 1 point.

3. Me: play 2, no point.

4. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

5. Me: play 3, no point.

6. Nene: play 3, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 0, Nene: 3

Alternatively:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 2, no point.

3. Me: play 2, get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 1, get 1 point.

5. Me: play 3, no point.

6. Nene: play 3, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 2

So, in this case, I can get at least 1 point.

But according to the problem, in the first test case with n=4 and cards 1,1,2,3, the output is 1.

Wait, but in this n=3 case, it seems I can get at least 1 point.

Wait, but in the problem's first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3, and Nene has 2,3,4,4.

In their explanation, they show a sequence where I get 1 point and Nene gets 3.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's see.

Possible turns:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 4, no point.

3. Me: play 1, get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 4, get 1 point.

5. Me: play 2, no point.

6. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

7. Me: play 3, no point.

8. Nene: play 3, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 3

Is there another sequence where I can get more than 1 point?

Suppose:

1. Me: play 2, no point.

2. Nene: play 4, no point.

3. Me: play 1, no point.

4. Nene: play 4, get 1 point.

5. Me: play 1, get 1 point.

6. Nene: play 3, no point.

7. Me: play 3, get 1 point.

8. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 2, Nene: 2

Wait, in this sequence, I got 2 points.

But according to the problem's explanation, the maximum I can get is 1.

What's going on here?

Wait, maybe Nene would play optimally to prevent me from getting more points.

In this sequence, Nene chose to play 3 on her sixth turn, which allowed me to get a point on my seventh turn.

But perhaps Nene can play differently to prevent that.

Alternative sequence:

1. Me: play 2, no point.

2. Nene: play 4, no point.

3. Me: play 1, no point.

4. Nene: play 4, get 1 point.

5. Me: play 1, get 1 point.

6. Nene: play 2, get 1 point.

7. Me: play 3, no point.

8. Nene: play 3, get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 3

In this case, I get only 1 point.

So, it seems that Nene can choose to play her cards in a way that minimizes my points.

Hence, in the first test case, the maximum I can get is 1 point.

I need to find a general strategy for this.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Each number appears exactly twice in the deck, and me and Nene split these cards.

For a particular number, I can have zero, one, or two cards of that number.

Wait, but in the problem, it says each number appears exactly twice in the deck, and in my hand, each number appears at most twice.

So, for each number, I can have either zero, one, or two cards, but since there are two cards for each number in total, if I have zero, Nene has two; if I have one, Nene has one; if I have two, Nene has zero.

So, for each number, we can categorize it based on how many cards of that number I have.

Let's define:

- Type A: I have two cards of this number. So, Nene has zero.

- Type B: I have one card of this number, and Nene has one card of this number.

- Type C: I have zero cards of this number, and Nene has two cards of this number.

So, for each number from 1 to n, it falls into one of these three types.

Given that, I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me think about how points are scored.

A point is scored when a player plays a card with a number that is already on the table.

So, to maximize my points, I want to play my cards in such a way that when I play a card, its number is already on the table.

But, Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points.

So, she will play in a way that maximizes her points, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my points.

I need to find a strategy that, given Nene's optimal play, maximizes my points.

Let me consider the different types of numbers.

Type A: I have two cards, Nene has zero.

In this case, both cards are with me. So, when I play the first card, it's not on the table, so no point. When I play the second card, it is already on the table, so I get one point.

So, for each Type A number, I can get one point by playing both cards.

Type B: I have one card, Nene has one card.

In this case, one card with me and one with Nene.

So, when one of us plays the first card, it's not on the table, no point. When the second card is played, it is on the table, so the player gets one point.

So, for Type B numbers, one point can be scored, and it depends on who plays their card second.

Type C: I have zero cards, Nene has two cards.

In this case, both cards are with Nene. So, when Nene plays the first card, no point, and when she plays the second card, it's already on the table, so she gets one point.

So, for Type C numbers, Nene can get one point.

Now, I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me think about the sequence of plays.

Since turns are alternating, and starting with me, I have to decide the order in which to play my cards.

I have some Type A numbers, where I have two cards, and Type B numbers, where I have one card each.

I need to arrange the order of playing my cards to maximize the number of times I play a card when its number is already on the table.

But Nene is also playing optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points.

So, she will arrange her plays to maximize her points, and if there are multiple options, choose the one that minimizes my points.

Let me consider the number of Type A and Type B numbers.

Letâ€™s denote:

- A: number of Type A numbers (I have two cards each)

- B: number of Type B numbers (I have one card each)

Then, C = n - A - B (Type C numbers, I have zero cards)

For Type A numbers, since both cards are with me, I will get one point per Type A number, by playing both cards.

For Type B numbers, it depends on the sequence of plays.

Nene has one card for each Type B number.

So, for each Type B number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene.

To score a point with a Type B number, I need to play my card when Nene has already played her card of the same number.

Similarly, Nene can score a point with a Type B number by playing her card after I have played my card.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points, she will arrange her plays to maximize her points from Type B numbers and, in case of ties, minimize my points.

Wait, but for Type B numbers, only one point can be scored, and it depends on who plays their card second.

If I play my Type B card before Nene plays her Type B card, then Nene can play her card later and score a point.

If I play my Type B card after Nene plays her Type B card, then I can score a point.

So, for each Type B number, there is a potential point that either I or Nene can get.

Nene will try to arrange her plays to maximize her points from Type B numbers.

Given that, I need to arrange my plays to maximize my points from Type B numbers, considering Nene's optimal response.

Let me think about the total points available from Type B numbers.

For each Type B number, one point can be scored by either me or Nene.

So, there are B points available in total from Type B numbers.

Nene will try to get as many of these B points as possible, and if there are multiple ways, she will choose the one that minimizes my points.

So, I need to maximize my points from Type B numbers, given Nene's optimal play.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where I can score a point.

Let me consider the sequence of plays.

I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Each turn consists of playing one card.

The table state is shared between us.

I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize the number of times I play a card that matches a number already on the table.

Nene, on her turns, will play her cards to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points.

I need to consider how Nene will play in response to my plays.

This seems quite complex.

Maybe I need to find a way to count the maximum points I can get, considering that Nene will try to minimize my points.

Wait, perhaps there is a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider the following approach.

First, I can get one point for each Type A number by playing both cards.

So, my base points are A.

Then, for Type B numbers, it's more complicated.

Nene has n turns, and I have n turns.

Each Type B number can contribute one point to either me or Nene.

I need to maximize the number of Type B numbers where I get the point.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points, I need to find a way to maximize my points from Type B numbers under her optimal play.

Let me think about the number of Type B numbers.

If I have B Type B numbers, and Nene has B Type B numbers, then together we have B pairs of cards.

Each pair can give one point to either me or Nene.

I need to maximize the number of pairs where I get the point.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize mine, she will arrange her plays to maximize her points from Type B numbers and, in case of ties, minimize mine.

I need to find a way to maximize my points from Type B numbers, considering Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where I can play my card after Nene plays her card.

Each such Type B number would give me one point.

Given that Nene is playing optimally, she will try to minimize the number of Type B numbers where I can play after her.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a scheduling problem, where I need to arrange my plays in such a way that as many of my Type B cards as possible are played after Nene plays her corresponding Type B card.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I play all my Type A cards first.

For each Type A number, I play the first card, then later play the second card to score a point.

In this way, I can secure A points from Type A numbers.

Then, for Type B numbers, I need to arrange my plays such that for as many Type B numbers as possible, I play my card after Nene plays her card.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and secondarily to minimize my points.

So, she will arrange her plays to maximize the number of Type B numbers where she plays second and scores the point, and if there are multiple ways, choose the one that minimizes the number of Type B numbers where I play second and score the point.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where Nene can play second.

Since Nene has n turns, and I have n turns, and considering the sequence of plays, Nene can choose to play her Type B cards in a way that maximizes her points.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some games, the number of points one can get is determined by the number of pairs or some similar combinatorial structure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory or something similar.

But that might be overkill.

Let me look back at the problem.

Given that each Type A number contributes one point to me, and each Type B number can contribute one point to either me or Nene, I need to maximize my points from Type B numbers, considering Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps the key is to note that Nene can choose to play her Type B cards in a way that minimizes my points from Type B numbers.

So, the maximum points I can get from Type B numbers is the number of Type B numbers where I can play second, given that Nene is trying to minimize that.

Wait, perhaps it's B minus the number of Type B numbers where Nene can play second.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where I can play second, given that Nene is playing optimally to minimize that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can get floor((B+1)/2) points from Type B numbers.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

n=1

My cards: 1

Nene's cards: 1

Type A: 0

Type B: 1

Type C: 0

Possible turns:

1. Me: play 1, no point.

2. Nene: play 1, get 1 point.

My points: 0

Nene's points: 1

So, from Type B numbers, I got 0 points.

Example 2:

n=2

My cards: 1,1

Nene's cards: 2,2

Type A: 1 (number 1)

Type B: 0

Type C: 1 (number 2)

Points from Type A: 1

Points from Type B: 0

Total my points: 1

Which matches the earlier example.

Another example:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

Type A: 0

Type B: 3

Type C: 0

Possible points from Type B: 3 points, which can be divided between me and Nene.

In one sequence, Nene gets 3 points, I get 0.

In another sequence, Nene gets 2 points, I get 1 point.

So, the maximum I can get is 1 point.

So, in this case, with B=3, I can get at most 1 point from Type B numbers.

Similarly, in the first test case with B=2 (n=4, my cards:1,1,2,3 => Type A:1, Type B:2, Type C:1), I can get 1 point from Type B numbers.

Wait, no, in the first test case, n=4, my cards:1,1,2,3.

So, Type A: number 1 (two cards with me), Type B: numbers 2 and 3 (one each with me and Nene), Type C: number 4 (two with Nene).

So, A=1, B=2, C=1.

In the example, the output is 1, which is A=1 plus something from Type B.

Wait, but in this case, A=1, and from Type B, I get 0 points, total 1 point.

But in the sequence I thought earlier, I could get 2 points.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, my cards:1,1,2,3.

Nene's cards:2,3,4,4.

Type A:1 (number 1)

Type B:2 (numbers 2 and 3)

Type C:1 (number 4)

Points from Type A:1

Points from Type B:0 (if Nene plays optimally)

Total:1

So, in this case, from Type B numbers, I can get 0 points if Nene plays optimally.

Hence, my total points are A=1 + 0 =1.

Another example:

n=3, my cards:1,2,3; Nene's cards:1,2,3.

Type A:0

Type B:3

Type C:0

In this case, A=0, and from Type B, I can get 1 point if I play optimally.

So, total points:0 +1=1.

From this, it seems that from Type B numbers, I can get floor(B/2) points.

In the first test case, B=2, floor(2/2)=1.

In the second test case, B=3, floor(3/2)=1.

In another test case with B=1, floor(1/2)=0.

Wait, but in the first test case with B=2, I can get 1 point, which matches floor(2/2)=1.

In the second test case with B=3, I can get 1 point, which matches floor(3/2)=1.

In the case with B=1, I can get floor(1/2)=0 points.

This seems to hold.

Hence, perhaps the maximum points I can get are A + floor(B/2).

Wait, but let's verify this.

In the first test case, A=1, B=2, floor(B/2)=1, total=2.

But the output is 1, which is A + (B - floor(B/2)).

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's A + ceil((B - A)/2).

Wait, in the first test case, A=1, B=2, ceil((2-1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, total=A+1=2, but the output is 1.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's A + floor((B)/2).

In the first test case, A=1, B=2, floor(2/2)=1, total=1+1=2, but output is 1.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's A + floor((B - A)/
