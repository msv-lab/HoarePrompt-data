Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that it's always possible, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal. Since I can perform the operation at most once, I need to choose a value x and select a range to set to x in such a way that, after this operation, all elements become equal, and the cost is minimized.

Wait, but I can perform the operation only once, meaning I can only set one range to a single value x. After that, if the array is not completely equal, I need to find a way to make them equal without performing any more operations. But the problem says I can perform the operation at most once, and it's guaranteed that it's possible to make all elements equal with at most one operation. So, perhaps I misunderstood.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

" You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers i , j , x (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n ) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j = 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to [1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] . "

" What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements of the array equal? "

And in the example provided:

Input:

Output:

So, for the first test case, with array [1,2,3,4,5,1], the answer is 4. That means, by performing one operation, I can make all elements equal, and the cost is 4.

Looking at the array [1,2,3,4,5,1], if I choose to set indices 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4 (since j-i+1 = 5-2+1=4). That seems to match.

In the second test case, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], the array is already equal, so no operation is needed, and the cost is 0.

In the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the answer is 2. If I set indices 4 and 5 to 8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], and the cost is 2.

So, the strategy seems to be: find the largest contiguous segment where the elements are already equal, and only change the minimum number of elements outside of that segment to make the whole array equal.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5,1], the largest contiguous segment where elements are equal is just single elements, so maybe I need to choose a value that can minimize the cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is to choose a value that appears multiple times and minimize the cost by setting the ranges that are not that value.

Wait, but in the first test case, choosing 1 and setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 costs 4. Alternatively, choosing 5 and setting indices 1 to 4 to 5 would cost 4 as well. So, in this case, the cost is the same.

In the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], setting indices 4 and 5 to 8 costs 2, which is better than setting other ranges.

So, perhaps the strategy is to find the most frequent value in the array and set all other elements to that value, but only in the minimal range needed.

But wait, in the first test case, 1 appears twice, 2 once, 3 once, 4 once, 5 once. So, 1 is the most frequent, but setting all elements to 1 requires setting indices 2 to 5 to 1, which costs 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, 1 appears seven times, so setting all elements to 1 costs 0, since all are already 1.

In the third test case, 8 appears five times, so setting indices 4 and 5 to 8 costs 2, which makes all elements 8.

So, perhaps the general strategy is:

- Find the most frequent value in the array.

- Find the minimal range of indices that need to be set to this value to make the entire array equal to this value.

- The cost is the length of this range.

But, how do I find this minimal range?

One way is to find the largest contiguous segment where the elements are already equal to the most frequent value, and then the range to set is the rest of the array.

Wait, but in the first test case, the most frequent value is 1, which appears at positions 1 and 6. So, the largest contiguous segment of 1's is just positions 1 and 6, which are not contiguous. So, the range to set would be positions 2 to 5, which costs 4.

In the third test case, the most frequent value is 8, which appears at positions 1-3 and 6-8. So, the largest contiguous segment of 8's is positions 1-3 and 6-8, with positions 4 and 5 being the ones to set to 8, costing 2.

So, generalizing, it seems that:

- Find the most frequent value, say x.

- Find the union of all maximal contiguous segments where the value is x.

- The range to set is the complement of this union, i.e., the parts not already equal to x.

- The cost is the total length of these ranges.

Wait, but in the first test case, the union of contiguous segments of 1's is just positions 1 and 6, which are not contiguous, so the range to set is positions 2 to 5.

In the third test case, the union of contiguous 8's is positions 1-3 and 6-8, so the range to set is positions 4 and 5.

So, in general, it's the minimal number of elements not equal to the most frequent value, but considering contiguous segments.

But, how to implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints: t up to 10^4, n up to 2*10^5, and the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.

So, I need an efficient algorithm, O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to find the minimal range to set to make all elements equal to x.

One way is:

- Find all positions where the array is already equal to x.

- Find the largest gap between these positions, and set the range covering this gap.

Wait, but in the first test case, positions of 1 are 1 and 6, so the gap is from position 2 to 5, which is length 4.

In the third test case, positions of 8 are 1,2,3,6,7,8, so the gaps are from 4 to 5, which is length 2.

So, the minimal range to set is the largest gap between positions where the array is already equal to x.

Wait, no. Actually, it's the total number of positions not equal to x.

But, in the first test case, positions 2,3,4,5 are not equal to 1, which is 4 positions.

In the third test case, positions 4,5 are not equal to 8, which is 2 positions.

So, perhaps it's simply the number of elements not equal to the most frequent element.

But, wait, in the sample input 4, which is [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], the output is 7.

The most frequent value is 9, appearing 3 times, at positions 1,2,4.

So, positions 3,5,6,7,8,9 are not 9, which is 6 positions. But the output is 7.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, no, positions 1,2,4 are 9, positions 3,5,6,7,8,9 are not 9, which is 6, but the output is 7. So, perhaps it's not just the number of elements not equal to the most frequent element.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if there are multiple most frequent elements, I need to choose the one that maximizes the sum of lengths of contiguous segments.

But in this case, 9 appears 3 times, 5 appears 3 times, 2 appears twice, 3 once.

If I choose 5, positions are 6,7,8, so the gaps are positions 1-5 and 9.

To make all elements 5, I need to set positions 1-5 and 9 to 5.

Positions 1-5 are 5 elements, position 9 is 1, total 6.

But the output is 7, so perhaps choosing 9 is better.

Wait, choosing 9: positions 1,2,4.

Need to set positions 3,5,6,7,8,9 to 9, which is 6.

But output is 7, so perhaps there's something wrong with this approach.

Wait, maybe I need to set the minimal range that covers all positions not equal to the chosen x.

But in this case, for x=9, positions to set are 3,5,6,7,8,9.

What's the minimal range covering these positions? Well, positions 3 to 9 is a range of length 7, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the minimal range to set is the minimal range that covers all positions not equal to the chosen x.

Wait, but in the first test case, positions to set are 2,3,4,5, which is a range of length 4.

In the third test case, positions to set are 4,5, which is a range of length 2.

In the last test case, positions to set are 3,5,6,7,8,9, which is a range from 3 to 9, length 7.

So, perhaps the minimal range to set is the minimal length that covers all positions where the array is not equal to the chosen x.

So, the strategy would be:

- Choose the value x that maximizes the length of the minimal range that needs to be set to make all elements equal to x.

- For each possible x, find the minimal range that covers all positions not equal to x.

- Choose the x that minimizes the cost, which is the length of that range.

But considering the constraints, iterating over all possible x might be too slow, since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n is 2*10^5, so overall time should be O(n log n).

But counting frequency of each x can be done with a frequency map.

Then, for each x, find the minimal range that covers all positions not equal to x.

Wait, but to find the minimal range that covers all positions not equal to x, it's equivalent to finding the maximal contiguous segment where all elements are equal to x, and then the range to set is the complement of this segment.

Wait, no, because there might be multiple segments where elements are equal to x.

So, need to find the union of all such segments, and then the range to set is the complement of this union.

Then, the cost is the total length of the complement.

Wait, in the first test case, for x=1, the union of segments is positions 1 and 6, so the complement is positions 2-5, length 4.

In the third test case, for x=8, the union of segments is positions 1-3 and 6-8, so the complement is positions 4-5, length 2.

In the last test case, for x=9, the union of segments is positions 1,2,4, so the complement is positions 3,5,6,7,8,9.

But to cover all positions not equal to 9, the minimal range is from 3 to 9, length 7.

Wait, but positions 3,5,6,7,8,9 are not contiguous, so the minimal range covering all these positions is from 3 to 9.

So, in general, for a given x, find the minimal range that covers all positions where a[i] != x.

This can be done by finding the maximum among the minimal i such that a[i] != x, and the maximal j such that a[j] != x.

Then, the range to set is from i to j.

So, for each x, find the minimal i where a[i] != x, and the maximal j where a[j] != x, and set the range from i to j.

Then, the cost is j - i + 1.

Then, choose the x that minimizes this cost.

This seems efficient, because for each x, finding the minimal i and maximal j where a[i] != x can be done in O(n) time per x, but since there are up to n different x, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

So, I need a better way.

Wait, but the problem says "it's guaranteed that this can always be done", so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Also, since t can be up to 10^4, and n up to 2*10^5 with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

So, perhaps I can find the overall minimal cost without iterating over all x.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose x to be the most frequent element in the array.

Then, the minimal range to set is the range that covers all positions where a[i] != x.

As in the earlier examples.

So, in that case, I can:

- Find the frequency of each x.

- Find the x with the maximum frequency.

- Then, find the minimal i and maximal j where a[i] != x and a[j] != x.

- If there are multiple x with the same maximum frequency, I need to choose the one that minimizes j - i + 1.

Wait, but in the last test case, choosing x=9, frequency 3, positions to set are from 3 to 9, length 7.

If I choose x=5, positions to set are from 1 to 5 and 9, which is from 1 to 9, length 9, which is worse.

Choosing x=2, positions to set are from 1 to 2,4,6,7,8,9, which is from 1 to 9, length 9.

So, choosing x=9 gives the minimal range to set.

Hence, among the x with maximum frequency, choosing the one that maximizes the sum of lengths of contiguous segments where a[i] == x.

Alternatively, choosing the x with maximum frequency, and among those, choosing the one that has the largest union of contiguous segments.

But, to implement this efficiently, I need a way to calculate, for each x, the minimal range to set.

Wait, but if I choose x with maximum frequency, and find the minimal i and maximal j where a[i] != x, then the range to set is from i to j.

So, I can:

- Find the frequency of each x.

- Find the x with maximum frequency.

- Among those x, find the one that minimizes j - i + 1, where i is the smallest index where a[i] != x, and j is the largest index where a[j] != x.

- Then, the cost is j - i + 1.

This seems efficient because:

- Finding frequency can be done in O(n) time.

- Finding i and j for each x with maximum frequency can be done in O(n) time per x.

- Since the number of x with maximum frequency is at most n, but in practice it's small, and since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4 but sum of n over all t is up to 2*10^5, it's acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n=6, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

Most frequent x=1, frequency=2.

Positions where a[i] != 1 are 2,3,4,5, so i=2, j=5, cost=4.

Second test case:

n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Most frequent x=1, frequency=7.

Positions where a[i] !=1 are none, so cost=0.

Third test case:

n=8, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

Most frequent x=8, frequency=6.

Positions where a[i] !=8 are 4,5, so i=4, j=5, cost=2.

Fourth test case:

n=1, a=[1]

Most frequent x=1, frequency=1.

No positions where a[i] !=1, so cost=0.

Fifth test case:

n=2, a=[1,2]

Most frequent x=1 or 2, frequency=1.

Choosing x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are 2, cost=1.

Choosing x=2, positions where a[i] !=2 are 1, cost=1.

So, minimal cost is 1.

Sixth test case:

n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Most frequent x=1,2,3, frequency=1.

Choosing any x, positions where a[i] !=x are 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, or 1 and 2, all with cost=2.

Seventh test case:

n=7, a=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Most frequent x=1 or 3, frequency=2.

Choosing x=1, positions to set are 1,2,3,4,7, which is from 1 to 7, cost=7.

Choosing x=3, positions to set are 1,2,4,5,6, which is from 1 to 6, cost=6.

So, minimal cost is 6.

Eighth test case:

n=9, a=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

Most frequent x=9 or 5, frequency=3.

Choosing x=9, positions to set are 3,5,6,7,8,9, which is from 3 to 9, cost=7.

Choosing x=5, positions to set are 1,2,3,4,5,9, which is from 1 to 5 and 9, which is from 1 to 9, cost=9.

So, minimal cost is 7.

Hence, the general approach seems to hold.

So, to implement this:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Find the frequency of each element.

- Find the maximum frequency.

- Among the elements with this maximum frequency, find the one that minimizes the range j - i + 1 where a[i] != x and a[j] != x.

- If there are multiple such x, choose any.

- If no elements need to be set (i.e., the array is already uniform), output 0.

- Else, output the minimal range length.

Edge cases to consider:

- All elements are already equal: cost=0.

- All elements are different: choose any x, cost=n-1.

- Array with only one element: cost=0.

- Array with two elements: cost=1.

- Arrays where the most frequent element appears in multiple disjoint segments.

Implementing this in code:

- Use a frequency map to count occurrences of each element.

- Identify the maximum frequency.

- For each element with this frequency, find the minimal i and maximal j where a[i] != x and a[j] != x.

- Compute j - i + 1 for these and choose the minimum.

- Output this minimal value.

Efficiency:

- Time: O(n) per test case, acceptable since sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

- Space: O(n) for the frequency map.

Potential optimizations:

- Since we only need the minimal range, and among multiple x with the same frequency, we choose the one with the smallest range, we can iterate through the array once for each x with maximum frequency.

- To further optimize, we can find all x with maximum frequency and then find the one with
