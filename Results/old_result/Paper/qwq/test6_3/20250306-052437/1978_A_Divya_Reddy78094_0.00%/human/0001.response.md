Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Alice has n books, each with a certain number of pages. She wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles and then read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages she reads.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. She has to divide the books into two piles, each pile must have at least one book, and then she reads the book with the maximum pages from each pile and sums those up. I need to help her maximize that sum.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Try all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and calculate the sum of the maximums for each division, then pick the maximum sum.

But that sounds inefficient, especially since n can be up to 100, and t can be up to 500. That would mean up to 500 test cases, each with up to 100 books. If I try all possible divisions, it would be exponential time, which is not feasible.

Option 2: Find a smarter way to select which books go into which pile to maximize the sum of the two largest books, one from each pile.

Wait, the problem is to maximize the sum of the largest book from each pile. So, I need to choose two books to be the largest in their respective piles.

But I need to make sure that these two books are in different piles.

So, the key is to select two books, put them into separate piles, and then assign the remaining books to these piles in any way, since the only thing that matters is the maximum in each pile.

Wait, actually, the way I think about it, the way the problem is set up, the division of the remaining books doesn't matter because only the maximum in each pile is considered.

So, the optimal strategy should be to select the two largest books and assign them to different piles, and then assign all other books to, say, the first pile.

In that way, the maximum of the first pile is the largest book, and the maximum of the second pile is the second largest book, and their sum is maximized.

Is that correct?

Let me verify with the example given.

In the first test case:

2

1 1

If I take the two books, both have 1 page each. So, the sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case:

4

2 3 3 1

The two largest books have 3 pages each. So, if I put one 3 in the first pile and the other 3 in the second pile, the sum is 3 + 3 = 6. But the sample output is 4. Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second test case, the sample output is 4, not 6. So, perhaps putting two 3's in separate piles isn't the correct approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that if I put two books with the same number of pages in separate piles, but there are multiple books with that number, I need to choose which ones to separate.

In the second test case, there are two books with 3 pages and two with 2 and 1.

Wait, no, the second test case has books with pages: 2, 3, 3, 1.

So, two books have 3 pages each.

In the note, it says:

"In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, but book 1 has 2 pages, book 2 has 3, book 3 has 3, book 4 has 1.

So, if she puts books 2 and 3 in the first pile, which have 3 and 3 pages, and books 1 and 4 in the second pile, which have 2 and 1 pages, then the maximum in the first pile is 3, and in the second pile is 2, so the sum is 3 + 2 = 5, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, maybe I misread the note.

Wait, the note says: "Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile."

Wait, but book 4 has only 1 page. Maybe "highest number" refers to the book's number, not the number of pages.

Wait, the problem says: "Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

Wait, hold on, the problem says: "Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

Does "highest number" refer to the book's index or the number of pages?

Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.

"Each book contains a_i pages, where i is the book's number."

Then, "Alice does the following:

- She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

- Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

And then, "Alice wants to find the maximum total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

Wait, so "highest number" refers to the book's index, not the number of pages.

So, in each pile, she reads the book with the highest index in that pile.

Wait, that changes things significantly.

So, in the second test case, the books are:

Book 1: 2 pages

Book 2: 3 pages

Book 3: 3 pages

Book 4: 1 page

In the note, it says: "Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

So, in this case, she reads book 3 from the first pile and book 4 from the second pile, summing up to 4 pages.

But according to my earlier misunderstanding, if "highest number" referred to the number of pages, the sum would be 3 + 3 = 6, which doesn't match the sample output.

So, now I understand that "highest number" refers to the book's index.

Therefore, in each pile, she reads the book with the highest index in that pile.

So, the task is to divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile is maximized.

That changes the approach completely.

So, I need to maximize the sum of the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

Given that, I need to decide which pile each book goes into, ensuring that each pile is non-empty.

Wait, but the highest-indexed book in each pile is determined by the division.

So, for example, if I have books 1,2,3,4, and I put books 1,2,3 in pile A and book 4 in pile B, then the highest-indexed book in pile A is book 3, and in pile B it's book 4.

Alternatively, if I put books 1 and 3 in pile A, and books 2 and 4 in pile B, then the highest-indexed book in pile A is book 3, and in pile B it's book 4.

Wait, but in the second test case, the note suggests putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another pile. Then, the highest-indexed book in the first pile is book 3, and in the second pile is book 4.

So, the sum is a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

But is this the maximum possible?

Let's see.

Alternative division: put books 1 and 2 in pile A, and books 3 and 4 in pile B.

Then, highest-indexed book in pile A is book 2 (pages 3), and in pile B is book 4 (pages 1), sum is 4.

Another division: put books 1,3 in pile A, and books 2,4 in pile B.

Sum is a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

Another division: put books 1,4 in pile A, and books 2,3 in pile B.

Sum is a_4 + a_3 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Another division: put books 1 in pile A, and books 2,3,4 in pile B.

Sum is a_1 + a_4 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Another division: put books 1,2 in pile A, and books 3,4 in pile B.

Sum is a_2 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

Another division: put books 1,2,3 in pile A, and book 4 in pile B.

Sum is a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

Another division: put books 1,3,4 in pile A, and book 2 in pile B.

Sum is a_4 + a_2 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Another division: put books 1,2,4 in pile A, and book 3 in pile B.

Sum is a_4 + a_3 = 1 + 3 = 4.

So, in all these divisions, the maximum sum I can get is 4.

But is there a way to get a higher sum?

Wait, what if I put books 1 and 2 in one pile, and books 3 and 4 in another pile.

Then, highest-indexed book in pile A is book 2 (pages 3), and in pile B is book 4 (pages 1), sum is 4.

Wait, but book 3 has 3 pages, which is the same as book 2.

Is there a way to get sum 5?

Wait, in the sample output, it's 4, but in the explanation, it's 4.

But in the problem statement, for the second test case, the output is 4.

Wait, but in the example, the output is:

2

4

5

13

5

For 5 test cases.

Wait, the second test case has output 4, which matches the note.

But in the third test case, output is 5.

Let's look at the third test case.

Input:

5

2 2 3 2 2

So, books:

1:2, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:2

According to the problem, we need to divide into two piles and read the highest-indexed book in each pile.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

One way: put books 1,2,3 in pile A, and books 4,5 in pile B.

Then, highest-indexed in pile A is book 3 (pages 3), in pile B is book 5 (pages 2), sum is 5.

Another way: put books 1,3 in pile A, and books 2,4,5 in pile B.

Sum is a_3 + a_5 = 3 + 2 = 5.

Another way: put books 1,2,4 in pile A, and books 3,5 in pile B.

Sum is a_4 + a_5 = 2 + 2 = 4.

So, the maximum is 5.

Hence, the output is 5 for the third test case.

This seems consistent.

So, the general approach is:

- Identify the two highest-indexed books that have the maximum pages possible.

- Assign them to different piles.

- Assign the remaining books to either pile.

Wait, but in the third test case, book 3 has 3 pages, and book 5 has 2 pages, sum is 5.

But if I try to put book 3 and book 4 in different piles, sum would be 3 + 2 = 5.

Alternatively, book 3 and book 2, sum is 3 + 2 = 5.

So, the maximum sum is 5.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

If I try to put book 3 and book 5 in different piles, sum is 3 + 2 = 5.

So, 5 is the maximum possible.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

So, general strategy:

- Find the two highest-indexed books such that their pages sum to the maximum possible.

- To do this, sort the books based on their indices, and then select the two books with the highest pages, ensuring they are in different piles.

Wait, but indices are unique, so I need to select two different books and put them in different piles.

Wait, no, indices are unique, but I need to select the highest-indexed books in their respective piles.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to select which pile each book goes into, ensuring that each pile has at least one book, and then sum the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

To maximize this sum, I need to maximize the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

One way to think about it is:

- Identify the book with the highest index and decide which pile to put it in.

- Then, identify the next highest-indexed book and decide which pile to put it in, ensuring that each pile has at least one book.

Wait, but this seems a bit involved.

An alternative approach:

- Since we need to have two non-empty piles, and read the highest-indexed book from each pile, we can consider all possible pairs of books where one book will be in pile A and the other in pile B, and the remaining books can be in either pile.

- Then, the sum would be the pages of these two books.

- We need to choose such a pair where the sum of their pages is maximized.

- However, we have to ensure that each pile has at least one book, so we cannot have both books in the same pile.

Wait, but in reality, since we are assigning each book to a pile, and the highest-indexed book in each pile is determined by the assignment, we need to maximize the sum of the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that the highest-indexed book in pile A is some book with index i, and in pile B is some book with index j, where i != j.

We need to maximize a_i + a_j.

But i and j are the highest indices in their respective piles.

So, in pile A, all books have indices less than or equal to i, and in pile B, all books have indices less than or equal to j.

Moreover, since indices are unique and ordered from 1 to n, the highest-indexed book in a pile determines that all books with lower indices in that pile must have indices less than or equal to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the books in order of their indices and decide which pile to assign them to.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix which pile gets the higher-indexed book.

Without loss of generality, assume pile A gets the book with the highest index, and pile B gets the book with the second-highest index.

Then, assign the remaining books to either pile, but ensuring that each pile has at least one book.

Wait, but the highest-indexed book in each pile must be the one we chose for that pile.

So, if pile A has the highest-indexed book, say book n, then all other books in pile A must have indices less than n.

Similarly, if pile B has the second-highest-indexed book, say book m, then all other books in pile B must have indices less than m.

Wait, but m must be less than n, since n is the highest.

But then, if m < n, and pile B contains books with indices less than m, and pile A contains books with indices up to n, but pile A could contain books with indices up to n, including m if m is in pile A.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to think recursively.

Start from the highest-indexed book and decide which pile to assign it to.

Then, for the next highest-indexed book, assign it to the other pile.

But I need to make sure that each pile has at least one book.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign the highest-indexed book to pile A, and the second-highest to pile B, and assign all lower-indexed books to the pile with the higher sum.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of a simpler example.

Take the first test case:

n=2

books: 1:1, 2:1

Possible divisions:

- Pile A: book 1, Pile B: book 2

Sum: a1 + a2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- Pile A: book 1, Pile B: books 2

Sum: a1 + a2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- Pile A: books 1,2, Pile B: empty (invalid)

- Pile A: book 2, Pile B: book 1

Sum: a2 + a1 = 1 + 1 = 2

So, the maximum sum is 2.

In the second test case:

n=4

books: 1:2, 2:3, 3:3, 4:1

Possible divisions:

- Pile A: books 1,2,3, Pile B: book 4

Sum: a3 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4

- Pile A: books 1,2, Pile B: books 3,4

Sum: a2 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4

- Pile A: books 1,3, Pile B: books 2,4

Sum: a3 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4

- Pile A: books 1,4, Pile B: books 2,3

Sum: a4 + a3 = 1 + 3 = 4

- Pile A: books 1,2,4, Pile B: book 3

Sum: a2 + a3 = 3 + 3 = 6

Wait, but in this division, pile A has books 1,2,4, with highest-indexed book being 4 (pages 1), and pile B has book 3 (pages 3).

So, sum is a4 + a3 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, but according to the earlier approach, sum is 4, not 6.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied it.

In the division where pile A has books 1,2,4 and pile B has book 3.

Highest-indexed in pile A is book 4 (pages 1), and in pile B is book 3 (pages 3), sum is 4.

Another division: pile A has books 1,3,4 and pile B has book 2.

Sum: a3 + a2 = 3 + 3 = 6

Wait, but in pile A, books 1,3,4, highest-indexed is 4 (pages 1), and pile B has book 2 (pages 3), sum is 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, but if pile A has books 1,3,4, highest-indexed is 4 (pages 1), and pile B has book 2 (pages 3), sum is 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, but if I try to assign pile A: books 1,4 and pile B: books 2,3.

Then, highest-indexed in pile A is 4 (pages 1), and in pile B is 3 (pages 3), sum is 4.

Alternatively, pile A: books 1,2, pile B: books 3,4.

Sum: a2 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

Wait, it seems that in all divisions, the sum is 4, except in the sample explanation where they got 4, but according to my earlier miscalculation, I thought sum could be 6, but actually, it's not.

Hence, the maximum sum is indeed 4.

So, perhaps the approach is to select the two highest pages among all books, provided that their indices are different.

Wait, but in this case, books 2 and 3 both have 3 pages, and book 4 has 1 page.

So, selecting books 2 and 3 would give sum 6, but according to the problem, since we have to read the highest-indexed book in each pile, and the highest-indexed book in a pile must be unique.

Wait, no, indices are unique, but in the division where pile A has books 1,2,4 and pile B has book 3, then sum is a4 + a3 =1 +3=4.

Alternatively, pile A has books 1,3,4 and pile B has book 2, sum is a3 + a2 =3 +3=6.

Wait, but in this division, pile A has books 1,3,4, with highest-indexed book being 4 (pages 1), and pile B has book 2 (pages 3).

Wait, but book 3 is in pile A, which has a higher index than book 2, but book 4 has a higher index than book 3, but its pages are 1.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, in pile A, which has books 1,3,4, the highest-indexed book is 4, which has 1 page.

In pile B, which has book 2, the highest-indexed book is 2, which has 3 pages.

So, the sum is 1 + 3 =4.

Similarly, in pile A: books 1,2,4, highest-indexed is 4 (1 page), pile B: book 3 (3 pages), sum is 4.

In pile A: books 1,2,3, pile B: book 4, sum is a3 + a4 =3 +1=4.

In pile A: books 1,4, pile B: books 2,3, sum is a4 + a3=1 +3=4.

In pile A: books 1,3, pile B: books 2,4, sum is a3 + a4=3 +1=4.

In pile A: books 1,2, pile B: books 3,4, sum is a2 + a4=3 +1=4.

So, in all possible divisions, the sum is 4, except in one case where pile A has books 1,3,4 and pile B has book 2, sum is a3 + a2=3 +3=6.

Wait, but according to the previous analysis, that should be a3 + a2=6, but according to the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile." And "highest number" refers to the book's number, i.e., its index.

So, in each pile, the book with the highest index in that pile is read.

So, in the division where pile A has books 1,3,4 and pile B has book 2, the highest-indexed book in pile A is book 4 (pages 1), and in pile B is book 2 (pages 3), sum is 4.

But if I try to assign pile A: books 1,3 and pile B: books 2,4.

Then, highest-indexed in pile A is book 3 (pages 3), in pile B is book 4 (pages 1), sum is 4.

Alternatively, pile A: books 1,2,3 and pile B: book 4.

Sum is a3 + a4=3 +1=4.

Wait, it seems that in all divisions, the sum is at most 4, but according to the sample output, it's 4.

So, perhaps my earlier miscalculation was wrong.

Hence, the approach should be:

- Identify, for each possible division, the highest-indexed book in each pile.

- Sum their pages.

- Choose the division that maximizes this sum.

But since n can be up to 100 and t up to 500, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about it differently.

Let's consider that the highest-indexed book in pile A is some book i, and in pile B is some book j, where i < j or j < i, depending on which pile has the higher index.

Wait, but since indices are unique and ordered, we can assume without loss of generality that pile A has the book with the higher index.

Wait, no, we cannot assume that.

Each pile must have at least one book, and the highest-indexed book in each pile must be in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to choose two books, one for each pile, such that their pages sum to the maximum possible, and their indices are such that all books in a pile have indices less than or equal to the highest-indexed book in that pile.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through all possible pairs of books to be the highest-indexed in their respective piles.

So, for each pair of books (i,j), where i < j, assign book j to pile A and book i to pile B, and ensure that all books with indices less than i are in pile B, and books with indices between i and j can be in either pile, but since j is in pile A, and i is in pile B, we need to make sure that the piles are divided accordingly.

This seems too complicated.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that the highest-indexed book in pile A is the maximum index among all books in pile A, and similarly for pile B.

To maximize the sum of pages of these two books, I need to choose which book is in which pile such that their pages are maximized.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the books in decreasing order of pages, and assign the two books with the highest pages to be in different piles.

Then, the sum would be the sum of the two highest pages.

But wait, in the second test case, the two highest pages are both 3, from books 2 and 3.

If I assign book 3 to pile A and book 2 to pile B, then the sum is 3 + 3 = 6, but according to the sample output, it's 4.

So, something is wrong with this approach.

Wait, but in the division where book 3 is in pile A and book 2 is in pile B, the highest-indexed book in pile A is book 3 (pages 3), and in pile B is book 2 (pages 3), sum is 6.

But the sample output is 4, not 6.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem has constraints that the highest-indexed book in each pile must be the one with the highest index in its pile, and all other books in the pile must have lower indices.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Each book contains a_i pages, where i is the book's number."

"Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles."

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

"Find the maximum total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

So, "highest number" refers to the book's number, which is its index.

So, in each pile, the book with the highest index is read.

So, the sum is the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

Hence, to maximize this sum, I need to maximize the sum of the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

Given that, I need to choose which pile each book goes into, ensuring that each pile has at least one book, and then sum the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

To maximize this sum, I should aim to have the books with higher pages as the highest-indexed books in their respective piles.

In the second test case, if
