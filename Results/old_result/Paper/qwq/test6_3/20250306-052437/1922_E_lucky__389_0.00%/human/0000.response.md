Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with length at most 200, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible to create such an array, I should output -1. The array elements can be anywhere from -10^9 to 10^9, and the subarrays can include any elements in order without changing their positions, but they must be strictly increasing.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. Given an array, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. An increasing subsequence is one where each element is strictly greater than the previous one in the subsequence.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1, 3, 2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty subsequence

- [1]

- [3]

- [2]

- [1,3]

- [1,2]

That's a total of 6 increasing subsequences.

Wait, but according to the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so I need to include that as well.

Given that, I need to find an array where the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

The problem allows arrays of length up to 200, which is a pretty large length, but given that X can be up to 10^18, I need to find a way to construct such arrays efficiently.

First, I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated.

Let's consider an array of distinct elements, sorted in increasing order. In that case, every subsequence is increasing, so the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^N - 1, where N is the length of the array (excluding the empty subsequence). Wait, but according to the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so it should be 2^N.

But in the example given in the problem, for X=2, the output is an array of length 1: [0]. Let's see: the increasing subsequences are [] and [0], so total of 2, which matches.

For X=5, the output is an array of length 3: [0,1,0]. Let's see the increasing subsequences:

- Empty subsequence

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

- [0] (the second 0)

So, total of 4. Wait, that doesn't match. According to the sample output, for X=5, the output is:

3

0 1 0

But according to my calculation, that should have only 4 increasing subsequences. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps subsequences are considered different based on the positions, not just the values. So, in [0,1,0], the subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first 0)

- [1]

- [0] (second 0)

- [0,1] (first 0 and 1)

- [0,1] (second 0 and 1)

Wait, but [0,1] appears twice, once for each 0. So total of 5 subsequences.

Yes, that makes sense now. So, subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the values are the same.

So, in this case, [0,1] appears twice because there are two 0's.

Got it.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty increasing subsequences plus one for the empty subsequence.

Wait, but according to the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so the total is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences plus one.

But in the sample input for X=2, the output is an array of length 1: [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=5, it's [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences as I listed above.

Okay, so now I need a general way to construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, where X can be up to 10^18, and the array length is at most 200.

First, I need to find a way to represent X in terms of the number of increasing subsequences.

I need to find an array where the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that subsequences can overlap in positions, I need to find a way to control the total count.

One approach is to consider building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated combinatorially.

I recall that in an array where all elements are equal, the only increasing subsequences are the empty one and the single-element subsequences. So, for an array of length N with all elements equal, the total number of increasing subsequences is N + 1.

But in this problem, since we allow duplicates, but increasing means strictly increasing, so duplicates cannot be part of the same increasing subsequence.

Wait, no, duplicates can be part of different increasing subsequences, but not in the same subsequence.

Wait, in the example [0,1,0], the subsequences [0,1] can be formed with either of the two 0's, so they are considered different subsequences.

So, in general, for an array, the total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-decreasing subsequences minus some overlaps, but I need a better way to think about this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations or something similar.

Wait, another idea: I know that in a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N - 1 (excluding the empty one), but including the empty one, it's 2^N.

But in this problem, the empty subsequence is also considered, so for a strictly increasing array of length N, the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

But in our problem, X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, but our array length is limited to 200, and 2^200 is way larger than 10^18, so that's manageable.

But the problem is that X can be any number up to 10^18, and I need to find an array whose number of increasing subsequences equals X.

Wait, but X can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 2^60 (which is about 1.1529215e+18), so I need to handle numbers up to 2^60.

Wait, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is larger than 10^18 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000), so it's fine.

But I need to find a way to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.

One approach is to represent X in binary and construct parts of the array that contribute specific amounts to the total count.

I need to find a way to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2, each corresponding to the number of increasing subsequences in a certain part of the array.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array in such a way that each new element added contributes a specific number of new increasing subsequences.

For example, if I have an array A, and I add a new element x at the end, then the number of new increasing subsequences added is equal to the number of increasing subsequences in A that are smaller than x.

Wait, more precisely, for each increasing subsequence S of A where S's last element is less than x, then S + [x] is a new increasing subsequence.

So, the number of new increasing subsequences added is equal to the number of increasing subsequences of A that are less than x.

This suggests that I can control the number of increasing subsequences by choosing x appropriately.

But I need to find a way to build the array step by step, adding elements in such a way that the total number of increasing subsequences sums up to X.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in an array consisting of multiple decreasing sequences, the total number of increasing subsequences can be calculated based on the lengths of these sequences.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of increasing subsequences being a sum over something related to the elements.

Let me consider a simpler case: if I have an array where all elements are equal, say [a,a,a,...,a], then the only increasing subsequences are the empty one and the single-element ones. So, total number is N + 1.

If I have an array where elements are strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,...,N], then the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

If I have an array where some elements are equal, then the total number of increasing subsequences is more than N + 1 but less than 2^N.

Wait, but in the sample input, for X=5, the output is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

Let me try to see a pattern here.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct corresponding array parts.

Wait, but X can be up to 10^18, which is manageable since 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18.

Wait, actually, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is larger than 10^18 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000), so it's fine.

But I need to find a way to construct the array based on the binary representation of X.

Wait, perhaps I can think of X as a sum of powers of 2, and each power of 2 corresponds to a certain pattern in the array.

Wait, let's consider that in a strictly increasing array of length N, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

If I have a array that is not strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^N.

But in the sample input, for X=5, which is not a power of 2, the array is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can build the array by combining parts that contribute specific amounts to the total count.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have disjoint parts in the array, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each part.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, no, because if parts are disjoint, then any increasing subsequence can include elements from any part, as long as they are in increasing order.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all possible non-empty subsets of the array that are strictly increasing.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider building the array by repeating certain patterns.

Wait, let's look at the sample input again.

For X=2, output is [0], which has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=5, output is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences as I listed earlier.

For X=13, output is [2,2,3,4,2], and for X=37, output is [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1].

I need to find a pattern here.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to be trying to construct such arrays.

Let me try to understand the given code.

The code reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads X, subtracts 1 from it, and then tries to decompose X into a sum of 2^i - 1 for some i's.

Wait, actually, in the code, it's doing x -=1; then while x !=0, it finds the largest i such that 2^(i+1) <= x +1, then appends i to subseq_lens, and updates x -= 2^i -1.

Wait, but 2^i -1 is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences of an array of length i with a certain structure.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to represent X-1 as a sum of (2^i -1), which corresponds to the number of non-empty increasing subsequences of an array of length i.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take X=5.

x =5-1=4

4 in binary is 100, which is 2^2.

So, i=2, since 2^(2+1)=8 >4+1=5.

Wait, 2^(i+1) <=x+1.

Wait, in code, it's while x !=0:

i=0

while 2^(i+1) <=x+1:

i +=1

So, for x=4, x+1=5.

2^(i+1):

i=0: 2^1=2 <=5, so i=1

2^2=4 <=5, so i=2

2^3=8 >5, so i=2

Then, subseq_lens.append(2)

x -= 2^2 -1 =4-1=3

Then, x=3

3 in binary is 11.

2^(i+1)<=4

i=0:2<=4, i=1:4<=4, i=2:8>4, so i=1

subseq_lens.append(1)

x -=2^1 -1=2-1=1, x=2

2 in binary is 10.

2^(i+1)<=3

i=0:2<=3, i=1:4>3, so i=0

subseq_lens.append(0)

x -=2^0 -1=1-1=0, x=1

Wait, no, 2^0=1, 1-1=0, x=1-0=1?

Wait, x -= 2^i -1, but 2^0=1, 1-1=0, x=2-0=2?

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code again.

Looking at the code:

x -=1

while x !=0:

i=0

while 2^(i+1) <=x+1:

i +=1

subseq_lens.append(i)

x -= 2^i -1

Then, it sets mx = max(subseq_lens)

Then, ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

Then, print len(ansv), and the ansv array.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what this is doing.

For X=5:

x=4

First loop:

i=0

2^(0+1)=2 <=5, so i=1

2^(1+1)=4 <=5, so i=2

2^(2+1)=8 >5, so i=2

subseq_lens=[2]

x -= 2^2 -1=4-1=3

Second loop:

x=3

i=0

2^(0+1)=2 <=4, i=1

2^(1+1)=4 <=4, i=2

2^(2+1)=8 >4, so i=2

subseq_lens=[2,2]

x -=2^2 -1=4-1=3, x=3-3=0

Then, mx=2

ansv=[0,1]

Then, for i in range(1,2):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[1]=2)

So, ansv=[0,1,2]

Wait, but in the sample input, for X=5, the output is [0,1,0], but according to this, it's [0,1,2].

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, in the sample input, for X=5, the output is [0,1,0], but according to this code, it's [0,1,2], which would have more than 5 increasing subsequences.

Wait, maybe the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think about how to represent X as a sum of numbers that correspond to the number of increasing subsequences.

I recall that in a sequence where elements are non-decreasing, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of elements where each subset is in increasing order.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is equal to the sum over all possible subsets of the array that are strictly increasing.

But this seems too general.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can represent X in binary, and each bit corresponds to including or excluding certain parts of the array that contribute to the total count.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by including elements that contribute specific amounts to the total count of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that adding a new element to the array can potentially double the number of increasing subsequences, similar to how binary works.

Wait, but in a strictly increasing array, adding a new element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or not include the new element.

Wait, in a strictly increasing array, adding a new element larger than all previous ones does double the number of increasing subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include the new element or not.

But in our case, the array is not necessarily strictly increasing, so it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array step by step, starting with an empty array, and at each step, adding an element that increases the number of increasing subsequences by a specific amount.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of increasing subsequences as a sum over the lengths of the array.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use dynamic programming to build up the array.

But given time constraints, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all positions of the number of increasing subsequences ending at that position.

And the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i is equal to the number of positions j < i where a_j < a_i, plus one (for the single element subsequence [a_i]).

This seems like the standard way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to find an array where this sum is exactly X.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider building the array by repeating certain patterns.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a group of elements that are all equal, then the number of increasing subsequences that include elements from that group is equal to the number of ways to choose one element from the group.

Wait, but in reality, if I have multiple equal elements, and I include one of them in a subsequence, it's considered different based on the position.

So, for example, in [0,1,0], the two 0's are considered different positions.

So, perhaps I need to think about the contribution of each element to the total number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

Wait, maybe I can think of the array as a combination of chains, where each chain is a strictly increasing subsequence.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum over all possible chains.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty subsets that are strictly increasing.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of combinations.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of binomial coefficients, since binomial coefficients correspond to the number of ways to choose subsets of certain sizes.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is too large for standard binomial coefficient representations.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

In an array with duplicates, it's less than 2^N.

But in this problem, duplicates can be present, and subsequences are considered different based on positions, not values.

So, perhaps I can build the array by having segments of strictly increasing sequences, and segments with duplicates.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary, and each bit corresponds to whether a particular segment is included or not.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as consisting of segments where each segment contributes a certain number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a segment of length L, the number of increasing subsequences in that segment is 2^L -1 (non-empty), plus the empty subsequence, which is 2^L.

But in reality, it's more complicated because segments can overlap and interact.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the array as a combination of independent parts, where the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each part.

Wait, but subsequences can include elements from different parts, so they are not truly independent.

Wait, unless the parts are separated in such a way that no element from one part is between elements of another part.

Wait, perhaps if I arrange the array so that elements from different parts are non-overlapping in their values, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each part.

For example, if I have two parts, where all elements in the first part are less than all elements in the second part, then any increasing subsequence can be formed by choosing a subsequence from the first part and a subsequence from the second part and concatenating them.

In this case, the total number of increasing subsequences would be (number of increasing subsequences in part1) * (number of increasing subsequences in part2).

Because for each subsequence in part1 and each subsequence in part2, their concatenation forms a valid increasing subsequence.

Additionally, we can include the empty subsequences from either part.

Wait, but the empty subsequence is included in both parts, so the total would be (sub1 +1) * (sub2 +1) -1, if we exclude the case where both subsequences are empty.

Wait, but in reality, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of:

- Subsequences from part1 (excluding empty)

- Subsequences from part2 (excluding empty)

- Concatenations of non-empty subsequences from part1 and non-empty subsequences from part2.

So, total subs = sub1 + sub2 + sub1 * sub2

Which is equal to (sub1 +1) * (sub2 +1) -1.

But in
