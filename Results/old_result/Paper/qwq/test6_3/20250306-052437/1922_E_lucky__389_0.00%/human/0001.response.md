Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with length at most 200, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible to create such an array, I should output -1. The array elements can be anywhere from -10^9 to 10^9, and the subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions in the array, even if the elements are the same.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. It's a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order, and they maintain their relative order in the array. For example, in the array [1, 3, 2], the increasing subsequences are [1], [3], [2], [1,3], but not [1,2] because 2 comes after 3, which is larger, so [1,2] doesn't maintain the relative order.

The problem mentions that even if two subsequences have the same values but are from different positions, they are considered different. For example, in [2,2], there are two subsequences of [2], each corresponding to a different position.

My task is to construct an array whose number of increasing subsequences is exactly X, and the array should have at most 200 elements.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences for a given array. Then, I need to find an array where this number is exactly X.

But calculating the number of increasing subsequences directly seems complicated, especially since X can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

I recall that for a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1, where n is the length of the array. This is because every non-empty subset of the array elements forms an increasing subsequence.

But in this problem, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing; it can have any arrangement as long as the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that we can have arrays that are not strictly increasing, and still count their increasing subsequences.

But perhaps I can start by considering arrays that are strictly increasing and see if I can generalize from there.

Let's consider a strictly increasing array, say [1,2,3]. The number of increasing subsequences is 2^3 - 1 = 7.

But in this problem, X can be any number, not necessarily one less than a power of two.

So, maybe I need to consider arrays that are not strictly increasing, to get different counts of increasing subsequences.

Wait, but if I have duplicates or decreasing elements, I might affect the number of increasing subsequences.

I need to find a way to construct an array where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can think in terms of binary representations or something similar, since X can be up to 10^18.

Wait, 10^18 is 2^60, approximately, so it's a large number.

But I need to represent X as the number of increasing subsequences in an array of at most 200 elements.

I need to find a way to represent X in terms of combinations of subsequences.

Another thought: perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is equal to the sum over all k from 1 to n of the number of increasing subsequences of length k.

But calculating this directly seems too time-consuming.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representations.

Let me consider that each position in the array can either be included in a subsequence or not, as long as the selected elements are in increasing order.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me look at some examples from the problem statement.

In the first test case, X=2.

The output is an array of length 1: [0]. The increasing subsequences are just [0], which is 1, but the problem says to subtract 1, so it's 0, but wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, the problem says to output an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

In this case, [0] has only one increasing subsequence, which is [0], so the number is 1, but X=2.

Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I misread.

Wait, in the example, for X=2, the output is:

1

0

So, an array of length 1 with element 0, which has only one increasing subsequence, [0]. But X=2, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or my understanding.

Wait, let's look at the problem statement again.

It says: "Note that an empty subsequence is also increasing."

Wait, I think I missed that. So, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing. So, for an array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences plus one (for the empty subsequence).

But in the problem, it seems that they are considering the empty subsequence as well, since for X=2, it's [0], which has two subsequences: the empty one and [0].

Yes, that makes sense. So, the total number of increasing subsequences is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences plus one for the empty subsequence.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "Note that an empty subsequence is also increasing."

And it seems that they are including the empty subsequence in the count.

So, for an array of length n, the total number of increasing subsequences is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences plus one.

In the first test case, X=2: the array [0] has two increasing subsequences: the empty one and [0]. So, that matches X=2.

Okay, got it.

Similarly, for X=5, the output is:

3

0 1 0

So, array [0,1,0]. Let's see the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [0] (first position)

- [1]

- [0] (third position)

- [0,1] (first and second positions)

So, total of 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case: X=13, array [2,2,3,4,2]

Let's list all increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2] (fifth)

- [2,3] (first and third)

- [2,4] (first and fourth)

- [2,3] (second and third)

- [2,4] (second and fourth)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (first, third, fourth)

- [2,3,4] (second, third, fourth)

- [2,3,4] (first, third, fourth and second, third, fourth, but positions differ)

Wait, I might be missing some, but overall, it seems there are 13 increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, the approach seems to be constructing an array such that the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one, is exactly X.

Given that, I need a way to construct such an array with at most 200 elements.

Now, to find a general approach, I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated and how to construct an array accordingly.

I recall that for a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty one.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2^n - 1, but the problem includes the empty subsequence, so it's 2^n.

Yes, for a strictly increasing array of length n, there are 2^n increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, for example, [1,2,3] has 2^3 = 8 subsequences:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2]

- [3]

- [1,2]

- [1,3]

- [2,3]

- [1,2,3]

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, if I have an array that is not strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences would be less than 2^n, because some subsequences might not be strictly increasing due to duplicates or decreasing elements.

So, perhaps I can construct an array that is a combination of strictly increasing parts and some repeated elements to control the total number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representation of X.

Since for a strictly increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, including the empty one.

So, if I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, each corresponding to a strictly increasing subarray, I might be able to construct the overall array.

But I need to make sure that the increasing subsequences from different parts are combined correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the inclusion-exclusion of subsequences from different parts.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the total number of increasing subsequences is multiplicative if the array is divided into independent parts.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have two independent strictly increasing subarrays, say [1,2] and [3,4]. If I concatenate them to form [1,2,3,4], which is still strictly increasing, the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^4 = 16.

But if I have [1,3,2], which is not strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^3.

So, perhaps I need a way to have parts of the array that contribute independently to the total count.

Wait, maybe I can have multiple strictly increasing subarrays that don't interfere with each other.

But in reality, in an array, the order matters because subsequences must maintain the relative order.

So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a strictly increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

If I introduce duplicates or decreasing elements, some subsequences would no longer be increasing, so the total count would be less than 2^n.

But it's not clear how to control the count precisely to reach any given X.

Let me consider the opposite approach: start with an array that has the minimal number of increasing subsequences and try to increase it.

Wait, but the minimal number is 1, for an array of length 1 (only the empty subsequence and the single element).

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of binary representations.

Given that 2^n is the number of increasing subsequences for a strictly increasing array of length n, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of distinct 2^k - 1's or something similar.

Wait, but X is the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one, so it's 2^n.

Wait, no, for a strictly increasing array, it's 2^n, including the empty one.

But in general, it can be any number between 1 and 2^n.

But with duplicates or decreasing elements, it can be any number in between.

But it's still not clear how to construct an array that achieves exactly X.

Let me think about smaller examples.

For X=2: array [0], which has 2 subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=5: array [0,1,0], which has 5 subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1], [0], [0,0] is not increasing, so perhaps only four, but in the example, it's given as 5, so maybe I'm missing one.

Wait, [0,1,0] has:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [1]

- [0] (third)

- [0,1] (first and second)

That's five.

Wait, but [0,0] is also a subsequence, but it's not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, total of five increasing subsequences.

Okay, so in this case, by introducing duplicates, I can control the total count.

Similarly, for X=13, the array [2,2,3,4,2] has 13 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps the idea is to have a sequence with some repeated elements to reduce the total count from the maximal 2^n.

But how to generalize this?

I need a systematic way to construct such arrays.

Let me consider the binary representation of X.

Since X can be up to 10^18, which is less than 2^60, but the array can have at most 200 elements, which would allow up to 2^200, which is way more than 10^18.

So, in terms of bits, 10^18 is 60 bits, but our array can represent up to 200 bits.

Wait, but it's not directly comparable because the number of increasing subsequences isn't simply 2^n for arbitrary arrays.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the binary representation of X and construct parts of the array that contribute specific amounts to the total count.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that certain elements can be included or excluded in the subsequences in a controlled manner.

But I'm not making much progress with this line of thought.

Let me look back at the code provided and see what approach it's taking.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

x = int(input())

x -= 1

subseq_lens = []

mx = 0

while x != 0:

i = 0

while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:

i += 1

if i == 0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i)

x -= 2 ** i - 1

mx = max(mx, i)

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

print(len(ansv))

for i in range(len(ansv)):

print(ansv[i], end=' ')

print()

So, it seems to be processing X by subtracting powers of 2 minus 1.

Wait, specifically, it's subtracting 2^i - 1 from X, where i is some value determined by how many times 2^(i+1) <= x + 1.

Then, it constructs an array that is a sequence from 0 to mx-1, and then appends some elements from subseq_lens.

This seems unclear to me.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to represent X as a sum of (2^i - 1) for different i's.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to understand the code's logic.

First, it subtracts 1 from X, so X becomes X - 1.

Then, it enters a loop while X != 0.

In each iteration, it finds the largest i such that 2^(i+1) <= x + 1.

Then, it appends i to subseq_lens and subtracts 2^i - 1 from X.

It keeps track of the maximum i in mx.

Then, it creates an array ansv that is [0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1].

Then, for each i from 1 to len(subseq_lens) - 1, it appends subseq_lens[i] to ansv.

Finally, it prints the length of ansv and the elements of ansv.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure if this approach is correct.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take X = 5.

X -= 1 => X = 4.

First iteration:

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <= 4 + 1 = 5.

i starts at 0.

2^(0+1) = 2 <= 5, so i = 0.

2^(1+1) = 4 <= 5, so i = 1.

2^(2+1) = 8 > 5, so stop.

Append i=1 to subseq_lens.

x -= 2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 => x = 4 - 1 = 3.

mx = max(0,1) = 1.

Second iteration:

x = 3.

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <= 3 + 1 = 4.

i=0: 2 <= 4.

i=1: 4 <= 4.

i=2: 8 > 4.

So, i=1.

Append 1 to subseq_lens.

x -= 2^1 - 1 = 1 => x = 3 - 1 = 2.

mx = max(1,1) = 1.

Third iteration:

x=2.

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <= 2 + 1 = 3.

i=0: 2 <= 3.

i=1: 4 > 3.

So, i=0.

Append 0 to subseq_lens.

x -= 2^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 => x = 2 - 0 = 2.

Wait, 2^0 = 1, 1 - 1 = 0, so x -= 0 => x remains 2.

This seems off.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back:

x -= 2 ** i - 1

So, when i=0, 2**0 -1 = 1 -1 =0, so x -=0.

So, x remains 2.

Then, the loop continues.

Fourth iteration:

x=2.

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <= 2 +1=3.

i=0: 2 <=3.

i=1:4>3.

So, i=0.

Append 0 to subseq_lens.

x -=0.

Still x=2.

This seems like an infinite loop.

Wait, but according to the code, if i==0, it breaks.

Wait, the code says:

if i == 0:

break

else:

subseq_lens.append(i)

x -= 2 ** i - 1

mx = max(mx, i)

So, in the third iteration, i=0, so it breaks.

So, subseq_lens = [1,1,0]

mx=1

ansv = [i for i in range(mx)] => [0]

then, for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):

ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

len(subseq_lens) = 3, so i=1 and i=2.

subseq_lens[1]=1, subseq_lens[2]=0.

So, ansv = [0,1,0]

Which matches the example output for X=5.

But earlier, when I tried to count the number of increasing subsequences for [0,1,0], I only found 5, which matches X=5.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

Let me try another example, say X=3.

X -=1 => X=2.

First iteration:

Find i such that 2^(i+1) <=3.

i=0: 2<=3.

i=1:4>3.

So, i=0.

Since i==0, break.

subseq_lens=[0]

mx=0

ansv=[i for i in range(mx)] => empty list.

Then, for i in range(1,1): nothing.

So, ansv remains empty.

But an empty array has only one subsequence: the empty one, but X=3.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the code handles X=1 separately.

But in the problem, X starts from 2.

Wait, but X=2 corresponds to [0], which has two subsequences: empty and [0].

So, for X=3, perhaps it's impossible, so output -1.

But according to the code, it would output an empty array, which is invalid because the array must have at least one element (since X >=2 corresponds to at least one element).

Wait, but the problem allows arrays of length at most 200, but doesn't specify a minimum length.

However, an empty array would have only one subsequence: the empty one, which doesn't match X=3.

So, perhaps the code needs to handle the case when ansv is empty and output -1.

But in the given code, it seems to output an empty array, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is flawed.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for impossible cases, we should output -1.

In this case, X=3 might not be achievable with any array, or perhaps it is achievable with a specific array.

Wait, let's see.

If I have an array of length 1, [a], it has two subsequences: empty and [a], total 2, which is X=2.

If I have an array of length 2, [a,b], if a < b, it has 2^2=4 subsequences: empty, [a], [b], [a,b].

If a >= b, it has 3 subsequences: empty, [a], [b], since [a,b] is not increasing.

So, for X=3, an array [a,b] with a >= b would have exactly 3 increasing subsequences: empty, [a], [b].

Hence, X=3 is achievable with an array of length 2 where the first element is not less than the second.

But according to the code, for X=3, it would output an empty array, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Another issue:
