Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices, where x is the maximum possible number satisfying this condition.

Okay, so trees are special because they're connected graphs with no cycles, and removing any edge will split them into exactly two connected components. That's a crucial property here.

Given that, if I remove one edge, the tree splits into two components. If I remove a second edge, each of those components can split further, and so on. So, after removing k edges, I'll have k+1 connected components.

But the twist is that each of these components must have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

Hmm. So, to maximize x, I need to minimize the number of components, because fewer components mean each can have more vertices. But wait, removing k edges gives me k+1 components, so the number of components is fixed based on k. So, I need to distribute the vertices as evenly as possible, I think.

Wait, but the tree structure might not allow for an even distribution. So, perhaps I need to find a way to partition the tree into k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices, and maximize x.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using binary search. Since x can range from 1 up to n, and I need the maximum x where it's possible to remove k edges to get components each with at least x vertices.

So, I can perform a binary search on x, and for each candidate x, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

The key part is implementing this check efficiently.

Given that the graph is a tree, I can root the tree and calculate subtree sizes. Then, I need to see if I can remove k edges such that all resulting subtrees have at least x vertices.

One approach is to perform a post-order traversal and count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices. If the number of such subtrees is at least k+1, then it's possible to remove k edges to achieve this.

Wait, actually, I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices. So, I need to find a way to partition the tree into k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices.

This seems similar to finding the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the tree into subtrees of at least x vertices, and then checking if this number is at most k.

So, perhaps I can compute the minimum number of cuts needed, and if it's less than or equal to k, then it's possible.

To compute the minimum number of cuts, I can traverse the tree and count how many subtrees of at least x vertices I can form.

Wait, but I need to maximize x, so I need to find the largest x where the number of subtrees with at least x vertices is less than or equal to k+1.

Actually, no. If I can partition the tree into m subtrees each with at least x vertices, then m <= k+1, because removing k edges gives k+1 components.

So, for a given x, I need to check if I can partition the tree into k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices.

Wait, but in reality, removing k edges will always result in k+1 components, so I need to ensure that all of these k+1 components have at least x vertices.

But how to maximize x?

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix x, and I want to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

I can think of it as removing k edges and ensuring that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But this seems tricky. Maybe I should consider the complement: find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices, and see if this number is <= k.

But I need to maximize x such that this minimal number is <= k.

This seems like a binary search on x, and for each x, find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and check if this number is <= k.

But finding the minimal number of edges to remove seems non-trivial.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a tree, removing an edge always increases the number of components by one.

So, if I have a tree with one component, and I remove edges, each removal increases the number of components by one.

So, to have at least m components, I need to remove at least m-1 edges.

But in this problem, I need to ensure that each component has at least x vertices.

So, I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to get components each with at least x vertices.

I think this minimal number can be found by counting how many components of at least x vertices I can form, and then the number of edges to remove is that number minus one.

Wait, more carefully:

If I can partition the tree into c components each with at least x vertices, then I need to remove c-1 edges.

So, if c-1 <= k, then it's possible.

Therefore, to maximize x, I need to minimize c, which means maximizing x such that the minimal c is <= k+1.

Wait, no. Wait, c is the number of components, which is k+1.

So, for a given x, find the maximal c such that I can partition the tree into c components each with at least x vertices, and check if c <= k+1.

Wait, but I think I need to find the minimal number of components, which is k+1, and ensure that each has at least x vertices.

I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me look at the code provided and see how it approaches this.

Looking at the code, it defines a Tree class with nodes that have edges, children, subtree sizes, parents, good components, and remaining sizes.

It seems to be implementing some kind of tree traversal to calculate these values.

There are two functions, func_1 and func_2, which seem to be calculating the number of "good components" and the remaining size for a given x.

Then, func_3 checks if for a given x, the number of good components is greater than k, or equal to k with remaining size at least x.

Finally, func_4 performs a binary search to find the maximum x satisfying the condition.

And func_5 reads input and calls the necessary functions.

So, the approach in the code is to perform a binary search on x, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

The check seems to be done by traversing the tree and counting the number of subtrees with at least x vertices.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n=5, k=1

Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 3-4, 3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

   ├─4

   └─5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, x=2 is possible.

The code should confirm that.

In the code, func_4 performs a binary search between 1 and n=5.

First, mid=(1+5+1)//2=3. So, check x=3.

Is it possible to remove 1 edge such that all components have at least 3 vertices?

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, {1,2} has 2 < 3, and {3,4,5} has 3.

So, not all components have at least 3 vertices. So, func_3 should return False.

Then, the search space becomes 1 to 2.

Next, mid=(1+2+1)//2=2.

Is x=2 possible?

Remove the edge between 1 and 3: {1,2} has 2, {3,4,5} has 3, both >=2. So, func_3 should return True.

Then, the search space becomes 2 to 2, and the answer is 2.

Seems correct for this case.

Let me check another example.

n=2, k=1

Edges: 1-2

If I remove the only edge, I get two components: {1} and {2}, both with size 1.

So, x=1 is possible, but x=2 is not, since I can't have both components with at least 2 vertices if I remove the only edge.

Wait, actually, with k=1, I remove one edge, resulting in two components, each with one vertex.

So, x=1 is possible, but x=2 is not.

The code should reflect this.

In the binary search, it starts with mid=(1+2+1)//2=2.

Check x=2: remove 1 edge, get two components with 1 vertex each, which is less than 2. So, func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 1, check x=1: remove 1 edge, get two components with 1 vertex each, which is >=1. So, func_3 returns True.

Thus, the answer is 1, which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

Edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6

A straight line tree.

If I remove the edge between 3 and 4, I get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

So, x=3 should be possible.

Let's see what the code does.

Binary search starts with mid=(1+6+1)//2=4.

Check x=4: remove 1 edge, can I have all components with at least 4 vertices?

If I remove any edge, the components will have sizes like 3 and 3, or 2 and 4, etc., none with at least 4.

So, func_3 should return False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 3.

Next mid=(1+3+1)//2=2.

Check x=2: remove 1 edge, say between 3 and 4, get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both >=2. So, func_3 returns True.

Then, search space becomes 2 to 3.

Next mid=(2+3+1)//2=3.

Check x=3: remove 1 edge, get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both >=3. So, func_3 returns True.

Then, search space becomes 3 to 3, answer is 3.

Which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1

Edges: 1-2, 1-3

If I remove the edge between 1 and 2, I get {1,3} and {2}, where {2} has only 1 vertex, which is less than x=1.

Similarly, removing between 1 and 3 gives {1,2} and {3}, both with >=1 vertex.

So, x=1 is possible, but x=2 is not, because in one of the components has only 1 vertex.

Wait, x=2 is not possible because no matter which edge I remove, one of the components will have only 1 vertex.

So, the answer should be 1.

Let's see what the code does.

Binary search starts with mid=(1+3+1)//2=2.

Check x=2: remove 1 edge, possible components are {1,2} and {3}, where {3} has only 1 < 2. Similarly, {1,3} and {2}, same issue.

So, func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 1, check x=1: remove 1 edge, get components with at least 1 vertex, which is true.

So, answer is 1, correct.

Good.

Another test case:

n=8, k=2

Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8

This is a tree where node 1 has children 2 and 3, node 2 has children 4 and 5, node 3 has children 6,7,8.

If I remove edges between 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}, with sizes 1,3,4.

But x=1 is possible, but x=2 is not because one component has only 1 vertex.

Alternatively, if I remove edges between 2-4 and 2-5, I get components: {1,3,6,7,8}, {2}, {4}, {5}, with sizes 5,1,1,1.

Not good.

Another option: remove edges between 1-2 and between 2-4.

Then components are: {1,3,6,7,8}, {2,5}, {4}, with sizes 5,2,1.

Again, x=1 is possible, x=2 is not.

Seems that in all cases, at least one component will have only 1 vertex, so x=1 is the answer.

The code should reflect this.

In the binary search, it starts with mid=(1+8+1)//2=5.

Check x=5: remove 2 edges, can I have all components with at least 5 vertices?

No matter which edges I remove, no component will have 5 vertices.

So, func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 4.

Next mid=(1+4+1)//2=3.

Check x=3: remove 2 edges.

If I remove edges between 1-2 and 1-3, get components {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}, with sizes 1,3,4.

Component {1} has only 1 < 3, so func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 2.

Next mid=(1+2+1)//2=2.

Check x=2: remove 2 edges.

If I remove edges between 1-2 and 1-3, get components {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}, with sizes 1,3,4.

Again, {1} has only 1 < 2, so func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 1, check x=1: remove 2 edges.

If I remove edges between 1-2 and 1-3, get components {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}, all with >=1 vertices.

So, func_3 returns True.

Thus, the answer is 1, which is correct.

Good.

Another test case:

n=6, k=2

Edges: 1-2, 2-3, 1-4, 4-5, 5-6

If I remove edges between 1-2 and 1-4, I get components {1}, {2,3}, {4,5,6}, with sizes 1,2,3.

x=1 is possible, x=2 is possible only if all components have at least 2 vertices, but one component has only 1 vertex.

So, x=1 is the answer.

Let's see what the code does.

Binary search starts with mid=(1+6+1)//2=4.

Check x=4: remove 2 edges, can I have all components with at least 4 vertices?

No, so func_3 returns False.

Search space becomes 1 to 3.

Next mid=(1+3+1)//2=2.

Check x=2: remove 2 edges, get components with sizes 1,2,3.

One component has only 1 < 2, so func_3 returns False.

Then, search space becomes 1 to 1, check x=1: remove 2 edges, get components with sizes 1,2,3, all >=1.

So, func_3 returns True.

Thus, the answer is 1, which is correct.

Alright, seems like the logic is holding up with these examples.

Now, let's look deeper into the code to ensure there are no mistakes in implementation.

First, the Tree class defines nodes with edges, children, subtree sizes, parents, good components, and remaining sizes.

The add_edge function adds edges between vertices.

The root_tree function is used to root the tree at vertex 0, setting parents and calculating subtree sizes recursively.

There's also a non-recursive version, root_tree_non_recursive, which does the same using a stack.

Then, func_1 seems to perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size for a given x.

Wait, actually, func_1 is implemented using a stack, simulating post-order traversal.

It seems to accumulate the number of good components and the remaining size up the tree.

Similarly, func_2 is a recursive version doing the same.

func_3 uses func_1 to get the number of good components and the remaining size, and checks if the number of good components is greater than k, or equal to k with remaining size >= x.

func_4 performs the binary search between 1 and n to find the maximum x.

func_5 reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls func_4 to get the answer.

Looking at func_1 and func_2, they seem to be doing the same thing, but one is iterative and the other recursive.

In the code, func_1 is used, which is iterative.

I assume it's to avoid recursion depth issues for large n.

Now, the logic in func_1 is to traverse the tree in post-order, accumulating the number of good components and the remaining size.

In each node, it sums the good components from its children, and if any child's remaining size is >= x, it counts as a good component, otherwise, it adds the child's remaining size to its own remaining size.

Finally, it returns the total good components and the remaining size for the subtree rooted at s.

Then, in func_3, it calls func_1 and checks if the number of good components is greater than k, or equal to k with remaining size >= x.

I need to ensure that this correctly determines whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

From my earlier reasoning, I think this is correct.

The number of good components represents the number of subtrees with at least x vertices, and the remaining size is the size of the current component.

If the number of good components is greater than k, it means I can remove k edges and still have more than k+1 components with at least x vertices, which is acceptable.

If the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is >= x, it means I can remove k edges to get k+1 components, all with at least x vertices.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

This seems logical.

Also, the binary search in func_4 is correctly set up to find the maximum x.

Now, I need to check if there are any potential errors in the implementation.

Looking at the Tree class, the nodes are initialized with subtree_size=1, which is correct because each node starts with itself.

In root_tree_non_recursive, it sets the parent and then iterates through the children, accumulating subtree sizes.

In func_1, it performs a post-order traversal using a stack, which should correctly process the tree in post-order.

The calculation of good_components and remaining_size seems accurate based on the logic discussed earlier.

Therefore, I don't see any mistakes in the code.

It appears to correctly implement the required algorithm to solve the problem.

Hence, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{2}
