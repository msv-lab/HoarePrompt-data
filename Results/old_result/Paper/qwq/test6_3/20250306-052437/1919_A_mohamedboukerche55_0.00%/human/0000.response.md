Alright, I have this problem here about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with their wallets. Each has some coins, and they take turns making moves according to specific rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the key points are:

1. Players take turns alternately, starting with Alice.

2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.

3. After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.

4. The player who can't remove a coin because their wallet is empty loses.

I need to determine, for given values of 'a' and 'b', who will win the game if both play optimally.

Looking at the sample input and output, I see multiple test cases, each with different values of 'a' and 'b', and the expected output is either "Alice" or "Bob".

Now, I need to think about how to approach this problem. Since it's a game with perfect information and both players play optimally, it seems like a problem that can be solved using game theory, possibly by finding a winning strategy based on the initial number of coins.

Let me consider some small values of 'a' and 'b' to see if I can find a pattern.

**Test Case 1:**

a = 1, b = 1

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. Now, a=1, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=0, b=1.

- Option 2: Don't swap. a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn:

- If Alice swapped:

- Bob can't swap because a=0, so he has to keep his wallet. Removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn:

- Both wallets are empty, so Alice can't make a move. Bob wins.

- If Alice didn't swap:

- a=0, b=1.

- Bob can't swap because a=0, so he keeps his wallet. Removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move. Bob wins.

So, in this case, regardless of Alice's choice, Bob wins.

**Test Case 2:**

a = 1, b = 4

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap. a=4, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=3, b=1.

- Option 2: Don't swap. a=0, b=4.

- If Alice swaps:

- Bob's turn:

- Option 1: Swap. a=1, b=3. Bob removes 1 coin, a=1, b=2.

- Option 2: Don't swap. a=3, b=0.

- If Bob swaps:

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap. a=2, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=1, b=1.

- Option 2: Don't swap. a=2, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn:

- Option 1: Swap. a=1, b=0. Bob removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Option 2: Don't swap. a=0, b=1. Bob removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn:

- Both wallets are empty. Alice can't make a move. Bob wins.

- If Bob doesn't swap:

- a=3, b=0.

- Alice's turn:

- Can't swap because b=0. So, must keep her wallet. Removes 1 coin, a=2, b=0.

- Bob's turn:

- Can't swap because b=0. Must keep his wallet. Can't remove a coin because b=0. Alice wins.

Wait, this is confusing. It seems like Alice has a choice that leads to her winning in one path and Bob winning in another.

Looking back at the sample output for a=1, b=4, it says "Alice". So, there must be a strategy where Alice can force a win.

Let me try to generalize this.

I need to find a pattern or a formula that can determine the winner based on 'a' and 'b'.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

1. 1 1 -> Bob

2. 1 4 -> Alice

3. 5 3 -> Bob

4. 4 5 -> Alice

5. 11 9 -> Bob

6. 83 91 -> Bob

7. 1032 9307 -> Alice

8. 839204 7281 -> Alice

9. 1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

10. 53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at these, it's not immediately obvious what the pattern is based on 'a' and 'b'.

Let me consider the parity of 'a' and 'b'.

In the first test case, a=1 (odd), b=1 (odd) -> Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1 (odd), b=4 (even) -> Alice wins.

Third test case, a=5 (odd), b=3 (odd) -> Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4 (even), b=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Fifth test case, a=11 (odd), b=9 (odd) -> Bob wins.

Sixth test case, a=83 (odd), b=91 (odd) -> Bob wins.

Seventh test case, a=1032 (even), b=9307 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Eighth test case, a=839204 (even), b=7281 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Ninth test case, a=1000000000 (even), b=1000000000 (even) -> Bob wins.

Tenth test case, a=53110 (even), b=2024 (even) -> Bob wins.

Hmm, it seems that when both 'a' and 'b' are even, Bob wins.

Wait, in the ninth test case, both are even, and Bob wins.

In the tenth test case, both are even, and Bob wins.

But in the seventh and eighth test cases, one is even and one is odd, and Alice wins.

In the second test case, one is odd and one is even, Alice wins.

In the first, third, fifth, sixth, ninth, and tenth test cases, either both are odd or both are even, and Bob wins.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, a=4 (even), b=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Seems like when 'a' and 'b' have different parities, Alice wins, and when they have the same parity, Bob wins.

But looking back, in the second test case, a=1 (odd), b=4 (even) -> Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, a=4 (even), b=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

In the seventh test case, a=1032 (even), b=9307 (odd) -> Alice wins.

In the eighth test case, a=839204 (even), b=7281 (odd) -> Alice wins.

In contrast, in the first test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

In the third test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

In the fifth test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

In the sixth test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

In the ninth test case, both even -> Bob wins.

In the tenth test case, both even -> Bob wins.

So, it seems that if 'a' and 'b' have the same parity (both even or both odd), Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But wait, in the second test case, a=1 (odd), b=4 (even) -> Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, a=4 (even), b=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

But in the ninth test case, both even -> Bob wins.

Tenth test case, both even -> Bob wins.

First test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

Third test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

Fifth test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

Sixth test case, both odd -> Bob wins.

So, it seems that if 'a' and 'b' have the same parity, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But wait, in the second test case, a=1 (odd), b=4 (even) -> Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, a=4 (even), b=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Seems to confirm the pattern.

So, perhaps the winning condition is based on the parity of 'a' and 'b'.

If 'a' and 'b' have the same parity, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But I need to verify this.

Looking back at the first test case: a=1, b=1 -> Bob wins.

Second test case: a=1, b=4 -> Alice wins.

Third test case: a=5, b=3 -> Bob wins.

Fourth test case: a=4, b=5 -> Alice wins.

Fifth test case: a=11, b=9 -> Bob wins.

Sixth test case: a=83, b=91 -> Bob wins.

Seventh test case: a=1032, b=9307 -> Alice wins.

Eighth test case: a=839204, b=7281 -> Alice wins.

Ninth test case: a=1000000000, b=1000000000 -> Bob wins.

Tenth test case: a=53110, b=2024 -> Bob wins.

Yes, this seems consistent.

So, the condition is:

- If a + b is even, Bob wins.

- If a + b is odd, Alice wins.

Wait, because if a and b have the same parity, a + b is even; if they have different parities, a + b is odd.

But in the second test case, a=1 (odd), b=4 (even) -> a + b = 5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

In the first test case, a=1 (odd), b=1 (odd) -> a + b = 2 (even) -> Bob wins.

This matches.

So, the winning condition is:

- If a + b is even, Bob wins.

- If a + b is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to be the pattern.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the correct strategy.

Let me think about the game more deeply.

This game is similar to the game of Nim or other impartial games where the concept of "Nim-sum" or parity might determine the winner.

In this case, since the players can choose to swap wallets or not, and then remove one coin, it's about manipulating the parity of the coin counts.

If a + b is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves in some way to ensure he wins.

If a + b is odd, Alice can make a move that puts Bob in a losing position.

This seems plausible, but I should try to think of a general strategy.

Let me consider the game state as a pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each move consists of:

1. Choosing to swap or not.

2. Removing one coin from the current wallet.

The player who can't make a move loses.

I need to find the winning and losing positions.

This seems complex, but if the sum a + b is even, Bob can always respond in a way that maintains the parity, eventually leading to Alice's loss.

If a + b is odd, Alice can make a move that makes a + b even, putting Bob in a losing position.

This seems to make sense.

Given that, the program provided seems to implement this logic.

Looking at the program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

s = input()

a = int(list(s.split())[0])

b = int(list(s.split())[1])

if (a + b) % 2 == 0:

print('bob ')

else:

print('alice')

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads a and b, checks if their sum is even, and prints "bob" if it is, otherwise "alice".

This matches the pattern I observed from the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, I conclude that this program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed \text{See the program above} \]

**Correctness: True**
