Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has a string, and he thinks it's ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Otherwise, it's beautiful. My task is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters possible.

First, I need to understand what makes a string ugly. If anywhere in the string, there's "pie" or "map", the whole string is considered ugly. So, to make it beautiful, I need to eliminate these substrings by removing some characters.

The goal is to remove the least number of characters to achieve this. It's important to be efficient because the strings can be quite long, up to 10^6 characters, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, but the total sum of n across all test cases is 10^6, which is manageable.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need a way to scan the string and identify occurrences of "pie" or "map". Whenever I find one, I need to decide which character(s) to remove to break that substring.

One straightforward way is to iterate through the string and check for these substrings. If I find "pie" or "map", I can remove one character from it, making sure that the substring is broken. Then, I can move on to the next part of the string.

But wait, if I remove a character, the indices of the characters after it change. So, I need to be careful about how I handle the indices after a removal.

Let me consider an example to see this more clearly.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 9

s = "mmapnapie"

I need to find "pie" or "map" in this string.

Looking at it:

Positions: 0:m, 1:m, 2:m, 3:a, 4:p, 5:n, 6:a, 7:p, 8:i, 9:e

Wait, n is 9, so positions 0 to 8:

m m a p n a p i e

Looking for "map" or "pie".

Looking at positions 2-4: m a p → "map" → ugly

Looking at positions 7-9: p i e → "pie" → ugly

So, there are two ugly substrings: "map" and "pie".

The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both.

If I remove one character from each, that would be two deletions.

For example, remove the 'm' from "map" and the 'p' from "pie", resulting in:

Positions removed: 2 (m) and 7 (p)

Remaining string: m m a p n a i e

Now, check for "map" or "pie":

Looking for "map": not present.

Looking for "pie": not present.

So, the string is beautiful after removing two characters.

According to the first test case, the answer is 2, which matches my manual calculation.

Another test case:

n = 9

s = "azabazapi"

Looking for "map" or "pie":

"azabazapi"

No "map" or "pie" found, so it's already beautiful. Output should be 0, which matches the example.

Third test case:

n = 8

s = "mappppie"

Looking for "map" or "pie":

"mappppie"

"map" at positions 0-2: m a p

"pie" at positions 5-7: p p i e → "ppie" which contains "pie"

So, two ugly substrings.

To make it beautiful, need to remove at least two characters.

For example, remove the 'm' from "map" and the 'i' from "pie", resulting in:

a p p p p e

No "map" or "pie" present.

So, again, the answer is 2, matching the example.

Fourth test case:

n = 18

s = "mapmapmapmapmapmap"

This has multiple "map" substrings.

Each "map" needs at least one character removed to break it.

But, removing one character can break multiple "map" substrings if they overlap.

Wait, in this case, "mapmap" has overlapping "map"s:

mapmap → map map, but the second 'm' is shared.

So, removing one 'm' can break two "map"s.

But in this string, it's "mapmapmapmapmapmap", which is 18 characters.

So, groupings:

map map map map map map

Each "map" overlaps with the next one by one character.

To break each "map", I need to remove at least one character per "map".

But since they overlap, removing one 'm' can break two "map"s.

So, for example, removing every second 'm' should break all "map"s.

Wait, let's see:

Original: m a p m a p m a p m a p m a p m a p m a p

Positions: 0 m

1 a

2 p

3 m

4 a

5 p

6 m

7 a

8 p

9 m

10 a

11 p

12 m

13 a

14 p

15 m

16 a

17 p

If I remove positions 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15:

Remaining: a p m a p m a p m a p m a p m a p

Now, check for "map":

Looking at positions 1-3: a p m → not "map"

Positions 2-4: p m a → not "map"

And so on, no "map" present.

Also, no "pie" present.

So, removed 6 characters, which matches the example output.

Fifth test case:

n = 1

s = "p"

No "map" or "pie", so output 0.

Sixth test case:

n = 11

s = "pppiepieeee"

Looking for "pie" or "map".

"pppiepieeee"

Looking at positions 2-4: p i e → "pie" → ugly

Looking at positions 5-7: p i e → "pie" → ugly

So, two "pie"s.

To make it beautiful, need to remove at least two characters.

For example, remove the 'p's from both "pie"s:

Remove positions 2 and 5:

Remaining: p p e i e e e

No "pie" or "map" present.

So, output is 2, matching the example.

From these examples, it seems that the number of deletions required is equal to the number of overlapping "map" or "pie" substrings.

But, in cases where removing one character can break multiple substrings, the actual number of deletions might be less than the number of occurrences.

However, in the examples provided, it seems that removing one character per substring is sufficient, especially when substrings don't overlap.

But in the fourth test case, "mapmapmapmapmapmap", the "map"s overlap, and removing one character can break two "map"s.

So, in such cases, the number of deletions is less than the number of "map"s.

Wait, in that case, there are 6 "map"s, but by removing 3 'm's, I could break all of them.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, the example output is 6, but according to that, removing 3 'm's should be enough.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the overlapping.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, the output is 6, which suggests that removing one character per "map" is necessary, even if they overlap.

But intuitively, removing one character can break multiple overlapping "map"s.

So, perhaps the provided program is not optimal.

Wait, let's look back at the provided program.

The program iterates through the string, checking for "map" or "pie" substrings, and whenever it finds one, it skips the next three characters and increments the answer by one.

So, in the fourth test case, it would find "map" at positions 0-2, skip to position 3, then find another "map" at positions 3-5, skip to position 6, and so on, totaling 6 deletions.

But, as I thought earlier, removing one 'm' can break two "map"s.

So, is the program correct?

In the first test case, "mmapnapie", the program would find "map" at positions 2-4, skip to position 5, then find "pie" at positions 7-9, skip to position 10, total deletions 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case, "azabazapi", no "map" or "pie", so deletions 0.

Third test case, "mappppie", finds "map" at positions 0-2, skip to 3, then "pie" at positions 5-7, skip to 8, deletions 2.

Fourth test case, "mapmapmapmapmapmap", finds "map" at positions 0-2, skip to 3, finds "map" at 3-5, skip to 6, and so on, total 6 deletions.

But, is there a way to make it beautiful with fewer deletions?

Wait, in the fourth test case, if I remove every second 'm', as I did earlier, removing positions 0,3,6,9,12,15, which is 6 deletions, matching the program's output.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to choose which characters to remove to minimize the deletions.

However, given the constraints of time and the fact that the problem asks for the minimum number of deletions, and the program seems to provide correct outputs for the examples, it might be correct.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the overlapping cases.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to keep as many characters as possible, removing the minimum number necessary to eliminate all "map" and "pie" substrings.

I can think of this as finding the longest subsequence of the string that does not contain "map" or "pie".

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can iterate through the string and keep track of whether adding the current character would create a "map" or "pie" substring.

If it does, I skip that character, incrementing the deletion count.

But handling overlapping substrings is tricky.

The provided program's approach is simpler: whenever it finds "map" or "pie", it skips the next three characters and counts one deletion.

This seems to work for non-overlapping or fully overlapping cases, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the string is "mapmap".

According to the program:

- Check positions 0-2: "map" → delete one, skip to position 3.

- Check positions 3-5: "map" → delete one, skip to position 6.

- Total deletions: 2.

But, in reality, removing one 'm' can break both "map"s.

For example, remove position 2 ('p'), resulting in "mamap".

Now, check for "map" or "pie":

"mamap" → no "map", no "pie".

So, only one deletion is needed, but the program outputs 2.

This suggests that the program is not optimal in some cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't always find the minimum number of deletions.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
