Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to sort it in non-descending order. That means I want all the 0s to come before all the 1s. To do this, I can perform operations where I choose any substring of the string and perform a cyclic shift on it. A cyclic shift means I take the last character of the substring and move it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. Each operation costs the length of the substring I choose.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what it means to sort the string. For a binary string, sorting in non-descending order means all 0s should be at the beginning and all 1s at the end. So, essentially, I need to move all the 1s that are before any 0s to the end of the string.

Now, let's think about how to achieve this with the given operations. Each operation allows me to cyclically shift any substring, and the cost is the length of that substring.

I need to find a strategy that minimizes the total cost. Cost is directly proportional to the length of the substrings I choose for shifting. So, to minimize cost, I should try to perform shifts on the smallest possible substrings.

Wait, but if I can choose any substring, maybe there's a way to shift multiple characters at once in a way that helps me achieve the sorting with fewer operations or with smaller substrings.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case: "10"

I need to sort it to "01". I can choose the entire substring "10" and perform a cyclic shift, which would turn it into "01". The cost is 2 (since the length is 2). That matches the first output in the example.

Another test case: "0000"

It's already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

Third test case: "11000"

According to the note, one optimal way is:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011" (string becomes "01100")

2. Choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011" (string becomes "00110")

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011" (string becomes "00011")

Total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

But is there a better way? Let's see.

Alternatively, I could choose the entire substring "11000" and perform cyclic shifts multiple times, but that would cost 5 each time, which is higher than 3. So, breaking it down into smaller substrings seems better.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to do this.

Let me think differently. Since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, maybe I can model this as moving certain characters to their desired positions with some cost.

In particular, I need to move all the 1s that are before any 0s to the end of the string.

So, in "11000", there are two 1s before the 0s, and three 0s. To move each of the 1s to the end, I need to shift them past all the 0s.

But how does that relate to the cost?

Wait, maybe each 1 that needs to be moved past k 0s costs k.

So, in "11000", there are two 1s that need to be moved past three 0s.

So, total cost would be 3 + 3 = 6.

But in the note, it's showing a cost of 9. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions and how the shifts affect the positions.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have a string s of length n.

I need to move all the 1s that are before any 0s to the end.

So, I need to find the positions where 1s are present before the first 0.

Once I have those positions, I need to move those 1s to the end.

Each such move can be done by performing a cyclic shift on the substring that includes the 1 and all the 0s after it.

The cost would be the length of that substring.

But perhaps there is a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of 1s that need to be moved and the number of 0s they need to be moved past.

In "11000", there are two 1s before the three 0s. So, for each 1, moving it past three 0s would cost 3.

Total cost would be 6.

But in the note, they performed three operations, each costing 3, for a total of 9.

So, my approach seems better.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let's see.

If I have "11000", I can choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "00110".

Then, choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 9.

But in my approach, I thought of moving each 1 past the 0s.

So, for the first 1, move it past three 0s, costing 3.

For the second 1, also move it past three 0s, costing another 3.

Total cost 6.

But according to the note, it's 9.

Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps moving a 1 past the 0s requires more operations than I thought.

Let me try to simulate moving a single 1 past three 0s.

Starting with "1000".

To move the 1 to the end:

Operation 1: Choose substring [1,2]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Now, string is "0100".

Operation 2: Choose substring [2,3]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Now, string is "0010".

Operation 3: Choose substring [3,4]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Total cost 6.

Final string is "0001".

So, to move one 1 past three 0s, it costs 6.

Similarly, in "11000", moving each 1 past three 0s would cost 6 per 1, totaling 12.

But in the note, they did it in three operations costing 3 each, totaling 9.

Wait, but in my simulation, it costed 6 for one 1.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way to move multiple 1s at once.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have "11000".

I can choose the entire substring [1,5]: "11000" and perform a cyclic shift: "01100", costing 5.

Now, string is "01100".

Then, choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Then, choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

But in the note, it's 9.

So, perhaps choosing smaller substrings is better.

Wait, maybe choosing substring [1,3], [2,4], and [3,5] as in the note.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me look at the positions of 1s and 0s.

In "11000", I have two 1s followed by three 0s.

To sort it, I need to move both 1s to the end.

Each 1 needs to be moved past three 0s.

If I move one 1 at a time, each would cost 3 operations of shifting past each 0.

But in the note, they performed three shifts of substrings of length 3.

Wait, maybe the cost is not directly related to the number of positions each 1 needs to move, but to the operations I perform.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inversions.

In a sorted string, all 0s are before 1s.

So, any 1 that is before a 0 is out of place.

I need to move those 1s to the end.

Each such 1 needs to be moved past all the 0s that come after it.

Each move can be thought of as swapping positions with a 0, but in reality, I'm performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in sorting problems, sometimes the minimum number of operations is related to the number of inversions or other similar metrics.

But here, since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, perhaps there's a way to model this as reversing substrings or something similar.

Wait, but it's not reversal; it's a cyclic shift.

So, maybe I need to think in terms of permutation cycles or something.

This seems too abstract.

Let me try to find a general formula or pattern.

Looking at the example:

- "10" costs 2.

- "0000" costs 0.

- "11000" costs 9.

- "101011" costs 5.

- "01101001" costs 11.

I need to find a way to calculate this cost based on the positions of 1s and 0s.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum, for each 1 that needs to be moved, of the number of 0s after it.

In "10", there is one 1 before the 0, and one 0 after it, so cost is 2.

Wait, no, "10" has one 1 before one 0, so number of 0s after it is one, but the cost is 2.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the number of positions it needs to move times some factor.

In "10", the 1 needs to move one position to the right, and the cost is 2.

Wait, maybe the cost is the length of the substring that includes the 1 and all the 0s after it.

In "10", substring is "10", length 2, cost 2.

In "11000", substring [1,3]: "110", length 3, cost 3.

Then, substring [2,4]: "100", length 3, cost 3.

Then, substring [3,5]: "000", length 3, cost 3.

Total 9.

But in my earlier simulation, I had higher costs.

So perhaps the optimal way is to choose substrings that cover multiple 1s and 0s at once.

Wait, but in "11000", choosing [1,3], [2,4], and [3,5] leads to total cost 9.

Is there a better way?

Let's see.

If I choose [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

Then [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Then [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Total 11.

Not better than 9.

Alternatively, choose [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Then [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Total 8.

Better than 9.

But in the note, it's 9.

So maybe 8 is possible.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 9 for "11000".

Hmm, perhaps the note is not showing the minimal possible.

But the problem says "one of the optimal strategies", so perhaps 9 is one optimal cost, but 8 is even better.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

If I choose [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Now string is "01100".

Then choose [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Now string is "00110".

Then choose [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Total cost 4 + 4 + 3 = 11.

Wait, that's higher than 9.

So perhaps choosing smaller substrings is better.

Wait, maybe choosing [1,3], [2,4], and [3,5] is better.

Wait, but in that case, it's three operations of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

So, perhaps 9 is the minimal cost.

But in my earlier attempt, I thought of moving each 1 past the 0s, which would cost 3 per 1, totaling 6.

But practically, it seems to cost more.

So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string and count the number of 1s that are before any 0s.

Then, for each such 1, I need to move it past all the 0s that come after it.

The cost for moving one 1 past k 0s could be k.

So, total cost would be the sum over all such 1s of the number of 0s after them.

In "11000", there are two 1s before three 0s.

So, total cost would be 3 + 3 = 6.

But in practice, it seems to cost more.

Wait, maybe the cost is not directly equal to the number of 0s after each 1, but to the operations needed to move them.

Perhaps I need to group the movements.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of inversions, where each 1 before a 0 is an inversion, and each operation can reduce a certain number of inversions.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at another example.

Take "101011".

According to the example, the cost is 5.

Let's see.

In "101011", the sorted string should be "001111".

So, I need to move the 1s before the 0s to the end.

Specifically, the first 1 is before three 0s, the second 1 is before two 0s, the third 1 is before one 0, and the fourth 1 doesn't need to move.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's count the number of 1s that are before any 0s.

In "101011", the positions of 1s are at 1,3,5,6, and 0s are at 2 and 4.

So, the first 1 is before two 0s (at positions 2 and 4).

The second 1 is before one 0 (at position 4).

The third 1 is before one 0 (at position 4).

The fourth 1 is after all 0s, so it doesn't need to move.

So, total cost would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

But in the example, it's 5.

So, perhaps my calculation is incorrect.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that moving one 1 affects the positions of other 1s.

For example, when I move the first 1 past the two 0s, the positions of the other 1s might change.

So, perhaps the total cost isn't just the sum of individual movements.

This is getting tricky.

Let me think about a general algorithm.

Suppose I keep track of the positions of 0s and 1s.

I can iterate from left to right and count the number of 1s before the first 0.

Each of these 1s needs to be moved past all the 0s that come after them.

So, for each 1 before the first 0, the cost is the number of 0s.

For 1s after the first 0 but before the last 0, the cost is the number of 0s to their right.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the number of inversions where a 1 appears before a 0.

Each such inversion needs to be resolved by moving the 1 past the 0.

Each move can resolve multiple inversions at once.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in bubble sort, the number of swaps needed is equal to the number of inversions.

But here, each operation can affect multiple inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

But in our case, the cost isn、t just the number of operations, but the sum of the lengths of the substrings chosen.

So, perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe I can model this as the minimum cost to transform the string into a sorted one, where the cost is the sum of the lengths of the substrings chosen for shifts.

But I need a way to calculate this efficiently.

Given the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and individual string lengths up to 2*10^5, with a total of 2*10^5 characters across all test cases, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost in linear time.

Let me consider the positions of 1s and 0s.

I need to move all the 1s that are before any 0s to the end.

So, I can find the prefix of 1s before the first 0, and count how many 1s are there.

Then, for each of these 1s, I need to move it past all the 0s.

But as I move one 1, it might affect the positions of other 1s.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as the number of 1s that need to be moved multiplied by the number of 0s.

But in the earlier example, that would be 2 * 3 = 6, but the note shows 9.

So, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions of the 1s and the 0s and calculate the cost based on their distances.

But that seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the operations differently.

Each cyclic shift operation allows me to move the last character of the chosen substring to the front of the substring.

This is similar to rotating the substring by one position.

I can perform this operation multiple times on the same substring.

Wait, but it's not immediately clear how to use this to move 1s to the end efficiently.

Maybe I need to consider that each cyclic shift can be used to move a 1 past a 0.

For example, if I have "10", shifting it cyclically gives "01", which moves the 1 past one 0.

Similarly, in "11000", shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which moves one 1 past one 0.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", moving another 1 past one 0.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving another 1 past one 0.

But in reality, in "11000", there are two 1s that need to be moved past three 0s.

So, why does this approach cost 9, while moving each 1 past three 0s should cost 3 per 1, totaling 6?

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps each cyclic shift can only move one 1 past one 0.

In "11000", to move one 1 past three 0s, I need to perform three shifts: first shift moves it past one 0, costing 2, then another shift moves it past another 0, costing 2, and so on, totaling 6 for one 1.

Similarly, for the second 1, another 6.

But in the note, they did three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Suppose I iterate through the string and count the number of 1s before the first 0.

Each of these 1s needs to be moved past all the 0s.

So, for each such 1, the cost is equal to the number of 0s.

But in practice, performing shifts might not allow me to move multiple 1s at once efficiently.

Perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of 1s before the first 0 multiplied by the number of 0s.

In "11000", there are two 1s before the first 0 and three 0s, so cost is 2 * 3 = 6.

But in the note, it's 9.

Wait, maybe that's just one possible way, and there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is equal to the number of inversions divided by the average number of inversions resolved per operation.

But this is too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in problems involving sorting with block reversals or rotations, the minimal number of operations can often be determined by counting the number of "blocks" or "runs".

But in this problem, since we're dealing with cyclic shifts, it might be different.

Wait, maybe I can model this as reversing substrings, since a cyclic shift can be equivalent to a reversal in some cases.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the cost differently.

Suppose I have a substring of length k that contains m 1s and k - m 0s.

When I perform a cyclic shift on this substring, I'm moving the last character to the front.

In terms of sorting, this might help me move some 1s past some 0s.

But it's not clear how to optimize this.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Sample inputs:

1. "10" -> cost 2

2. "0000" -> cost 0

3. "11000" -> cost 9

4. "101011" -> cost 5

5. "01101001" -> cost 11

Is there a formula that can generate these costs based on the strings?

Looking at "10": one 1 before one 0, cost 2.

"11000": two 1s before three 0s, cost 9.

"101011": two 1s before two 0s, cost 5.

"01101001": three 1s before four 0s, cost 11.

Wait, perhaps the cost is (number of 1s before the first 0) * (number of 0s) + (number of 1s between the first and last 0) * (number of 0s after them) + ...

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the left and keep track of the number of 1s encountered before each 0, and for each such 1, add the number of 0s after it to the total cost.

In "11000":

- There are two 1s before the first 0.

- There are three 0s after them.

- So, for each of the two 1s, the cost is three.

- Total cost: 6.

But in the note, it's 9.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe for each 1 that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of 0s plus something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is equal to the number of positions each 1 needs to move.

In "11000", each 1 needs to be moved three positions to the right (past three 0s).

So, 2 * 3 = 6.

But again, the note shows 9.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the operations aren't independent.

Perhaps performing one operation affects the positions of other 1s, thereby increasing the total cost.

In that case, the actual cost might be higher than just the sum of individual movements.

Hence, the cost might be higher than 6 in "11000".

But in the note, it's 9, which is 3 operations of cost 3 each.

So, perhaps there's a way to calculate the minimal number of operations required and then compute the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the lengths of the substrings chosen in the operations.

So, if I can choose operations that cover multiple 1s and 0s in larger substrings, I might be able to reduce the total cost.

But in practice, it seems choosing smaller substrings leads to lower costs.

Wait, in "11000", choosing three substrings of length 3 costs 9, while choosing one substring of length 5 costs 5, but then additional operations are needed.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is achieved by choosing the smallest possible substrings that allow moving the 1s past the 0s.

But in practice, it seems that choosing larger substrings might cover more movements in a single operation.

Wait, maybe I need to find a way to cover all the 1s that need to be moved in as few operations as possible, preferably covering multiple 1s in one operation.

But in "11000", choosing [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which moves one 1 past one 0.

Then, [2,4]: "110" -> "011", moving another 1 past one 0.

Then, [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving another 1 past one 0.

But in this case, there are only two 1s that need to be moved, so perhaps the extra operation is unnecessary.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that moving a 1 past a 0 requires a shift that includes that 1 and the 0 it's being moved past.

So, for each 1 that needs to be moved past a 0, I need to perform a shift that includes both the 1 and the 0.

In "11000", to move the first 1 past the first 0, I can choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, to move the second 1 past the remaining two 0s, I need to perform two more operations: choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3; then [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 9.

So, in this case, moving each 1 past the 0s requires multiple operations, leading to a higher total cost.

Hence, the minimal cost isn't just the number of 1s multiplied by the number of 0s, but rather the number of 1s multiplied by the number of 0s each needs to be moved past, considering the operations needed to achieve that.

This seems consistent with the note.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is indeed 9 for "11000", not 6 as I initially thought.

Therefore, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

So, how do I generalize this?

For each 1 that needs to be moved, I need to perform as many operations as there are 0s it needs to be moved past.

Each operation costs the length of the substring chosen.

In "11000", for each 1, there are three 0s to move past, so for each 1, I need to perform three operations of cost 3 each.

Wait, no, in the note, they performed three operations of cost 3 each for two 1s moving past three 0s.

Wait, perhaps it's not directly proportional.

I need a better way to calculate this.

Let me consider that each operation can move one 1 past one 0, and costs the length of the substring that includes both the 1 and the 0.

In "11000", to move one 1 past one 0, I can choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Similarly, to move another 1 past one 0, choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

And so on.

Hence, for two 1s moving past three 0s, it costs 3 per movement, totaling 9.

So, perhaps the cost is the number of 1s that need to be moved multiplied by the number of positions they need to move, with each position movement costing the length of the substring that includes the 1 and the 0 it's being moved past.

In this case, moving past one 0 costs 3, moving past two 0s costs 6, and so on.

But in "11000", to move a 1 past three 0s, it would cost 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the note.

Hence, for two 1s, it would be 9.

So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and the minimal cost is indeed 9.

Therefore, perhaps the general formula is: for each 1 that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of 0s after it multiplied by the position it needs to move.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the number of 1s that need to be moved past each 0.

So, for each 0, count the number of 1s before it, and add the number of positions it needs to be moved.

Wait, perhaps for each 0, add the number of 1s before it multiplied by the number of positions it needs to move.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in problems involving sorting with reversals, the reversal distance is used to determine the minimal number of operations needed.

But in this problem, since operations are cyclic shifts on substrings, it's different.

Perhaps I need to model this as a series of transpositions or block moves.

But this seems too complex.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that finding an optimal solution is non-trivial and look for a heuristic that provides a good enough cost, even if not minimal in all cases.

But the problem asks for the minimal total cost.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is incorrect and look for an alternative way to calculate the cost.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- "10" -> 2

- "0000" -> 0

- "11000" -> 9

- "101011" -> 5

- "01101001" -> 11

Is there a pattern or formula that can generate these outputs based on the strings?

Looking at "10": one 1 before one 0, cost 2.

"11000": two 1s before three 0s, cost 9.

"101011": two 1s before two 0s, cost 5.

"01101001": three 1s before four 0s, cost 11.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum over all 1s before the first 0 of (number of 0s * length of the prefix up to that 1).

But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s before each 0 multiplied by the position of the 0.

Still too vague.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each 1 that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of 0s after it plus one.

Wait, in "11000", two 1s need to be moved past three 0s, so cost per 1 is 3, total 6.

But sample output is 9.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of 0s after each 1 plus the number of 1s before it.

No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm going in circles here.

Perhaps I need to consider that each cyclic shift can resolve multiple inversions at once.

Hence, the minimal cost would be less than the sum of individual movements.

But in practice, in "11000", it's costing 9, which is higher than 6.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the number of inversions multiplied by some factor.

In "11000", there are six inversions (each 1 before each of the three 0s): 2 * 3 = 6.

But the sample output is 9.

Hence, not directly proportional.

This is confusing.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that finding the minimal cost is complex and look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the number of 1s before the first 0 multiplied by the number of 0s.

In "11000", that would be 2 * 3 = 6, but sample output is 9.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the square of the number of 1s before the first 0 multiplied by the number of 0s.

No, that doesn't make sense.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each 1 that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of 0s plus the number of 1s before it.

Wait, in "11000", for the first 1, cost is 3 + 1 = 4; for the second 1, cost is 3 + 1 = 4; total 8.

Still not matching the sample output of 9.

This isn't working.

Perhaps I need to consider that each operation can only affect a certain number of inversions, and I need to divide the total inversions by that number to get the number of operations.

But this is too vague.

Given the time I've spent on this, perhaps I need to look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all 1s before the first 0 of the number of 0s plus the number of 1s after it.

But this seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is equal to the number of 1s before the first 0 multiplied by the number of 0s plus the number of 1s after the first 0.

In "11000", that would be 2 * 3 + 0 = 6, but sample output is 9.

Still not matching.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy altogether.

Let me consider that the cost is equal to the number of operations needed to move all the 1s past the 0s, with each operation moving a group of 1s past a group of 0s.

In "11000", I can choose to move both 1s past all three 0s in one operation, but the cost would be 5.

Alternatively, move one 1 past three 0s in three operations of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

Hence, choosing larger substrings might be more cost-effective.

Wait, but in "11000", choosing [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Then, choosing [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Then, choosing [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 11.

But in the note, it's 9
