Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent. Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people. Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My task is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or output -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and preferences clearly.

- Introverts: Each needs a tent alone. So, the number of tents required for introverts is exactly 'a'.

- Extroverts: Each needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, for 'b' extroverts, we need tents that have three people each, and extroverts must be in these tents.

- Universals: They can adapt to any situation, so they can be placed in tents alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The goal is to minimize the total number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, allocate tents for introverts since they need individual tents. So, the number of tents for introverts is 'a'.

Next, consider the extroverts. Since each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others, we need to form groups of three that include one extrovert and two others (which can be universals or other extroverts, but extroverts need to have exactly two others with them).

Wait, no. The problem says each extrovert wants a tent with two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people: the extrovert and two others. So, for 'b' extroverts, we need to have 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

But hold on, that seems contradictory. If each extrovert needs a tent with two others, does that mean each extrovert is in a separate tent with two others, or can multiple extroverts share the same tent as long as each has two others with them?

Wait, no, the problem says each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others, meaning each extrovert must be in a tent that has exactly three people: the extrovert plus two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

But, if we have multiple extroverts, can they share the same tent? Wait, if a tent can hold up to three people, and each extrovert needs a tent with exactly three people, then multiple extroverts cannot share the same tent because each extrovert needs their own tent with two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

Now, the universals can fill in the remaining spots in these tents or have their own tents if necessary.

So, the total number of tents would be the number of tents for introverts plus the number of tents for extroverts plus any additional tents needed for universals.

But we need to minimize the number of tents, so we should try to maximize the number of universals in the tents with extroverts.

Let me formalize this.

Total tents = tents for introverts + tents for extroverts + tents for universals.

Tents for introverts: 'a'

Tents for extroverts: 'b', each needing two others in the tent.

Tents for universals: depending on how many are left after filling the extroverts' tents.

Wait, let's think differently.

First, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents.

Then, allocate tents for extroverts: each extrovert needs a tent with two others. So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each containing one extrovert and two others.

The question is, who are these "two others"? They can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but if an extrovert needs a tent with two others, and those two others can be extroverts or universals, then we need to make sure that in each extrovert's tent, there are exactly two non-extroverts (universals or other extroverts).

Wait, no. If an extrovert needs a tent with two others, those "others" can be anyone except themselves.

But, if we have multiple extroverts, can their "others" overlap?

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself.

Let me think in terms of grouping.

Each extrovert needs to be in a group of exactly three people, including themselves and two others.

So, each extrovert needs a group of three: themselves plus two others.

Similarly, universals can be in groups of one, two, or three.

Introverts must be in groups of one.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of people per tent.

First, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents, each with one introvert.

Then, for extroverts, since each needs a tent with exactly three people, including themselves, we need to pair each extrovert with two others.

These "others" can be universals or other extroverts.

But if we have multiple extroverts, and each needs two others in their tent, we need to make sure that the "others" are appropriately assigned.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I should look at the total number of "slots" needed for extroverts.

Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly three people: the extrovert plus two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each with three people: one extrovert and two others.

The "others" can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but if an extrovert is in a tent with two others, and those others are also extroverts, then those other extroverts would also need their own tents with two others, and so on.

This seems like it could lead to overcounting or circular dependencies.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of universals available to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

Let me try to formalize this.

Total number of people needed to accompany extroverts: 2*b (since each extrovert needs two others in their tent).

These "others" can be universals or other extroverts.

But, if an extrovert is in a tent with two other extroverts, then each of those extroverts would also need two others in their tents, leading to a cycle.

So, perhaps extroverts should not be placed in tents with other extroverts.

Let me consider that extroverts should be in tents with universals only.

So, for each extrovert, their tent should consist of one extrovert and two universals.

In this case, the number of universals needed is 2*b.

If c >= 2*b, then we can allocate 'b' tents for extroverts, each with one extrovert and two universals.

Then, the remaining universals can be allocated to their own tents.

In this case, the total number of tents would be:

a (for introverts) + b (for extroverts) + ceil((c - 2*b)/3) (for remaining universals).

But, this might not be the minimal number of tents, because universals can share tents with each other or with extroverts.

Wait, but if I allocate extroverts only with universals, that might not be minimal.

Maybe it's better to have some extroverts share tents with other extroverts.

Wait, but earlier I thought that might lead to circular dependencies.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I group extroverts in groups of three: one extrovert and two others.

Wait, no, each extrovert needs their own tent with two others.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how many "extra people" are needed to satisfy the extroverts.

Each extrovert needs two others in their tent.

So, total "other" slots needed are 2*b.

These "other" slots can be filled by universals or by extroverts.

But, if an extrovert is filling another extrovert's "other" slot, then that extrovert also needs their own tent with two others.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should consider the net number of universals needed.

Let's say that each extrovert needs two "other" slots, which can be filled by universals or by other extroverts.

But, each extrovert who is filling another extrovert's "other" slot is also needing their own "other" slots.

This seems like a system of dependencies that might not resolve easily.

Perhaps it's better to consider that extroverts should not share tents with other extroverts, to avoid these complications.

So, if extroverts are only paired with universals, then the number of universals needed is 2*b.

If c >= 2*b, then we can allocate 'b' tents for extroverts, each with one extrovert and two universals, and the remaining universals can be allocated to their own tents.

Total tents would be a + b + ceil((c - 2*b)/3).

But, perhaps there is a better way to minimize the number of tents by having universals share tents with extroverts in a more optimized way.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the remainder when dividing the number of universals by 3.

But, I need to ensure that extroverts' requirements are met first.

Let me consider that to satisfy 'b' extroverts, I need 'b' tents, each requiring two additional people.

So, total additional people needed: 2*b.

These additional people can be universals or extroverts.

But, if I use extroverts as additional people, those extroverts also need their own tents with two others.

This seems like a recursive dependency that could be tricky to handle.

Perhaps it's simpler to consider that extroverts should not share tents with other extroverts, to avoid this complexity.

So, if extroverts are only paired with universals, then the number of universals needed is 2*b.

If c >= 2*b, then we can allocate 'b' tents for extroverts, each with one extrovert and two universals, and the remaining universals (c - 2*b) can be allocated to tents, either alone, in pairs, or triples.

The minimal number of tents for the remaining universals would be ceil((c - 2*b)/3).

Therefore, total tents = a (introverts) + b (extroverts) + ceil((c - 2*b)/3).

But, if c < 2*b, then we need to see if we can use some extroverts to fill in as "others" for other extroverts.

Wait, but that might not work, because each extrovert needs their own tent with two others.

It's getting confusing.

Maybe I should look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals.

According to the explanation, they use 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for two extroverts and one universal, and 1 tent for the remaining two universals. Total 3 tents.

Wait, but according to my earlier approach, for 2 extroverts, I would need 2*2=4 universals, but here there are only 3 universals, which seems insufficient.

But in the example, they managed to do it with 3 tents.

How?

Oh, wait, in the first tent: 1 extrovert + 2 universals.

In the second tent: 1 extrovert + 1 universal + 1 universal.

But that would require 2 extroverts and 4 universals, but there are only 3 universals.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, maybe in the first tent: 1 extrovert + 2 universals.

In the second tent: 1 extrovert + 1 universal + 1 universal.

But that would require 2 extroverts and 4 universals, but there are only 3 universals.

Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe they are sharing extroverts.

Wait, perhaps one extrovert shares a tent with another extrovert and a universal.

But then, each extrovert in that tent has two others: the other extrovert and the universal.

But, does that satisfy the condition?

Wait, the problem says each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others, meaning the tent must contain exactly three people: the extrovert and two others.

So, if a tent has two extroverts and one universal, does that satisfy both extroverts' preferences?

Wait, each extrovert in that tent has two others: the other extrovert and the universal.

So, yes, it satisfies the condition for both extroverts.

So, in this case, with 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 3 universals:

- Tent 1: 1 introvert.

- Tent 2: 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

- Tent 3: 2 universals.

Total 3 tents.

That makes sense.

So, in this scenario, extroverts are sharing tents with other extroverts.

So, my earlier assumption that extroverts should not share tents with other extroverts is incorrect.

They can share tents with other extroverts, as long as each tent has exactly three people: one extrovert and two others, or two extroverts and one other.

Wait, but in the tent with two extroverts and one universal, each extrovert has two others: the other extrovert and the universal.

So, it satisfies the condition for both extroverts.

Good.

So, now I need to generalize this.

Given 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals, I need to form tents with exactly three people, each containing at least one extrovert, and the rest can be universals or other extroverts.

The number of such tents needed is ceil(b / 1), but since each tent can have up to two extroverts, perhaps it's floor(b / 2).

Wait, no.

Wait, each tent can have up to three people, including up to two extroverts.

So, the number of tents needed for 'b' extroverts is ceil(b / 2), because each tent can accommodate up to two extroverts.

But, in each tent with extroverts, the number of universals needed is 3 - number of extroverts in that tent.

So, for each tent with two extroverts, we need one universal.

For each tent with one extrovert, we need two universals.

So, total universals needed would be: for tents with two extroverts, one universal per tent; for tents with one extrovert, two universals per tent.

Let me formalize this.

Let's say we have 'b' extroverts.

We can group them into tents of up to two extroverts per tent.

- If 'b' is even, we have b/2 tents, each with two extroverts and one universal.

- If 'b' is odd, we have floor(b/2) tents with two extroverts and one universal, and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

So, total universals needed:

If 'b' is even: b/2 * 1 = b/2 universals.

If 'b' is odd: floor(b/2) * 1 + 2 = (b-1)/2 + 2 = (b-1 + 4)/2 = (b + 3)/2 universals.

Wait, let's check:

For b even: b/2 tents, each with 1 universal → b/2 universals.

For b odd: (b-1)/2 tents with 1 universal + 1 tent with 2 universals → (b-1)/2 + 2 = (b-1 + 4)/2 = (b + 3)/2 universals.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, total universals needed are:

If b is even: b/2

If b is odd: (b + 1)/2

Wait, wait.

Wait, for b even: b/2 universals.

For b odd: (b-1)/2 * 1 + 2 = (b-1)/2 + 2 = (b - 1 + 4)/2 = (b + 3)/2.

Wait, but (b + 1)/2 is different from (b + 3)/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me re-express.

For b even:

Tents with extroverts: b/2 tents, each with two extroverts and one universal.

Total universals needed: b/2.

For b odd:

Number of tents with two extroverts: floor(b/2) = (b-1)/2.

Number of tents with one extrovert: 1.

Total universals needed: (b-1)/2 * 1 + 2 * 1 = (b-1)/2 + 2 = (b - 1 + 4)/2 = (b + 3)/2.

Alternatively, for b odd, (b + 1)/2 would be the number of tents needed if each tent could have up to three people, but in this case, it's different.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to calculate the universals needed.

Let me think in terms of the remainder when b is divided by 2.

Total universals needed for extroverts' tents:

For each tent with two extroverts, need one universal.

For each tent with one extrovert, need two universals.

Number of tents with two extroverts: floor(b / 2).

Number of tents with one extrovert: b % 2.

Total universals needed: floor(b / 2) * 1 + (b % 2) * 2.

Simplify:

If b is even: floor(b / 2) * 1 + 0 * 2 = b / 2.

If b is odd: floor(b / 2) * 1 + 1 * 2 = (b - 1)/2 + 2 = (b - 1 + 4)/2 = (b + 3)/2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should be (b + 1)/2, but according to this, it's (b + 3)/2.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify with an example.

Take b = 1:

floor(1 / 2) * 1 + (1 % 2) * 2 = 0 * 1 + 1 * 2 = 2.

Which matches (1 + 3)/2 = 2.

b = 2:

floor(2 / 2) * 1 + (2 % 2) * 2 = 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 = 1.

Which matches (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5, but floor(2.5) is not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, (b + 3)/2 seems to be matching for both even and odd b.

Wait, for b = 2: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5, which is not an integer, but we need 1 universal.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to use ceiling or floor functions.

Wait, perhaps total universals needed is ceil(2*b / 3).

Wait, for b = 1: ceil(2/3) = 1, but earlier calculation shows 2 universals needed.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a formula that gives:

For b = 0: 0

b = 1: 2

b = 2: 1

b = 3: 1

b = 4: 2

Wait, for b = 3: floor(3 / 2) * 1 + (3 % 2) * 2 = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 = 3 universals.

But according to earlier logic, for b = 3, we can have one tent with three extroverts, needing 3 - 1 = 2 universals? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly three people: the extrovert plus two others.

These "others" can be universals or other extroverts.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need to form tents of three people, each containing at least one extrovert.

The minimal number of tents required for 'b' extroverts is ceil(b / 2), because each tent can contain up to two extroverts.

Then, for each tent with two extroverts, we need one universal.

For each tent with one extrovert, we need two universals.

So, total universals needed = (number of tents with two extroverts) * 1 + (number of tents with one extrovert) * 2.

Where:

Number of tents with two extroverts = floor(b / 2)

Number of tents with one extrovert = b % 2

Therefore, total universals needed = floor(b / 2) * 1 + (b % 2) * 2 = floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)

Simplify:

= floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)

For b even: floor(b / 2) + 0 = b / 2

For b odd: floor(b / 2) + 2 = (b - 1)/2 + 2 = (b + 3)/2

Wait, but earlier I thought for b = 1, universals needed = 2, which matches (1 + 3)/2 = 2.

For b = 2, universals needed = 1, which is floor(2 / 2) + 0 = 1.

For b = 3, universals needed = floor(3 / 2) + 2 * (3 % 2) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3.

But according to the earlier example, for b = 3 and c = 0, it should be impossible, but according to this, universals needed = 3, which would require c >= 3.

But if c >= 3, then it's possible.

Wait, but in reality, for b = 3 and c >= 3, it should be possible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, if it's impossible, output -1.

So, in this case, if c >= (floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)), then it's possible, else -1.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for b = 1, c >= 2.

For b = 2, c >= 1.

For b = 3, c >= 3.

Seems consistent.

So, the formula for minimum universals needed is floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2).

Alternatively, it can be expressed as ceil(2*b / 3), but I need to verify.

Wait, for b = 1: ceil(2/3) = 1, but according to earlier calculation, need 2 universals. So, not matching.

Hence, ceil(2*b / 3) is not the right formula.

Therefore, the correct formula for minimum universals needed is floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2).

Which simplifies to:

If b is even: b / 2

If b is odd: (b + 3)/2

Wait, for b = 1: (1 + 3)/2 = 2

For b = 2: 2 / 2 = 1

For b = 3: (3 + 3)/2 = 3

Yes, matches the earlier calculations.

So, total universals needed is:

u_needed = floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)

If c >= u_needed, then it's possible.

The total number of tents would be:

tents_for_introverts: a

tents_for_extroverts: ceil(b / 2)

tents_for_remaining_universals: ceil((c - u_needed) / 3)

Total tents: a + ceil(b / 2) + ceil((c - u_needed) / 3)

But need to make sure that c - u_needed >= 0.

If c < u_needed, then it's impossible, output -1.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for b = 1, c >= 2.

For b = 2, c >= 1.

For b = 3, c >= 3.

Which matches u_needed as floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2).

So, this seems correct.

Let me confirm with another example.

Take b = 4:

u_needed = floor(4 / 2) + 2 * (4 % 2) = 2 + 0 = 2

So, c >= 2 is needed.

With b = 4, extroverts can be grouped into two tents, each with two extroverts and one universal.

Total universals needed: 2.

Remaining universals: c - 2.

These can be grouped into ceil((c - 2)/3) tents.

Total tents: a + ceil(4 / 2) + ceil((c - 2)/3) = a + 2 + ceil((c - 2)/3)

Seems reasonable.

Another example: b = 5:

u_needed = floor(5 / 2) + 2 * (5 % 2) = 2 + 2 = 4

So, c >= 4 is needed.

Grouping: two tents with two extroverts and one universal (total 2 universals), and one tent with one extrovert and two universals (total 2 universals).

Total universals needed: 2 + 2 = 4.

Yes, matches the formula.

So, the formula seems correct.

Hence, the approach is:

1. Calculate u_needed = floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)

2. If c < u_needed, output -1

3. Else, calculate total tents as a + ceil(b / 2) + ceil((c - u_needed) / 3)

Now, looking at the given code:

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:

if extroverts % 3 != 0:

if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:

return None

return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:

ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)

return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

In func_1, it checks if extroverts % 3 != 0, and if so, checks if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3, then returns None.

Else, returns ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Then, func_2 adds introverts to this result, or returns -1 if func_1 returns None.

But according to my earlier reasoning, this seems incorrect.

In my reasoning, u_needed = floor(b / 2) + 2 * (b % 2)

Then, total tents = a + ceil(b / 2) + ceil((c - u_needed) / 3)

But in the given code, it's calculating ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3) and adding introverts.

This seems different.

Let me see.

In the first test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

According to my formula:

u_needed = floor(2 / 2) + 2 * (2 % 2) = 1 + 0 = 1

Since c = 3 >= 1, it's possible.

Total tents = 1 + ceil(2 / 2) + ceil((3 - 1)/3) = 1 + 1 + ceil(2/3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Which matches the sample output.

But according to the given code:

func_1(b, c) = ceil((2 + 3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Then, func_2 = a + ret = 1 + 2 = 3

Which also matches.

Another test case: a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

u_needed = floor(4 / 2) + 2 * (4 % 2) = 2 + 0 = 2

c = 1 < 2, so impossible, output -1

According to given code:

func_1(4,1):

4 % 3 != 0, and 4 % 3 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None

Then, func_2 = -1

Which matches.

Another test case: a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

u_needed = 2

c = 2 >= 2

Total tents = 1 + ceil(4 / 2) + ceil((2 - 2)/3) = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

According to given code:

func_1(4,2) = ceil((4 + 2)/3) = ceil(6/3) = 2

func_2 = 1 + 2 = 3

Which matches.

Another test case: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

u_needed = floor(1 / 2) + 2 * (1 % 2) = 0 + 2 = 2

c = 1 < 2, impossible, output -1

Given code:

func_1(1,1):

1 % 3 != 0, and 1 % 3 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None

func_2 = -1

Which matches.

Seems consistent so far.

Another test case: a = 1, b = 3, c = 2

u_needed = floor(3 / 2) + 2 * (3 % 2) = 1 + 2 = 3

c = 2 < 3, impossible, output -1

Given code:

func_1(3,2):

3 % 3 == 0, so return ceil((3 + 2)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

func_2 = 1 + 2 = 3

But according to my formula, it should be -1 since c < u_needed.

Wait, according to my formula, u_needed = 3 for b = 3, c = 2 < 3, so -1

But according to given code, it's 3.

Which is incorrect.

Hence, the given code is wrong in this case.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, the given code seems to be matching my formula in some cases but not in all.

Specifically, when b = 3 and c = 2, my formula says u_needed = 3, which is greater than c = 2, so -1.

But the given code returns a + ceil((b + c)/3) = 1 + ceil(5/3) = 1 + 2 = 3.

Which is incorrect, as per my formula.

But perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider the u_needed formula.

Let me think again.

For b extroverts, we need to form tents with exactly three people, each containing at least one extrovert.

Each tent can have:

- 1 extrovert and 2 universals

- 2 extroverts and 1 universal

- 3 extroverts and 0 universals (but not allowed, since extroverts need two others, which must be universals or other extroverts)

Wait, but if a tent has 3 extroverts, does that satisfy the condition?

Each extrovert in that tent has two others: the other two extroverts.

So, yes, it satisfies the condition.

Hence, for b extroverts, we can have tents with either:

- 1 extrovert + 2 universals

- 2 extroverts + 1 universal

- 3
