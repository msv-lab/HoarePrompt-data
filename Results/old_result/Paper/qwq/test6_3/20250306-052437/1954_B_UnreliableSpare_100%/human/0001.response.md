Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here.

We have an array that's called "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times, possibly zero. The operation allows us to choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and then replace a[i] with a[i-1].

So, the task is to take such a beautiful array and find the minimum number of elements we need to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, we should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. The definition says that by repeatedly replacing a[i] with a[i-1] whenever a[i-1] equals a[i+1], we can make all elements the same.

Let's consider some examples to grasp this.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 2, 2]

Output: -1

Explanation: No matter how many elements you remove, all remaining elements are the same, so it remains beautiful.

Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: By removing one element, say the last one, we get [1, 2, 1, 2], which cannot be made beautiful.

Example 3:

Input: [1]

Output: -1

Explanation: It's already not beautiful because you can't perform any operations, but according to the problem, single-element arrays might be considered beautiful or not. Wait, the problem says "the given array a is beautiful," so even single-element arrays are beautiful. Hence, removing the only element would make it empty, which might not be considered beautiful, but according to the problem, we should output -1 if it's impossible to make it not beautiful. So, for n=1, output -1.

Example 4:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]

Output: 3

Explanation: By removing the first three 3's, we get [5, 3, 3, 3], which cannot be made beautiful.

From these examples, it seems that if all elements are already the same, removing any number of elements won't make it not beautiful, hence output -1. If not all elements are the same, there might be a way to make it not beautiful by removing certain elements.

But wait, in the second example, even though not all elements are the same, removing one element makes it not beautiful. So, having all elements the same is a sufficient condition for being beautiful, but it's not necessarily the only configuration that's beautiful.

I need to think deeper about the property that makes an array beautiful.

Let's think about the operation allowed: choose an index i where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1 and a[i-1] == a[i+1], then replace a[i] with a[i-1].

This operation allows us to change a[i] to a[i-1] under the condition that a[i-1] equals a[i+1]. Essentially, we can propagate values through the array in a specific way.

If we have a sequence where a[i-1] == a[i+1], we can set a[i] to that value, and repeat this process until no more operations can be performed.

The goal is to make all elements equal by performing these operations as many times as needed.

So, for the array to be beautiful, it must be possible to make all elements equal by repeatedly applying this operation.

Now, the problem is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer possible to make all elements equal using these operations.

First, I need to understand what configurations make an array not beautiful.

If an array is such that no matter how you remove elements, you can still always make all elements equal using the operations, then the answer is -1.

Otherwise, find the minimum number of removals to reach a state where it's impossible to make all elements equal using the operations.

Let's consider some cases.

Case 1: All elements are already equal.

- No matter how many elements you remove, the remaining array will still be beautiful because you can make all elements equal without any operations.

- Hence, output -1.

Case 2: Not all elements are equal.

- We need to see if by removing certain elements, we can disrupt the ability to make all elements equal.

- Perhaps, by removing elements that allow the propagation of values, we can make the array not beautiful.

Let's think about how the operations work.

Suppose we have a sequence like [a, b, a]. Here, a == a, so we can replace b with a, making it [a, a, a].

Similarly, [a, b, a, b, a] can be transformed by replacing the second b with a, then the first b with a, resulting in [a, a, a, a, a].

It seems that if there are sequences where elements alternate or repeat in a certain pattern, we can use the operations to make all elements equal.

Perhaps, the key is to find the minimum number of removals to break the continuity that allows such propagations.

Another way to think about it is to look for the smallest number of removals that prevent the array from being reduced to a single value via the allowed operations.

Let me consider the array as a sequence and look for patterns that must be broken.

One approach could be to look for the minimum number of removals to make the array not consist of a single repeating value or to break the chains that allow the operations to propagate the values.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I need a different angle.

Let's consider that in order for an array to be beautiful, there must be a way to propagate a value through the array using the operations.

So, if the array is connected in a way that allows the propagation from one end to the other, then it's beautiful.

Hence, to make it not beautiful, we need to disconnect it in such a way that propagation is no longer possible.

This sounds similar to making the array disconnected in graph terms, where each element is a node and operations are edges.

Wait, perhaps modeling the array as a graph can help.

Let's think of the array as a graph where each index is a node, and there's an edge between nodes i and i+1 if a[i] == a[i+1].

In this graph, if the entire array can be made beautiful, meaning all a[i] can be made equal, it might correspond to the graph being connected in some way.

But I need to think carefully about this analogy.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of segments of the array where all elements are equal.

Let's partition the array into segments where all elements are the same.

For example, in [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1], the segments are [1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1].

Now, in order to make the entire array beautiful, meaning all elements equal, we need to be able to propagate values through these segments using the operations.

Wait, but the operations allow changing a[i] to a[i-1] only if a[i-1] == a[i+1].

So, if we have segments where the bordering elements are equal, we might be able to propagate values across them.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The reference solution seems to be checking if all elements are the same. If they are, it outputs -1, meaning it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of a segment where the value is equal to the first element, and outputs that as the minimum number of removals.

Wait, let's look at the code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

flag = True

for i in range(1, n):

if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:

flag = False

break

ans = Decimal('Infinity')

(val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == val:

cnt += 1

else:

ans = min(ans, cnt)

cnt = 0

ans = min(ans, cnt)

if flag:

print(-1)

else:

print(ans)

So, it first checks if all elements are equal. If they are, it sets flag to True and later prints -1.

If not all elements are equal, it initializes val to arr[0] and counts the maximum consecutive sequence of val.

Then, it iterates through the array, counting consecutive val and keeping track of the minimum cnt when it encounters a different element.

Wait, actually, in the code, it's keeping track of the minimum cnt when it encounters a different element, but I think there's a mistake in the reasoning.

Let me step through the code with an example.

Take the second example:

n = 5

arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]

flag will be set to False because arr[1] != arr[0].

Then, val = arr[0] = 1

cnt = 0

Iterate through the array:

i=0: arr[0]==1, cnt=1

i=1: arr[1]!=1, ans=min(inf,1), cnt=0

i=2: arr[2]==1, cnt=1

i=3: arr[3]!=1, ans=min(1,1), cnt=0

i=4: arr[4]==1, cnt=1

After loop, ans=min(1,1)=1

Print 1

Which matches the expected output.

Another example:

n=7

arr=[3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

flag=False because arr[3]!=arr[2]

val=3

cnt=0

i=0: arr[0]==3, cnt=1

i=1: arr[1]==3, cnt=2

i=2: arr[2]==3, cnt=3

i=3: arr[3]!=3, ans=min(inf,3), cnt=0

i=4: arr[4]==3, cnt=1

i=5: arr[5]==3, cnt=2

i=6: arr[6]==3, cnt=3

After loop, ans=min(3,3)=3

Print 3

Which matches the expected output.

Wait, but in the second example, the output is 1, which seems correct, but in the fourth example, it's 3, which also seems correct.

But is this logic generalizable?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=4, arr=[1,1,2,2]

flag=False because arr[2]!=arr[1]

val=1

cnt=0

i=0: arr[0]==1, cnt=1

i=1: arr[1]==1, cnt=2

i=2: arr[2]!=1, ans=min(inf,2), cnt=0

i=3: arr[3]!=1, ans=min(2,0), but cnt=0, so ans remains 2

After loop, ans=2

But what should be the correct answer?

If we remove 2 elements, say the first two, we get [2,2], which is beautiful.

Wait, but according to the logic, it would output 2, but [2,2] is still beautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, no, the goal is to make it not beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

In this case, removing one element might still leave it beautiful.

For example, removing arr[1], we get [1,2,2], which is still beautiful because we can replace the 1 with 2 (since 2==2), making it [2,2,2].

Removing arr[0], we get [1,2,2], same as above.

Removing arr[2], we get [1,1,2], which can be made beautiful by replacing the last 2 with 1.

Removing arr[3], we get [1,1,2], same as above.

So, in this case, no matter which single element you remove, the remaining array is still beautiful.

You need to remove at least two elements to make it not beautiful.

For example, removing arr[1] and arr[2], we get [1,2], which cannot be made beautiful.

Hence, the correct answer should be 2, which matches the logic's output.

Wait, but according to the code, ans=2, which is correct.

Another example: n=6, arr=[1,2,1,2,1,2]

flag=False because arr[1]!=arr[0]

val=1

cnt=0

i=0: arr[0]==1, cnt=1

i=1: arr[1]!=1, ans=min(inf,1), cnt=0

i=2: arr[2]==1, cnt=1

i=3: arr[3]!=1, ans=min(1,1), cnt=0

i=4: arr[4]==1, cnt=1

i=5: arr[5]!=1, ans=min(1,1), cnt=0

After loop, ans=1

So, output=1

Is this correct?

If we remove one element, say arr[1], we get [1,1,2,1,2], which can be made beautiful by replacing arr[2] with 1 (since arr[1]==arr[3]==1), making it [1,1,1,1,2], then replace the last 2 with 1 (since arr[3]==arr[4]==1), making it [1,1,1,1,1]. So, still beautiful.

Similarly, removing arr[3], we get [1,2,1,1,2], which can be made beautiful by replacing arr[1] with 1 (since arr[0]==arr[2]==1), making it [1,1,1,1,2], then replace the last 2 with 1, making it [1,1,1,1,1].

Wait, so removing one element still allows the array to be made beautiful.

Hence, the correct answer should be 2, not 1.

But according to the code, it would output 1, which is incorrect.

Hence, the reference solution seems to have a flaw.

Wait, but in the given examples, it seems to work, but in this additional example, it fails.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
