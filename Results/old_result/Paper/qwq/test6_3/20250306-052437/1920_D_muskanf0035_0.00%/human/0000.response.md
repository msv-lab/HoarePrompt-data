Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Jayden has an array that starts empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. There are two types of operations: appending an integer to the array or appending multiple copies of the current array to itself. After performing all these operations, he has some queries asking for specific elements in the final array.

First, I need to understand the operations clearly.

Operation 1: Append an integer x to the end of the array.

This is straightforward. If x is 5, for example, the array just gets a new element at the end, which is 5.

Operation 2: Append x copies of the current array to the end of the array.

This one is a bit trickier. So, if the current array is [1, 2, 3] and x is 2, then after this operation, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, it's concatenating x copies of the current array to itself.

Also, it's guaranteed that before performing operation 2, there's at least one operation of type 1, so the array isn't empty when operation 2 is performed.

Then, there are q queries, each asking for the k-th element of the final array. The elements are 1-indexed, which is good to note.

Looking at the constraints:

- t (number of test cases) is up to 5000.

- n and q for each test case can be up to 10^5.

- The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

So, efficiency is important here, especially since t can be up to 5000 and n and q up to 10^5 per test case, but with the sum over all test cases being 10^5, that means on average, n and q per test case are low, but some test cases can have up to 10^5.

But wait, the sum of n and q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5. So, if t=5000, then on average, n+q=20 per test case, but worst-case might have n and q up to 10^5 in a single test case.

Wait, no. The sum of n and q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5. So, if t=5000, then on average, n+q=20 per test case. So, it's manageable.

But I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough to handle the worst-case scenarios.

Looking at the example provided, it seems that the array can become quite large after several operation 2's, since it appends multiple copies of itself.

But in the constraints, k can be up to min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations. So, the array can be huge, up to 10^18 elements, but we have to handle queries efficiently without actually building the array.

Wait, but building the array is impossible for large k, since k can be up to 10^18, which is way beyond any feasible array size.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this, without constructing the entire array.

Let me think about how the array is built.

Starting with an empty array, let's simulate the operations step by step.

Suppose n=3:

Operation 1: append 1 → a = [1]

Operation 2: append 2 copies of a → a = [1, 1, 1]

Wait, no. Operation 2 appends x copies of a to the end of a. So, a becomes a + a * x.

Wait, in Python, [1, 2, 3] + [1, 2, 3] * x would do that.

But in this case, starting with [1], append 2 copies of [1], so it becomes [1] + [1, 1] = [1, 1, 1].

Wait, but the problem says "appends x copies of array a to the end of array a". So, it's a += a * x.

But in Python, lists use zero-based indexing, but the problem uses one-based indexing for queries.

Wait, no, the problem says elements are 1-indexed.

So, for queries, k=1 refers to the first element.

Now, if I try to build the array step by step, for large n and x up to 10^9, it's impossible due to memory constraints.

Hence, I need a smarter way to find the k-th element without constructing the entire array.

I need to find a way to determine the k-th element based on the sequence of operations.

Let me think about how the array is constructed.

Let's consider each operation and see how it affects the array's size and content.

Initially, array a is empty.

Let's number the operations from 1 to n.

For each operation:

- If b=1, append x to a. So, the size increases by 1.

- If b=2, append x copies of the current a to a. So, the size becomes size + x*size.

Wait, more generally, after operation 2, the new size is size * (x+1).

Wait, no. Let's see.

If a has size s, and we append x copies of a, then the new size is s + x*s = s*(x+1).

Yes, that's correct.

So, after each operation 2, the size is multiplied by (x+1).

But operation 1 just increases the size by 1.

So, I can keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

Let me define size_after[i] as the size of the array after the i-th operation.

Initialize size = 0

For each operation in order:

if b=1:

size +=1

else:

size *= (x+1)

So, I can precompute the size after each operation.

Then, for each query k, I need to find the k-th element in the final array.

But since the array can be up to 10^18 elements, I can't build it.

I need to traverse the operations in reverse or something to find out which element corresponds to the k-th position.

Wait, perhaps I can work backwards.

Start from the final size, and for each query k, find which element it corresponds to.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can represent the array as a tree, where operation 2 creates branches.

Wait, that might be overcomplicating.

Another idea: operation 1 adds a leaf, operation 2 repeats the current tree x times.

But I need a more efficient approach.

Looking back, perhaps I can keep track of the origin of each position in the final array.

But with k up to 10^18, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the array as a sequence of segments, where each segment corresponds to a repetition of previous arrays.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of segment trees or some kind of interval representation.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the operations and see how the array is built.

Suppose we have the following operations:

Operation 1: append 1 → a = [1]

Operation 1: append 2 → a = [1,2]

Operation 2: append 1 copy of a → a = [1,2,1,2]

Operation 1: append 3 → a = [1,2,1,2,3]

Operation 2: append 3 copies of a → a = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Now, for queries 1 through 20, the answers are:

1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2, 5:3, 6:1, 7:2, 8:1, 9:2, 10:3, 11:1, 12:2, 13:1, 14:2, 15:3, 16:1, 17:2, 18:1, 19:2, 20:3

As shown in the example.

Now, to find the k-th element without building the entire array, I need to find a way to determine which original operation corresponds to the k-th position.

I can keep track of the size after each operation, and then for each query, find out which operation's element corresponds to the k-th position.

Wait, perhaps I can loop through the operations in reverse, keeping track of the size, and see which operation contributes to the k-th element.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, I'll compute the size after each operation.

Then, for each query k, I'll find the operation that corresponds to the k-th position in the final array.

Starting from the final size, and going backwards through the operations, determining which part of the array the k-th position falls into.

Let me try to work through an example.

Take the first test case:

n=5, q=10

Operations:

1 1 → a = [1], size=1

1 2 → a = [1,2], size=2

2 1 → a = [1,2,1,2], size=4

1 3 → a = [1,2,1,2,3], size=5

2 3 → a = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], size=20

Queries: 1 through 10

So, for k=1, it's 1

k=2, it's 2

k=3, it's 1

and so on.

Now, to find the k-th element without building the entire array, I need to see which part of the array it falls into based on the operations.

Let me try to think recursively.

After operation 5 (2 3), the size is 5*(3+1)=20

After operation 4 (1 3), the size is 5

After operation 3 (2 1), the size is 2*(1+1)=4

After operation 2 (1 2), the size is 2

After operation 1 (1 1), the size is 1

Wait, actually, for operation 2, the size is multiplied by (x+1).

Wait, in operation 3, it's 2 1, so size becomes 2*(1+1)=4

Then operation 4, 1 3, size=4+1=5

Operation 5, 2 3, size=5*(3+1)=20

Yes, that matches.

Now, for a given k, say k=14, which is 2 in the final array.

How can I find that without building the array?

I need to see which part of the array the 14th element belongs to.

Since operation 5 is a repetition, I can find out how many repetitions include the 14th element.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the operations in reverse.

Start from the final size, and see which operation corresponds to the k-th position.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

First, compute the size after each operation.

Then, for each query k, starting from the final size, find out which operation's part includes the k-th position.

If the operation is type 1, then it's a single element.

If it's type 2, then it's x copies of the previous array.

So, for operation 5 (2 3), which is repeating the array 3 times, the size becomes 5*(3+1)=20

So, the array is [a, a, a, a], where a is the array before operation 5, which is [1,2,1,2,3]

So, positions 1-5: first copy

6-10: second copy

11-15: third copy

16-20: fourth copy

So, for k=14, it's in the fourth copy, position 14-15=9, which is position 14-15=9 in the original a, which is 2.

Wait, no, position 14 is in the fourth copy, which is positions 16-20.

Wait, let's see:

positions 1-5: first copy

6-10: second copy

11-15: third copy

16-20: fourth copy

So, k=14 is position 14, which is in the fourth copy, position 14-15=9, but since each copy is 5 elements, position 14 is position 14-15=9, but that's position 14-15=9, which is position 4 in the original a, which is 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused with indexing.

Let me try to think differently.

When operation 5 is 2 3, it appends 3 copies of the current array to itself.

So, if the current array is a, of size s=5, then after operation 5, the array becomes a + a * 3 = a * 4, since a + a*3 = a*(1+3)=a*4

So, the final array is 4 times the original a.

So, to find the k-th element, I can find which copy it belongs to.

For k=14, 14 / 5 = 2 with remainder 4, so it's in the third copy, position 4, which is 2.

Wait, but according to the example, k=14 is 2.

Wait, no, 14 divided by 5 is 2 with remainder 4, so it's in the third copy, position 4, which is 2.

But in the example, for k=14, it's 2.

Similarly, k=15 is also 3.

Wait, but in the example, for k=14, it's 2, and for k=15, it's 3.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in general, for operation 2 x, the array becomes a + a*x = a*(x+1)

Then, to find the k-th element, I can find k modulo the size before the operation.

Wait, perhaps.

But I need a general way to handle multiple operations.

Maybe I can keep a list of sizes after each operation, and then for each query, starting from the last operation, determine in which part the k-th element falls.

Yes, that seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, compute size_after[op] for each operation op from 1 to n.

Initialize size = 0

For each operation i from 1 to n:

if b_i == 1:

size +=1

elif b_i == 2:

size *= (x_i + 1)

Then, for each query k, starting from the last operation, find out which operation's part includes the k-th position.

Initialize current_k = k

Start from the last operation and go backwards.

For each operation i from n downto 1:

if b_i == 1:

if current_k == 1:

answer is x_i

else:

current_k -=1

elif b_i == 2:

# operation 2, appends x_i copies of the current array

# before this operation, the size was size_after[i-1]

# after this operation, size becomes size_after[i] = size_after[i-1] * (x_i + 1)

# so, the array is repeated (x_i + 1) times

# need to find which copy current_k falls into

copy_number = (current_k -1) // size_after[i-1] +1

remainder = (current_k -1) % size_after[i-1] +1

if copy_number == 1:

# original array before operation

current_k = remainder

else:

# in one of the copied arrays

# need to find the corresponding position in the original array

current_k = remainder

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the size before the operation.

Let me try to define size_before[op] as the size before performing operation op.

Initialize size_before[0] = 0

For each operation i from 1 to n:

if b_i == 1:

size_after[i] = size_before[i] +1

elif b_i == 2:

size_after[i] = size_before[i] * (x_i +1)

Set size_before[i+1] = size_after[i]

Then, for each query k, starting from the last operation, find which part the k-th element belongs to.

Initialize current_k = k

For operation i from n downto 1:

if b_i == 1:

if current_k == 1:

answer is x_i

else:

current_k -=1

elif b_i == 2:

# operation 2, appends x_i copies of the current array

# size_before[i] = size_after[i-1]

# size_after[i] = size_before[i] * (x_i +1)

# so, the array is repeated (x_i +1) times

# find which copy current_k is in

copy_number = (current_k -1) // size_before[i] +1

if copy_number <= x_i:

# in one of the copied arrays

current_k = (current_k -1) % size_before[i] +1

else:

# in the original array

current_k = (current_k -1) - (x_i * size_before[i])

But this seems messy.

Maybe I need to keep track of the size before and after each operation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to simulate the process in code.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute size_after for each operation.

Then, for each query, starting from the last operation, find out which operation's part the k-th element belongs to, and update k accordingly until I reach an operation 1, which appends a specific element.

That element is the answer for that query.

I need to handle this efficiently, without exceeding time limits, given that n and q can be up to 10^5 per test case, but with the sum over all test cases being 10^5.

So, per test case, n + q <= 10^5, and t <= 5000, but with sum over all test cases n + q <= 10^5.

Wait, no, the problem says the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

So, total operations across all test cases is <=10^5, and total queries across all test cases is <=10^5.

Hence, I need an efficient solution per test case.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

read n and q

read n operations: list of [b, x]

read q queries: list of k

Then, for each query k, find the k-th element in the final array.

To do this efficiently, I need to precompute the size after each operation.

Let me define size_after as a list of size n+1, where size_after[0] = 0

For each operation i from 1 to n:

if b_i ==1:

size_after[i] = size_after[i-1] +1

elif b_i ==2:

size_after[i] = size_after[i-1] * (x_i +1)

Then, for each query k:

current_k = k

for i in range(n,0,-1):

if b_i ==1:

if current_k ==1:

answer is x_i

break

else:

current_k -=1

elif b_i ==2:

# operation 2, appends x_i copies of the current array

# size_before[i] = size_after[i-1]

# size_after[i] = size_before[i] * (x_i +1)

# find which copy current_k is in

copies = x_i +1

copy_number = (current_k -1) // size_after[i-1] +1

remainder = (current_k -1) % size_after[i-1] +1

if copy_number <= x_i:

# in one of the copied arrays

current_k = remainder

else:

# in the original array

current_k = remainder

# continue to previous operations

Continue this until current_k is found in an operation 1.

This seems correct, but might be slow for large n and q.

I need to optimize it.

Is there a way to speed this up?

Perhaps by precomputing some values or using binary search.

Wait, maybe I can represent the operations in a tree structure, where each operation 2 creates x copies of the previous array.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that operation 2 repeats the array multiple times, and find a way to map k directly to the original operations.

But I think the current approach is acceptable, given the constraints.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(n, operations, queries):

array = []

result = []

for (op_type, value) in operations:

if op_type == 1:

array.append(value)

else:

array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])

for k in queries:

result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])

return result

def func_2():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, q) = map(int, input().split())

operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

queries = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = func_1(n, operations, queries)

print(*result)

So, func_2 reads the input and calls func_1 for each test case.

Func_1 simulates the operations by building the array step by step and then answers the queries by taking (k-1) % len(array).

This approach is incorrect for large k, since it builds the array explicitly, which can be up to 10^18 elements.

This will exceed memory and time limits.

Hence, I need to implement a smarter way to find the k-th element without building the array.

Let me try to implement the logic I described earlier.

I'll write a function that computes size_after for each operation, and then for each query, traverses the operations backwards to find the corresponding element.

Here's a sketch of the implementation:

def find_kth_element(n, operations, queries):

# Compute size_after for each operation

size_after = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

op_type, x = operations[i - 1]

if op_type == 1:

size_after[i] = size_after[i - 1] + 1

elif op_type == 2:

size_after[i] = size_after[i - 1] * (x + 1)

result = []

for k in queries:

current_k = k

for i in range(n, 0, -1):

op_type, x = operations[i - 1]

if op_type == 1:

if current_k == 1:

result.append(x)

break

else:

current_k -= 1

elif op_type == 2:

copies = x + 1

size_before = size_after[i - 1]

copy_number = (current_k - 1) // size_before + 1

remainder = (current_k - 1) % size_before + 1

if copy_number <= x:

# In one of the copied arrays

current_k = remainder

else:

# In the original array

current_k = remainder

# Continue to previous operations

return result

Then, in func_2, call this function instead of func_1.

But I need to ensure that this function is efficient enough.

Given that n and q can be up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but with the sum over all test cases n + q <=1e5, this should be acceptable.

I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me test this logic with the first test case.

n=5, operations:

1 1

1 2

2 1

1 3

2 3

size_after:

i=0: 0

i=1: 1 (append 1)

i=2: 2 (append 2)

i=3: 4 (append 1 copy of current array: [1,2,1,2])

i=4: 5 (append 3)

i=5: 20 (append 3 copies: [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3])

Queries: 1 through 10

For k=1:

current_k=1

i=5, op=2, x=3

copies=4

size_before=5

copy_number=(1-1)//5 +1=1

remainder=(1-1)%5 +1=1

copy_number=1 <= x=3? No, so in original, current_k=1

i=4, op=1, x=3

current_k=1

append 3

Wait, but in the example, k=1 is 1, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the logic.

Wait, in operation 5, which is 2 3, it appends 3 copies of the current array.

So, before operation 5, size_after[4]=5, array is [1,2,1,2,3]

After operation 5, array becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, for k=1:

i=5, op=2, x=3

copies=4

size_before=5

copy_number=(1-1)//5 +1=1

remainder=1

copy_number=1 <=3? Yes, so current_k=1

i=4, op=1, x=3

current_k=1

append 3

But in the example, k=1 should be 1, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the copy_number calculation.

Let me think differently.

When operation 2 appends x copies, the array becomes [original, original*x]

So, total copies is x+1 times the original.

But the operation appends x copies of the current array to itself.

So, a += a * x

Hence, the new array is a * (x+1)

So, for k=1, it's in the first copy.

For k=2, second element in the first copy.

And so on.

So, to find which copy k belongs to, I can do (k-1) // size_before +1

If copy_number <= x, then it's in one of the appended copies, and the element is the same as in the original array at position (k-1) % size_before +1

Else, it's in the original part.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Let me try again.

For operation 2 with x copies:

- The original array is size_before.

- After appending x copies, the new array is original + original*x = original*(x+1)

- So, the new array is [original[1], original[2], ..., original[size_before], original[1], original[2], ..., up to x times]

- So, to find the k-th element in the new array:

- If k <= size_before, it's in the original part.

- Else, it's in one of the copied parts.

- Specifically, copy_number = (k -1) // size_before +1

- If copy_number <= x, then it's in the copied part, and the element is original[(k-1) % size_before +1]

- Else, it's in the original part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of modulo.

Wait, perhaps I need to map k to the original array based on the copies.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the example again.

After operation 5, size=20

Original array before operation 5: size=5

After operation 5: [original, original, original, original] (4 copies)

So, for k=1 to 5: first copy

k=6 to 10: second copy

k=11 to 15: third copy

k=16 to 20: fourth copy

So, for k=14, it's in the fourth copy, position 14-15=9, which is position 4 in the original array, which is 2.

Wait, but in zero-based indexing:

copy_number = (k-1) // 5 +1

For k=14, (13)//5 +1 = 2 +1 =3

So, copy_number=3 <= x=3, so it's in the copied part, and the element is original[(13)%5 +1] = original[3 +1] = original[4] =2

Yes, that matches.

Similarly, for k=5, copy_number=(4)//5 +1=0+1=1, which is <=3, so original[4%5 +1]=original[4+1]=original[5]=3

Wait, but in the array, k=5 is 3, which matches.

For k=6, copy_number=(5)//5 +1=1+1=2 <=3, so original[5%5 +1]=original[0+1]=original[1]=1

But in the array, k=6 is 1, which matches.

For k=20, copy_number=(19)//5 +1=3+1=4 <=3? No, so it's in the original part, which is position (19)- (3*5)=19-15=4, which is original[4]=2

Wait, but in the array, k=20 is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the copy_number calculation.

Let me recast the formula.

copy_number = (k -1) // size_before +1

If copy_number <= x, then it's in the copied part, and the element is original[(k-1) % size_before +1]

Else, it's in the original part, and the element is determined by the remaining position.

Wait, in the case of k=20:

copy_number=(19)//5 +1=3 +1=4

If copy_number <=3, which it's not, so it's in the original part.

Then, remaining_position = k -1 - (x * size_before) =19 - (3*5)=19-15=4

So, original_position=4+1=5, which is 3.

Yes, that matches the array.

Wait, earlier I thought it was position 4, but it's position 5.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in earlier calculations.

Let me recalculate for k=14.

k=14

copy_number=(13)//5 +1=2+1=3 <=3, so it's in the copied part, element is original[(13)%5 +1]=original[3 +1]=original[4]=2

Yes, matches.

For k=5:

copy_number=(4)//5 +1=0+1=1 <=3, so original[4%5 +1]=original[4+1]=original[5]=3

Yes, matches.

For k=6:

copy_number=(5)//5 +1=1+1=2 <=3, so original[5%5 +1]=original[0+1]=original[1]=1

Yes, matches.

For k=20:

copy_number=(19)//5 +1=3+1=4 >3, so in original, position=19 - (3*5)=4, original[4+1]=original[5]=3

Yes, matches.

So, the logic seems correct.

Hence, I need to implement this logic in code.

I need to make sure that I handle the operations in reverse order, and correctly compute the size_before for each operation 2.

Also, I need to handle operation 1 correctly, where appending a single element.

I need to keep track of the elements appended in operation 1, and when operation 2 is performed, I need to know how the array was repeated.

Wait, but in operation 2, it appends x copies of the current array to itself.

So, the new array is the old array plus x times the old array.

Hence, it's (x+1) times the old array.

Hence, to find the k-th element in the new array, I need to find which copy k falls into.

If k <= size_before, it's in the original array.

Else, it's in one of the copied parts.

Hence, I can compute copy_number=(k-1)//size_before

if copy_number < x, then it's in the copied part, and the element is the same as in the original array at position (k-1)%size_before +1

else, it's in the original part at position (k-1) - (x * size_before) +1

I think this is the correct way.

Let me adjust my earlier code accordingly.

def find_kth_element(n, operations, queries):

# Compute size_after for each operation

size_after = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

op_type, x = operations[i - 1]

if op_type == 1:

size_after[i] = size_after[i - 1] + 1

elif op_type == 2:

size_after[i] = size_after[i - 1] * (x + 1)

# Now, for each query, find the k-th element

result = []

for k in queries:

current_k = k

for i in range(n, 0, -1):

op_type, x = operations[i - 1]

if op_type == 1:

if current_k == 1:

result.append(x)

break

else:

current_k -= 1

elif op_type == 2:

size_before = size_after[i - 1]

copies = x + 1

if current_k <= size_before:

# In the original part

current_k = current_k

elif current_k <= size_before * copies:

# In one of the copied parts

copy_number = (current_k - 1) // size_before

remainder = (current_k - 1) % size_before + 1

if copy_number < x:

# In one of the copied parts

current_k = remainder

else:

# In the original part

current_k = current_k - x * size_before

else:

raise ValueError("Invalid k")

# Continue to previous operations

return result

This seems correct.

Let me test it with the first test case.

n=5, operations:

1 1 → size_after[1]=1

1 2 → size_after[2]=2

2 1 → size_after[3]=2*(1+1)=4

1 3 → size_after[4]=5

2 3 → size_after[5]=5*(3+1)=20

Queries: 1 through 10

For k=1:

i=5, op=2, x=3

size_before=5

copies=4

k=1 <=5? Yes, in original part, current_k=1

i=4, op=1, x=3

current_k=1, append 3

But in the example, k=1 should be 1, not 3.

Wait, there's a mistake.

Wait, in operation 5, which is 2 3, it appends 3 copies of the current array to itself.

So, the array becomes a + a*3 = a*4

Hence, for k=1, it's in the first copy, which is the original array.

The original array before operation 5 is [1,2,1,2,3]

Hence, k=1 corresponds to the first element of the original array, which is 1.

Hence, the code should return 1 for k=1.

But in my earlier implementation, it returns 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle operation 2.

Let me think again.

When operation 2 is performed, it appends x copies of the current array to itself.

Hence, the new array is a + a*x = a*(x+1)

So, the original array is the first copy, and the appended copies are the next x copies.

Hence, for k in 1 to size_before, it's the original array.

For k from size_before+1 to size_before*(x+1), it's the copied parts.

Hence, to find which copy k belongs to:

copy_number = (k -1) // size_before

if copy_number < x:

# in one of the appended copies

position_in_copy = (k -1) % size_before +1

# find the element in the original array at position_in_copy

else:

# in the original array

position_in_original = k -1 - (x * size_before) +1

Hence, I need to keep track of the original array's elements.

But in my earlier implementation, I only keep track of the size, not the actual elements.

Hence, I need a way to map the k-th position to the corresponding operation 1 that appended the element.

Hence, perhaps I need to keep track of the elements added by operation 1 and their positions.

Wait, but with k up to 10^18, I can't store the elements.

I need a way to map k to the corresponding operation 1 that added that element.

Hence, perhaps I need to keep track of which operation 1 corresponds to which positions in the final array.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the original positions and their multiplications due to operation 2.

Let me try to build a list of [position, operation_index] pairs, but that might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of the operations that added elements, and for each operation 2, record how many times the array was repeated.

Then, for a query k, traverse the operations in reverse, dividing k by the repetition factors.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to find the k-th element in the final array, without building the array.

Hence, I need an efficient way to determine which element was added by which operation 1, considering the repetitions due to operation 2.

Perhaps I can represent the array as a sequence of segments
