Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, both of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after these swaps.

First, I need to understand what swapping digits means in this context. For example, if x is 73 and y is 31, swapping the second digits would make x=71 and y=33. So, I can see that the positions are aligned, and I'm swapping digits at the same positions in both numbers.

My goal is to maximize the product of x and y after performing these swaps as many times as I want. I need to figure out the strategy that leads to the maximum product.

Let me think about how the product of two numbers depends on their digits. The product is maximized when both numbers are as large as possible. So, I should arrange the digits in such a way that both x and y are maximized.

But wait, it's not that simple because I'm swapping digits at the same positions in both numbers. So, for each position, I can choose to swap or not swap, but I have to do it for that position only.

Let me consider each position independently and decide whether swapping that position's digits between x and y would lead to a better product.

But considering that the product is multiplicative, it's not straightforward to optimize by looking at each position separately. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me think about the overall magnitude of the numbers. To maximize the product, I probably want to maximize the leading digits of both numbers because they have the highest place values.

For example, if x is 73 and y is 31, swapping the second digits results in x=71 and y=33. The product is 71*33=2343, whereas the original product is 73*31=2263. So, swapping improved the product.

Let me try another example. Suppose x is 2 and y is 5. If I swap the first digits, x becomes 5 and y becomes 2. The product is 5*2=10, whereas the original product is 2*5=10. So, it's the same.

Another example: x=3516 and y=3982. If I swap all digits, x becomes 3982 and y becomes 3516. The product is 3982*3516=13,996,752. Original product is 3516*3982=13,996,752. So, same product.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for x=3516 and y=3982, it's outputting x=3912 and y=3586. Let's calculate that product: 3912*3586=14,042,272. Which is higher than the original product.

So, there must be a better way to swap digits to maximize the product.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I recall that for two numbers with the same number of digits, to maximize their product, we might want to balance making both numbers as large as possible.

One strategy could be to sort the digits in both numbers in descending order, but since I can only swap digits at the same positions, I need to find a way to arrange the digits at each position to maximize the overall product.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider greedily deciding for each position whether swapping leads to a higher product.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the mathematical expression for the product.

Suppose x = x1 * 10^{n-1} + x2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + xn

And y = y1 * 10^{n-1} + y2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + yn

Then, product p = x * y

I need to maximize p by swapping xi with yi for any i.

But this seems complicated to optimize directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the contribution of each pair of digits (xi, yi) to the overall product.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each position, swapping should be done if it increases the product more than not swapping.

But I need a better way to decide for each position.

Let me think differently. Since multiplying large numbers is involved, maybe there's a mathematical property or inequality that can guide the arrangement of digits.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the average of x and y: the product is maximized when x and y are as close as possible.

Wait, no. For a fixed sum, the product is maximized when x and y are equal. But in this case, I'm not fixing the sum; I'm trying to maximize the product by swapping digits at the same positions.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

I need to make a choice for each position independently, as the swaps are performed simultaneously for the same positions.

So, for each position, I have to decide whether swapping that position's digits will lead to a higher product.

But since the product depends on all positions together, it's not straightforward to optimize.

Maybe I can look for a pattern or a rule that applies to each position.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case:

Input:

73

31

Output:

71

33

Product before swapping: 73 * 31 = 2263

After swapping second digits: 71 * 33 = 2343

Indeed, 2343 > 2263

Second test case:

Input:

2

5

Output:

5

2

Product before swapping: 2 * 5 = 10

After swapping: 5 * 2 = 10

Same product

Third test case:

Input:

3516

3982

Output:

3912

3586

Product before swapping: 3516 * 3982 = 13,996,752

After swapping: 3912 * 3586 = 14,042,272

Which is higher

Wait, but according to the sample output, for the third test case, it's swapping certain digits to achieve x=3912 and y=3586.

But according to the problem, I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y for any i, any number of times.

So, for x=3516 and y=3982, swapping first and second digits would give x=3916 and y=3582

But the sample output is x=3912 and y=3586

Which suggests that they swapped the first and second digits, and also the third and fourth digits.

Wait, no:

Original:

x: 3 5 1 6

y: 3 9 8 2

After swapping first digits: x=3, y=3 (no change)

Swapping second digits: x=9, y=5

Swapping third digits: x=1, y=8

Swapping fourth digits: x=6, y=2

So, x=3916, y=3582

But the sample output is x=3912, y=3586

Which suggests that they swapped different digits.

Wait, perhaps they swapped only some digits.

Wait, 3516 to 3912 means:

- First digit: 3 to 3 (no swap)

- Second digit: 5 to 9 (swap)

- Third digit: 1 to 1 (no swap)

- Fourth digit: 6 to 2 (swap)

Similarly, y: 3982 to 3586:

- First digit: 3 to 3 (no swap)

- Second digit: 9 to 5 (swap)

- Third digit: 8 to 8 (no swap)

- Fourth digit: 2 to 6 (swap)

So, they swapped the second and fourth digits.

Wait, but according to the problem, I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y for each i, independently, in a single operation.

But I can perform this operation any number of times.

Wait, no, each swap is for corresponding digits at position i in both numbers, and I can choose to perform this swap or not for each position i, and I can repeat this operation any number of times.

But actually, since each swap is independent for each position, and I can perform the operation any number of times, it's equivalent to choosing for each position whether to swap or not, because each swap at a position is independent of the others.

So, I can choose to swap or not swap for each position independently.

So, I need to decide for each position i whether to swap the i-th digits of x and y to maximize the product.

Now, to maximize the product, I need to maximize the overall value of x and y together.

I need a strategy to decide for each position whether swapping will lead to a higher product.

One approach could be to consider that for higher significance digits (leftmost digits), I want both x and y to have as high digits as possible.

But since I'm swapping digits at the same positions, I need to decide for each position whether swapping that position's digits will help maximize the product.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of which digit is larger at each position and decide based on that.

Let me consider that for each position, if a_i > b_i, then keep a_i in x and b_i in y; else, swap to have the larger digit in x and the smaller in y.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should arrange the digits in such a way that the sum of the digits in x and y is maximized, but since x and y have the same digits in the same positions, their sum would be the same regardless of swapping.

Wait, no, their sum would change based on the arrangement.

Wait, no, their sum would be the same because it's the same digits.

Wait, no, their sum would be different because swapping digits at a position changes the individual numbers.

Wait, no, actually, the sum x + y would change based on the arrangement.

Wait, but I'm not sure if maximizing the sum would necessarily maximize the product.

I recall that for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

But in this case, I'm not fixing the sum; I'm trying to maximize the product by arranging the digits.

Wait, perhaps I should aim to make x and y as close as possible in value, to maximize their product.

So, I need to arrange the digits such that x and y are as close as possible.

But how do I achieve that?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I can swap their digits at the same positions.

I need to arrange them so that x and y are as close as possible in value.

To do that, for each position, I should assign the larger digit to the number that is currently smaller, to balance them.

Wait, that might be too vague.

Let me consider an example.

Take x=3516 and y=3982.

Original x=3516, y=3982

Sum: x + y = 7500

If I swap second digits: x=3916, y=3582

Sum: 7500 (same)

Product: 3916*3582 = 14,042,272

Original product: 3516*3982 = 13,996,752

So, by swapping, the product increased.

In this case, swapping made x larger and y smaller, but the product increased.

Wait, but according to the earlier thought that the product is maximized when x and y are close, in this case, x increased from 3516 to 3916 and y decreased from 3982 to 3582, making them closer, and the product increased.

So, perhaps making x and y closer in value increases the product.

Is that always the case?

Let me check with another example.

Take x=2, y=5.

Product: 10

If I swap digits: x=5, y=2.

Product: 10, same as before.

So, in this case, swapping didn't change the product.

And x and y are still the same distance apart.

Wait, but in the first example, swapping made x and y closer and increased the product.

Wait, no, in the first example, x=73 and y=31.

If I swap the second digits: x=71, y=33.

So, x decreased by 2, y increased by 2.

They became closer, and the product increased from 2263 to 2343.

Similarly, in the third example, x increased by 3916-3516=400, y decreased by 3982-3582=400.

So, they became closer, and the product increased.

So, it seems that making x and y closer in value increases the product.

But is this always true?

Let me think about two numbers with the same sum.

Given a fixed sum s, the product x*y is maximized when x=y, since the product is a quadratic function that peaks at x=s/2.

So, for a fixed sum, the product is maximized when x and y are equal.

In this problem, when I swap digits at the same positions, I'm effectively choosing whether to have the larger digit in x or in y for each position.

So, for each position, I should decide whether to put the larger digit in x or in y based on which choice brings x and y closer in value.

Wait, but I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me think about it in terms of place values.

Each position has a place value of 10^i for the i-th digit from the right.

So, for each position, I have two digits, a_i and b_i.

I can choose to have a_i in x and b_i in y, or b_i in x and a_i in y.

I need to decide for each position which choice to make to maximize the product.

This seems complicated because the product depends on all positions together.

Maybe I can prioritize higher digits in higher place values.

Wait, but that's the usual way to maximize a single number.

But here, I have two numbers, and I need to maximize their product.

Perhaps I should sort the digits in x and y in a specific way.

Wait, but I can only swap digits at the same positions.

I cannot rearrange the digits within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

So, I need to find a way to arrange the digits at each position to maximize the product.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

I need to make a choice for each position to maximize the product.

But since the product is multiplicative across all positions, it's not straightforward to optimize.

Maybe I can look at the logarithm of the product, which would be additive.

So, log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y)

But I need to maximize x*y, which is equivalent to maximizing log(x) + log(y).

So, I need to maximize the sum of log(x) and log(y).

But x and y are composed of their digits at different place values.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the contribution of each position to the product.

For example, for two-digit numbers x=10*a1 + a2 and y=10*b1 + b2.

Their product is (10*a1 + a2)*(10*b1 + b2) = 100*a1*b1 + 10*(a1*b2 + a2*b1) + a2*b2.

So, the product is a sum of terms, each corresponding to a pair of digits from x and y, multiplied by their place values.

So, perhaps I can maximize each of these terms independently.

But since the digits are linked by the swaps, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as maximizing the sum of the products of corresponding digits weighted by their place values.

So, for each position, I have the product of the digits at that position multiplied by the square of the place value.

Wait, more precisely, for positions i and j, the product would have terms involving place values 10^{i+j}.

But this seems too involved.

Let me try to find a simpler strategy.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case:

x=73, y=31

Swap second digits: x=71, y=33

Product increases from 2263 to 2343.

Second test case:

x=2, y=5

Swapping digits: x=5, y=2

Product remains 10.

Third test case:

x=3516, y=3982

Swap second and fourth digits: x=3912, y=3586

Product increases from 13,996,752 to 14,042,272.

So, in cases where swapping makes x and y closer, the product increases.

In the second test case, x and y are already as close as possible, so swapping doesn't change the product.

So, perhaps the strategy is to swap digits at each position where doing so brings x and y closer together.

But how do I determine that for each position?

Let me consider that for each position, if a_i > b_i, then assigning a_i to x and b_i to y would make x larger and y smaller, whereas swapping would make x smaller and y larger.

So, if x is currently smaller than y, swapping would bring them closer, and if x is larger than y, not swapping would keep them closer.

Wait, but I need to consider the overall effect on the entire numbers, not just the individual digits.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of the difference between x and y.

I need to minimize |x - y| to maximize x*y.

So, for each position, I should choose to swap if it reduces |x - y|.

But again, this is not straightforward because changing digits at different positions affects x and y differently.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose x and y are single-digit numbers.

Then, swapping them doesn't change the product, which is consistent with the second test case.

Now, for multi-digit numbers, I need to consider the impact of each digit on the overall difference between x and y.

Perhaps I can iterate from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, deciding at each step whether to swap to minimize |x - y|.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can sort the digits in x and y in a specific way.

Wait, but I can only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

I cannot rearrange the digits within x or y.

So, I need to find a way to arrange the digits at each position to maximize the product.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

I need to make a choice for each position to maximize the product.

But since the product is multiplicative across all positions, it's challenging to optimize directly.

Maybe I can look at the ratio of the products.

Wait, perhaps considering the geometric mean.

But that seems too involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix x and try to choose y to maximize x*y, given the constraints on y.

But y is determined by the swaps at each position.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as optimizing the product under certain constraints.

But that might be too abstract.

Let me consider that for each position, swapping increases or decreases the product.

I need to find a way to decide for each position whether swapping is beneficial.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the difference in the product when swapping versus not swapping for each position.

Let's try to formalize this.

Let’s denote p_not_swap = x * y

Let’s denote p_swap = (x - a_i*10^{pos} + b_i*10^{pos}) * (y - b_i*10^{pos} + a_i*10^{pos})

Where a_i and b_i are the digits at position pos in x and y, respectively.

Then, p_swap - p_not_swap = ...

But calculating this difference for each position seems too time-consuming, especially since the positions are interdependent.

There must be a better way.

Let me consider that for each position, swapping a_i and b_i affects the product by changing x and y by (b_i - a_i)*10^{pos} for x and (a_i - b_i)*10^{pos} for y.

So, the change in product δp = (x + δx)*(y + δy) - x*y = x*δy + y*δx + δx*δy

Where δx = (b_i - a_i)*10^{pos} and δy = (a_i - b_i)*10^{pos} = -δx

So, δp = x*(-δx) + y*δx + δx*(-δx) = δx*(y - x - δx)

This seems complicated to maximize directly.

Maybe I need to consider the sign of δp to decide whether to swap.

But this seems too involved for each position.

Perhaps there's a simpler rule based on comparing the digits at each position.

Wait, perhaps I can compare a_i with b_i and decide based on which one is larger.

Let me consider that for each position, if a_i >= b_i, then keep a_i in x and b_i in y; else, swap to have the larger digit in x.

But earlier, in the sample input, swapping certain digits increased the product by making x and y closer.

So, perhaps I should aim to balance x and y by assigning larger digits to the number that is currently smaller.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the digits from the most significant to the least significant and decide based on the current values of x and y.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize x and y as initial values.

For each position from the most significant to the least significant:

- If x < y, assign the larger digit to x by not swapping if a_i >= b_i, or swap if a_i < b_i.

- If x >= y, assign the larger digit to y by swapping if a_i > b_i, or not swapping if a_i <= b_i.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Let me think again.

If x < y, I want to increase x and decrease y to bring them closer.

So, for positions where a_i < b_i, I should swap to increase x and decrease y.

For positions where a_i >= b_i, I can keep them as is.

Similarly, if x > y, I want to decrease x and increase y to bring them closer.

So, for positions where a_i > b_i, I should swap to decrease x and increase y.

For positions where a_i <= b_i, I can keep them as is.

And if x == y, I can choose to swap or not based on which choice keeps them equal.

This seems like a possible strategy.

Let me test this strategy with the sample input.

First test case:

x=73, y=31

Initially, x < y (73 < 31 is false; actually, 73 > 31)

Wait, 73 > 31, so x > y.

According to the strategy, since x > y, for positions where a_i > b_i, swap to decrease x and increase y.

First digit: a1=7, b1=3; since 7 > 3, swap to get a1=3, b1=7; x=33, y=71

Second digit: a2=3, b2=1; since 3 > 1, swap to get a2=1, b2=3; x=31, y=73

But according to the sample, they swapped only the second digits to get x=71 and y=33.

Hmm, seems different.

Wait, perhaps I need to decide based on the current values of x and y at each step.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the difference in x and y and decide accordingly.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

In this problem, I can't fix the sum, but perhaps I can arrange the digits such that x and y are as close as possible.

To do that, for each position, I can assign the larger digit to the number that is currently smaller.

This way, I'm balancing the two numbers.

Let me try this idea.

Initialize x and y as lists of digits.

For each position from the most significant to the least significant:

- If x < y, assign the larger digit to x; else, assign the larger digit to y.

Wait, but x and y are strings of digits, so comparing them as strings would give the correct ordering.

Let me try with the first test case:

x='73', y='31'

Compare x and y as strings: '73' > '31'

So, x > y.

For the first digit:

a1='7', b1='3'

Since x > y, assign the larger digit to y.

So, since '7' > '3', swap them to get x='3', y='7'

Wait, but x is '73' and y is '31', so if I swap the first digits, x becomes '33' and y becomes '71'

But according to the earlier step, x=33 and y=71, which is x < y.

Now, move to the second digit:

a2='3', b2='1'

Now, x='33', y='71', so x < y.

Assign the larger digit to x.

Since '3' > '1', do not swap.

So, x remains '33' and y remains '71'

But according to the sample, they swapped only the second digits to get x='71' and y='33'

This is different.

Wait, perhaps my strategy is flawed.

Let me try another approach.

Maybe I should sort the digits in x and y in a specific way.

Wait, but I can only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

I cannot rearrange the digits within x or y.

So, I need to find a way to arrange the digits at each position to maximize the product.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to swap or not, and I need to make this choice to maximize the product.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I can look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that x and y have the same length, and I can swap their digits at the same positions.

So, for each position, I have two digits, a_i and b_i, and I can choose to have a_i in x and b_i in y, or b_i in x and a_i in y.

I need to choose for each position which option gives a higher product.

But since the product is multiplicative across all positions, it's not straightforward to optimize.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the products.

But that seems too involved.

Let me think about the logarithm of the product, which is the sum of the logarithms of x and y.

So, log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y)

To maximize this sum, I need to maximize log(x) + log(y)

So, for each position, I should choose the arrangement that maximizes the sum of log(x) and log(y).

But log(x) and log(y) are concave functions, so maximizing their sum might not be straightforward.

This seems too complicated for this problem.

Perhaps I should look for a simpler heuristic.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, it seems that swapping digits where a_i < b_i increases the product.

Wait, in the first test case, a2=3 < b2=1 is false, so no swap is needed for the second digit, but according to the sample, they swapped the second digits.

Wait, b2=1 < a2=3, so swapping makes a2=1 and b2=3, making x=71 and y=33.

In this case, a2=3 > b2=1, and they swapped to get a2=1 and b2=3.

So, x decreased and y increased.

Similarly, in the third test case, they swapped digits where a_i > b_i to make x larger and y smaller.

So, perhaps the strategy is to swap digits at positions where a_i > b_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, swapping where a_i > b_i led to x decreasing and y increasing, which brought them closer and increased the product.

In the third test case, swapping certain digits where a_i > b_i or a_i < b_i in a specific way increased the product.

But I need a general rule.

Let me consider that for positions where a_i > b_i, swapping would decrease x and increase y, bringing them closer.

Similarly, for positions where a_i < b_i, swapping would increase x and decrease y, again bringing them closer.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to swap digits at positions where a_i > b_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, x=73 > y=31, so swapping a_i > b_i (which is the first digit: 7>3) would decrease x and increase y, bringing them closer.

In the third test case, x=3516 < y=3982, so swapping a_i > b_i (e.g., second digit: 5<9, so don't swap; fourth digit: 6>2, so swap) seems to align with this strategy.

Let me test this strategy with the third test case.

x=3516, y=3982

Compare digit by digit:

First digit: 3 == 3, no swap.

Second digit: 5 < 9, don't swap.

Third digit: 1 < 8, don't swap.

Fourth digit: 6 > 2, swap.

So, swap fourth digits: x=3512, y=3986

But according to the sample output, x=3912 and y=3586.

So, it seems that in the sample, they swapped more digits.

Wait, perhaps I need to swap all positions where a_i > b_i.

Wait, but in the third test case, a_i > b_i only at the fourth digit (6>2).

So, swapping only the fourth digit gives x=3512 and y=3986, but the sample output shows x=3912 and y=3586, which suggests swapping more digits.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Let me consider that for positions where a_i < b_i, I should swap to increase x and decrease y, bringing them closer.

But in the third test case, second digit: 5 < 9, so swap to get x=3916 and y=3582

Then, fourth digit: 6 > 2, swap to get x=3912 and y=3586

Which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the strategy is to swap digits at positions where a_i < b_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, a2=3 < b2=1 is false, so no swap, but according to the sample, they swapped the second digits.

Wait, b2=1 < a2=3, so a_i > b_i, don't swap according to this rule.

But in the sample, they swapped the second digits.

This is confusing.

Maybe the strategy is to swap digits at positions where swapping brings x and y closer together.

But I need a more concrete rule.

Let me consider that for each position, if swapping reduces |x - y|, then swap; else, don't swap.

But implementing this requires calculating the difference before and after swapping for each position, which is too time-consuming.

Perhaps I can make a greedy choice based on the place value and the digits.

Wait, maybe I can sort the digits in x and y in such a way that the higher digits are assigned to the number that needs to be larger to balance the product.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me consider that for the most significant digits, I should assign the larger digit to the smaller number.

For example, if x < y, assign the larger digit to x, else assign the larger digit to y.

Wait, but in the first test case, x=73 > y=31, so assign the larger digit to y.

So, for the first digit, a1=7 > b1=3, so swap to get x=33 and y=71.

Now, x=33 < y=71.

For the second digit, a2=3 < b2=1 is false, so don't swap.

So, final x=33 and y=71, product=33*71=2343, which matches the sample.

Wait, but in the sample, they have x=71 and y=33.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the strategy.

Let me try this:

- If x < y, assign the larger digit to x by swapping if a_i < b_i.

- If x >= y, assign the larger digit to y by swapping if a_i > b_i.

Wait, in the first test case, x=73 > y=31, so assign larger digits to y by swapping when a_i > b_i.

For first digit, a1=7 > b1=3, swap to get x=33 and y=71.

Now, x=33 < y=71.

For second digit, a2=3 < b2=1 is false, so don't swap.

So, x=33 and y=71, product=2343, which matches the sample.

In the third test case, x=3516 < y=3982, so assign larger digits to x by swapping when a_i < b_i.

First digit: 3 == 3, no swap.

Second digit: 5 < 9, swap to get x=3916 and y=3582.

Now, x=3916 > y=3582.

For third digit: 1 < 8, swap to get x=3986 and y=3512.

Now, x=3986 > y=3512.

For fourth digit: 6 > 2, swap to get x=3912 and y=3586.

Now, x=3912 < y=3586, which is not consistent with the earlier step.

Wait, perhaps I need to decide based on the current values at each step.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for each position, if swapping reduces |x - y|, then swap; else, don't swap.

So, for the third test case:

Initial x=3516, y=3982

|diff|=3982-3516=466

First digit: a1=3, b1=3, swapping doesn't change.

Second digit: a2=5, b2=9, swapping would make x=3916, y=3582, |diff|=3916-3582=334 < 466, so swap.

Now, x=3916, y=3582, |diff|=334

Third digit: a3=1, b3=8, swapping would make x=3986, y=3512, |diff|=3986-3512=474 > 334, so don't swap.

Fourth digit: a4=6, b4=2, swapping would make x=3982, y=3516, |diff|=3982-3516=466 > 334, so don't swap.

So, final x=3916 and y=3582, product=3916*3582=14,042,272, which matches the sample.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's x=3912 and y=3586.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same product.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the third test case, after swapping the second digit, x=3916 and y=3582.

Now, |diff|=3916-3582=334.

Then, for the third digit, a3=1 < b3=8, swapping would make x=3986 and y=3512, |diff|=3986-3512=474 > 334, so better to not swap.

For the fourth digit, a4=6 > b4=2, swapping would make x=3982 and y=3516, |diff|=3982-3516=466 > 334, so better to not swap.

So, final x=3916 and y=3582.

But the sample output shows x=3912 and y=3586.

Perhaps the sample took different steps.

But according to my strategy, not swapping the third and fourth digits after swapping the second digit gives the desired result.

So, perhaps the strategy of swapping digits where swapping reduces |x - y| works.

Let me try this strategy with another example.

Take x=2 and y=5.

Initial |diff|=3.

Only one digit: a1=2 < b1=5, swap to get x=5 and y=2, |diff|=3.

So, no change in |diff|.

So, either swap or not, the product remains the same.

Now, another example: x=73, y=31.

Initial |diff|=42.

First digit: a1=7 > b1=3, swap to get x=33 and y=71, |diff|=71-33=38 < 42, so swap.

Second digit: a2=3 < b2=1 is false, so don't swap.

So, final x=33 and y=71, product=2343, which matches the sample.

So, this strategy seems to work.

Let me formalize this strategy:

- For each position from the most significant to the least significant:

- If swapping reduces |x - y|, then swap; else, don't swap.

This seems to be a reasonable heuristic to maximize the product by bringing x and y closer together.

Now, to implement this strategy, I need to:

- Iterate through each position.

- For each position, calculate the potential |x - y| if I swap or don't swap.

- Choose the option that reduces |x - y|.

- Update x and y accordingly.

But implementing this directly would be time-consuming, especially for large numbers with up to 100 digits.

I need a more efficient way to decide for each position whether to swap or not.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a rule that can be applied independently for each position.

Looking back at the strategy:

- If x < y, swap digits where a_i < b_i to increase x and decrease y.

- If x >= y, swap digits where a_i > b_i to decrease x and increase y.

This seems to align with the earlier observations.

So, perhaps I can implement this rule:

- If x < y, swap digits where a_i < b_i.

- Else, swap digits where a_i > b_i.

Let me test this rule with the first test case:

x=73 < y=31 is false, so x > y.

Swap digits where a_i > b_i.

First digit: a1=7 > b1=3, swap to get x=33 and y=71.

Now, x=33 < y=71.

Second digit: a2=3 < b2=1 is false, don't swap.

So, final x=33 and y=71, product=2343.

Matches the sample.

Third test case:

x=3516 < y=3982, so swap digits where a_i < b_i.

First digit: a1=3 == b1=3, no swap.

Second digit: a2=5 < b2=9, swap to get x=3916 and y=3582.

Now, x=3916 > y=3582.

Third digit: a3=1 < b3=8, but now x > y, so don't swap.

Fourth digit: a4=6 > b4=2, but x > y, so don't swap.

So, final x=3916 and y=3582, product=14,042,272.

But the sample output is x=3912 and y=3586, which also gives the same product.

So, multiple solutions are possible, but my approach also leads to a correct solution.

Hence, this rule seems to work.

Let me try it with another example.

Suppose x=123 and y=132.

x=123 < y=132, so swap digits where a_i < b_i.

First digit: 1 == 1, no swap.

Second digit: 2 < 3, swap to get x=133 and y=122.

Now, x=133 > y=122.

Third digit: 3 > 2, so don't swap.

So, final x=133 and y=122, product=133*122=16,226.

Alternatively, if I swap both second and third digits:

Original: x=123, y=132

Swap second digits: x=133, y=122

Swap third digits: x=132, y=123

Product: 132*123=16,236, which is higher.

So, my earlier strategy didn't lead to the maximum product.

Wait, perhaps my strategy needs refinement.

In this example, x=123 < y=132, so swap digits where a_i < b_i.

First digit: 1 == 1, no swap.

Second digit: 2 < 3, swap to get x=133 and y=122.

Now, x=133 > y=122.

Third digit: 3 > 2, so don't swap.

So, x=133 and y=122, product=16,226.

But if I swap both second and third digits:

Swap second digits: x=133, y=122

Swap third digits: x=132, y=123

Product=132*123=16,236, which is higher.

So, my strategy missed a higher product.

Perhaps I need to consider swapping digits where a_i < b_i for positions where x < y, but also consider swapping other digits if it leads to a higher product.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps I can sort the digits in x and y in such a way that the digits in x and y are arranged to maximize the product.

But since I can only swap corresponding digits, I need to decide for each position whether to swap or not.

Wait, maybe I can sort the positions based on the difference between a_i and b_i and decide accordingly.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each position, swapping a_i and b_i changes x and y by (b_i - a_i)*10^{pos} and (a_i - b_i)*10^{pos}, respectively.

So, the change in the difference (x - y) is 2*(b_i - a_i)*10^{pos}.

If x > y, and a_i > b_i, then swapping decreases (x - y) by 2*(b_i - a_i)*10^{pos}, which is positive since b_i - a_i < 0.

Similarly, if x < y, and a_i < b_i, swapping increases (x - y) by 2*(b_i - a_i)*10^{pos}, which is positive since b_i - a_i > 0.

So, swapping when a_i < b_i and x < y reduces |x - y|.

Similarly, swapping when a_i > b_i and x > y reduces |x - y|.

So, perhaps the strategy is to swap digits where a_i < b_i if x < y, or a_i > b_i if x > y.

This aligns with the earlier rule.

But in the additional example I considered, x=123 < y=132, so swap digits where a_i < b_i.

First digit: 1 == 1, no swap.

Second digit: 2 < 3, swap to get x
