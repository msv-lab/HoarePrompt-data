Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bernard has to cross a river on a ferry, but he's always late, and Rudolf wants to help by building some bridges. The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns, and each cell has a depth value a_{i,j}. The depths on the first and last columns are always 0 because those are the banks.

Rudolf can build a bridge on any row, and to build a bridge, he needs to install supports in certain cells. The rules are:

1. A support must be installed in the first cell of the row (column 1).

2. A support must be installed in the last cell of the row (column m).

3. The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d, where distance is defined as |j1 - j2| - 1.

The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

Now, Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows and minimize the total cost of installing supports for all these bridges.

First, I need to understand how to minimize the cost for a single bridge on a row. Given a row, I need to place supports at column 1 and column m, and possibly some in between, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. I can think of it as finding the minimal cost path from column 1 to column m, where each step can be up to d columns ahead, and the cost of each step is the cost of placing a support in that column.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let dp[j] be the minimal cost to reach column j from column 1, following the rules.

Initialization:

dp[0] = 0 (since support must be placed at column 1)

For j from 1 to m-1:

dp[j] = min over all i where j - d <= i < j and support is placed at i, of dp[i] + cost of placing support at j

But wait, the support at j is a_{i,j} + 1, but since we're on a single row, it's just a[j] + 1.

Wait, no, a_{i,j} depends on the row, but since we're on a single row, it's a[j].

Wait, in the code, it's implemented as row[j] + 1, which seems correct.

But in the code, it's func_1(row, d):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Hmm, this seems to be using a sliding window minimum approach with a heap.

Let me try to understand this.

We have a heap that keeps track of the minimum values in the window of size d.

For each position i from d to m-1, it pops elements from the heap that are outside the window, then sets row[i] to be the minimum in the window plus row[i] + 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e[0] is the minimum value in the window.

Wait, but e is a tuple (value, index), and e[0] is the value.

So, it's setting row[i] to be the minimum value in the previous d columns plus row[i] + 1.

But in the first loop, row[0] = 1, and for i in range(1, d), row[i] = row[i] + 2.

I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

In the problem, the cost of placing a support at column j is a_{i,j} + 1.

We need to place supports at column 1 and column m, and possibly some in between, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of all supports placed.

We need to minimize this total cost.

This sounds like we need to select a subset of columns to place supports, with the constraints that:

- Column 1 and column m have supports.

- No two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

And minimize the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for all j where a support is placed.

This is similar to the classic "jump game" with costs, where you can jump up to d steps at a time, and each jump has a cost.

In dynamic programming terms, dp[j] = the minimal cost to reach column j from column 1, following the rules.

The recurrence would be:

dp[j] = min over all k where j - d <= k < j and k has a support, of dp[k] + cost of placing a support at j.

But since we can choose which columns to place supports, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, but in the code, it's assuming that for each row, the minimal cost to build the bridge is computed by func_1(row, d), which uses a sliding window minimum approach.

Let me see if this makes sense.

In func_1(row, d):

- row[0] = 1: this sets the cost of placing a support at column 1 to 1 (since a_{i,1} = 0, and 0 + 1 = 1).

- for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2: I'm not sure about this part. If d is greater than 1, this adds 2 to the cost of columns 1 to d-1. But why +2?

Wait, maybe it's a mistake. Let's think differently.

Perhaps the dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach column j.

So, dp[0] = 1 (since support must be placed at column 1).

For j from 1 to m-1:

dp[j] = min over k where j - d <= k < j, of dp[k] + (a[j] + 1 if k < j - 1 else 0)

Wait, but this seems off.

Wait, perhaps dp[j] is the minimal cost to reach column j, assuming a support is placed at j.

Then, for each j from 1 to m:

dp[j] = min over k where j - d <= k < j, of dp[k] + a[j] + 1

But then, we need to ensure that supports are placed at column 1 and column m.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

- We must place supports at column 1 and column m.

- We can place supports in any columns in between, with the distance constraint.

- The total cost is the sum of a[j] + 1 for each j where a support is placed.

So, to minimize this, we need to choose a set of columns to place supports, including column 1 and m, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart, and the sum of a[j] + 1 is minimized.

This is similar to selecting a subset of columns to place supports optimally.

The dynamic programming approach would be:

dp[j] = minimal total cost to place supports from column 1 to column j, following the rules.

Initialization:

dp[0] = 1 (since support is placed at column 1)

For j from 1 to m:

dp[j] = min over k where j - d <= k < j, of dp[k] + (a[j] + 1 if k < j - 1 else 0)

Wait, no. Since if k = j - 1, and we're placing a support at j, we need to add a[j] + 1 to dp[k].

Wait, actually, it's simpler:

dp[j] = min over k where j - d <= k < j, of dp[k] + (a[j] + 1 if k < j - 1 else 0)

But this seems incorrect. Let's think again.

Actually, for each j, dp[j] is the minimal cost to reach j from column 1, placing supports appropriately.

So, dp[j] = min over k where j - d <= k < j and a support is placed at k, of dp[k] + (a[j] + 1 if a support is placed at j else 0)

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps it's better to use the approach in the code and see if it makes sense.

In the code, func_1(row, d):

- Sets row[0] = 1

- For i in range(1, d), sets row[i] = row[i] + 2

- Initializes a min-heap with the first d elements

- For each i from d to m-1:

- Pops elements from the heap that are outside the window

- Sets row[i] = minimum in the window + row[i] + 1

- Pushes the new element into the heap

Finally, returns row[-1]

Wait, perhaps row[i] in this context is dp[j], the minimal cost to reach column j.

Let's see:

- dp[0] = 1

- For j from 1 to d-1:

dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + (a[j] + 1 if j > 1 else 0)

But in the code, it's setting row[i] = row[i] + 2 for i in range(1, d)

Wait, this doesn't seem to match.

Wait, maybe it's implementing the sliding window minimum to compute dp[j].

In standard dynamic programming for this kind of problem, dp[j] = min over k in [max(0, j - d), j - 1] of dp[k] + cost[j], where cost[j] = a[j] + 1.

So, dp[j] = min_{k in [j - d, j - 1]} (dp[k] + a[j] + 1)

But since a[j] + 1 is constant for j, it's dp[j] = (a[j] + 1) + min_{k in [j - d, j - 1]} dp[k]

So, to compute dp[j], we need the minimum dp[k] in the previous d columns.

This can be efficiently computed using a sliding window minimum approach.

The sliding window minimum can be computed using a deque or a heap.

In the code, it's using a heap to keep track of the minimum dp[k] in the window.

So, in func_1(row, d):

- Initialize dp as row

- Set dp[0] = 1 (since support is placed at column 1)

- For j from 1 to d-1:

dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + (a[j] + 1 if j > 1 else 0)

Wait, but in the code, it's setting row[i] = row[i] + 2 for i in range(1, d)

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps row[i] is being used to store dp[i].

Let me try to rewrite func_1 to make it clearer.

def func_1(row, d):

dp = row.copy()

dp[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (row[i] + 1)

min_heap = [(dp[i], i) for i in range(d)]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while min_heap[0][1] <= i - d - 1:

heappop(min_heap)

dp[i] = min_heap[0][0] + (row[i] + 1)

heappush(min_heap, (dp[i], i))

return dp[-1]

This seems more accurate.

So, dp[i] = min over k in [i - d, i - 1] dp[k] + (row[i] + 1)

This matches the dynamic programming recurrence I derived earlier.

So, func_1 correctly computes the minimal cost to build a bridge on a single row.

Then, in func_2:

- Read n, m, k, d

- Read n rows of depths

- Compute the cost for each row using func_1

- Compute the total cost for each consecutive k rows and find the minimum total cost

This seems correct.

So, overall, the program seems to be correctly solving the problem.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{4} \]
