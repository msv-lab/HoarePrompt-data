Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x and at least 1, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, the result is as large as possible. Basically, I need to maximize gcd(x, y) + y.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. The greatest common divisor of x and y is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, because 2 is the biggest number that divides both 6 and 4.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to choose y in a way that this sum is as big as possible, given that y is less than x.

Let me think about this. Since y is added to gcd(x, y), and y is less than x, I want y to be as large as possible to make the sum bigger. But I also need to consider gcd(x, y). If y is very close to x, say y = x - 1, what is gcd(x, x-1)?

Well, consecutive integers are coprime, meaning their gcd is 1. So, if y = x - 1, then gcd(x, y) = 1. Therefore, the sum would be 1 + (x - 1) = x.

Is there a way to get a sum larger than x? Let's see.

Suppose y is not x - 1. Maybe y is x - 2. What's gcd(x, x - 2)? It depends on x.

For example, if x is even, x - 2 is also even, so gcd(x, x - 2) is at least 2. So, gcd(x, x - 2) + (x - 2) = 2 + (x - 2) = x.

Wait, that's the same as y = x - 1.

Let me try another example. Letâ€™s say x = 10.

Possible y values:

- y = 9: gcd(10, 9) = 1, sum = 1 + 9 = 10

- y = 8: gcd(10, 8) = 2, sum = 2 + 8 = 10

- y = 7: gcd(10, 7) = 1, sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 6: gcd(10, 6) = 2, sum = 2 + 6 = 8

- y = 5: gcd(10, 5) = 5, sum = 5 + 5 = 10

- y = 4: gcd(10, 4) = 2, sum = 2 + 4 = 6

- y = 3: gcd(10, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 2: gcd(10, 2) = 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: gcd(10, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

So, in this case, the maximum sum is 10, achieved by y = 5, y = 6, y = 8, and y = 9.

The problem says that if there are multiple y that satisfy the condition, I can choose any. So, for x = 10, y = 5 is a valid choice.

Looking at the example output, for x = 10, y = 5 is chosen.

Another example in the input is x = 7.

Possible y values:

- y = 6: gcd(7, 6) = 1, sum = 1 + 6 = 7

- y = 5: gcd(7, 5) = 1, sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 4: gcd(7, 4) = 1, sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 3: gcd(7, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 2: gcd(7, 2) = 1, sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 1: gcd(7, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

So, the maximum sum is 7, achieved by y = 6.

In the example output, y = 6 is chosen for x = 7.

Another one: x = 21.

Possible y:

- y = 20: gcd(21, 20) = 1, sum = 1 + 20 = 21

- y = 19: gcd(21, 19) = 1, sum = 1 + 19 = 20

- y = 18: gcd(21, 18) = 3, sum = 3 + 18 = 21

- y = 17: gcd(21, 17) = 1, sum = 1 + 17 = 18

- y = 16: gcd(21, 16) = 1, sum = 1 + 16 = 17

- y = 15: gcd(21, 15) = 3, sum = 3 + 15 = 18

- y = 14: gcd(21, 14) = 7, sum = 7 + 14 = 21

- y = 13: gcd(21, 13) = 1, sum = 1 + 13 = 14

- y = 12: gcd(21, 12) = 3, sum = 3 + 12 = 15

- y = 11: gcd(21, 11) = 1, sum = 1 + 11 = 12

- y = 10: gcd(21, 10) = 1, sum = 1 + 10 = 11

- y = 9: gcd(21, 9) = 3, sum = 3 + 9 = 12

- y = 8: gcd(21, 8) = 1, sum = 1 + 8 = 9

- y = 7: gcd(21, 7) = 7, sum = 7 + 7 = 14

- y = 6: gcd(21, 6) = 3, sum = 3 + 6 = 9

- y = 5: gcd(21, 5) = 1, sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 4: gcd(21, 4) = 1, sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 3: gcd(21, 3) = 3, sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 2: gcd(21, 2) = 1, sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 1: gcd(21, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

So, the maximum sum is 21, achieved by y = 20, y = 18, y = 14.

In the example output, y = 18 is chosen for x = 21.

Another one: x = 2.

Possible y:

- y = 1: gcd(2, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

That's the only option. So, y = 1 is chosen, as in the example.

Looking at these examples, it seems that choosing y = x - 1 always gives a sum of x, and in some cases, there are other y that also give the same sum. Sometimes, there are y that give a higher sum, but in the examples provided, the chosen y gives a sum equal to x.

Wait, in the x = 10 case, y = 5 gives sum = 10, which is the same as y = 9.

Similarly, for x = 7, y = 6 gives sum = 7.

For x = 21, y = 18 gives sum = 21.

So, it seems like the sum is always x in these cases.

Is this always true? Let's see for x = 100.

Possible y:

- y = 99: gcd(100, 99) = 1, sum = 1 + 99 = 100

- y = 98: gcd(100, 98) = 2, sum = 2 + 98 = 100

- y = 95: gcd(100, 95) = 5, sum = 5 + 95 = 100

- y = 90: gcd(100, 90) = 10, sum = 10 + 90 = 100

- y = 80: gcd(100, 80) = 20, sum = 20 + 80 = 100

- y = 75: gcd(100, 75) = 25, sum = 25 + 75 = 100

- y = 50: gcd(100, 50) = 50, sum = 50 + 50 = 100

- y = 25: gcd(100, 25) = 25, sum = 25 + 25 = 50

- y = 20: gcd(100, 20) = 20, sum = 20 + 20 = 40

- y = 10: gcd(100, 10) = 10, sum = 10 + 10 = 20

- y = 5: gcd(100, 5) = 5, sum = 5 + 5 = 10

- y = 4: gcd(100, 4) = 4, sum = 4 + 4 = 8

- y = 2: gcd(100, 2) = 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: gcd(100, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

So, for x = 100, any y that is a divisor of 100 will give sum = x, and other y give lower sums.

In the example, y = 98 is chosen for x = 100, which also gives sum = 100.

Similarly, for x = 1000, y = 750 is chosen, which gives gcd(1000, 750) = 250, sum = 250 + 750 = 1000.

Wait, but x = 1000, y = 750:

gcd(1000, 750) = 250, sum = 250 + 750 = 1000.

But y = 999 would give gcd(1000, 999) = 1, sum = 1 + 999 = 1000.

So, again, sum is x.

It seems consistent that choosing y = x - 1 gives sum = x.

But is there a way to get a sum greater than x?

Let me think.

Suppose x = 6.

Possible y:

- y = 5: gcd(6, 5) = 1, sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 4: gcd(6, 4) = 2, sum = 2 + 4 = 6

- y = 3: gcd(6, 3) = 3, sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 2: gcd(6, 2) = 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: gcd(6, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Again, sum is at most 6.

In the example, y = 3 is chosen for x = 6, which gives sum = 6.

So, in all these cases, the maximum sum seems to be x.

Is this always the case?

Let me consider x = 4.

Possible y:

- y = 3: gcd(4, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 2: gcd(4, 2) = 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: gcd(4, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Again, sum is 4.

Another one: x = 5.

Possible y:

- y = 4: gcd(5, 4) = 1, sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 3: gcd(5, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 2: gcd(5, 2) = 1, sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 1: gcd(5, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Sum is at most 5.

Seems consistent.

So, it seems that the maximum sum is always x, and any y that is a divisor of x or y = x - 1 achieves this sum.

Given that, the problem allows me to choose any y that achieves this maximum sum.

So, in the program provided, it simply chooses y = x - 1 for each x.

From the examples, y = x - 1 is a valid choice, as it gives sum = x, which is the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
