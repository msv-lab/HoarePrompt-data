Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two together at a promotional price of b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of money Maxim has to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which tells me how many scenarios I need to handle. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the regular price per yogurt, and b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

My task is to output the minimum cost for each test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9. Buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 9 burles, which is less than buying them individually for 10 burles (5 each). So, the minimum cost is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9. If I buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and one individual yogurt (5), the total is 14. Alternatively, buying all three individually would cost 15 (5*3). So, 14 is cheaper.

Third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11. Buying one promotion (2 yogurts for 11) and one individual yogurt (5) totals 16. But the note says it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles. Wait, but according to the problem, I can only buy two yogurts at the promotion price, so how is buying three for 15 possible? Oh, maybe it's implying that in this case, b is higher than 2a, so it's better to buy individually.

Wait, no. In the third test case, buying two yogurts with the promotion costs 11, and one individually costs 5, totaling 16. But the output is 15, which suggests that perhaps there's a different way to interpret the promotion, but according to the problem statement, the promotion is only for buying two yogurts for b burles. So, maybe in this case, it's better to buy two individually for 10 (5 each) and one with the promotion for 11, but that would be 21, which is worse. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that I can choose to buy two yogurts at the promotion price or at the regular price. So, for n=3, a=5, b=11, I can buy one pair at promotion price 11 and one individually at 5, totaling 16, or buy all three individually at 15. Wait, but according to the note, buying three individually is 15, which is less than 16, so the minimum is 15.

Wait, but according to the problem, when buying two yogurts, I can choose to buy them at the regular price (2*5=10) or at the promotion price (11). So, in this case, buying two at regular price (10) and one individually (5) would total 15, which is better than buying two at promotion price (11) and one individually (5), which would be 16.

So, in this scenario, it's better to buy two yogurts at the regular price and one individually.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11. Buying two pairs at promotion price would be 22, or buying two pairs at regular price would be 20 (2*5*2=20). So, 20 is cheaper than 22, hence the output is 20.

From this, I can see that the strategy should be:

- If the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than the regular price for two (2*a), then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price, and buy any remaining yogurt individually.

- If the regular price for two yogurts (2*a) is less than or equal to the promotion price (b), then it's better to buy all yogurts at the regular price.

But wait, in the third test case, a=5, b=11, so 2*a=10 < b=11, so it's better to buy all yogurts at the regular price, which would be 3*5=15, which matches the output.

In the second test case, a=5, b=9, so 2*a=10 > b=9, so it's better to buy as many pairs at the promotion price and any remaining yogurt individually.

For n=3, I can buy one pair at 9 and one individual at 5, totaling 14, which is less than buying all three individually for 15.

Wait, so my initial strategy needs adjustment.

I think the correct approach is:

- If b < 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy pairs at the promotion price.

- So, for n yogurts, I can buy floor(n/2) pairs at b each, and if n is odd, buy the remaining one at a.

- However, I need to consider if buying two individually is cheaper than buying a pair at b.

- So, actually, if b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible at b, and buy any remaining yogurt individually.

- If b >= 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at a each.

But in the third test case, b=11 >= 2*a=10, so buy all individually for 15, which matches the output.

In the second test case, b=9 < 2*a=10, so buy one pair at 9 and one individual at 5, totaling 14.

In the first test case, n=2, b=9 < 2*a=10, so buy one pair at 9.

In the fourth test case, b=11 >= 2*a=10, so buy all individually: 4*5=20.

Seems consistent.

So, generalizing:

- If b < 2*a, then cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

- Else, cost = n * a

Wait, but in the third test case, b=11 >= 2*a=10, so cost = 3 * 5 = 15

In the second test case, b=9 < 2*a=10, so cost = (3 // 2)*9 + (3 % 2)*5 = 1*9 + 1*5 = 14

In the first test case, n=2, b=9 < 2*a=10, so cost = (2//2)*9 + (2%2)*5 = 1*9 + 0*5 = 9

In the fourth test case, b=11 >= 2*a=10, so cost = 4*5 = 20

All match the example outputs.

So, my formula seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X)

print(X * C + B)

Wait, this seems problematic.

First, in the if condition: if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

This corresponds to the case when it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, which is correct.

Then, elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

This is for when n is even, and presumably b >= 2*a, but in this branch, it's printing A * C / 2, which seems odd. Wait, no, if n is even and b >= 2*a, then according to my earlier logic, we should just buy all individually: A * B. But here, it's printing A * C / 2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to buy n/2 pairs at price C each, so total cost would be (n/2) * C. But in the code, it's printing int(A * C / 2), which is mathematically the same as (A // 2) * C, assuming integer division.

But in Python 3, / performs floating-point division, and int() converts it to integer. So, int(A * C / 2) is equivalent to (A // 2) * C if A is even, but if A is odd, it would be ((A // 2) * C + C / 2), which is not what we want.

Wait, no, let's see:

For even A, A * C / 2 is exactly (A // 2) * C.

For odd A, A * C / 2 is (A // 2)*C + C/2, but since C is integer, C/2 could be a float, and then int() would truncate it.

But in any case, this seems error-prone and not clearly expressing the intention.

Moreover, in the else clause, which is when A is odd and b >= 2*a, it's printing X (which is A // 2), then printing X * C + B.

Wait, but in the function, it's printing X, and then X * C + B. But according to the problem, we should only print one line per test case, the minimum cost.

So, this seems incorrect because it's printing two lines: X and then X * C + B.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake, and it should only print X * C + B.

But in the first part, it's printing A * B when b * 2 < C, which seems inverted. Wait, no, in the code, it's if B * 2 < C: print(A * B), which matches my earlier logic.

But in the elif A % 2 == 0:, it's printing int(A * C / 2), which for even A, is equivalent to (A // 2) * C, which would be the cost of buying A/2 pairs at price C each.

But according to my earlier logic, if b >= 2*a, we should buy all individually at a each, which would be A * B.

So, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be if b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible at b, and remaining individually.

Else, buy all individually.

But in the code, it's if B * 2 < C: print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0: print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X)

print(X * C + B)

So, in the elif clause, when A is even and b >= 2*a, it's printing (A // 2) * C, which is buying A/2 pairs at price C each.

But according to my logic, it's better to buy all individually at A * B.

Similarly, in the else clause, for odd A, it's printing X (which is A // 2), then X * C + B, which seems like buying X pairs at C each and one individual at B, which would be correct only if b < 2*a.

But in this else clause, it's when b >= 2*a, which, according to my logic, should buy all individually at A * B.

So, this seems incorrect.

Looking back at the problem, it says: "When buying two yogurts, he can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price."

So, for each pair of yogurts, Maxim can choose whether to buy them at the promotion price b or at two individual prices a each.

So, the optimal strategy is:

- If b < 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy pairs at b.

- So, for n yogurts, buy floor(n/2) pairs at b, and if n is odd, buy the remaining yogurt individually at a.

- If b >= 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at a.

Hence, the cost is:

- If b < 2*a: cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

- Else: cost = n * a

So, the correct implementation should be:

for _ in range(t):

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if b < 2 * a:

cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

else:

cost = n * a

print(cost)

But in the given code, it's:

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X)

print(X * C + B)

This doesn't align with the correct logic.

In the first if clause, if b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible at b and remaining individually at a, which would be (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a.

But in the code, it's printing A * B, which is buying all individually at a, which is incorrect in this scenario.

For example, in the second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9.

Here, b=9 < 2*a=10, so should buy one pair at 9 and one individual at 5, total 14.

But according to the code, since b*2=18 < C is false, it goes to elif A % 2 == 0:, which is not true, so goes to else clause: X = A // 2 =1, print(X) and print(X*C + B), which is 1 and 1*9 +5=14.

But it's printing two lines:1 and 14, which is incorrect, as we need to print only one line per test case.

Moreover, in the first test case: n=2, a=5, b=9.

b*2=18 < C is false, so goes to elif A % 2 ==0:, which is true, so print(int(A*C /2))=int(2*9/2)=9, which matches the output.

But according to the correct logic, since b < 2*a, it should buy one pair at b=9.

So, in this case, it happens to be correct, but for n=3, it's printing two lines.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9.

Condition: B*2=18 < C is false, so goes to elif A % 2 ==0:, which is true, so print(int(A*C /2))=int(2*9/2)=9, which is correct.

For n=3, a=5, b=9.

B*2=18 < C is false, so goes to else clause: X = A // 2 =1, print(X) and print(X*C + B)=1 and 1*9 +5=14.

But according to the correct logic, since b < 2*a, should buy one pair at b=9 and one individual at a=5, total 14.

But the code is printing two lines:1 and 14, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the extra print(X) is a mistake, and it should only print X * C + B.

In that case, for n=3, it would print 14, which is correct.

Similarly, for n=4, a=5, b=11.

B*2=22 < C is false, so since A % 2 ==0, it prints int(A*C /2)=int(4*11/2)=22, but according to the correct logic, since b >= 2*a, should buy all individually at 4*5=20, which is better than 22.

So, in this case, the code is giving 22, but the correct cost is 20.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output for n=4, it's 20, but according to the code, it would print 22.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the code, for n=4, a=5, b=11.

B*2=22 < C is false, so since A % 2 ==0, it prints int(A*C /2)=int(4*11/2)=22, but according to the correct logic, since b >= 2*a, it should print A * B =4*5=20.

So, in this case, the code is giving 22, which is higher than 20, hence incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
