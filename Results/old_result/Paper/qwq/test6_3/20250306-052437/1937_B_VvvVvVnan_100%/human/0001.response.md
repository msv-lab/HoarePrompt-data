Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper that starts at the top-left cell (1,1) and wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along that path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when compared character by character in order. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in trying to find the smallest string, I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Given that the grid is only 2 rows high, it's a bit simpler than a general grid. The grasshopper can only move right or down, so the path can be represented by a sequence of moves: right and down. Since it has to go from (1,1) to (2,N), it needs to make exactly one down move and N-1 right moves in some order.

Wait, actually, no. It needs to go from (1,1) to (2,N), which means it needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step, as long as it ends up at (2,N).

But in reality, because it's only 2 rows, the down move can only be from row 1 to row 2. So, the path can have any number of right moves in row 1, then a single down move to row 2, and then the remaining right moves in row 2.

So, the path is: some number of right moves in row 1, then a down move to row 2, and then the remaining right moves in row 2.

Therefore, the position where the down move occurs is variable, and that will determine the string.

To find the lexicographically smallest string, I need to choose the path where the sequence of cells gives the smallest possible string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider all possible down move positions and construct the strings, then compare them. But that would be inefficient for large N, since N can be up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to find the minimal string without generating all possible paths.

Let me consider the two possible choices at each step:

- Move right in the current row.

- If in row 1, can also move down to row 2.

But since moving down can only happen once, and it's from some position in row 1 to the corresponding position in row 2, then continues right in row 2.

So, the string is constructed by taking the cells in order: starting from (1,1), then either moving right in row 1 or down to row 2 and then right in row 2.

I need to choose where to make the down move to minimize the string lexicographically.

Let me consider that the string is composed of parts from row 1 and row 2, connected at the down move.

So, the string is: part of row 1 from column 1 to some column k, then part of row 2 from column k to column N.

I need to choose k such that the combined string is lex smallest.

But it's not just about choosing one k, because for different k's, the strings are different.

Wait, actually, for each k from 1 to N, there is a path that corresponds to moving right k times in row 1, then down to row 2 at column k, then right (N - k) times in row 2.

So, for each k from 1 to N, there is a path that collects a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2,k+1}, ..., a_{2N}.

I need to choose the k that gives the smallest string among all these possibilities.

But again, comparing all these strings for large N is not efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me think about it differently.

Since the grid has only two rows, I can consider the path as choosing a point in row 1 where I stay as long as possible, collecting '0's, and then switch to row 2 as early as possible when necessary to get a '0'.

Wait, no. I need to minimize the string lexicographically, which means getting '0's as early as possible.

So, perhaps I should stay in row 1 as long as possible, collecting '0's, and switch to row 2 only when row 1 has a '1' and row 2 has a '0' at the next column, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the point where row 1 has a '1' and row 2 has a '0' at the previous column.

Hmm, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the string is composed of the sequence of cells from row 1 up to some point, then row 2 from that point onwards.

I need to choose the switch point to minimize the string.

To find the minimal string, I can think of it as finding the minimal possible sequence by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints of the grid.

But because the path has dependencies (you can't arbitrarily choose characters), I need to be careful.

An alternative approach is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimal string and the number of paths that achieve it.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j][s] as the number of paths to reach cell (i,j) with the string s.

But that seems too memory-intensive and slow for N up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, since we're dealing with binary strings and we need the lex smallest one, perhaps I can greedily choose the path that has the smallest possible character at each step.

But in a 2xN grid, with only one down move, it's tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start at (1,1).

- At each step, choose to stay in the current row if possible, i.e., if the current cell is '0' and the next cell in the same row is '0' or equal to the current one.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, think about it this way:

- The string is built by concatenating parts of row 1 and row 2.

- To get the lex smallest string, I should choose to stay in row 1 as long as possible, collecting '0's, and switch to row 2 only when necessary.

- But what is the condition to switch?

- Suppose at some column k, if a_{1,k} > a_{2,k}, then it's better to switch to row 2 before that.

- Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two strings: one from row 1 and one from row 2.

I need to merge them in a way that simulates the path.

But it's not exactly merging, because the path has dependencies.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching to row 2 gives a better string.

Let me consider that for each k from 1 to N, the string is a_{11} to a_{1k} followed by a_{2k} to a_{2N}.

I need to choose k such that this combined string is lex smallest.

To find the smallest such string, I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible character at each position.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate column by column and decide whether to switch to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the current string as empty.

Initialize the current row as row 1.

For each column j from 1 to N:

- If staying in the current row gives a smaller or equal character than switching to the other row, stay in the current row.

- Else, switch to the other row.

But I need to think carefully about when to switch.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the remaining parts of the string if I switch at this point versus staying.

But that seems too slow for large N.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that the string is determined by choosing a switch point k, where k is the column where I switch from row 1 to row 2.

So, the string is a_{11} to a_{1k} followed by a_{2k} to a_{2N}.

I need to choose k such that this string is lex smallest.

To find the lex smallest among these options, I can find the minimal possible string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position.

So, for position 1, I have a_{11}.

For position 2, I have a_{12} if I stay in row 1, or a_{21} if I switch at column 1.

Wait, but switching at column 1 means taking a_{11}, then a_{21} to a_{2N}.

But in that case, position 2 of the string would be a_{21}.

Whereas, if I stay in row 1 until column 2, the string up to position 2 would be a_{11}a_{12}.

So, I need to choose, for each position, the smallest possible character, considering the constraints of the grid.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the current row and the current position, and choose the minimal possible character at each step.

Let me try to define dp[j][r], where j is the current column, and r is the current row.

dp[j][r] represents the lex smallest string from position 1 to j when ending at row r.

But dp[j][r] would be a string of length j, which is not efficient for large N.

Instead, perhaps I can keep track of the choices that lead to the minimal string.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal string step by step.

Let me try to think of it in terms of steps.

At each step, I can choose to move right in the current row or, if in row 1, move down to row 2 and then move right in row 2.

I need to choose the path that gives the lex smallest string.

I can use a greedy approach: always choose the path that gives the smallest possible character at the current position.

But since the path has dependencies, I need to look ahead to decide whether to switch rows or stay.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each column whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row based on which choice gives the smallest character at that position.

But because switching affects future choices, I need to be careful.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start at (1,1).

- At each column, choose the row (either stay in the current row or switch to the other row if possible) that gives the smallest character at that position.

- Since you can only switch from row 1 to row 2, once you switch to row 2, you can't go back to row 1.

Wait, that might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- Current row = 1

- String = empty

- Count = 1 (number of paths)

For each column j from 1 to N:

- If current row is 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1j} to the string.

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2j} to the string.

- Choose the option that gives the smallest possible character at this position.

- If both options give the same character, choose both and update the count accordingly.

- If chose to stay in row 1, increment the count if both options were equal.

- If chose to switch to row 2, set current row to 2.

- Else, if current row is 2:

- Only option: stay in row 2, append a_{2j} to the string.

This seems promising.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

Example 1:

n = 2

s1 = 00

s2 = 00

So, grid:

0 0

0 0

Following the algorithm:

Start at (1,1), current row = 1

Column 1:

Option 1: stay in row 1, append '0'

Option 2: switch to row 2, append '0'

Both options give '0', so choose both, count = 2, string = '0'

Column 2:

Current row can be 1 or 2.

Option 1: stay in row 1, append '0'

Option 2: switch to row 2, append '0'

Both options give '0', so choose both, count = 2, string = '00'

Since n=2, stop here.

So, the minimal string is '00' and count is 2.

But according to the sample input, the output is '000', which has length 3.

Wait, n=2, so the string should have length 3, because the path includes n+1 cells: from (1,1) to (2,2), passing through either (1,2) or (2,1).

Wait, no. Wait, in the sample input, n=2, and the output is '000', which has length 3, corresponding to the path (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2), or (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2), both giving '000'.

So, in my earlier understanding, I thought the string is of length n, but according to the problem, it's of length n+1, because the path includes n+1 cells.

Wait, let's verify:

From (1,1) to (2,2), the possible paths are:

- (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2): cells a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}

- (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2): cells a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}

So, indeed, the string has length 3 for n=2.

In my earlier approach, I thought the string has length n, but according to the problem, it's n+1.

I need to correct that.

So, the string has length n+1, not n.

Hence, in the first example, '000' is correct.

In my earlier attempt, I误以为字符串长度是n，但实际上它是n+1。

所以，我需要修正我的方法来处理长度为n+1的字符串。

让我重新思考一下。

由于路径是从(1,1)到(2,n)，每次移动要么向右，要么向下，因此路径的长度总是n+1步。

因此，字符串的长度是n+1。

现在，我需要找到所有可能的路径，并找到其中lexicographically最小的字符串，以及有多少条路径产生这个最小字符串。

由于直接比较所有可能的路径是不现实的，因为n可以达到2e5，所以需要一个更高效的方法。

让我尝试重新定义动态规划。

定义dp[j]表示到达第j列时的最小字符串以及路径数。

但是，由于字符串是逐步构建的，比较字符串会很耗时。

也许我可以维护当前的最小字符串和对应的路径数。

让我尝试以下方法：

初始化：

- 当前最小字符串为一个空列表。

- 路径数为1。

从第1列开始，到第n列结束。

对于每一列j从1到n：

- 如果当前在第1行：

- 选择 staying in row 1: appends a1[j]

- 选择 switching to row 2: appends a2[j]

- 选择哪个选项使得当前字符串最小。

- 如果两个选项的当前字符相同，则两种选择都保留，并将路径数相加。

- 如果选择staying in row 1，然后继续。

- 如果选择switching to row 2，则之后必须在row 2。

- 如果当前在第2行：

- 只能选择 staying in row 2: appends a2[j]

这听起来有点像序列比对中的动态规划。

让我尝试用动态规划来实现。

定义 dp[j][r]，其中r=0表示row1，r=1表示row2。

dp[j][r]表示到达第j列第r行时的最小字符串和路径数。

初始化：

dp[1][0] = (s1[0], 1) # (string, count)

dp[1][1] = (s2[0], 1)

然后，对于每一列j从2到n：

对于每一行r=0 or 1：

如果r=0（row1）：

- 只能从dp[j-1][0]过来，appends s1[j-1]

如果r=1（row2）：

- 可以从dp[j-1][0]切换过来，appends s2[j-1]

- 或者从dp[j-1][1]过来，appends s2[j-1]

然后，比较dp[j][0]和dp[j][1]的字符串，选择最小的。

但这仍然需要比较字符串，对于n=2e5，会超时。

我需要优化比较过程。

也许我可以维护一个当前的最小字符串前缀，以及在该前缀下的路径数。

让我尝试这个方法。

初始化：

- 当前最小字符串为空列表。

- 路径数为1。

对于每一列j从1到n：

- 如果当前在row1：

- 选择staying in row1: appends s1[j-1]

- 选择switching to row2: appends s2[j-1]

- 比较这两个选择的当前字符。

- 选择较小的字符。

- 如果两个字符相等，则路径数相加。

- 如果选择switching to row2，则之后必须在row2。

- 如果当前在row2：

- 只能选择staying in row2: appends s2[j-1]

这听起来和之前的想法一样，但需要更具体的实现。

让我尝试写一个伪代码。

Initialize:

current_string = []

count = 1

current_row = 0 # 0 for row1, 1 for row2

For j from 1 to n:

if current_row == 0:

option1 = s1[j-1]

option2 = s2[j-1]

if option1 < option2:

# choose stay in row1

current_string.append(option1)

# count remains the same

elif option2 < option1:

# choose switch to row2

current_string.append(option2)

current_row = 1

count = count

else:

# option1 == option2

# both choices are equal, so both paths are valid

# append option1 (or option2, since they are equal)

current_string.append(option1)

# count is the sum of both paths

count *= 2

if current_row == 1:

# can only stay in row2

current_string.append(s2[j-1])

count = count

else:

# can't do anything, stay in row2

pass

Wait, but this doesn't account for the fact that once you switch to row2, you can't go back to row1.

But in the above logic, if current_row == 0, you can choose to stay in row1 or switch to row2.

If you choose to switch to row2, then current_row becomes 1, and from there on, you can only stay in row2.

This seems manageable.

Let me test this logic with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Initialize:

current_string = []

count = 1

current_row = 0

For j=1:

current_row = 0

option1 = s1[0] = '0'

option2 = s2[0] = '0'

option1 == option2, so append '0' and count *= 2 => count = 2

For j=2:

current_row could be 0 or 1, depending on previous choices.

Wait, in my current logic, current_row is determined by the last choice.

Wait, in the first iteration, since option1 == option2, I set current_row to still be 0, but count *=2.

Wait, I need to track both possibilities.

This seems too simplistic.

Maybe I need to track whether we have switched to row2 or not.

Let me try to keep track of two states:

- stayed in row1 until some point

- switched to row2 at some point

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the minimal string and the counts for each possible state.

Define two variables:

- min_str_row1: the minimal string if staying in row1

- min_str_row2: the minimal string if switching to row2 at some point

- counts_row1: the number of paths for min_str_row1

- counts_row2: the number of paths for min_str_row2

Then, for each column, update these variables.

But it's getting complicated.

An alternative approach is to iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row1 or switch to row2 based on which choice gives the smallest possible character at that position.

To make it efficient, perhaps I can find the first column where s1[j] > s2[j], and switch there.

But that might not always give the correct answer, because switching at an earlier column might lead to a smaller string in the subsequent columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose to switch at the earliest possible position where s2 has a smaller character.

But it's not that straightforward.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one that, at each position, has the smallest possible character, given the constraints of the path.

To achieve this, I need to choose, for each column, whether to stay in row1 or switch to row2, in a way that minimizes the string.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the minimal string and the counts for each possible state.

Given the constraints of time and complexity, I need an O(N) solution.

Let me try to implement the following approach:

- Initialize two variables: min_str_row1 and min_str_row2, both as empty lists.

- Initialize counts for each: count_row1 and count_row2, both starting at 1.

- For each column j from 1 to n:

- If staying in row1 gives a smaller string than switching to row2, update min_str_row1 and count_row1.

- Else if switching to row2 gives a smaller string, update min_str_row2 and count_row2.

- If both choices give the same string, merge them.

- Finally, choose the smaller of min_str_row1 and min_str_row2 as the overall minimal string, and sum the counts.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two possible states: one where we stay in row1, and one where we have switched to row2.

At each step, update both states based on the possible moves.

Let me try to implement this.

Define:

- row1_str: the minimal string if we stay in row1 up to column j.

- row2_str: the minimal string if we have switched to row2 at some column <= j.

- row1_count: the number of paths for row1_str.

- row2_count: the number of paths for row2_str.

Initialize:

- row1_str = [s1[0]]

- row2_str = [s2[0]]

- row1_count = 1

- row2_count = 1

For j from 1 to n-1:

- Option 1: stay in row1

- new_row1_str = row1_str + [s1[j]]

- new_row2_str = row2_str + [s2[j]]

- Option 2: switch to row2 from row1

- switch_str = row1_str + [s2[j]]

- if switch_str < new_row2_str:

- row2_str = switch_str

- row2_count = row1_count

- elif switch_str == new_row2_str:

- row2_count += row1_count

- row1_str = row1_str + [s1[j]]

- row1_count = row1_count

- row2_str = row2_str + [s2[j]]

- row2_count = row2_count

Wait, perhaps I need to compare the strings step by step.

This seems too involved.

An alternative approach is to find the point where switching to row2 gives a better string.

Let me try to find the minimal string by iterating through the columns and keeping track of the minimal possible string prefix.

Initialize:

- current_min_str = []

- current_counts = [1]

For each column j from 1 to n:

- Consider the current possible choices:

- If staying in row1: append s1[j-1]

- If switching to row2: append s2[j-1]

- Choose the smallest possible character at this position.

- If both choices give the same character, take both paths.

- Update the current_min_str and current_counts accordingly.

But I need to manage the states where we have stayed in row1 or switched to row2.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of two lists: one for paths that are still in row1 and one for paths that have switched to row2.

Initialize:

- row1_str = [s1[0]]

- row2_str = [s2[0]]

- row1_count = 1

- row2_count = 1

For j from 1 to n-1:

- If row1_str < row2_str:

- Choose to stay in row1

- row1_str.append(s1[j])

- row1_count += row1_count

- Else if row2_str < row1_str:

- Choose to switch to row2

- row2_str.append(s2[j])

- row2_count += row2_count

- Else:

- If s1[j] < s2[j]:

- row1_str.append(s1[j])

- row1_count += row1_count

- row2_str.append(s2[j])

- row2_count += row2_count

- Else:

- row2_str.append(s2[j])

- row2_count += row1_count + row2_count

Wait, this is getting messy.

I need a better way to handle this.

Let me look at the sample input again.

Sample Input 1:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Expected Output:

000

2

According to my earlier logic, if I choose to stay in row1 for both columns, the string is '000' with count=2.

Sample Input 2:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Expected Output:

11000

1

In this case, the minimal string is '11000', and there's only one path that gives this string.

Sample Input 3:

n=8

s1=00100111

s2=11101101

Expected Output:

001001101

4

So, for n=8, the minimal string is '001001101', and there are 4 paths that give this string.

I need to find a way to generalize this.

Perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row1 or switch to row2 based on which choice gives the smaller character at that position.

But I need to consider that switching to row2 affects the subsequent choices.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string prefix.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize:

- current_min_str = []

- current_counts = 0

- current_row = 0 (row1)

For j from 1 to n:

- if current_row == 0:

- option1: stay in row1, append s1[j-1]

- option2: switch to row2, append s2[j-1]

- if option1 < option2:

- choose option1

- current_min_str.append(s1[j-1])

- current_counts remains the same

- elif option2 < option1:

- choose option2

- current_min_str.append(s2[j-1])

- current_row = 1

- else:

- both options are equal

- choose both

- current_min_str.append(s1[j-1])

- current_counts *= 2

- else:

- must stay in row2, append s2[j-1]

- current_counts remains the same

Wait, let's test this with sample input 1:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Initialize:

current_min_str = []

current_counts = 1

current_row = 0

j=1:

current_row=0

option1: s1[0]='0'

option2: s2[0]='0'

option1 == option2

choose both

current_min_str.append('0')

current_counts *=2 => current_counts=2

j=2:

current_row=0 (since in previous step, both options were equal, and we stayed in row1)

option1: s1[1]='0'

option2: s2[1]='0'

option1 == option2

choose both

current_min_str.append('0')

current_counts *=2 => current_counts=4

But according to the sample input, the output should be '000' with count=2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

I must have a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the path consists of moving right in row1 up to some column k, then switching to row2 at column k, and then moving right in row2 to column n.

So, for each k from 1 to n, there is a path that collects s1[1..k] and s2[k..n].

I need to find the k that gives the lex smallest string s1[1..k] + s2[k..n].

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to n and find the minimal concatenation.

But for n=2e5, iterating through all k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider merging the two strings s1 and s2 in a way that simulates the path.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s1 starts being larger than s2.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of the longest common prefix.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints of the path.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function to find the lex smallest string:

Initialize an empty list for the result.

Initialize two pointers: one for row1 and one for row2.

Initialize counts accordingly.

At each step, decide whether to take the character from row1 or row2.

But since the path has dependencies, I need to consider the alignment of the strings.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Perhaps I can find the minimal string by scanning the grid column by column and choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering the possible moves.

Wait, maybe I can use a priority queue to keep track of the current minimal string prefix and the corresponding path counts.

But that might be too slow for n=2e5.

I need a linear time solution.

Let me consider that the minimal string is constructed by choosing to stay in row1 as long as s1[j] <= s2[j], and switch to row2 when s2[j] < s1[j].

But this might not always be correct, because switching early might lead to smaller strings in some cases.

Wait, let me think about it.

Suppose s1 = 01 and s2 = 00, n=2.

If I stay in row1 until s1[j] > s2[j], which is at j=2, then switch to row2 at j=2.

So, the string would be s1[1] + s1[2] + s2[2] = 010

But if I switch at j=1, the string would be s1[1] + s2[1] + s2[2] = 000, which is smaller.

So, in this case, switching early gives a smaller string.

Hence, my previous idea is incorrect.

Therefore, I need a way to find the earliest column where switching to row2 gives a smaller string.

But how to determine that efficiently?

Let me consider computing the minimal possible string by finding the point where s2 starts being smaller than s1.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal string by finding the minimal suffix in s2 and prefix in s1.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal string by finding the minimal concatenation of a prefix of s1 and a suffix of s2.

So, I need to find k in 1..n such that s1[1..k] + s2[k..n] is lex smallest.

To find the minimal such concatenation, I can iterate k from 1 to n and find the minimal string among s1[1..k] + s2[k..n].

But for n=2e5, this is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the minimal possible concatenation of a prefix of s1 and a suffix of s2.

I can compute the minimal such concatenation by finding the point where s2 starts being smaller than s1.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the difference between s1 and s2 and find the first position where s2 is smaller.

But that might not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal string by finding the minimal possible character at each position, considering the possible switches.

Let me try to think in terms of the minimal possible character at each step.

Initialize:

- current_min_str = []

- current_counts = 1

- current_row = 0 (row1)

For j from 1 to n:

- if current_row == 0:

- option1: stay in row1, append s1[j-1]

- option2: switch to row2, append s2[j-1]

- if option1 < option2:

- choose option1

- current_min_str.append(s1[j-1])

- else if option2 < option1:

- choose option2

- current_min_str.append(s2[j-1])

- current_row = 1

- else:

- both options are equal

- choose both

- current_min_str.append(s1[j-1])

- current_counts *= 2

- else:

- must stay in row2, append s2[j-1]

- current_counts remains the same

Wait, let's test this with sample input 1:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Initialize:

current_min_str = []

current_counts =1

current_row=0

j=1:

current_row=0

option1=s1[0]='0'

option2=s2[0]='0'

option1 == option2

choose both

current_min_str.append('0')

current_counts *=2 => current_counts=2

j=2:

current_row=0 (since in previous step, both options were equal)

option1=s1[1]='0'

option2=s2[1]='0'

option1 == option2

choose both

current_min_str.append('0')

current_counts *=2 => current_counts=4

But according to the sample input, the output should be '000' with count=2.

Wait, there's a mismatch.

In the sample input, n=2, so the string should have length 3: s1[1], s1[2], s2[2] or s1[1], s2[1], s2[2].

So, in my approach, I need to ensure that the string has length n+1.

Wait, in my earlier steps, I only have two characters in current_min_str, but it should have three.

I need to adjust my approach to account for the fact that the path includes n+1 cells.

Wait, no. Actually, for n=2, the path includes three cells: from (1,1) to (2,2), passing through either (1,2) or (2,1).

Hence, the string should have three characters.

In my earlier approach, I was only appending one character per column, but I need to append an additional character when switching rows.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that switching rows adds an extra character.

Wait, no. Each move adds one character to the string.

In the path (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2), it's three characters: s1[1], s1[2], s2[2]

In the path (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2), it's s1[1], s2[1], s2[2]

Hence, for n=2, the string has length 3.

In my earlier approach, I was appending one character per column, but I need to account for the switch properly.

I think my earlier approach is flawed.

Let me try a different strategy.

Let me consider that the string is composed of the first k characters from s1 followed by the last n characters from s2 starting from column k.

Wait, no. It's more nuanced.

In the path (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2), the string is s1[1], s1[2], s2[2]

In the path (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2), the string is s1[1], s2[1], s2[2]

Hence, for each k from 1 to n, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..n]

Wait, no. For k=1, it's s1[1], s2[1], s2[2]

For k=2, it's s1[1], s1[2], s2[2]

Hence, in general, for k from 1 to n, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..n]

Wait, but s2[k..n] includes s2[k], which is already included in s1[1..k] if k>1.

Wait, no, s1[1..k] and s2[k..n] are distinct parts.

Wait, actually, in the path where you stay in row1 up to column k, then switch to row2 at column k, and continue to column n in row2.

Hence, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..n]

Hence, for each k from 1 to n, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..n]

Hence, to find the minimal string, I can find the minimal concatenation among s1[1..k] + s2[k..n] for k=1 to n.

But for n=2e5, iterating through all k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the minimal possible among these concatenations.

Hence, I can find the minimal string by finding the minimal possible prefix from s1 and suffix from s2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s2 starts being smaller than s1.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that s1[1..k] + s2[k..n] is minimal.

This seems similar to finding the minimal concatenation of prefix and suffix.

I recall that to find the minimal rotation of a string, one can use the concept of suffix array.

But here, it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I can concatenate s2 and s1, and find the lexicographically smallest string starting from some position.

Wait, perhaps not directly applicable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two strings: s1 and s2.

I need to find k in 1..n such that s1[1..k] + s2[k..n] is lex smallest.

I can iterate k from 1 to n and find the minimal such concatenation.

But for n=2e5, this is too slow.

I need a way to find this minimal concatenation efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one where the prefix from s1 is as small as possible, and the suffix from s2 continues that minimality.

Hence, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where s2 starts being smaller than s1.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where s2[k..n] is smaller than s1[k..n].

But I need to compare s1[1..k] + s2[k..n] with s1[1..k+1] + s2[k+1..n], and so on.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one where the switch from row1 to row2 is done at the earliest possible column where s2 starts being smaller.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where s2[k] < s1[k], and switch at that point.

But in the earlier example, that might not always be correct.

Wait, in sample input 1:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

There is no k where s2[k] < s1[k], so I should stay in row1 until the end.

Hence, the minimal string is s1[1..2] + s2[2..2] = 0 + 0 = 000

With count=2, as per the sample.

In sample input 2:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

I need to find k where s1[1..k] + s2[k..4] is minimal.

Looking at k=1: s1[1] + s2[1..4] = 1 + 1100 = 11100

k=2: s1[1..2] + s2[2..4] = 1
