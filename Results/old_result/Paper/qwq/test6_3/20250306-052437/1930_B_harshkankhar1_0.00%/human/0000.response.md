Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n in some order. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], etc. The problem gives an example where for n=4, the permutation [4,1,2,3] is valid, but [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,2,1] are not.

So, I need to generate a permutation where this specific condition doesn't hold for any pair of indices i and j. The condition is that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, with i != j and both between 1 and n-1.

Let me try to understand why [4,1,2,3] is valid. Let's check all possible pairs of i and j.

- For i=1, j=2: p1=4 divides p2=1? No, because 4 doesn't divide 1.

- i=1, j=3: p1=4 divides p3=2? Yes, 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, but not the other way around.

- i=1, j=4: p1=4 divides p4=3? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=1 divides p3=2? Yes, and p3=2 divides p4=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes, but p3=2 divides p5? Wait, p5 doesn't exist since n=4.

- i=3, j=4: p3=2 divides p4=3? No.

So, in this permutation, there are no pairs i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to be generating a permutation by reversing every second element in the list. Let's see what it does for n=4.

First, it creates a list a = [1,2,3,4].

Then, a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]. So, a[::2] is [1,3], reversing it gives [3,1]. So, the list becomes [3,2,1,4].

Wait, but in the example, the permutation is [4,1,2,3]. But according to the code, for n=4, it should output [3,2,1,4]. Hmm, that's different from the example. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me check the code again. The function func_1 is called for each test case. It reads n, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses every second element.

Wait, maybe I need to see what the code actually does for the first test case in the example.

In the first test case, n=4, and the output should be 4 1 2 3, but according to the code, it's producing 3,2,1,4. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect then. Because in the example, it's outputting 4 1 2 3, but according to the code, it's doing something else.

Let me verify the code again.

The code is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

So, for each test case, it reads n, creates a list from 1 to n, reverses every second element, and prints the list.

For n=4, list is [1,2,3,4], a[::2] is [1,3], reversed to [3,1], so list becomes [3,2,1,4].

But in the example, for n=4, the output is 4 1 2 3.

So, the code is not matching the example output. Does that mean the code is incorrect?

Wait, maybe there are multiple correct permutations, and the example is just one of them. The problem says that there can be multiple solutions, and any one of them is acceptable.

So, perhaps [3,2,1,4] is also a valid permutation. Let's check if it satisfies the condition.

Permutation: [3,2,1,4]

Check all possible pairs (i,j):

- i=1, j=2: 3 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 3 divides 1? Yes, but p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes. So, this is a problem because both conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but according to the problem, there should be no such pairs.

So, in [3,2,1,4], p1=3 divides p3=1 and p2=2 divides p4=4. But 3 does not divide 1, because 1 divided by 3 is not an integer. Wait, actually, in terms of divisibility, we say a divides b if b % a == 0. So, 3 does not divide 1, because 1 % 3 != 0.

So, in this case, the first condition p_i divides p_j is not satisfied, because 3 does not divide 1. So, this pair is okay.

- i=1, j=4: 3 divides 4? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=1 divides p5? But p5 doesn't exist, so this pair is invalid.

- i=3, j=4: 1 divides 4? Yes, but p4=4 divides p5? Doesn't exist.

So, in [3,2,1,4], the only pair where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} is when i=1 and j=3, but as we saw, p_i=3 does not divide p_j=1, so it's okay.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 does not divide 1, so that pair is fine.

Therefore, [3,2,1,4] seems to be a valid permutation as well.

So, perhaps the code is correct, and the example just shows one possible valid permutation, while the code generates another valid one.

But in the note, it says that [3,4,2,1] is invalid, but in our case, [3,2,1,4] seems to be valid.

So, maybe the code is correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's reversing every second element, which for n=4, gives [3,2,1,4], which seems to be valid.

For n=3, the list is [1,2,3], a[::2] is [1,3], reversed to [3,1], so the list becomes [3,2,1].

But in the example, for n=3, the output is [1,2,3], but according to the code, it's [3,2,1].

Is [3,2,1] valid for n=3?

Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: 3 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 3 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 1? No.

So, all pairs are fine, so [3,2,1] is also valid.

Hence, the code seems to be generating valid permutations for both n=3 and n=4.

But in the problem statement, it says that for n=3, all 6 permutations are valid, so it doesn't matter which one we choose, as long as it's a permutation.

Given that, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to think more generally. Does this method of reversing every second element always produce a valid permutation?

Let's consider n=5.

List: [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1], so the list becomes [5,2,3,4,1].

Is [5,2,3,4,1] a valid permutation?

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: 5 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 5 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=4: 5 divides 4? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 3? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: 3 divides 4? No.

So, seems fine.

Another test case: n=6.

List: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1], so list becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6].

Is [5,2,3,4,1,6] valid?

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: 5 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 5 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=4: 5 divides 4? No.

- i=1, j=5: 5 divides 1? No.

- i=1, j=6: 5 divides 6? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 3? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

- i=2, j=5: 2 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=6: 2 divides 6? Yes, and p3=3 divides p6=6? Yes. Oh, that's a problem.

So, in this permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6], we have i=2, j=6: p2=2 divides p6=6 and p3=3 divides p7= nothing, since n=6 and j+1=7 is out of bounds. Wait, p_{j+1} would be p7, which doesn't exist. So, perhaps this pair is invalid because p_{j+1} doesn't exist.

Wait, the condition is for j < n, and i < n, and j+1 <= n, etc. The problem says 1 <= i, j < n, and i != j.

So, j can be up to n-1, I think.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement.

"such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}."

So, j < n, and j+1 <= n.

In the case of n=6, j can be up to 5, so j+1=6 is still within bounds.

So, for i=2, j=5: p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

i=2, j=6: p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes, and p3=3 divides p7? p7 doesn't exist, so this pair is invalid because j+1 exceeds n.

Wait, but according to the condition, j < n, so j can be up to n-1=5.

So, for j=5, p5=1, and p6=6.

So, p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

Wait, 2 does not divide 1, because 1 % 2 != 0.

So, the condition p_i divides p_j is not satisfied here.

Hence, this pair is fine.

Another pair: i=3, j=5: p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

i=4, j=5: p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

So, seems okay.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for i=2, j=6, but j=6 would be out of bounds since j < n=6.

Wait, j can be up to 5.

Hence, in this permutation, it seems to be valid.

But I need to think more generally.

Is there any n where this method of reversing every second element would produce an invalid permutation?

Let me think about n=5 again.

Permutation: [5,2,3,4,1]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: 5 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 5 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=4: 5 divides 4? No.

- i=1, j=5: 5 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 3? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

- i=2, j=5: 2 divides 1? No.

- i=3, j=4: 3 divides 4? No.

- i=3, j=5: 3 divides 1? Yes, and p4=4 divides p6? Doesn't exist.

So, seems fine.

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

- i=2, j=6: p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes, and p3=3 divides p7? Doesn't exist.

But since p7 doesn't exist, this pair shouldn't be considered.

Hence, the permutation seems valid.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for all possible i and j where j+1 <= n, the condition holds.

In other words, j can be up to n-1, since j < n and j+1 <= n.

So, j can be from 1 to n-1.

Wait, but in the earlier example, j can be up to n-1=5 for n=6.

So, in that case, i can be from 1 to n-1=5.

Let's check i=1 to 5, j=1 to 5, i != j.

But as we saw, in i=2, j=5: p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

So, it's okay.

I think for n=6, the permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6] is valid.

Similarly, for n=3: [3,2,1], which we've already checked and seems valid.

For n=4: [3,2,1,4], which also seems valid.

For n=5: [5,2,3,4,1], valid.

So, perhaps this method works.

But to be thorough, let's check for n=7.

List: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7], reversed to [7,5,3,1], so list becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1].

Is [7,2,5,4,3,6,1] valid?

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: 7 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 7 divides 5? No.

- i=1, j=4: 7 divides 4? No.

- i=1, j=5: 7 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=6: 7 divides 6? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 5? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

- i=2, j=5: 2 divides 3? No.

- i=2, j=6: 2 divides 6? Yes, and p3=5 divides p7=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: 5 divides 4? No.

- i=3, j=5: 5 divides 3? No.

- i=3, j=6: 5 divides 6? No.

- i=4, j=5: 4 divides 3? No.

- i=4, j=6: 4 divides 6? Yes, and p5=3 divides p7=1? No.

So, all pairs are fine.

Seems like this method works for n=7.

Is there any n where this method would fail?

Let me think about larger n, say n=10.

List: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9], reversed to [9,7,5,3,1], so list becomes [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10].

Is [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10] valid?

Check some pairs:

- i=1, j=2: 9 divides 2? No.

- i=1, j=3: 9 divides 7? No.

- i=1, j=4: 9 divides 4? No.

- i=1, j=5: 9 divides 5? No.

- i=1, j=6: 9 divides 6? No.

- i=1, j=7: 9 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=8: 9 divides 8? No.

- i=1, j=9: 9 divides 1? No.

- i=1, j=10: 9 divides 10? No.

- i=2, j=3: 2 divides 7? No.

- i=2, j=4: 2 divides 4? Yes, and p3=7 divides p5=5? No.

- i=2, j=5: 2 divides 5? No.

- i=2, j=6: 2 divides 6? Yes, and p3=7 divides p7=3? No.

- i=2, j=7: 2 divides 3? No.

- i=2, j=8: 2 divides 8? Yes, and p3=7 divides p9=1? No.

- i=2, j=9: 2 divides 1? No.

- i=2, j=10: 2 divides 10? Yes, and p3=7 divides p11? Doesn't exist.

- i=3, j=4: 7 divides 4? No.

- i=3, j=5: 7 divides 5? No.

- i=3, j=6: 7 divides 6? No.

- i=3, j=7: 7 divides 3? No.

- i=3, j=8: 7 divides 8? No.

- i=3, j=9: 7 divides 1? No.

- i=3, j=10: 7 divides 10? No.

- i=4, j=5: 4 divides 5? No.

- i=4, j=6: 4 divides 6? Yes, and p5=5 divides p7=3? No.

- i=4, j=7: 4 divides 3? No.

- i=4, j=8: 4 divides 8? Yes, and p5=5 divides p9=1? No.

- i=4, j=9: 4 divides 1? No.

- i=4, j=10: 4 divides 10? Yes, and p5=5 divides p11? Doesn't exist.

- i=5, j=6: 5 divides 6? No.

- i=5, j=7: 5 divides 3? No.

- i=5, j=8: 5 divides 8? No.

- i=5, j=9: 5 divides 1? No.

- i=5, j=10: 5 divides 10? Yes, and p6=6 divides p11? Doesn't exist.

- i=6, j=7: 6 divides 3? No.

- i=6, j=8: 6 divides 8? No.

- i=6, j=9: 6 divides 1? No.

- i=6, j=10: 6 divides 10? Yes, and p7=3 divides p11? Doesn't exist.

- i=7, j=8: 3 divides 8? No.

- i=7, j=9: 3 divides 1? No.

- i=7, j=10: 3 divides 10? No.

- i=8, j=9: 8 divides 1? No.

- i=8, j=10: 8 divides 10? No.

- i=9, j=10: 1 divides 10? Yes, and p10=10 divides p11? Doesn't exist.

So, in this permutation, there are no pairs where both conditions are satisfied.

Hence, it seems that this method works for n=10 as well.

Is there a general reason why this method should work for all n >= 3?

Let's think about the method: reversing every second element.

In the list a = list(range(1, n+1)), a[::2] are the elements at even indices (0-based indexing), which are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., elements.

Reversing them means that the largest elements are placed at the beginning, interspersed with the smaller elements.

This seems to disrupt any divisibility patterns that could cause the condition to fail.

But to be sure, perhaps I should think about the properties of divisibility.

Divisibility is such that smaller numbers divide larger numbers, but not vice versa.

So, by placing larger numbers at the beginning, we reduce the chances of p_i dividing p_j
