Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a, given x_2 to x_n. And there can be multiple possible a arrays, but I just need to find any one that satisfies the conditions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

3 5 4 9

Let's verify this:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Check x_2 = 2:

5 % 3 = 2 ✔️

x_3 = 4:

4 % 5 = 4 ✔️

x_4 = 1:

9 % 4 = 1 ✔️

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output:

2 5 11

Check:

a = [2, 5, 11]

5 % 2 = 1 ✔️

11 % 5 = 1 ✔️

Good.

So, how to approach this problem?

I need to find a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

- 2 ≤ n ≤ 500

- x_i ≥ 1

Wait, in the problem statement, it says x_i ≥ 1, but looking back, in the example, there are x_i = 0 possible? Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, so x_i can be from 1 to 500.

But in the example, there are x_i = 0 possible? Wait, no, in the problem description, it says c mod d, and gives examples like 5 mod 2 = 1, 72 mod 3 = 0, 143 mod 14 = 3.

But in the constraints, it says 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, so x_i cannot be 0. Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again.

"1≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2≤ i≤ n."

So x_i is from 1 to 500, inclusive.

So, no x_i is 0.

Got it.

So, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, and x_i >=1.

Also, a_i can be up to 10^9.

I need to find such an array a.

Let me try to find a general way to construct a from x.

Let's consider that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

This means that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >=1.

Because, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + (a_i % a_{i-1}) = k * a_{i-1} + x_i.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is chosen such that a_i is minimized or something.

But, since a_i can be up to 10^9, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, k can be chosen accordingly.

But, I need to choose a_1 first, and then build up a_2, a_3, up to a_n.

But, a_1 has no a_0, so it can be chosen freely, as long as it's >=1.

Wait, no, a_1 can be chosen, but it affects a_2, and so on.

Wait, actually, a_1 can be chosen as x_2 +1, or something.

Wait, in the first test case, a_1 =3, x_2=2, so 3 >2, and 5 %3=2.

So, perhaps choosing a_1 > x_2.

Wait, but in the second test case, a_1=2, x_2=1, 5%2=1.

So, maybe a_1 can be x_2 +1.

Wait, but in the third test case, a_1=5, x_2=4, 14%5=4.

So, a_1 can be x_2 +1, but it's not necessary.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=2, x=[500], output a=[501,500].

So, a_1=501, a_2=500.

500 %501=500, which is x_2.

So, it works.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set a_1 to x_2 +1.

Because, a_2 % a_1 =x_2.

So, if a_1 >x_2, then a_2 can be k*a_1 +x_2, for some k.

But, to keep a_2 as small as possible, maybe set k=1.

So, a_2 = a_1 +x_2.

Then, a_3 = k*a_2 +x_3.

But, need to ensure that a_3 % a_2 =x_3.

Similarly, set a_3 = a_2 +x_3.

But, wait, a_3 = a_2 +x_3 may not satisfy a_3 % a_2 =x_3.

Because, a_3 % a_2 =x_3 only if a_3 >=a_2.

Wait, actually, in the first test case, a_3=4, a_2=5, 4%5=4=x_3=4.

So, a_3 can be less than a_2.

Wait, but in the second test case, a_3=11, a_2=5, 11%5=1=x_3=1.

So, a_3 can be greater than a_2.

Wait, so in general, a_3 =k*a_2 +x_3.

To make a_3 as small as possible, set k=1, so a_3=a_2 +x_3.

But, in the first test case, a_3=4, a_2=5, which is less than a_2 +x_3=5+4=9.

Wait, but 4%5=4, which is correct.

So, in this case, a_3=4 < a_2 +x_3.

So, perhaps a_3 can be a_2 +x_3 -m*a_2, for some m.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the function provided.

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [0] * n

ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

for i in range(n - 2):

ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

return ans

So, it sets ans[0] = arr[0] +1.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-3:

sets ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

while ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

ans[i+1] += ans[i]

Then, sets ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

Let's see what this does.

In the first test case:

arr = [2,4,1]

n=4

ans = [0,0,0,0]

ans[0] =2+1=3

Then, i from 0 to n-3=1:

i=0:

ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] =2+3=5

5 > arr[1]=4, so no while loop.

Then i=1:

ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] =4+5=9

9 > arr[2]=1, so no while loop.

Then, ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1] =9 +1=10

But in the sample output, it's 3 5 4 9

Wait, but here, ans=[3,5,9,10]

But in the sample output, it's 3 5 4 9

So, different.

But in the sample output, it's 3,5,4,9 which satisfies:

5%3=2

4%5=4

9%4=1

But according to this function, it's 3,5,9,10 which would be:

5%3=2 ✔️

9%5=4 ✔️

10%9=1 ✔️

So, both are correct.

But the sample output shows 3,5,4,9.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

So, the function provides a different correct solution.

That's fine, as the problem says any correct a is acceptable.

So, now, let's see if this function works correctly.

In the first test case, it gives 3,5,9,10 which is correct.

In the sample output, it's 3,5,4,9 which is also correct.

So, both are correct.

Let's see for the second test case.

n=3

arr=[1,1]

ans=[0,0,0]

ans[0]=1+1=2

then, i from 0 to 0 (n-2=1):

i=0:

ans[1]=1+2=3

3 > arr[1]=1, so no while loop.

then, ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=3+1=4

So, a=[2,3,4]

But in the sample output, it's 2,5,11.

Both are correct.

2,3,4:

3%2=1 ✔️

4%3=1 ✔️

2,5,11:

5%2=1 ✔️

11%5=1 ✔️

So, again, multiple solutions are possible.

Now, let's check if the function works for other test cases.

Third test case:

n=6

arr=[4,2,5,1,2]

ans=[0,0,0,0,0,0]

ans[0]=4+1=5

then, i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

ans[1]=4+5=9

9 > arr[1]=2, no while loop.

i=1:

ans[2]=2+9=11

11 > arr[2]=5, no while loop.

i=2:

ans[3]=5+11=16

16 > arr[3]=1, no while loop.

i=3:

ans[4]=1+16=17

17 > arr[4]=2, no while loop.

then, ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=17+2=19

So, a=[5,9,11,16,17,19]

Check:

9%5=4 ✔️

11%9=2 ✔️

16%11=5 ✔️

17%16=1 ✔️

19%17=2 ✔️

Correct.

But in the sample output, it's 5,14,16,5,11,24.

Which also works:

14%5=4 ✔️

16%14=2 ✔️

5%16=5 ✔️

11%5=1 ✔️

24%11=2 ✔️

So, again, multiple solutions possible.

Fourth test case:

n=2

arr=[500]

ans=[0,0]

ans[0]=500+1=501

then, no loop, since n-2=0, range(0) is empty.

then, ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=501+500=1001

So, a=[501,1001]

But in the sample output, it's [501,500]

Wait, sample output is [501,500]

But according to the function, it's [501,1001]

Now, [501,500]: 500%501=500 ✔️

[501,1001]: 1001%501=1001-2*501=1001-1002=-1, but modulo should be positive, so 500 ✔️

Wait, but 1001 %501 is 1001 -2*501=1001-1002=-1, but modulo should be 500.

Because 501*2=1002, 1002 -1001=1, but since it's positive, it's 501*1=501, 501*2=1002, so 1001 -1002=-1, but modulo is 500.

Wait, in programming, a%b is a - (a//b)*b, and if a >=0, b>0, then a%b >=0.

So, 1001 %501 =1001 -2*501=1001-1002=-1, but in Python, 1001%501=1001 -1*501=1001-501=500.

Yes, because 1001 //501=1, since 501*1=501 <1001, 501*2=1002 >1001, so 1001//501=1, then 1001 -1*501=500.

So, 1001%501=500.

So, [501,1001] is correct.

But sample output is [501,500], which is also correct, since 500%501=500.

So, again, multiple solutions possible.

Fifth test case:

n=3

arr=[1,5]

ans=[0,0,0]

ans[0]=1+1=2

then, i from 0 to 0:

i=0:

ans[1]=1+2=3

3 > arr[1]=5, no while loop.

then, ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=3+5=8

So, a=[2,3,8]

Check:

3%2=1 ✔️

8%3=2 ≠5 ❌

Oops, that's incorrect.

Wait, so according to the function, a=[2,3,8], but 8%3=2, which should be x_3=5.

But 2 ≠5, so it's incorrect.

But in the sample output, it's [2,7,5]

Wait, let's check [2,7,5]:

7%2=1 ✔️

5%7=5 ✔️

So, correct.

But according to the function, it's [2,3,8], which is incorrect because 8%3=2 ≠5.

So, the function is not always correct.

Wait, but in the previous test cases, it worked.

But in this test case, it fails.

So, perhaps there's an issue with the function.

Let's see what's happening.

In the fifth test case:

n=3

arr=[1,5]

So, x2=1, x3=5

Function does:

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

ans[2]=3+5=8

But 8%3=2 ≠5.

So, it's incorrect.

What's the problem here?

Well, in this case, x3=5, which is greater than a2=3.

So, a3 % a2 = a3 %3 =5, but 5 >3, which is impossible.

Because a3 %3 can be at most 2.

Wait, but in the sample output, a3=5, and 5%7=5, but in this case, a2=7 >a3=5.

Wait, in the sample output, a=[2,7,5]

a2=7 >a3=5, and 5%7=5, which is correct.

So, in general, if a_{i} > a_{i-1}, then a_{i} % a_{i-1} = a_{i} - a_{i-1} * floor(a_{i}/a_{i-1}).

But if a_{i} < a_{i-1}, then a_{i} % a_{i-1} = a_{i}, since floor(a_{i}/a_{i-1})=0.

So, in this case, a3=5 < a2=7, so a3 % a2 =a3=5, which matches x3=5.

But in the function's output, a3=8 > a2=3, and 8%3=2, which doesn't match x3=5.

So, the function fails in this case.

So, perhaps the function needs to handle the case when a_{i} <= a_{i-1} differently.

Looking back at the function:

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [0] * n

ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

for i in range(n - 2):

ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

return ans

In the fifth test case:

arr=[1,5]

n=3

ans=[0,0,0]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

ans[1]=3 > arr[1]=5? 3 <=5? Yes, 3 <=5.

So, enter the if clause.

while ans[1] <= arr[1]:

ans[1] += ans[0]

So, ans[1]=3 <=5: ans[1] +=2 => ans[1]=5

5 <=5: ans[1] +=2 => ans[1]=7

7 >5: exit loop.

So, ans=[2,7,0]

Then, ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=7+5=12

So, ans=[2,7,12]

Now, check:

7%2=3 ≠1, wait, but in the sample output, a=[2,7,5], where 7%2=1, which matches x2=1.

But in this case, 7%2=1 is correct.

Then, a3=12 %7=5, which matches x3=5.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's [2,7,5], which also matches.

But according to the function, it's [2,7,12], which is also correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was [2,3,8], but actually, with the correction, it's [2,7,12].

So, [2,7,12]:

7%2=1 ✔️

12%7=5 ✔️

And sample output is [2,7,5], which is also correct.

So, both are correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, perhaps the function works in this case after all.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought ans[1] becomes 7, and ans[2]=7+5=12.

But in the sample output, it's [2,7,5].

So, both are correct.

So, the function provides [2,7,12], which is correct.

Sample output shows [2,7,5], which is also correct.

So, multiple solutions possible.

Hence, the function seems to work.

Wait, but in my earlier step, I thought ans[1]=3, but according to the function, it should be ans[1]=5, then 5 <=5, so ans[1]=7.

So, yes, ans=[2,7,12], which is correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, the function seems to work.

Now, let's see if there are any edge cases where it might fail.

Consider n=2, arr=[1]

Then, ans=[0,0]

ans[0]=1+1=2

no loop

ans[-1]=ans[-2]+arr[-1]=2+1=3

So, a=[2,3]

Check: 3%2=1 ✔️

Another case: n=2, arr=[999]

ans[0]=999+1=1000

ans[1]=1000 +999=1999

Check: 1999%1000=999 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=3, arr=[1,1]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

3 >1, no while loop

ans[2]=3+1=4

Check: 3%2=1 ✔️

4%3=1 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=3, arr=[2,2]

ans[0]=2+1=3

ans[1]=2+3=5

5 >2, no while loop

ans[2]=5+2=7

Check: 5%3=2 ✔️

7%5=2 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=4, arr=[1,2,3]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

3 >2, no while loop

ans[2]=2+3=5

5 >3, no while loop

ans[3]=5+3=8

Check: 3%2=1 ✔️

5%3=2 ✔️

8%5=3 ✔️

Good.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but earlier I thought in n=3, arr=[1,5], it sets ans[1]=7, which is fine.

Alternatively, in the sample output, [2,7,5] also works.

So, multiple solutions possible.

Now, is there any case where the function fails?

Let me think about arr[i] >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, in the function, if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], it enters the while loop and adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

This ensures that ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

But, in the modulo operation, a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i.

If a_i > a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} =a_i - floor(a_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

But, in the function, it sets ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i], and if that's <= arr[i+1], it adds ans[i] repeatedly until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

So, effectively, ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i] + k*ans[i], for some k such that ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

So, ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]*(1 +k), where k >=0.

Then, ans[i+1] % ans[i] = (arr[i] + ans[i]*(1+k)) % ans[i] = arr[i] % ans[i].

But we need ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+1}.

Wait, but according to the function, it sets ans[i+1] =arr[i] + ans[i], and if that's <= arr[i+1], it adds ans[i] until it's > arr[i+1].

But, in the modulo operation, ans[i+1] % ans[i] = arr[i] % ans[i].

But we need ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+1}.

So, for this to hold, arr[i] % ans[i] should be x_{i+1}.

But arr[i] is x_{i+1}, so x_{i+1} % ans[i] should be x_{i+1}.

Which is true only if ans[i] > x_{i+1}.

Wait, x_{i+1} % ans[i] =x_{i+1} if and only if ans[i] >x_{i+1}.

But in the function, ans[i] =arr[i-1] + ans[i-1], and arr[i-1] =x_i.

So, ans[i] =x_i + ans[i-1].

Given that ans[i-1] >x_i (since ans[i-1] =arr[i-2] + ans[i-2], and so on, starting from ans[0]=x_2 +1 >x_2), so ans[i] >x_i +x_{i-1}.

Wait, no, ans[i] =x_i + ans[i-1].

But ans[i-1] >=x_{i-1}, but not necessarily ans[i-1] >x_i.

Wait, in the first test case, ans[0]=3 >x_2=2.

ans[1]=2+3=5 >x_3=4.

ans[2]=4+5=9 >x_4=1.

So, in this case, it works.

But in the fifth test case, arr=[1,5], n=3.

ans[0]=1+1=2 >x_2=1.

ans[1]=1+2=3 >x_3=5? 3 <=5, so enter the while loop.

ans[1]=3+2=5 <=5, so ans[1]=5+2=7 >5, exit loop.

So, ans[1]=7 >x_3=5.

Then, ans[2]=7+5=12 >5.

So, in this case, it's fine.

Wait, but in the sample output, a3=5 < a2=7, which is allowed because 5%7=5.

So, in general, as long as a_i >x_{i+1}, it should be fine.

But in the function, it sets ans[i+1] =arr[i] + ans[i], and if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], it adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

So, in the end, ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

But arr[i+1] =x_{i+2}, so ans[i+1] >x_{i+2}.

But we need ans[i+1] >x_{i+1}, not x_{i+2}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices.

Wait, arr is x_2 to x_n.

So, arr[i] =x_{i+2}.

Wait, no, arr is x_2 to x_n, indexed from 0 to n-2.

So, arr[0]=x_2, arr[1]=x_3, ..., arr[n-2]=x_n.

So, in the loop, for i in range(n-2):

ans[i+1] =arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

while ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

ans[i+1] += ans[i]

Then, ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

So, arr[i+1] =x_{i+3}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of indices.

Let me consider i from 0 to n-3.

So, for each i from 0 to n-3:

ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

while ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1]:

ans[i+1] += ans[i]

Then, ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

Now, arr[i] =x_{i+2}

So, arr[0]=x_2, arr[1]=x_3, ..., arr[n-2]=x_n

So, in the loop, ans[i+1] =x_{i+2} + ans[i]

Then, if ans[i+1] <=x_{i+3}, enter the while loop.

Add ans[i] until ans[i+1] >x_{i+3}.

Then, finally, ans[-1] = ans[-2] +x_n

Now, need to check if ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+2}

Given that ans[i+1] =x_{i+2} + ans[i] +k*ans[i], for some k.

So, ans[i+1] =x_{i+2} + ans[i]*(1+k)

Then, ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+2} % ans[i]

But we need ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+2}

Which is true if x_{i+2} < ans[i].

But in the function, if ans[i+1] <=x_{i+3}, it adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] >x_{i+3}.

But I'm not sure if this ensures that ans[i] >x_{i+2}.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

But in practice, it seems to work, as seen in the sample inputs.

Perhaps the key is that ans[i] is set to x_{i+1} + ans[i-1], and ans[i-1] >x_i, and so on.

Wait, ans[0]=x_2 +1 >x_2

Then, ans[1]=x_2 + ans[0] >x_2 >x_3? Not necessarily.

Wait, in the fifth test case, ans[0]=2 >x_2=1

ans[1]=1+2=3 >x_3=5? 3 <=5, so enter the while loop.

ans[1]=3+2=5 <=5, so ans[1]=5+2=7 >5, exit loop.

So, ans[1]=7 >x_3=5

Then, ans[2]=7+5=12 >5

So, in this case, ans[1]=7 >x_3=5.

Similarly, in other test cases, it seems to work.

So, perhaps the function is correct.

Now, I need to confirm if this function always produces a correct a array.

Let me try to think of a case where it might fail.

Suppose n=3, arr=[5,1], n=3.

Then, ans[0]=5+1=6

ans[1]=5+6=11 >1, no while loop.

ans[2]=11+1=12

So, a=[6,11,12]

Check:

11%6=5 ✔️

12%11=1 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=4, arr=[3,2,1]

ans[0]=3+1=4

ans[1]=3+4=7 >2, no while loop.

ans[2]=2+7=9 >1, no while loop.

ans[3]=9+1=10

Check:

7%4=3 ✔️

9%7=2 ✔️

10%9=1 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=3, arr=[4,5]

ans[0]=4+1=5

ans[1]=4+5=9 >5, no while loop.

ans[2]=9+5=14

Check:

9%5=4 ✔️

14%9=5 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=3, arr=[2,1]

ans[0]=2+1=3

ans[1]=2+3=5 >1, no while loop.

ans[2]=5+1=6

Check:

5%3=2 ✔️

6%5=1 ✔️

Good.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if arr[i] >= ans[i]?

For example, n=3, arr=[1,2]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3 >2, no while loop.

ans[2]=3+2=5

Check:

3%2=1 ✔️

5%3=2 ✔️

Good.

Another case: n=3, arr=[3,1]

ans[0]=3+1=4

ans[1]=3+4=7 >1, no while loop.

ans[2]=7+1=8

Check:

7%4=3 ✔️

8%7=1 ✔️

Good.

Seems fine.

Wait, but what if arr[i] >= ans[i-1], but arr[i] < ans[i]?

Wait, in the function, ans[i] =arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]

Since ans[i-1] >x_{i}, and x_{i} >=1, so ans[i-1] >=2.

arr[i-1]=x_{i} >=1.

So, ans[i] =x_{i} + ans[i-1] >=1 +2=3.

So, ans[i] >=3.

But arr[i]=x_{i+1} can be up to 500.

So, if x_{i+1} >= ans[i], which is possible, but in the function, it adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

Wait, no, it's ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], which is arr[i] + ans[i] <= arr[i+1].

So, if arr[i] + ans[i] <= arr[i+1], then ans[i+1] += ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

But, in this case, ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i] +k*ans[i], for some k such that ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

Then, ans[i+1] % ans[i] = (arr[i] + ans[i]*(1+k)) % ans[i] = arr[i] % ans[i}

But we need ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+1}

So, arr[i] % ans[i] should equal x_{i+1}

But arr[i]=x_{i+1}, so x_{i+1} % ans[i] should equal x_{i+1}, which is true only if ans[i] >x_{i+1}

But in the function, if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], it adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]

But arr[i+1]=x_{i+2}

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after the loop, ans[i+1] > arr[i+1], which is x_{i+2}

But we need ans[i+1] % ans[i] =x_{i+1}

But ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i] +k*ans[i] = arr[i] + ans[i]*(1+k)

So, ans[i+1] % ans[i] = arr[i] % ans[i}

But arr[i]=x_{i+1}, so arr[i] % ans[i] =x_{i+1} % ans[i]

We need x_{i+1} % ans[i] =x_{i+1}, which holds if ans[i] >x_{i+1}

But in the function, if ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], it adds ans[i] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]

But arr[i+1]=x_{i+2}

So, it ensures that ans[i+1] >x_{i+2}

But I'm not sure how this relates to ans[i] and x_{i+1}

Maybe I need to think recursively.

Starting from a_1 =x_2 +1 >x_2

Then, a_2 =x_2 +a_1

Then, a_3 =x_3 +a_2, but need to ensure that a_3 %a_2 =x_3

But, a_3 =x_3 +a_2, which may not satisfy a_3 %a_2 =x_3, unless a_2 >x_3

But in the function, a_2 =x_2 +a_1, and a_1 =x_2 +1 >x_2

So, a_2 =x_2 +a_1 >x_2 +x_2 =2*x_2

But x_3 can be up to 500, which may be larger than a_2.

Wait, no, x_3 is from 1 to 500, and a_2 =x_2 +a_1, where a_1 =x_2 +1

So, a_2 =x_2 +x_2 +1=2*x_2 +1

If x_2 is large, say x_2=500, then a_2=1001

So, a_2=1001 >x_3=500

So, in this case, a_3 =x_3 +a_2 =500 +1001=1501 >x_4

Assuming x_4 <=500

Then, a_4 =x_4 +a_3 =x_4 +1501

And so on.

So, in this case, a_2 >x_3, a_3 >x_4, etc.

So, in general, a_{i} >x_{i+1}, which ensures that a_{i} % a_{i-1} =a_{i} - floor(a_{i}/a_{i-1})*a_{i-1}

But since a_{i} >x_{i+1}, and a_{i} =x_{i+1} +a_{i-1}, then a_{i} % a_{i-1} =x
