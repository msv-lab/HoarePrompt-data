Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i is equal to a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i has to be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

I need to find values for a_1 to a_n that satisfy this condition for each x_i. The problem says that if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can return any one of them.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by choosing a value for a_1 and then determine the rest based on that.

Let's consider the first element, a_1. There are no constraints on a_1 except that it has to be between 1 and 10^9. So, I can choose any value within that range.

Wait, but actually, x_2 depends on a_1 and a_2. Let's see: x_2 = a_2 % a_1.

So, a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

This means that a_2 is equal to k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k.

Since a_2 has to be greater than or equal to x_2 (because remainder is always less than the divisor), and a_1 can be any value from 1 to 10^9, I need to choose a_1 such that a_2 is within the allowed range.

Hmm, maybe I should choose a_1 to be x_2 + 1. That way, a_2 can be a multiple of a_1 plus x_2.

Let me try that.

Suppose a_1 = x_2 + 1.

Then, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2.

To minimize a_2, I can choose k = 1, so a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = (x_2 + 1) + x_2 = 2 * x_2 + 1.

But I need to check if this satisfies a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

Let's compute (2 * x_2 + 1) % (x_2 + 1).

Well, (2 * x_2 + 1) divided by (x_2 + 1):

(2 * x_2 + 1) / (x_2 + 1) = 2 - 1/(x_2 + 1), so the integer part is 1, and the remainder is (2 * x_2 + 1) - 1 * (x_2 + 1) = 2 * x_2 + 1 - x_2 - 1 = x_2.

Yes, that works.

So, a_2 = a_1 + x_2 satisfies a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

Great, so I can set a_1 = x_2 + 1 and a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Now, moving on to a_3.

x_3 = a_3 % a_2.

Similarly, a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3 for some integer m.

Again, to minimize a_3, I can choose m = 1, so a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

Then, a_3 % a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) % a_2 = x_3, which is what we want.

So, it seems like a general pattern: set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Wait, but does this always work?

Let me check with the first example.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

So, a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3

a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9

a_4 = 9 + 1 = 10

Now, check:

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

a_3 % a_2 = 9 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3.

a_4 % a_3 = 10 % 9 = 1, which matches x_4.

Perfect, it works for the first test case.

Let's check the second test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2

a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3

a_3 = 3 + 1 = 4

Check:

3 % 2 = 1, matches x_2.

4 % 3 = 1, matches x_3.

Good.

Third test case:

n = 6

x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]

a_1 = 4 + 1 = 5

a_2 = 5 + 4 = 9

a_3 = 9 + 2 = 11

a_4 = 11 + 5 = 16

a_5 = 16 + 1 = 17

a_6 = 17 + 2 = 19

Check:

9 % 5 = 4, matches x_2.

11 % 9 = 2, matches x_3.

16 % 11 = 5, matches x_4.

17 % 16 = 1, matches x_5.

19 % 17 = 2, matches x_6.

Looks good.

Fourth test case:

n = 2

x = [500]

a_1 = 500 + 1 = 501

a_2 = 501 + 500 = 1001

Check:

1001 % 501 = 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, wait, that can't be right.

Wait, 1001 divided by 501 is 2, since 2*501 = 1002, which is greater than 1001. So, 1001 - 1*501 = 500, so 1001 % 501 = 500, which matches x_2.

Good.

Fifth test case:

n = 3

x = [1,5]

a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2

a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3

a_3 = 3 + 5 = 8

Check:

3 % 2 = 1, matches x_2.

8 % 3 = 2, but x_3 is 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, in this case, a_3 % a_2 should be 5, but 8 % 3 is 2, not 5.

So, my initial approach fails here.

Hmm, so what's the issue?

In this case, x_3 = 5, but a_2 is 3, and 5 is greater than 3, which is a problem because the remainder must be less than the divisor.

So, in cases where x_i >= a_{i-1}, my initial approach doesn't work.

In this example, x_3 = 5 and a_2 = 3, but 5 >= 3, which violates the modulo condition because a_3 % 3 can't be 5.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that x_i < a_{i-1}, right?

Wait, no, looking back, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, but in this case, a_{i-1} is 3 and x_i is 5, which is invalid.

So, my approach fails in this case.

I need a way to handle cases where x_i >= a_{i-1}.

How can I adjust my approach to handle this?

Let me think about it.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then I need to make sure that a_i is at least a_{i-1} + x_i, but also that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, but if a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, then as long as x_i < a_{i-1}, this works.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then I need to choose k such that k * a_{i-1} + x_i is greater than or equal to a_{i-1}, and also satisfies a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, but actually, in the modulo operation, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which implies that a_i = m * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer m, and m should be chosen such that a_i is positive and within the constraints.

So, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then m should be at least 1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in this case, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i only if x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1} * floor(x_i / a_{i-1}).

Wait, no, a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i - floor(a_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

But in this case, a_i = m * a_{i-1} + x_i, and x_i >= a_{i-1}, which means m needs to be adjusted accordingly.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to choose a_{i} when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Let me consider that a_i must be greater than x_i, because the remainder is always less than the divisor.

So, a_i > x_i.

Also, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be greater than x_i, and a_i must be such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe I can choose a_i to be a multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i, and adjust the multiple until a_i > x_i.

Wait, perhaps I can set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and if a_i <= x_i, then add a multiple of a_{i-1} until a_i > x_i.

Wait, but a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i should already be greater than x_i, unless a_{i-1} <= 0, but a_{i-1} is at least 1.

Wait, in the earlier example, a_2 = 3, x_3 = 5, so a_3 = 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than 5, but 8 % 3 = 2, not 5.

So, this approach doesn't work when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

I need to find a way to make a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i even when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, maybe I need to add multiples of a_{i-1} to a_i until a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But that seems inefficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose a_1 to be greater than all x_i.

Wait, but x_i can be up to 500, and a_1 can be up to 10^9, so I can choose a_1 to be something large enough.

But even then, I might run into issues.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a_1 to be the maximum x_i plus one.

Let me try that.

Set a_1 = max(x) + 1.

Then, for each a_i, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see.

In the fifth test case:

x = [1,5]

Set a_1 = 5 + 1 = 6

a_2 = 6 + 1 = 7

a_3 = 7 + 5 = 12

Check:

7 % 6 = 1, matches x_2.

12 % 7 = 5, matches x_3.

Perfect, it works.

In the earlier failing case, with a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 8, which didn't work because 8 % 3 = 2, not 5.

But with a_1 = 6, a_2 = 7, a_3 = 12, it works.

So, choosing a_1 = max(x) + 1 seems to solve the problem.

Let me verify with other test cases.

First test case:

x = [2,4,1]

max(x) = 4, so a_1 = 5

a_2 = 5 + 2 = 7

a_3 = 7 + 4 = 11

a_4 = 11 + 1 = 12

Check:

7 % 5 = 2, matches x_2.

11 % 7 = 4, matches x_3.

12 % 11 = 1, matches x_4.

Good.

Second test case:

x = [1,1]

max(x) = 1, so a_1 = 2

a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3

a_3 = 3 + 1 = 4

Check:

3 % 2 = 1, matches x_2.

4 % 3 = 1, matches x_3.

Good.

Third test case:

x = [4,2,5,1,2]

max(x) = 5, so a_1 = 6

a_2 = 6 + 4 = 10

a_3 = 10 + 2 = 12

a_4 = 12 + 5 = 17

a_5 = 17 + 1 = 18

a_6 = 18 + 2 = 20

Check:

10 % 6 = 4, matches x_2.

12 % 10 = 2, matches x_3.

17 % 12 = 5, matches x_4.

18 % 17 = 1, matches x_5.

20 % 18 = 2, matches x_6.

Good.

Fourth test case:

x = [500]

max(x) = 500, so a_1 = 501

a_2 = 501 + 500 = 1001

Check:

1001 % 501 = 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, which is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's recalculate.

Actually, 1001 divided by 501 is 2, because 2*501 = 1002, which is greater than 1001. So, 1001 - 1*501 = 500, hence 1001 % 501 = 500, which matches x_2.

Good.

So, choosing a_1 = max(x) + 1 seems to work in all these cases.

Let me see if there's any case where this might fail.

Suppose x = [1000], but wait, the problem states that x_i <= 500, so x_i <= 500.

Wait, no, looking back, x_i can be up to 500, as per the problem statement.

So, x_i <= 500.

Therefore, choosing a_1 = 501 would be sufficient in all cases, since a_1 > x_i for all i.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, x_i = 500, and a_1 = 501, which works.

So, setting a_1 = max(x) + 1 ensures that a_1 > x_i for all x_i, which prevents the issue where x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, x = [1,5], max(x) = 5, a_1 = 6, which is greater than 5, and it worked.

Whereas earlier, when I set a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than x_3 = 5, leading to a_3 = 8, and 8 % 3 = 2, not 5.

So, choosing a_1 = max(x) + 1 seems to be a safe choice.

Is there any downside to this approach?

Well, a_1 could be up to 501, which is within the limit of 10^9.

And the rest of the a_i would be built upon that.

Seems fine.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [0] * n

ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

for i in range(n - 2):

ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

return ans

So, it sets ans[0] = arr[0] + 1, which is a_1 = x_2 + 1.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-3, it sets ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i], which is a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Then, there's a check: if ans[i+1] < arr[i+1], it enters a loop where it keeps adding ans[i] to ans[i+1] until ans[i+1] > arr[i+1].

Finally, it sets ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1].

Let me see how this works with the fifth test case.

n = 3

arr = [1,5]

ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3

Check if 3 < 5: yes, so enter the loop.

Loop: 3 <= 5, so ans[1] += 2 -> ans[1] = 5

Now, 5 <= 5, so ans[1] += 2 -> ans[1] = 7

Now, 7 > 5, exit the loop.

Then, ans[2] = ans[1] + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12

So, a = [2,7,12]

Check:

7 % 2 = 1, which matches x_2 = 1.

12 % 7 = 5, which matches x_3 = 5.

Perfect.

In this case, it worked.

Earlier, when a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 8, which didn't work because 8 % 3 = 2, not 5.

But with this adjustment, a_3 = 7, which is greater, and 7 % 2 = 1, 12 % 7 = 5, which works.

So, the loop ensures that a_i is large enough so that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, even when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Let me see how it works in the fourth test case.

n = 2

arr = [500]

ans[0] = 500 + 1 = 501

ans[1] = 500 + 501 = 1001

Check if 1001 < 500: no, because 1001 > 500, so no loop.

So, a = [501,1001]

Check:

1001 % 501 = 500, which matches x_2.

Good.

In the first test case:

n = 4

arr = [2,4,1]

ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3

ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5

Check if 5 < 4: no, so no loop.

ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9

Check if 9 < 1: no, so no loop.

ans[3] = 9 + 1 = 10

So, a = [3,5,9,10]

Check:

5 % 3 = 2, matches x_2.

9 % 5 = 4, matches x_3.

10 % 9 = 1, matches x_4.

Good.

Seems like this approach works.

So, the function func_1 seems to correctly implement the logic to generate the a array.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
