Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game on a tree with n nodes, and the tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array. There are t rounds, but in this version, t is always 1, so I don't have to worry about multiple rounds. Each round starts with a stone on one node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until no moves are left. Ron goes first, then Hermione, and so on. I need to figure out who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the tree structure. It's a tree with exactly two leaves, which means it's a straight path connecting the two leaves, right? Like a linear structure, similar to an array where each element is connected to its neighbors.

So, if the tree has n nodes and only two leaves, it must be a simple path: node 1 connected to node 2, node 2 connected to node 3, and so on, up to node n. That means the tree is essentially a line.

Given that, the game is similar to moving a piece along this line, from one end to the other, but only to inactive neighbors. The player who can't make a move loses.

I need to determine, for a given starting node, who wins the game if both players play optimally.

Let me think about game theory here. This seems like an impartial game, where the Sprague-Grundy theorem might apply. But since the tree is a simple path, maybe there's a simpler way to determine the winner based on the position of the starting node.

Let's consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

Input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output:

Ron

So, the tree has 3 nodes: 1-2-3. Starting at node 3.

Moves:

- Ron moves from 3 to 1 (the only inactive neighbor).

- Hermione has no moves left because both neighbors of 1 are already active.

- So, Hermione loses, and Ron wins.

Example 2:

Input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Output:

Hermione

Tree: 1-2-3-4-5. Starting at node 5.

Moves:

- Ron moves from 5 to 4.

- Hermione moves from 4 to 3.

- Ron moves from 3 to 2.

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1.

- Ron has no moves left.

- So, Ron loses, and Hermione wins.

From these examples, it seems that the player who makes the last move wins. In the first example, Ron makes the last move, and in the second, Hermione does.

I need to generalize this.

Given that the tree is a straight path, the game is equivalent to moving a piece along the path, and the player who can't move loses.

This is similar to the game of Nim with a single pile, where the number of stones is equivalent to the number of moves left.

In standard Nim, the second player wins if the number of stones is even, and the first player wins if it's odd, but I need to verify that in this context.

Wait, in the first example, n=3, starting at node 3, Ron wins.

In the second example, n=5, starting at node 5, Hermione wins.

Wait, in both cases, it's about the parity of the distance from the starting node to one of the leaves.

Wait, in the first example, starting at node 3, which is a leaf, Ron moves to node 1, which is the other leaf, and Hermione has no moves.

In the second example, starting at node 5, Ron moves to 4, Hermione to 3, Ron to 2, Hermione to 1, and Ron loses.

So, in the first example, the path length is 2 (nodes 3 to 1), and Ron wins.

In the second example, the path length is 4 (nodes 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1), and Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the first example, the path length is 2, which is even, and Ron wins.

In the second example, the path length is 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of moves made.

In the first example, there's only one move: from 3 to 1. So, total moves = 1, which is odd. Ron makes the first and only move, so he wins.

In the second example, there are four moves: 5 to 4, 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1. Total moves = 4, which is even. Hermione makes the last move, so she wins.

So, when the number of moves is odd, Ron wins, and when it's even, Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the first example, Ron makes one move and wins, which is odd.

In the second example, there are four moves, which is even, and Hermione makes the last move.

Wait, but four moves would mean Ron moves first, then Hermione, then Ron, then Hermione. So, Hermione makes the fourth move, which is the last move, so she wins.

Similarly, in the first example, only one move is made by Ron, who wins.

So, it seems that if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins, and if it's even, Hermione wins.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=2:

Nodes: 1-2

Start at node 2.

Ron moves from 2 to 1.

Hermione has no moves left.

So, Ron makes one move, which is odd, and wins.

Another example: n=4

Nodes: 1-2-3-4

Start at node 4.

Ron moves from 4 to 3.

Hermione moves from 3 to 2.

Ron moves from 2 to 1.

Hermione has no moves left.

Total moves: 3, which is odd, so Ron wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier observation, when the number of moves is even, Hermione wins, but in this case, with 3 moves, which is odd, Ron wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in the n=5 case, starting at node 5, total moves are 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

In n=4, starting at node 4, total moves are 3, which is odd, and Ron wins.

In n=3, starting at node 3, total moves are 1, which is odd, and Ron wins.

In n=2, starting at node 2, total moves are 1, which is odd, and Ron wins.

So, it seems that when the number of moves is odd, Ron wins, and when it's even, Hermione wins.

But wait, in the n=5 case, total moves are 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, but in n=4, total moves are 3, Ron wins.

n=3, moves=1, Ron wins.

n=2, moves=1, Ron wins.

So, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of moves.

Wait, maybe it's about the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf.

In n=3, starting at node 3, distance to leaf is 0 (since it's a leaf itself), and number of moves is 1.

In n=5, starting at node 5, distance to leaf is 0, number of moves is 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because starting at a leaf, the number of moves would be the distance to the other leaf.

Wait, in n=3, distance between leaves is 2, starting at one leaf, one move to the other leaf.

In n=5, starting at one leaf, distance to the other leaf is 4, so 4 moves.

In n=4, starting at one leaf, distance to the other leaf is 3, so 3 moves.

In n=2, distance is 1, but in the earlier example, I said moves are 1.

Wait, in n=2, starting at node 2, moving to node 1, no more moves, so moves=1.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the distance from the starting node to the other leaf.

In n=3, distance is 2, moves=1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the number of moves is equal to the distance from the starting node to the other leaf, divided by 2 and ceiling it or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of edges traversed.

In n=3, starting at node 3, move to node 1, traversing one edge.

In n=5, starting at node 5, move to 4, to 3, to 2, to 1, traversing four edges.

So, the number of moves is equal to the distance from the starting node to the other leaf.

In n=3, distance is 2, moves=1 (since one move covers two nodes).

Wait, no, in n=3, moves=1, covering one edge.

In n=5, moves=4, covering four edges.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the distance from the starting node to the other leaf.

In n=3, distance=2, moves=1.

Wait, but distance is 2 edges, moves=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes minus one, divided by 2.

Wait, in n=3, moves=1, which is (3-1)/2.

In n=5, moves=4, which is (5-1)/1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's about the level of the tree or something.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a game on a path graph, where each move reduces the length of the path.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game as having a nimber (grundy number) based on the position.

In impartial game theory, the nimber of a position is the mex (minimum excludant) of the nimbers of the positions reachable in one move.

In this game, moving from a node to an inactive neighbor is like reducing the path length.

But since the tree is a path, maybe I can find a pattern in the nimbers for each position.

Let's try to compute the nimbers for small n.

For n=2:

- Starting at leaf node: moving to the other node ends the game. So, the nimber is 0 (since there are no moves from the ending position).

- Starting at the other node: similarly, moving to the leaf ends the game.

Wait, perhaps I need to define the nimber for each node.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see that the game is equivalent to subtracting 1 from the current position, similar to subtraction games in combinatorial game theory.

But in this case, it's moving along a path.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as moving along a line, and the game ends when you reach one end.

But in standard impartial games, moving to a position with nimber 0 loses.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of moves available from each position.

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Given that the tree is a path, and moves are only to inactive neighbors, it's similar to moving along the path, activating nodes one by one, and the player who can't move loses.

This seems like a standard impartial game where the nimber of a position is the mex of the nimbers of its neighbors.

But perhaps there's a pattern based on the distance from the starting node to the end.

Wait, maybe I can think recursively.

Define the nimber of a position as mex of the nimbers of positions you can move to.

Since the game is played on a path, the nimbers should follow a certain pattern.

In this case, since it's a path, and moves are only to adjacent inactive nodes, it might be similar to a game of Nim with a single pile of a certain size.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to Nim with the number of tokens equal to the distance to the end.

But I need to think carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of moves as the distance from the starting node to the other leaf, and determine the winner based on the parity of that distance.

Wait, in the first example, n=3, distance from starting node to other leaf is 2, moves=1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second example, n=5, distance=4, moves=4 (even), Hermione wins.

Wait, but in n=4, distance=3, moves=3 (odd), Ron wins.

Wait, but according to this, distance being even or odd doesn't directly correlate.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of moves as equal to the distance.

In n=3, distance=2, moves=1.

In n=4, distance=3, moves=3.

In n=5, distance=4, moves=4.

Wait, in n=3, distance=2, moves=1.

Wait, that doesn't match directly.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is floor((distance)/1), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the number of moves is equal to the distance.

In n=3, distance=2, moves=1. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the floor of (distance /1), but again, no.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that each move covers one edge.

So, in n=3, starting at one leaf, moving to the other leaf covers one edge, so one move.

In n=5, starting at one leaf, moving to the other leaf covers four edges, so four moves.

Wait, but in n=4, starting at one leaf, moving to the other leaf covers three edges, so three moves.

So, in general, the number of moves is equal to the distance from the starting node to the other leaf.

Given that, in the first example, distance=2, moves=2, but wait, earlier I thought moves=1, but actually, in n=3, starting at node 3, moving to node 1 directly, that's one move, covering two nodes.

Wait, no, in n=3, nodes are 1-2-3.

If starting at 3, moving to 2, then to 1.

Wait, but in the first example, it seems like moving directly from 3 to 1, but perhaps that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the movement.

In the first example, starting at node 3, which is connected to node 2.

Node 2 is connected to node 1 and node 3.

Node 1 is connected only to node 2.

So, starting at node 3, Ron moves to node 2.

Then Hermione moves to node 1.

Then no moves left.

So, two moves in total: Ron moves first to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1.

So, in this case, with n=3, starting at node 3, there are two moves: Ron, then Hermione.

So, Hermione makes the last move, so Hermione wins.

But according to the sample input, it's Ron who wins.

Wait, maybe I misread the first example.

Wait, in the first example, the output is "Ron", but according to my current understanding, with two moves, Hermione makes the last move, so she should win.

But the sample output says "Ron".

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the first example again.

Looking back at the first sample input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output:

Ron

Wait, according to the description, starting at node 3.

Given the tree:

- Node 2 connected to node 3

- Node 3 connected to node 1

So, the tree is 1-2-3.

Starting at node 3.

Moves:

1. Ron moves from 3 to 2.

2. Hermione moves from 2 to 1.

3. No moves left.

So, Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but the sample output is "Ron".

This contradicts my current understanding.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Looking back: "A move consists of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there (thus activating this neighbor)."

So, when Ron moves from 3 to 2, node 2 becomes active.

Then Hermione moves from 2 to 1, node 1 becomes active.

Then no moves are left because all nodes are active.

So, Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but the sample output is "Ron".

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the moves.

Wait, perhaps in the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron moves to node 1 directly.

Wait, in the tree 1-2-3, node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1.

So, from node 3, you can only move to node 2, not directly to node 1.

Wait, but in the first sample, starting at node 3, moving to node 1 is allowed.

Wait, but according to the tree, node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1 and node 3.

So, from node 3, you can only move to node 2.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in interpreting the tree.

Looking back at the first sample input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

So, edges are:

- 2 connected to 3

- 3 connected to 1

So, the tree is 1-3-2.

Wait, perhaps node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 3 is connected to node 1.

So, it's 1-3-2.

In this case, starting at node 3, you can move to node 1 or node 2.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says "the tree has exactly two leaves", which are nodes 1 and 2.

So, starting at node 3, which is connected to both leaves, Ron can choose to move to either node 1 or node 2.

Suppose he moves to node 1, then Hermione has no moves left because node 2 is still inactive, but she can't move from node 1 to node 3 because node 3 is already active.

Wait, but in the problem, it's specified that you can only move to inactive neighbors.

When Ron moves from 3 to 1, node 1 becomes active.

Then, Hermione can't move from 1 to 3 because node 3 is already active.

So, Hermione has no moves left, so Ron wins.

But according to my earlier misunderstanding, I thought Ron moves from 3 to 2, then Hermione moves from 2 to 1, but that would require that node 2 is connected to both node 1 and node 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the tree structure.

Given edges:

- 2 connected to 3

- 3 connected to 1

So, the tree is 1-3-2.

So, starting at node 3, Ron can choose to move to either node 1 or node 2.

If he moves to node 1, then Hermione can't move anywhere, so Ron wins.

If he moves to node 2, then Hermione can move from node 2 to node 3, then Ron can't move anymore, so Hermione wins.

But in the sample input, it's specified that starting at node 3, Ron wins.

So, perhaps Ron chooses to move to node 1, forcing Hermione to have no moves left.

Therefore, Ron wins.

So, Ron can choose the move that leads to his victory.

Similarly, in the second sample input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Output:

Hermione

So, tree is 1-2-3-4-5.

Starting at node 5, Ron moves to 4, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1, and then no moves are left, so Hermione makes the last move, hence she wins.

So, in this case, Ron cannot force a win, and Hermione wins.

So, the game depends on the starting position and the structure of the tree.

Given that the tree is a path with two leaves, I need to find a way to determine the winner based on the starting node.

I need to find a general strategy or formula to determine the winner for any starting node in such a tree.

Perhaps I can model this as a game on a path graph, where each node has a certain nimber based on its position.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate the number of moves or the game's length based on the starting position.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves each player can make.

In the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron moves to node 1, and Hermione has no moves, so total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second sample, starting at node 5, Ron moves to 4, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1, total moves: 4 (even), Hermione wins.

In n=4, starting at node 4, Ron moves to 3, Hermione moves to 2, Ron moves to 1, total moves: 3 (odd), Ron wins.

In n=3, starting at node 3, Ron moves to 1, total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In n=2, starting at node 2, Ron moves to 1, total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier misunderstanding, in n=3, starting at node 3, moves: Ron to 2, Hermione to 1, total moves: 2 (even), Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, there must be a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Looking back, in the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron can choose to move to node 1 directly, making Hermione have no moves left.

Alternatively, if Ron moves to node 2, then Hermione moves to node 1, and Ron has no moves left.

So, Ron can choose to move in a way that minimizes the number of moves, or maximizes his chances of winning.

In this case, by moving directly to a leaf, he can force a win.

So, perhaps the strategy is to determine if the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf is even or odd.

Wait, in n=3, starting at node 3, distance to nearest leaf (itself) is 0, which is even, and Ron wins.

In n=5, starting at node 5, distance to nearest leaf is 0, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the distance to the other leaf.

In n=3, distance from 3 to 1 is 2, which is even, and Ron wins.

In n=5, distance from 5 to 1 is 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, that doesn't correlate.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of moves, which is equal to the distance to the other leaf.

In n=3, distance=2, moves=1 (odd), Ron wins.

In n=5
