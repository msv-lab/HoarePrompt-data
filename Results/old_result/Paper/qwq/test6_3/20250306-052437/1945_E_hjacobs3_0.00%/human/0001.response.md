Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a permutation of size n, which means it's an array of distinct integers from 1 to n in some order. We're also given a number x that we need to find in this permutation using a modified binary search. The twist is that before performing the binary search, I can perform at most two swap operations on the array. Each swap allows me to choose two indices i and j and swap the elements at those positions.

The goal is to rearrange the array in such a way that after performing the binary search, the value at position l is equal to x. It's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient to achieve this.

First, I need to make sure I understand what a binary search does, especially since it's applied to a permutation that may not be sorted. In a standard binary search, the array needs to be sorted, and the algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the value at the midpoint is less than or equal to x, it searches the right half; otherwise, it searches the left half. This continues until the size of the search interval is 1.

In this problem, the binary search is slightly different. The loop continues until r - l = 1, and in each iteration, it calculates m as the floor of (r + l) / 2. If p_m <= x, it sets l = m; otherwise, it sets r = m.

Given that the array is a permutation, it's not necessarily sorted, so the binary search may not work correctly unless we rearrange the array appropriately by swapping elements.

My task is to figure out how to perform at most two swaps to make sure that after the binary search, p_l = x.

The problem mentions that it can be shown two swaps are always sufficient. That's helpful to know, as I don't need to worry about cases where more swaps are required.

Let's think about how binary search works in this context. The binary search is performed on the array as is, without sorting it. Normally, binary search relies on the array being sorted to correctly narrow down the search interval. Here, since the array isn't sorted, the search may not find x directly, but we can manipulate the array by swapping elements to guide the search to the correct position.

I need to ensure that after at most two swaps, the binary search ends with p_l = x.

Let me consider the behavior of the binary search in this problem:

1. Initialize l = 0 and r = n.

2. While r - l > 1:

a. Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2).

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m.

c. Else, set r = m.

3. After the loop, p_l should be equal to x.

I need to arrange the array such that after these steps, p_l = x.

First, I need to understand how the binary search divides the array and how the swaps can influence the final position of x.

Let's consider that the binary search is effectively trying to find the position where x would be inserted in a sorted array. However, since the array isn't sorted, I need to adjust it so that the search ends up at the correct position.

One approach is to ensure that the elements at the positions where the binary search looks during its steps are set in such a way that the search converges to x.

But this seems a bit too vague. Let's think differently.

Given that I can perform at most two swaps, I need to find a way to adjust the array minimally to make the binary search work.

Perhaps I can identify the current position of x in the array and see if it's already in a position that would satisfy the binary search condition. If not, I can swap it to a position where it would be found correctly.

But I need to consider that the binary search divides the array based on the values at the midpoints, and I need to ensure that these midpoints have values that guide the search correctly to x.

Wait, maybe I should simulate the binary search process and see where it ends up without any swaps, and then see what swaps are needed to make it land on x.

Let's try that.

Suppose I run the binary search on the original array and see what value p_l is at the end. If p_l is already x, then no swaps are needed. If not, I need to perform swaps to make p_l = x.

But I need to be careful because the binary search path depends on the values in the array, so swapping elements can change the path.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's consider a different strategy.

Another idea is to fix the positions that are examined during the binary search so that they lead the search to x.

Since the binary search only looks at specific positions (the midpoints), perhaps I can ensure that these positions have values that are less than or equal to x or greater than x, depending on the step, to guide the search correctly.

But again, this seems too vague. Let's consider a concrete example.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 6, x = 3

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

If I run the binary search:

Initialize l = 0, r = 6

Loop:

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p_m = 4 >= 3, so l = 3

Now, r - l = 3, which is greater than 1

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4

p_m = 5 >= 3, so l = 4

Now, r - l = 2, which is greater than 1

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5

p_m = 6 >= 3, so l = 5

Now, r - l = 1, end loop

p_l = p_5 = 6, which is not equal to 3

But according to the sample input, the output is 0, meaning no swaps are needed. Wait, but in this case, p_l is 6, not 3. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input. Let's check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Sample Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

Wait, in the first test case, n=6, x=3, array=[1,2,3,4,5,6], output is 0, meaning no swaps are needed. But according to my earlier simulation, p_l = 6, which is not equal to 3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the binary search algorithm.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"m = floor((r + l)/2)"

"If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m"

Wait, in my simulation, when p_m >= x, I set l = m. But according to the problem, if p_m <= x, set l = m, else r = m.

In the first example:

array = [1,2,3,4,5,6], x=3

l=0, r=6

m=floor((0+6)/2)=3, p_m=4 > 3, so r=3

Now, r - l = 3 - 0 = 3 > 1

m=floor((0+3)/2)=1, p_m=2 < 3, so l=1

Now, r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 > 1

m=floor((1+3)/2)=2, p_m=3 <= 3, so l=2

Now, r - l = 3 - 2 =1, end loop

p_l = p_2 =3, which is equal to x=3.

Ah, I must have misremembered the binary search steps in my earlier simulation. So in this case, no swaps are needed, which matches the sample output of 0.

Another sample input:

n=6, x=5

array=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

Run binary search:

l=0, r=6

m=floor((0+6)/2)=3, p_m=5 <=5, so l=3

r - l =3, >1

m=floor((3+6)/2)=4, p_m=2 <=5, so l=4

r - l =2, >1

m=floor((4+6)/2)=5, p_m=4 <=5, so l=5

r - l =1, end loop

p_l = p_5=4 !=5

According to the sample output, perform one swap: 3 4

Swap indices 3 and 4:

Original array: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

After swapping indices 3 and 4: [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Run binary search again:

l=0, r=6

m=3, p_m=6 >5, so r=3

r - l=3-0=3 >1

m=1, p_m=1 <5, so l=1

r - l=3-1=2 >1

m=2, p_m=5 <=5, so l=2

r - l=3-2=1, end loop

p_l = p_2=5 ==5

Perfect, it works with one swap.

Another sample input:

n=5, x=1

array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Run binary search:

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=4 >1, so r=2

r - l=2-0=2 >1

m=1, p_m=5 >1, so r=1

r - l=1-0=1, end loop

p_l = p_0=3 !=1

According to sample output, perform two swaps: 2 4 and 1 5

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

After swapping indices 2 and 4: [3,5,2,4,1]

Then swapping indices 1 and 5: [1,5,2,4,3]

Run binary search:

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=2 <=1, so l=2

r - l=5-2=3 >1

m=3, p_m=4 >1, so r=3

r - l=3-2=1, end loop

p_l = p_2=2 !=1

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I messed up the swap indices.

Wait, in the sample output, it's "2 4" and "1 5", but array indices start at 1.

So, array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Swap 2 and 4: swap array[1] and array[3]: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap 1 and 5: swap array[0] and array[4]: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, run binary search:

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=4 <=1, so l=2

r - l=5-2=3 >1

m=3, p_m=5 >1, so r=3

r - l=3-2=1, end loop

p_l = p_2=4 !=1

Hmm, still not equal to 1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the swap indices.

Wait, perhaps the swaps are applied simultaneously or in a different order.

Let's try swapping 2 and 4 first: swap array[1] and array[3]: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap 1 and 5: swap array[0] and array[4]: [1,2,4,5,3]

Wait, same as before. p_l=4 !=1

But according to the sample output, it should work. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the binary search steps are different.

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=4 >1, so r=2

r - l=2-0=2 >1

m=1, p_m=2 >1, so r=1

r - l=1-0=1, end loop

p_l = p_0=1 ==1

Ah, I see, I made a mistake in the previous step. p_m=4 >1, so r=2, then m=1, p_m=2 >1, so r=1, then r - l=1, end loop, p_l=p_0=1==1.

Yes, it works with two swaps.

So, the strategy seems to be:

- Perform swaps to adjust the array so that the binary search ends with p_l = x.

- We can perform up to two swaps.

Now, I need to find a general way to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me think about what the binary search is doing.

The binary search is effectively trying to find the smallest l such that p_l <= x, and r is the smallest value greater than l where p_r > x.

Wait, actually, in this variant of binary search, it's a bit different from the standard one.

In the given binary search:

- While r - l >1:

- m = floor((r + l)/2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- End while

- Return p_l

This looks like it's trying to find the rightmost position where p_m <= x.

Wait, actually, it's finding the smallest l such that p_l <=x and r is the smallest index where p_r >x.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of dividing the array into two parts: one where p_i <=x and one where p_i >x.

The binary search is trying to find the boundary between these two parts.

So, perhaps I need to arrange the array such that all elements <=x are on the left and >x are on the right, and the position l ends up being the correct one.

But I can only perform up to two swaps, so I need to be precise about which elements to swap.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Run the binary search on the original array to see where it ends up.

2. If p_l ==x, no swaps are needed.

3. If p_l !=x, find out where x is currently located in the array.

4. If swapping x with p_l makes p_l =x, do that.

5. If not, find another element to swap to make it possible with at most two swaps.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that after the binary search, p_l should be x.

So, I need to have x at position l after the binary search.

I can try to directly swap x to position l.

But I need to make sure that the binary search path leads to l.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the elements at the positions examined during the binary search are set in a way that guides the search to l.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Given that two swaps are always sufficient, there must be a general way to adjust the array to make the binary search find x.

One possible way is to place x at the position where the binary search expects it to be.

To do that, I need to determine the final position l that the binary search would land on, and then swap x to that position.

If x is already at that position, no swaps are needed.

If x is at some other position, I can swap it directly to l.

If there are obstacles, I might need a second swap to make that possible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. Run the binary search on the original array to find the final l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0.

3. Else, find the current position of x in the array.

4. If swapping x with p_l makes p_l =x, output 1 swap: swap x's position with l.

5. If not, find another element to swap to make the first swap possible.

But I need to ensure that only two swaps are used.

Wait, perhaps I can always perform at most two swaps to adjust the array so that p_l =x.

Let me consider that I can swap x to its correct position l, and if necessary, swap some other element to make room.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

- Run the binary search to find l.

- If p_l ==x, do nothing.

- Else, find the current position of x, say pos_x.

- Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

- If p_l now equals x, output 1 swap: l+1 and pos_x+1.

- Else, find another element to swap to make p_l =x.

- For the second swap, find an element that is equal to x and swap it to l.

- But since it's a permutation, there's only one x, so this might not work.

Wait, in a permutation, each element is unique, so there's only one x.

So, after swapping x to l, p_l should be x.

But in some cases, as in the sample input, one swap is enough, and in others, two swaps are needed.

I need to understand why two swaps are sometimes necessary.

Looking back at the second sample input:

n=6, x=5

array=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

After one swap: swap 3 and 4 -> [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then binary search finds p_l=5, which is correct.

In the third sample input:

n=5, x=1

array=[3,5,4,2,1]

After two swaps: swap 2 and 4 -> [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap 1 and 5 -> [1,2,4,5,3]

Then binary search finds p_l=1, which is correct.

So, in the first swap, they moved x to its correct position, and in the second swap, adjusted another element if necessary.

Wait, in the first swap, swap 2 and 4: positions 2 and 4 contain 5 and 2 respectively.

After swapping, array becomes [3,2,4,5,1]

Then, swap 1 and 5: positions 1 and 5 contain 3 and 1, so after swapping, [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, p_l =1, which is x.

So, in this case, x was moved to position 5, and then swapped to position 1.

But why not swap directly x to position l?

Maybe in some cases, direct swapping isn't possible, and I need to use an intermediate swap.

Let me think of a general approach.

General Approach:

1. Run the binary search on the original array to find l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0.

3. Else, find the current position of x, say pos_x.

4. Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

5. Run the binary search again.

6. If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

7. Else, find another element to swap to make p_l =x.

8. Swap another element with p_l or p_pos_x to achieve p_l ==x.

9. Output 2 swaps.

But I need to make sure that this always works with at most two swaps.

Given that it's guaranteed that two swaps are sufficient, I need to find a way to always achieve p_l ==x with at most two swaps.

Let me consider that in the first swap, I swap x to its correct position l.

If that makes p_l ==x, then I'm done with one swap.

If not, I need to perform a second swap to fix any inconsistencies.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Alternative Approach:

1. Run the binary search to find l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0.

3. Else, find pos_x.

4. Swap p_l and p_pos_x.

5. Run the binary search again.

6. If p_l ==x, output 1 swap.

7. Else, find another element, say p_k, such that swapping p_k with p_l makes p_l ==x.

8. Swap p_l and p_k.

9. Output 2 swaps.

But I need to make sure that after the first swap, the second swap will make p_l ==x.

Wait, perhaps I need to swap p_l with x, and if that doesn't make p_l ==x, swap p_l with another element that would make it equal to x.

But since x is unique, swapping p_l with x should make p_l ==x.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider an example where one swap isn't enough.

Take the third sample input:

n=5, x=1

array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Run binary search:

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=4 >1, r=2

m=0, p_m=3 >1, r=0

r - l=0 - 0=0, end loop

p_l = p_0=3 !=1

So, l=0

pos_x=4 (index 4)

Swap p_0 and p_4: array becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Run binary search again:

l=0, r=5

m=2, p_m=4 >1, r=2

m=0, p_m=1 <=1, l=0

r - l=2 - 0=2 >1

m=1, p_m=5 >1, r=1

r - l=1 -0=1, end loop

p_l = p_0=1 ==1

So, in this case, one swap is enough.

But in the sample output, it shows two swaps. Maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the goal.

Perhaps the approach isn't unique, and multiple sequences of swaps can lead to the correct result.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap is enough, and in others, two swaps are needed.

I need to find a way to determine the necessary swaps in a general case.

Let me try to think differently.

I can think of the binary search as partitioning the array into segments based on the midpoints chosen during the search.

I need to ensure that x is placed in the segment where the binary search expects it to be.

But this seems too abstract.

Another idea: since the array is a permutation, all elements are unique.

I can treat the array as a sequence of values and see how the binary search navigates through it based on comparisons with x.

I need to manipulate the array so that the search
