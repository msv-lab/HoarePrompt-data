Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `2n`, and it contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice. Then there's an integer `k` (between `1` and `n/2`), and I need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, with specific properties.

First, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Additionally, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem also mentions that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a sequence `x` is a subset of `y` if `x` can be obtained by deleting several elements from `y` and rearranging them in any order. So, order doesn't matter, and elements can be rearranged.

Given that, I need to select `2k` elements from the first `n` elements to form `l`, and `2k` elements from the last `n` elements to form `r`, such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

I recall that XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR elements doesn't matter, and XORing a number with itself results in zero.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire array, and the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements each contain one occurrence of each number.

Wait, no. Actually, each number appears twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in the first `n` and once in the last `n`. The problem doesn't specify that. So, a number could appear twice in the first `n` elements or twice in the last `n` elements.

Wait, let's read the problem again. It says:

"l is a subset of [a1, a2, … an]

r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, … a2n]"

And it's mentioned that each integer from `1` to `n` occurs exactly twice in `a`.

So, some numbers might appear twice in the first `n` elements, and some might appear twice in the last `n` elements, or they could be split between the two halves.

I need to find `2k` elements from the first `n` and `2k` elements from the last `n` such that their XORs are equal.

I need to think about how to select these subsets.

One idea is to use the property of XOR. If I can find subsets such that the XOR of their elements is equal, maybe I can find a way to balance the XOR values between `l` and `r`.

But this seems a bit tricky. Let me think differently.

Since the problem guarantees that at least one pair exists, I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first `n` elements and the XOR of all elements in the last `n` elements.

Let's denote:

`xor_l = a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an`

`xor_r = a(n+1) ^ a(n+2) ^ ... ^ a(2n)`

Since each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire array, `xor_l ^ xor_r` should be equal to the XOR of all elements in the array.

Wait, actually, since each number appears twice, and XOR is zero for a number XORed with itself, the XOR of all elements in the array should be zero.

Therefore, `xor_l ^ xor_r = 0`, which implies `xor_l = xor_r`.

That's an important observation. So, the XOR of the first `n` elements is equal to the XOR of the last `n` elements.

Now, I need to select `2k` elements from the first `n` and `2k` elements from the last `n` such that their XORs are equal.

Since `xor_l = xor_r`, maybe I can select subsets such that their XORs are equal to a certain value.

Wait, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XORs are equal to `xor_l`.

Because `xor_l = xor_r`, if I select a subset `l` from the first `n` elements with XOR equal to `xor_l`, then I can select a subset `r` from the last `n` elements with XOR equal to `xor_r = xor_l`, and they will match.

But how do I select such subsets?

I need to select `2k` elements from the first `n` elements such that their XOR is `xor_l`.

Similarly for the last `n` elements.

Wait, but selecting `2k` elements with XOR equal to `xor_l` might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can select `2k` elements from the first `n` elements and `2k` elements from the last `n` elements such that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is equal.

But that might not be directly helpful.

Let me think about another approach.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select `2k` elements from each half, maybe I can pair the occurrences of the numbers and select them accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs of numbers that are equal and include them in `l` and `r`.

But the problem allows subsets with any order and any selection of elements, as long as they are subsets of the respective halves.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of numbers that are equal and include them in `l` and `r`.

But I need to select `2k` elements in each subset, so that would mean selecting `k` pairs in each subset.

Wait, but the problem allows subsets to be any selection of elements, not necessarily pairs.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that since `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need to select subsets `l` and `r` with equal XOR, perhaps selecting subsets with even occurrences of each number could help.

Wait, since XOR of two identical numbers is zero, maybe I can balance the selections accordingly.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some ideas.

In the first sample:

Input:

2 1

1 2 2 1

Output:

2 1

2 1

So, n=2, k=1

Array: 1,2,2,1

First n elements: 1,2

Last n elements: 2,1

Selected l: 2,1

Selected r: 2,1

XOR of l: 2^1 = 3

XOR of r: 2^1 = 3

Which matches.

In the second sample:

Input:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

Output:

6 4

1 3

So, n=6, k=1

Array: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

First n elements: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Last n elements: 1,6,3,5,5,4

Selected l: 6,4

Selected r:1,3

XOR of l: 6^4 = 2

XOR of r:1^3=2

Which matches.

So, in both samples, they selected subsets such that their XORs are equal.

Now, how to generalize this.

One approach that comes to mind is to select pairs of equal elements, one from the first half and one from the second half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

Wait, but in the first sample, they selected 2 and 1 from both halves, but they are not necessarily from different halves.

Wait, in the first sample, the first half is 1,2 and the second half is 2,1, so selecting 2 and 1 from both halves.

In the second sample, they selected 6 and 4 from the first half, and 1 and 3 from the second half.

Wait, in that case, 6 and 4 are from the first half, and 1 and 3 are from the second half.

So, perhaps they are selecting elements such that their XOR matches.

But I need a systematic way to select these subsets.

Let me consider that since the XOR of the entire first half is equal to the XOR of the entire second half, maybe I can select subsets that have the same XOR as the remaining elements in their respective halves.

Wait, that might be too complicated.

Another idea: since XOR is involved, perhaps I can look at the XOR of all elements in the first half and try to select a subset of `2k` elements such that their XOR is equal to a certain value.

But determining that value and ensuring that the same XOR can be achieved in the second half might be tricky.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

I know that XOR is linear, which means I can use Gaussian elimination to find subsets with a desired XOR.

But that might be too slow, especially since n can be up to 5*10^4 and t can be up to 5000.

I need a more efficient approach.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Let me denote:

- For each number from 1 to n, count how many times it appears in the first half and how many times it appears in the second half.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, it can appear:

- Twice in the first half

- Twice in the second half

- Once in the first half and once in the second half

I need to consider these cases.

Let me consider that I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half such that the XOR of selected elements in both halves is equal.

I need to maximize the use of pairs that can simplify the XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs of equal numbers, one from the first half and one from the second half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

But I need to select `2k` elements in each subset.

Wait, maybe I can select `k` pairs of equal numbers, one from each half, and include two copies in each subset.

But I need to select `2k` elements, so that would work if I select `k` pairs and include two copies of each in `l` and `r`.

Wait, but that might not be possible for all `k`, since some numbers may appear twice in the same half.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more strategic.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on where their two occurrences are:

1. Both occurrences are in the first half.

2. Both occurrences are in the second half.

3. One occurrence is in the first half and one in the second half.

Let me denote:

- For numbers in category 1: both occurrences are in the first half.

- For numbers in category 2: both occurrences are in the second half.

- For numbers in category 3: one occurrence in the first half and one in the second half.

Now, for category 3, I can select one occurrence for `l` and one for `r`.

For category 1, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `l`.

Similarly, for category 2, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `r`.

I need to select a total of `2k` elements for `l` and `r` each, such that their XORs are equal.

This seems a bit involved. Maybe I can start by selecting as many category 3 numbers as possible, since selecting both their occurrences (one in `l` and one in `r`) would contribute the same value to both XORs.

Wait, but I need to select `2k` elements in each subset, not `k` numbers.

Wait, no, `2k` elements in each subset.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select `m` pairs from category 3, where each pair consists of one occurrence in `l` and one in `r`.

Each such pair would contribute the same value to both `l` and `r`.

Then, I need to select the remaining elements to make up `2k` elements in each subset.

This might be a way to ensure that the XORs are equal.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

- For category 3 numbers, I can select one occurrence for `l` and one for `r`.

- For category 1 numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `l`.

- For category 2 numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `r`.

I need to select a total of `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` for `r`.

I need to ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

One strategy could be:

1. Select as many category 3 numbers as possible, assigning one occurrence to `l` and one to `r`.

2. For the remaining selections, use category 1 and category 2 numbers to fill up to `2k` elements, ensuring that the XORs match.

But this still seems a bit vague.

Let me think about the total number of category 3 numbers.

Let me denote:

- Let `c3` be the number of category 3 numbers.

Then, the number of such pairs is `c3`.

Each pair can contribute two elements: one to `l` and one to `r`.

So, if I select `p` such pairs, I would have `p` elements in `l` and `p` elements in `r` from category 3.

Then, I need to select `2k - p` elements from category 1 for `l`, and `2k - p` elements from category 2 for `r`.

Wait, but category 1 has numbers with two occurrences in the first half, so I can select up to two elements per number.

Similarly, category 2 has numbers with two occurrences in the second half.

I need to select `2k - p` elements from category 1 for `l`, and `2k - p` elements from category 2 for `r`.

Moreover, I need to ensure that the XOR of selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

Given that, perhaps I can select `p` pairs from category 3, and then select `2k - p` elements from category 1 for `l` and `2k - p` elements from category 2 for `r`, ensuring that their XORs are equal.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for category 3 numbers, selecting one occurrence for `l` and one for `r` would make their XOR contributions equal.

Then, for the remaining selections, I need to select elements from category 1 for `l` and from category 2 for `r`, such that their XORs are equal.

But since category 1 numbers are only in the first half, and category 2 numbers are only in the second half, and their occurrences are limited, I need to manage their selections carefully.

This seems too involved for the time constraints.

Let me consider a different approach.

Given that the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps there's a straightforward way to select the subsets.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

In the first sample:

n=2, k=1

Array: 1,2,2,1

First half: 1,2

Second half: 2,1

Selected l: 2,1

Selected r:2,1

XOR: 2^1 = 3 for both.

In the second sample:

n=6, k=1

Array:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

First half:6,4,2,1,2,3

Second half:1,6,3,5,5,4

Selected l:6,4

Selected r:1,3

XOR:6^4=2 and 1^3=2.

So, in the first sample, they selected all elements from each half.

In the second sample, they selected two elements from each half with matching XOR.

Perhaps a general strategy is to select elements such that the XOR of selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

One way to ensure this is to select elements such that the XOR of their differences is zero.

But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half such that the XOR of all selected elements is zero.

But since the XOR of the entire first half equals the XOR of the entire second half, maybe I can use that property.

Let me denote:

`xor_l = a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an`

`xor_r = a(n+1) ^ a(n+2) ^ ... ^ a(2n)`

As established earlier, `xor_l = xor_r`.

Now, suppose I select a subset `l` from the first half with XOR `x`, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half would be `xor_l ^ x`.

Similarly, if I select a subset `r` from the second half with XOR `y`, the XOR of the remaining elements in the second half would be `xor_r ^ y`.

But since `xor_l = xor_r`, if I can select `l` and `r` such that `x = y`, then `xor_l ^ x = xor_r ^ y`, which implies that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is equal.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total XOR of selected elements in both subsets.

If I select subsets `l` and `r` with XOR `x` and `y` respectively, then I need `x = y`.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible selections and find such subsets.

But with n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider another angle.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select `2k` elements from each half, maybe I can look at the XOR of the entire first half and the second half, and try to balance the selections accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of equal numbers, one from each half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

But that might not be possible if some numbers appear twice in the same half.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me create two frequency arrays:

- `freq_l`: frequency of each number in the first half.

- `freq_r`: frequency of each number in the second half.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, `freq_l[i] + freq_r[i] = 2` for each `i` from `1` to `n`.

Now, I need to select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half such that the XOR of selected elements in both subsets is equal.

One idea is to select numbers that appear once in each half, and select one occurrence for `l` and one for `r`.

For numbers that appear twice in the same half, I need to handle them differently.

Wait, perhaps I can categorize the numbers based on their frequencies in the halves.

Let me denote:

- `both_l`: numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- `both_r`: numbers that appear twice in the second half.

- `split`: numbers that appear once in the first half and once in the second half.

Then:

- For `split` numbers, I can select one for `l` and one for `r`, and their XOR contributions will be equal.

- For `both_l` numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `l`.

- For `both_r` numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `r`.

I need to select a total of `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` for `r`.

One possible strategy is:

1. Select as many `split` numbers as possible, assigning one to `l` and one to `r`.

2. For the remaining selections, use `both_l` numbers for `l` and `both_r` numbers for `r`, ensuring that their XORs match.

But this still seems complex.

Let me think about the total number of `split` numbers.

Let `c_split` be the number of `split` numbers.

Then, I can select up to `c_split` pairs, each contributing one to `l` and one to `r`.

Each such pair would contribute the same value to both `l` and `r` in terms of XOR.

So, if I select `p` such pairs, I would have `p` elements in `l` and `p` elements in `r` from `split` numbers.

Then, I need to select `2k - p` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - p` elements from `both_r` for `r`, such that the XOR of selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

This seems manageable.

Let me denote:

- `xor_split_l`: XOR of the `p` elements selected from `split` numbers for `l`.

- `xor_split_r`: XOR of the `p` elements selected from `split` numbers for `r`.

Since we're selecting one occurrence of each `split` number for `l` and one for `r`, and both occurrences are equal, `xor_split_l = xor_split_r`.

Then, I need to select `2k - p` elements from `both_l` with XOR `x`, and `2k - p` elements from `both_r` with XOR `x`, such that `xor_split_l ^ x = xor_split_r ^ x`.

But since `xor_split_l = xor_split_r`, this would hold.

So, selecting `p` pairs from `split` numbers and then selecting elements from `both_l` and `both_r` with the same XOR `x` would satisfy the condition.

Now, I need to choose `p` such that `2k - p` elements can be selected from `both_l` and `both_r` with the same XOR.

This still seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can set `p = k`, so I select `k` pairs from `split` numbers, and then select `k` elements from `both_l` and `k` elements from `both_r` with the same XOR.

But I need to select `2k` elements in each subset, so selecting `k` pairs from `split` numbers would give me `k` elements in `l` and `k` elements in `r`.

Then, I need to select `k` more elements for `l` from `both_l` and `k` more elements for `r` from `both_r`, such that the XOR of the entire `l` equals the XOR of the entire `r`.

Given that `xor_l = xor_r`, and the selected `split` pairs have equal XOR contributions to `l` and `r`, perhaps selecting arbitrary `k` elements from `both_l` and `k` elements from `both_r` would suffice.

But I need to ensure that their XORs are equal.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps there's a simple way to construct such subsets.

Looking back at the sample inputs, in the first sample, they selected all elements from each half.

In the second sample, they selected two elements from each half with equal XOR.

Perhaps selecting all elements from each half would always work, but in the first sample, that's possible, but for larger `k`, it might not be feasible.

Wait, no, the problem states that `k` is up to `n/2`, and `n` can be up to `5*10^4`, so selecting all elements isn't efficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for `k = 1`, I need to select two elements from each half with equal XOR.

I can iterate through all possible pairs in the first half and compute their XOR, and do the same for the second half, and find a matching pair.

But with n up to `5*10^4`, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

So, that's not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the properties of XOR again.

I recall that in linear algebra, XOR operations can be represented as vector operations over GF(2).

So, perhaps I can model this as a system of linear equations and find a solution using Gaussian elimination.

But with n up to `5*10^4`, Gaussian elimination would be too slow.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that since `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need to select subsets with equal XOR, maybe I can select subsets such that their XOR is equal to `xor_l`.

Wait, but I need to select `2k` elements from each half with equal XOR.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the XOR of the selected subsets.

Let me denote:

- `s_l`: the XOR of selected elements in `l`.

- `s_r`: the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

I need `s_l = s_r`.

Given that, and knowing that the XOR of all elements in the first half is `xor_l`, and in the second half is `xor_r`, with `xor_l = xor_r`, perhaps I can relate the selected subsets to the overall XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the XOR of selected elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half, since `s_l ^ (xor_l ^ s_l) = xor_l`.

Similarly for `r`.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I select `2k` elements from the first half and `2k` elements from the second half, and compute their XORs.

I need these XORs to be equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements such that the XOR of their differences is zero.

But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` together.

If `s_l = s_r`, then `s_l ^ s_r = 0`.

So, the XOR of selected elements in `l` and `r` is zero.

But I'm not sure how to use that.

Let me consider that the XOR of all selected elements in both subsets is equal to `s_l ^ s_r = 0`, since `s_l = s_r`.

Moreover, the XOR of all elements in the first half is `xor_l`, and in the second half is `xor_r`, with `xor_l = xor_r`.

But I need to relate the selected subsets to these XORs.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, and I need to select `2k` elements from each half, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of identical numbers, one from each half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

But that might not be possible if some numbers appear twice in the same half.

Wait, perhaps I can select as many `split` pairs as possible and fill the remaining selections from `both_l` and `both_r`.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- `c_split`: number of `split` numbers.

- `c_both_l`: number of numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- `c_both_r`: number of numbers that appear twice in the second half.

Note that `c_split + c_both_l + c_both_r = n`.

Now, I can select up to `c_split` pairs, each contributing one element to `l` and one to `r`.

Each such pair would contribute the same value to both `l` and `r` in terms of XOR.

Then, I need to select `2k - c_split` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - c_split` elements from `both_r` for `r`, such that their XORs are equal.

But I need to ensure that `2k - c_split` is non-negative, which is guaranteed since `k <= floor(n/2)` and `c_split <= n`.

Wait, but it's possible that `c_split < k`, so `2k - c_split` could be larger than `c_both_l` or `c_both_r`.

I need to make sure that I can select enough elements from `both_l` and `both_r`.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for `both_l` numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `l`.

Similarly, for `both_r` numbers, I can select zero, one, or two occurrences for `r`.

I need to select a total of `2k - c_split` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - c_split` elements from `both_r` for `r`, such that their XORs are equal.

This still seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to find a way to select elements such that their XORs match, possibly by selecting elements with specific properties.

Wait, maybe I can look at the XOR of all elements in `both_l` and `both_r`.

Wait, but `both_l` numbers appear twice in the first half, so their XOR contributions in `l` would be zero if both are selected.

Similarly for `both_r` numbers in `r`.

This might simplify things.

Let me think about that.

If I select both occurrences of a number from `both_l` in `l`, their XOR contribution is zero.

Similarly for `both_r` in `r`.

So, selecting both occurrences of a number from `both_l` is equivalent to selecting zero elements in terms of XOR.

Therefore, I can treat selecting both occurrences of a number from `both_l` as not selecting anything, since their XOR is zero.

Similarly for `both_r`.

So, effectively, for `both_l` numbers, I can choose to select zero or one occurrence, since selecting two is equivalent to selecting zero.

Similarly for `both_r`.

Therefore, for `both_l`, I can select zero or one occurrence per number, and similarly for `both_r`.

Now, I need to select `2k - c_split` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - c_split` elements from `both_r` for `r`, such that the XOR of selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

Given that, and considering that selecting one occurrence of a number contributes its value to the XOR, and selecting zero or two contributions nothing, perhaps I can find a way to match the XORs.

But this still seems complex.

Let me consider that if `c_split >= k`, then I can select `k` pairs from `split` numbers, and select zero elements from `both_l` and `both_r`.

In this case, `l` and `r` would each have `2k` elements, all from `split` numbers, and their XORs would be equal.

But what if `c_split < k`?

Then, I need to select `c_split` pairs from `split` numbers, and select the remaining `2k - c_split` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - c_split` elements from `both_r` for `r`, ensuring their XORs are equal.

But selecting elements from `both_l` and `both_r`, I need their XORs to be equal.

Given that each number in `both_l` can contribute zero or its value to the XOR, and similarly for `both_r`, I need to choose a subset of `both_l` numbers to contribute to `l`, and a subset of `both_r` numbers to contribute to `r`, such that the XOR of contributions in `l` equals the XOR of contributions in `r`.

This sounds like finding two subsets with equal XOR, which is a classic problem that can be solved using Gaussian elimination over GF(2).

However, with n up to `5*10^4` and t up to `5000`, this approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that since selecting both occurrences of a number from `both_l` or `both_r` contributes zero to the XOR, I can ignore such selections as they don't affect the XOR.

Therefore, I only need to consider selecting one occurrence of some numbers from `both_l` and `both_r`.

Given that, I need to select a subset of `both_l` numbers, summing their XOR contributions to `x`, and a subset of `both_r` numbers, summing their XOR contributions to `x`, such that `x` is equal for both subsets.

Given that, and considering that I need to select `2k - c_split` elements in total from `both_l` and `both_r`, but I need to select `2k - c_split` elements from each.

Wait, no, I need to select `2k - c_split` elements from `both_l` for `l`, and `2k - c_split` elements from `both_r` for `r`, such that the XOR of selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of selected elements in `r`.

This seems too involved for the time constraints.

Perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that for `both_l` numbers, selecting one occurrence contributes its value to the XOR, and selecting two contributions nothing.

Similarly for `both_r`.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements such that the XOR of selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements arbitrarily from `both_l` and `both_r`, and adjust the selections to make their XORs equal.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that since `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need `s_l = s_r`, perhaps I can set `s_l = s_r = xor_l`.

Then, I can try to select subsets from `both_l` and `both_r` such that their XORs are equal to `xor_l`.

But I need to select `2k - c_split` elements from each.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider that selecting elements from `both_l` and `both_r` is independent, and I need their XORs to be equal.

Perhaps I can select elements from `both_l` to achieve a certain XOR, and then select elements from `both_r` to match that XOR.

But again, with large n, this needs to be efficient.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that for `both_l` numbers, I can create a set of possible XORs achievable by selecting subsets of one occurrence of each number.

Similarly for `both_r`.

Then, I need to find two subsets, one from `both_l` and one from `both_r`, with the same XOR value.

But with n up to `5*10^4`, this is not feasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that since `xor_l = xor_r`, and I need `s_l = s_r`, perhaps I can select subsets such that `s_l = s_r = xor_l`.

But I need to select `2k` elements in each subset, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can select subsets such that `s_l = s_r = xor_l`.

Then, for the remaining elements in each half, their XOR would be `xor_l ^ s_l = 0`.

But since `s_l = xor_l`, `xor_l ^ s_l = 0`.

Similarly for `r`.

So, the remaining elements in each half would have XOR zero.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that if I can select subsets `l` and `r` with `s_l = s_r`, then their XORs are equal.

But finding such subsets efficiently is challenging.

Given the time constraints, perhaps there's a simpler, greedy approach.

Let me consider selecting pairs of equal numbers, one from each half, and include them in `l` and `r` respectively.

This way, their XOR contributions would be equal.

But if a number appears twice in the same half, I can't form such pairs.
