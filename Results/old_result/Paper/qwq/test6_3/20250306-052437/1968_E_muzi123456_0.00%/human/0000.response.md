Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n x n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of the chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. It's essentially the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates. So, it's like moving in a grid-based city where you can only move horizontally and vertically, and the distance is the total number of blocks you have to travel.

Now, I need to select n points in an n x n grid such that the number of unique distances between any two points is maximized. The problem provides some examples for small values of n, like n=2, n=3, and so on, up to n=6.

Looking at the examples:

- For n=2, the output is:

1 1

1 2

So, the points are (1,1) and (1,2). The distances are:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

So, the distinct distances are {0,1}, which has a size of 2.

The note says that for n=2, this is the maximum possible.

For n=3:

2 1

2 3

3 1

Distances:

- (2,1) to (2,1): 0

- (2,1) to (2,3): 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): 1

- (2,3) to (2,3): 0

- (2,3) to (3,1): 2

- (3,1) to (3,1): 0

Distinct distances: {0,1,2}

Size is 3.

For n=4:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,1): 0

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (4,3): 5

- (1,1) to (4,4): 6

- (1,3) to (1,3): 0

- (1,3) to (4,3): 3

- (1,3) to (4,4): 4

- (4,3) to (4,3): 0

- (4,3) to (4,4): 1

- (4,4) to (4,4): 0

Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

Size is 7.

Similarly, for n=5 and n=6, the outputs are provided.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to spread the points out in such a way that the distances between them are as diverse as possible.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t -= 1

n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n + 1):

print('1', end=' ')

print(i)

print(' ')

So, for each test case, it reads t, then for each of the t test cases, it reads n and outputs n points where all points have x-coordinate 1 and y-coordinates from 1 to n.

So, for n=2, it would output:

1 1

1 2

Which matches the first example.

For n=3:

1 1

1 2

1 3

For n=4:

1 1

1 2

1 3

1 4

And so on.

Now, I need to verify if this approach maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze this.

In this approach, all points are placed in the first row, with x=1 and y from 1 to n.

So, for any two points (1, y1) and (1, y2), the Manhattan distance is |1-1| + |y1 - y2| = 0 + |y1 - y2| = |y1 - y2|.

So, the distances between any two points are simply the absolute differences in their y-coordinates.

Given that y coordinates range from 1 to n, the possible distances are 1, 2, 3, ..., up to n-1.

So, the distinct distances would be {0,1,2,3,...,n-1}.

The size of this set is n.

Wait, but for n=2, in the first example, the distinct distances are {0,1}, which has size 2.

For n=3, according to this approach, distances would be {0,1,2}, size 3.

For n=4, {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

But in the n=4 example provided in the problem, the output has points:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

And the distinct distances are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which has size 7, which is larger than n.

Similarly, for n=5 in the problem's example, the output has points:

1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5

And the distinct distances are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, size 10, which is larger than n=5.

Wait, so in the problem's examples, for n=4, they achieved 7 distinct distances, whereas the given program would output points giving only n=4 distinct distances.

Similarly, for n=5, they have 10 distinct distances, whereas the program would give only 5.

So, it seems like the given program does not maximize the number of distinct distances.

Wait, but in the n=2 example, it gives 2 distinct distances, which matches the maximum possible.

For n=3, the program would give 3 distinct distances, but in the problem's example for n=3, they have {0,1,2,3}, which is 4 distinct distances.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, for n=3, if we place points at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), the distances would be {0,1,2}, size 3.

But in the problem's example, they place points at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), and get distances {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

So, indeed, the given program's approach does not maximize the number of distinct distances.

Similarly, for n=4, the program would place points at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), giving distances {0,1,2,3}, size 4, but the problem's example achieves 7.

For n=5, the program would give {0,1,2,3,4}, size 5, but the problem's example achieves 10.

So, it seems like the given program does not achieve the maximum number of distinct distances.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but for n=2, it does achieve the maximum.

Maybe for smaller n, it works, but for larger n, it doesn't.

But the problem requires the program to be correct for all n in the given range.

Hence, since it doesn't maximize the number of distinct distances for n >=3, it's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem.

Wait, maybe the program is correct, and the examples provided in the problem are just illustrations, not necessarily optimal.

But no, the notes say "it can be shown that it is the greatest possible."

So, in the first example, for n=2, it's the greatest possible.

For n=3, the arrangement given in the notes achieves 4 distinct distances, whereas the program would achieve only 3.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is a different approach, and I need to verify if it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the program is attempting to place all points in a single row to maximize diversity.

But as seen, for n >=3, it doesn't achieve the maximum number of distinct distances.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to place points in a way that the number of distinct distances is equal to n, but as seen, for n >=3, it's possible to achieve more.

Hence, the program is suboptimal and therefore incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for any arrangement that maximizes the number of distinct distances, and the given program doesn't necessarily achieve that.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "your task is to maximize the size of H."

Hence, if the program doesn't always maximize H, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to select n cells in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an integer n, representing an n x n grid.
   - We need to choose n cells in this grid.
   - Our goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances among these chosen cells.

2. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
   - We need to select n points such that the number of unique distances calculated using the Manhattan distance formula is maximized.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For n=2, placing points at (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances {0,1}.
   - For n=3, placing points at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) gives distances {0,1,2,3}.
   - For higher n, similar strategies are used to maximize diversity in distances.

4. **Identifying the Flaw in the Given Program**:
   - The given program places all points in the first row, i.e., (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n).
   - For these points, the Manhattan distances are simply the differences in their y-coordinates, leading to distances from 0 to n-1.
   - This results in n distinct distances.
   - However, as seen in the examples, for n=3, it is possible to achieve 4 distinct distances, which is more than n.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not always maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for n >= 3.
   - Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases t.
  - For each test case, read the integer n.

- **Point Selection**:
  - Select n points all in the first row: (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n).

- **Output**:
  - Print the coordinates of the selected points.

- **Flaw**:
  - This approach only achieves n distinct distances, which is suboptimal for n >= 3, as demonstrated in the examples provided in the problem statement.

Hence, the given program is incorrect for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n in the specified range.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
