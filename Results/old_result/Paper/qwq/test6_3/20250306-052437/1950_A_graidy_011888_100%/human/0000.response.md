Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given three digits, a, b, and c, and I need to determine if they form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions provided.

First, I need to understand what a stair and a peak are. A stair is defined as a < b < c, which means each digit is larger than the previous one. A peak is defined as a < b > c, meaning the middle digit is larger than both the first and the third.

The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by an integer t, and for each test case, there are three digits provided on a single line.

My task is to read these inputs, check the conditions for each test case, and output "STAIR" if it's a stair, "PEAK" if it's a peak, and "NONE" otherwise.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

7

1 2 3

3 2 1

1 5 3

3 4 1

0 0 0

4 1 7

4 5 7

Output:

STAIR

NONE

PEAK

PEAK

NONE

NONE

STAIR

From this, I can see that for the first test case, 1 2 3, it's a stair because 1 < 2 < 3.

The second one, 3 2 1, doesn't satisfy either condition, so it's NONE.

The third one, 1 5 3, is a peak because 1 < 5 > 3.

The fourth one, 3 4 1, is also a peak for the same reason: 3 < 4 > 1.

The fifth one, 0 0 0, doesn't satisfy either condition, so it's NONE.

The sixth one, 4 1 7, doesn't satisfy either condition because 4 is not less than 1, and 1 is not greater than 7.

The seventh one, 4 5 7, is a stair because 4 < 5 < 7.

So, the logic seems straightforward. Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

The program defines a function called func(). It reads the number of test cases, n, using input(). Then, for each test case, it reads the three digits a, b, and c using map(int, input().split()).

It then checks if a < b < c, and if so, prints "STAIR". If not, it checks if a < b and b > c, and if so, prints "PEAK". Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

Looking back at the problem statement, this seems to match the conditions specified. Let me verify with the example test cases.

Take the first test case: 1 2 3.

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.

Check if 1 < 2 < 3, which is True, so print "STAIR". Correct.

Second test case: 3 2 1.

a = 3, b = 2, c = 1.

Check if 3 < 2 < 1, which is False.

Then check if 3 < 2 and 2 > 1, which is False and True respectively, so overall False. So, print "NONE". Correct.

Third test case: 1 5 3.

a = 1, b = 5, c = 3.

Check if 1 < 5 < 3, which is False.

Then check if 1 < 5 and 5 > 3, which is True and True, so print "PEAK". Correct.

Fourth test case: 3 4 1.

a = 3, b = 4, c = 1.

Check if 3 < 4 < 1, which is False.

Then check if 3 < 4 and 4 > 1, which is True and True, so print "PEAK". Correct.

Fifth test case: 0 0 0.

a = 0, b = 0, c = 0.

Check if 0 < 0 < 0, which is False.

Then check if 0 < 0 and 0 > 0, which is False and False, so print "NONE". Correct.

Sixth test case: 4 1 7.

a = 4, b = 1, c = 7.

Check if 4 < 1 < 7, which is False.

Then check if 4 < 1 and 1 > 7, which is False and False, so print "NONE". Correct.

Seventh test case: 4 5 7.

a = 4, b = 5, c = 7.

Check if 4 < 5 < 7, which is True, so print "STAIR". Correct.

So, based on the example, the program seems to be working correctly.

Let me consider some edge cases to make sure.

Edge case 1: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1.

This should be NONE, as neither a < b < c nor a < b > c is true.

Check if 1 < 1 < 1, which is False.

Then check if 1 < 1 and 1 > 1, which is False and False, so print "NONE". Correct.

Edge case 2: a = 1, b = 2, c = 2.

Check if 1 < 2 < 2, which is False because 2 < 2 is False.

Then check if 1 < 2 and 2 > 2, which is True and False, so overall False. Print "NONE". Correct.

Edge case 3: a = 2, b = 1, c = 3.

Check if 2 < 1 < 3, which is False.

Then check if 2 < 1 and 1 > 3, which is False and False, so print "NONE". Correct.

Edge case 4: a = 1, b = 3, c = 2.

Check if 1 < 3 < 2, which is False.

Then check if 1 < 3 and 3 > 2, which is True and True, so print "PEAK". Correct.

Edge case 5: a = 0, b = 9, c = 5.

Check if 0 < 9 < 5, which is False.

Then check if 0 < 9 and 9 > 5, which is True and True, so print "PEAK". Correct.

Edge case 6: a = 5, b = 6, c = 7.

Check if 5 < 6 < 7, which is True, so print "STAIR". Correct.

Edge case 7: a = 7, b = 6, c = 5.

Check if 7 < 6 < 5, which is False.

Then check if 7 < 6 and 6 > 5, which is False and True, so overall False. Print "NONE". Correct.

Edge case 8: a = 1, b = 1, c = 2.

Check if 1 < 1 < 2, which is False.

Then check if 1 < 1 and 1 > 2, which is False and False, so print "NONE". Correct.

Edge case 9: a = 2, b = 3, c = 1.

Check if 2 < 3 < 1, which is False.

Then check if 2 < 3 and 3 > 1, which is True and True, so print "PEAK". Correct.

Edge case 10: a = 3, b = 2, c = 1.

Check if 3 < 2 < 1, which is False.

Then check if 3 < 2 and 2 > 1, which is False and True, so overall False. Print "NONE". Correct.

Seems like the program handles these edge cases correctly.

Another thing to consider is the constraints. The problem states that a, b, and c are digits between 0 and 9, inclusive. The program doesn't make any assumptions beyond that, so it should be fine.

Also, the problem mentions that there are t test cases, and t can be up to 1000. The program uses a loop to handle each test case, which should be efficient enough for this range.

I should also check if there are any syntax errors or runtime errors possible. The program reads inputs using input() and map(int, ...), which should work fine for the given input format. As long as the input follows the specified format, there shouldn't be any issues.

One thing to note is that the function is defined but not called. In Python, if this is the main program, we need to ensure that the function is invoked. However, in many programming competition environments, the main function is implicitly called, or it's expected that the function is defined but not called. To be safe, I might add func() at the end to ensure it runs.

But assuming this is a script that's run directly, I should add func() at the end.

So, the complete program would be:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

if a < b < c:

print('STAIR')

elif a < b and b > c:

print('PEAK')

else:

print('NONE')

func()

This way, when the script is run, it executes func().

Overall, the logic seems correct, and it handles all the cases appropriately based on the problem description and the example provided.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the provided conditions. 

## Approach

1. **Stair Condition**: The digits a, b, c form a stair if `a < b < c`.
2. **Peak Condition**: The digits a, b, c form a peak if `a < b > c`.
3. **Neither**: If the digits do not satisfy either of the above conditions, the output should be "NONE".

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checks**:
   - Check if `a < b < c`. If true, print "STAIR".
   - Else, check if `a < b and b > c`. If true, print "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is satisfied, print "NONE".

3. **Efficiency**: 
   - The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(t), where t is the number of test cases.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and classify the sequences of digits as stairs, peaks, or neither, based on the given conditions.
