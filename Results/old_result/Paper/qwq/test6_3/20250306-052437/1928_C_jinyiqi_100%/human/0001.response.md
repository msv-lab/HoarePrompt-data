Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and settling into positions based on a parameter k, where k > 1. The settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. The pattern is that the first k positions are numbered 1 to k, and the next k-2 positions are numbered k-1 down to 2. Then this repeats.

For example, if k=3, the pattern would be: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,...

Given Vasya's position n and the number x he received, I need to find how many natural numbers k > 1 satisfy the condition that at position n, the number assigned is x.

Constraints:

- k > 1

- 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t (number of test cases) ≤ 100

First, I need to understand the settling pattern.

For a given k:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 down to 2

- Then it repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, the period is 2k - 2.

For example, if k=3:

- Positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, ...

Given n and x, I need to find all k >1 such that at position n, the number is x.

Approach:

1. Find the period for a given k: p = 2k -2

2. Find the position within the period: pos = n mod p

3. Determine what number is assigned to that position based on k.

But this seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the examples:

First test case: n=10, x=2

k=2: pattern: 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2 → at position 10: 2

k=3: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2 → position 10:2

k=5:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2 → position 10:2

k=6:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2 → position 10:2

So, k=2,3,5,6 satisfy.

Second test case: n=3, x=1

k=2:1,2,1 → position 3:1

So, only k=2 satisfies.

Third test case: n=76, x=4

k values that satisfy: 9 of them.

Fourth: n=100, x=99

No k satisfies.

Fifth: n=1e9, x=5e8

Only k=5e8 +1 satisfies.

So, I need a general approach to find all k >1 such that at position n, the number is x.

Let me try to find a formula.

First, observe that within one period (2k-2 positions):

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a given k, to find the number at position n:

Find p = 2k -2

Then, pos = n mod p

If pos ==0, pos = p

If pos <=k, number = pos

Else, number = 2k - pos

So, number = pos if pos <=k else 2k - pos

Given that, we have:

number = x

So, x = pos if pos <=k else 2k - pos

And pos = n mod p, where p=2k-2

Also, k >1

This seems a bit messy. Maybe I can solve for k in terms of n and x.

Let me consider two cases:

Case 1: pos <=k

Then, x = pos

And pos = n mod p

So, n mod p =x

But p=2k-2

So, n ≡ x mod (2k-2)

Which means 2k-2 divides n -x

So, 2k-2 divides n -x

Thus, 2k-2 is a divisor of n -x

So, 2k-2 divides n -x, and k >1

So, 2k-2 >=2 since k>1

So, k = (d +2)/2, where d divides n -x and d >=2

But k must be integer, so d +2 must be even, i.e., d must be even.

Wait, d divides n -x, and d >=2

But, k = (d +2)/2

So, d must be even for k to be integer.

So, d must be even divisor of n -x, d >=2

Similarly, in this case, pos =x <=k

So, x <=k

So, x <= (d +2)/2

So, d >= 2x -2

But d divides n -x, and d >= max(2, 2x -2)

Wait, x >=1, but x <n, n >=1

But in constraints, x <n <=1e9

So, d >=2 and d divides n -x, and d >= 2x -2

But need to make sure that d +2 is divisible by 2, i.e., d is even.

So, collect all even divisors d of n -x, where d >=2 and d >= 2x -2

Then, k = (d +2)/2

Case 2: pos >k

Then, x = 2k - pos

And pos = n mod p

So, x = 2k - (n mod p)

So, 2k = x + (n mod p)

But p=2k -2

So, 2k = x + (n mod (2k -2))

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's another way.

Looking back, perhaps I can consider that in one period of 2k -2 positions, there are certain positions that have number x.

I need to find k such that at position n, the number is x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a given k, the number at position n is determined as follows:

Find m = floor( (n-1)/(2k-2) )

Then, pos = n - m*(2k-2)

Then, if pos <=k, number = pos

Else, number = 2k - pos

Set this equal to x and solve for k.

But this seems similar to what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a given k, the number at position n is x, and find k accordingly.

Looking back at the first case, where n=10 and x=2, and k=2,3,5,6 satisfy.

Let me see for k=4:

Pattern:1,2,3,4,3,2

Positions:1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:3,6:2,7:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:3,6:2,...

So, position 10:4, which is not 2. So k=4 is invalid.

Similarly, k=7:

Pattern:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,5,4,3,2

Position 10:4, which is not 2.

So, only k=2,3,5,6 satisfy.

So, perhaps I need to find k such that either:

- n mod (2k -2) <=k and n mod (2k -2) ==x


- or n mod (2k -2) >k and 2k - (n mod (2k -2)) ==x


But this seems too involved.

Maybe instead, think in terms of d=2k -2, which is the period.

So, d=2k -2 => k=(d +2)/2

Now, d must be even, since k is integer.

So, d is even, d >=2 (since k>1)

Now, for the first case:

n mod d <= k and n mod d ==x

So, n mod d ==x and x <=k

Since k=(d +2)/2, x <= (d +2)/2

So, x <= (d +2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: 2x <= d +2

So, d >= 2x -2

Also, d must divide n -x, because n ≡x mod d

So, d divides n -x

Similarly, d must be even and d >=2

And d >= 2x -2

So, collect all even divisors d of n -x, where d >=2 and d >= 2x -2

Then, k=(d +2)/2

Similarly, for the second case:

n mod d >k and 2k - (n mod d) ==x

But 2k = d +2

So, 2k - (n mod d) = (d +2) - (n mod d) =x

So, (d +2) - (n mod d) =x

So, n mod d = d +2 -x

But n mod d < d

So, d +2 -x < d => 2 -x <0 => x >2

Wait, x >=1, n >=1, x <n

This seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the second case, n mod d = d +2 -x

But n mod d < d

So, d +2 -x < d => 2 -x <0 => x >2

But x can be 1, so maybe this case doesn't always hold.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider only the first case for now and see.

So, in the first case, d must be even, d divides n -x, d >=2, d >=2x -2

Then, k=(d +2)/2

Similarly, in the second case, d must be even, d divides n -x, d >=2, d >= something

But perhaps it's too complicated.

Looking back at the first test case: n=10, x=2

So, n -x =8

Even divisors d of 8: 2,4,8

Now, for each d:

d=2: k=(2+2)/2=2

Check if x=2 <=k=2: yes

d=4: k=(4+2)/2=3

Check if x=2 <=k=3: yes

d=8: k=(8+2)/2=5

Check if x=2 <=k=5: yes

Also, need to check the second case.

Second case: d must satisfy d >=2x -2=2*2 -2=2

So, all d >=2 are already satisfying d >=2x -2 when d >=2 and x >=1

Wait, if x=1, 2x -2=0, so d >=0, which is always true since d >=2

So, for n=10, x=2, d=2,4,8 are valid, giving k=2,3,5

But in the example, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

Wait, k=6 is also valid, but d=2*6 -2=10, and 10 divides n -x=8?

10 does not divide 8, so how is k=6 valid?

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, for k=6, d=10, and n=10, n mod d=0

Then, pos =n mod d=0, which corresponds to d

In the first case, pos <=k, which is d <=k?

Wait, d=10, k=6, d <=k? 10<=6? No.

So, it should be second case.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incomplete.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given k, the number at position n is x.

So, I can compute n mod p, where p=2k-2

If n mod p <=k, then number =n mod p

Else, number =2k - (n mod p)

Set this equal to x and solve for k.

Case 1: n mod p <=k, and n mod p =x

So, n mod p =x <=k

Case 2: n mod p >k, and 2k - (n mod p)=x

So, 2k - (n mod p)=x => 2k =x + (n mod p) => k=(x + (n mod p))/2

But n mod p can be expressed in terms of k, which is complicated.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Looking back at the first test case: n=10, x=2

k=2,3,5,6 satisfy.

For k=2: p=2*2-2=2

n mod p=10 mod 2=0, which corresponds to p, which is position p: number=k=2=x

So, it matches.

For k=3: p=4

10 mod 4=2, which is <=k=3, so number=2=x

For k=5: p=8

10 mod 8=2, which is <=k=5, so number=2=x

For k=6: p=10

10 mod 10=0, which corresponds to p: number=k=6, but x=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, k=6 was said to be valid, but according to this, it shouldn't be.

But in the example, k=6 is listed as valid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the initial pattern description, for k=6:

Positions:1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:5,8:4,9:3,10:2

So, position 10:2=x, which matches.

But according to my earlier logic, for k=6, p=10, n mod p=0, which corresponds to position p: number=k=6, which is not x=2.

But according to the pattern, position 10 is 2.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about position 0 is incorrect.

In the pattern, position p is actually position p, which is number k, but in the repeating pattern, position p is equivalent to position 0, which should be number k.

But in the example, for k=6, position 10 is 2, not 6.

So, perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps position p is mapped to number k, but in the pattern, position p is actually position 0 in the repeating sequence, which corresponds to number k.

But in the example, position 10 for k=6 is 2, not 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Let me try to generalize.

For a given k:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

- Then, positions 2k-1 and 2k are again 1,2,...

But in the example for k=6:

Positions:1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:5,8:4,9:3,10:2,...

So, position 10 is 2.

So, in this case, n=10, x=2, k=6 is valid.

But according to my earlier logic, n mod p=0, which should correspond to position p: number=k=6, which doesn't match x=2.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps when n mod p =0, it corresponds to position p: number=k

But in the example, position 10 (n mod p=0) is 2, not k=6.

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in the repeating pattern, position p is equivalent to position 0, which is mapped to number 2 in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when n mod p =0, the number is p /2 +1 or something similar.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that for position n, if n mod p =0, then number=2k - p

But in the example, p=10, k=6, 2k -p=12-10=2, which matches x=2.

So, in this case, when n mod p=0, number=2k -p

Similarly, when n mod p >k, number=2k - (n mod p)

And when n mod p <=k, number=n mod p

So, in the first case, number=n mod p =x, with n mod p <=k

In the second case, number=2k - (n mod p)=x, with n mod p >k

So, in the second case, when n mod p >k, then 2k - (n mod p)=x

So, 2k =x + (n mod p)

But p=2k -2

So, 2k =x + (n mod (2k -2))

This seems recursive and hard to solve directly.

Maybe I can express n mod p in terms of k.

Let me set p=2k -2

Then, n mod p =n - floor(n/p)*p =n - floor(n/(2k-2))*(2k-2)

But this seems too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the second case, n mod p >k

So, n mod p =n - floor(n/p)*p

Set 2k - (n mod p)=x

And p=2k -2

So, 2k - (n - floor(n/p)*(2k -2))=x

This seems too messy.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in both cases, n can be expressed in terms of k.

Let me consider that for a given k, the number at position n is x.

I need to find all k where this holds.

Looking back, perhaps it's easier to iterate over possible k and check if the number at position n is x.

But with n and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible directly.

I need a smarter approach.

Looking back at the first approach, where I considered d=2k -2 divides n -x, and d >=2x -2.

Then, k=(d +2)/2

So, I can find all even divisors d of n -x, where d >=2 and d >=2x -2, then k=(d +2)/2

Similarly, for the second case, find d such that d divides n -x, d >=2, and d >=..., and solve for k.

But I need to make sure I don't double-count.

Looking back at the first test case: n=10, x=2

n -x=8

Even divisors of 8: 2,4,8

For d=2: k=(2+2)/2=2, which is valid

d=4: k=3

d=8: k=5

But in the example, k=6 is also valid.

Wait, k=6 corresponds to d=10, but 10 does not divide 8.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both cases.

In the second case, where n mod p >k, and 2k - (n mod p)=x

So, 2k =x + (n mod p)

But p=2k -2

So, 2k =x + (n mod (2k -2))

This seems recursive.

Maybe I can set m=2k -2, then m divides n -x

Then, m +2=2k, so k=(m +2)/2

Similarly, in the second case, 2k =x + (n mod m)

But n mod m =n - floor(n/m)*m

So, 2k =x + n - floor(n/m)*m

But m=2k -2, so substitute:

2k =x + n - floor(n/(2k -2))*(2k -2)

This seems too complicated to solve directly.

Perhaps I need to consider that in the second case, 2k - (n mod m)=x

So, 2k - (n - floor(n/m)*m)=x

So, 2k -n + floor(n/m)*m =x

So, floor(n/m)=(x +n -2k)/m

But k=(m +2)/2, so substitute:

floor(n/m)=(x +n - (m +2))/m

Simplify: floor(n/m)=(x +n -m -2)/m

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that it's too difficult to handle both cases simultaneously and look for a different approach.

Looking back, perhaps I can consider that in the first case, where n mod p <=k, and n mod p =x

So, n ≡x mod p, with p=2k -2, and x <=k

So, p divides n -x, and p=2k -2, so 2k -2 divides n -x

And k >=x

Similarly, in the second case, n mod p >k, and 2k - (n mod p)=x

So, 2k =x + (n mod p)

But p=2k -2, so n mod p =2k -x

So, n ≡2k -x mod p

But p=2k -2, so n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2)

Which simplifies to n ≡2k -x mod (2k -2)

So, n -2k +x is divisible by 2k -2

But 2k -2 divides n -2k +x

But 2k -2 divides n -2k +x

So, 2k -2 divides n -2k +x

Which means 2k -2 divides n +x -2k

But this seems similar to the first case.

This is getting too tangled.

Maybe I should stick to the first approach and accept that I might miss some k.

In the first approach, I can find all k where k=(d +2)/2, with d even divisor of n -x, d >=2, d >=2x -2

Then, for the second case, perhaps find k where k=(n +x -2)/2, provided certain conditions.

But this seems error-prone.

Looking back at the first test case: n=10, x=2

n -x=8

Even divisors of 8
