Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I need to perform exactly k operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after k such operations, and then output that sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation does. When I select a contiguous subarray and insert its sum into the array, where can I insert it? The problem says "anywhere in the array," so I can choose any position to insert this new element. For example, if I have [1, 2, 3] and I choose the subarray [2, 3], whose sum is 5, I can insert 5 at the beginning, middle, or end, resulting in [5, 1, 2, 3], [1, 5, 2, 3], or [1, 2, 3, 5].

My aim is to maximize the sum of the array after k operations. Since I'm allowed to perform exactly k operations, I need to figure out the best way to use these operations to increase the total sum.

Let me think about the sum of the array. Initially, it's the sum of the given array. Each operation allows me to insert a sum of a subarray into the array, which effectively adds that sum to the total sum because I'm inserting a new element equal to the sum of some subarray.

Wait a minute, but I'm inserting a new element, which is the sum of a subarray, into the array. Does that mean the total sum increases by that subarray sum? Yes, because I'm adding a new element to the array.

So, if I perform k operations, each time inserting a sum of some subarray into the array, the total sum will increase by the sum of the subarray I choose each time.

My goal is to maximize the total sum after k operations, so I need to choose subarrays whose sums are as large as possible for each insertion.

But there's a catch: the subarrays are contiguous, and I can choose any contiguous subarray, including empty subarrays, whose sum is 0.

So, to maximize the sum, I should choose the subarray with the maximum possible sum each time and insert it into the array.

Wait, but I have to do this k times, and each time I insert a new element, which could potentially change the sums of future subarrays.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's think differently.

Suppose I have the initial array a1, a2, ..., an. After the first operation, I choose a contiguous subarray, say from l to r, with sum S, and insert S into the array at some position.

Now, the array has n+1 elements. The sum of the array is the original sum plus S.

Then, for the second operation, I can choose another contiguous subarray from the new array, which now includes the newly inserted element, and insert its sum, and so on, up to k operations.

This seems complicated because the array grows with each operation, and choosing the best subarrays each time could be messy.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that each operation allows me to add a sum of a contiguous subarray to the total sum.

I need to maximize the total sum after k operations.

An important observation is that the sum of a contiguous subarray is just the sum of consecutive elements in the array.

So, if I can choose any contiguous subarray and add its sum to the total sum, k times, how can I maximize this?

Wait, but I have to insert the sum as a new element into the array, which then affects future choices.

Hmm.

Perhaps I can think of it differently. Each operation allows me to add a certain value to the total sum, and that value is the sum of a contiguous subarray.

But since I'm inserting that sum into the array, it also becomes part of the array for future operations.

This seems recursive, but it might be too complicated to handle directly.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray in the original array.

I can compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm or similar methods.

Then, in each operation, I can choose to insert this maximum subarray sum into the array, which would add that sum to the total sum.

But is this the optimal approach?

Wait, but in each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, so potentially, I could choose different subarrays each time.

Moreover, by inserting new elements, I can create larger sums in future operations.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the sum after k operations.

Initially, the sum is S0 = sum of a.

After the first operation, I insert sum of some subarray, say S1, so the new sum is S0 + S1.

After the second operation, I insert sum of some subarray from the new array, which could include the previously inserted S1, so potentially S2 could be S1 + some other sums.

This seems to be getting complicated.

Maybe I need to find a pattern or formula that can express the maximum sum after k operations without simulating each operation.

Let me consider that each operation allows me to add a sum of a contiguous subarray to the total sum.

If I denote M as the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the array, then in each operation, I can add at least M to the sum.

But actually, I can add more than that by strategically choosing subarrays that include previously inserted sums.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as the sum growing exponentially.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have the initial sum S0.

In the first operation, I add M, so the new sum is S0 + M.

In the second operation, I can add M again, so the sum becomes S0 + M + M = S0 + 2M.

In the third operation, I can add M again, so S0 + 3M, and so on up to k operations.

So, it seems like the sum would be S0 + k*M.

But is this the maximum possible?

Wait, maybe I can do better by choosing larger subarrays that include previously inserted sums.

For example, if I insert M into the array, then in the next operation, I can choose a subarray that includes this M, so the sum would be larger than M.

Wait, for instance, if I have [1, 2, 3], sum is 6.

I choose subarray [2,3] with sum 5 and insert it, so the array becomes [1,2,3,5], sum is 11.

In the next operation, I can choose [5] with sum 5 and insert it, making the array [1,2,3,5,5], sum is 16.

Alternatively, I could choose [2,3,5] with sum 10 and insert it, making the array [1,2,3,5,10], sum is 21.

So, in this case, choosing larger subarrays that include previously inserted sums allows me to add more in each operation.

Therefore, simply adding M k times might not be the optimal strategy.

So, perhaps the sum can grow faster than linearly with k.

Let me consider the potential for exponential growth.

Suppose I have an array with a single positive number, say [a], where a > 0.

In the first operation, I can choose the entire array and insert a, making the array [a, a], sum 2a.

In the second operation, I can choose both elements and insert 2a, making the array [a, a, 2a], sum 4a.

In the third operation, I can choose the last two elements and insert 2a + 2a = 4a, making the array [a, a, 2a, 4a], sum 8a.

So, it seems like the sum is doubling each time.

Is this pattern holding?

Let's see:

- Initial sum: a

- After 1 operation: 2a

- After 2 operations: 4a

- After 3 operations: 8a

- ...

- After k operations: 2^k * a

But wait, in this example, the sum after k operations is (2^k) * a.

But in the problem, we have to perform exactly k operations, and we need to maximize the sum.

So, perhaps in general, the sum can be expressed as the initial sum plus some function of the maximum subarray sum multiplied by some factor related to k.

But in the above example with a single positive number, it seems like the sum becomes (2^k) * a.

Wait, but in that case, the maximum subarray sum is a, and each operation allows me to insert a sum that is potentially larger than a, but in this specific case, it seems to double each time.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize this.

Suppose the array has multiple elements, some positive and some negative.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum after k operations.

I think the key is to identify the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and then find a way to exponentially increase that sum through operations.

But I need to be careful because negative numbers can decrease the sum if not managed properly.

Let me consider the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the initial array.

Let me denote this as M.

Then, in each operation, I can insert M into the array, but actually, by choosing subarrays that include previously inserted M's, I can create larger sums.

In fact, in each operation, I can potentially double M, or add M again to the sum.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that in each operation, I can add M to the sum, and then the new M becomes M + M = 2M, and so on.

So, after k operations, M becomes M * (2^k).

But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the initial sum S0.

In each operation, I can add M to the sum, and also insert M into the array, which can be part of future subarrays.

So, in the next operation, I can choose a subarray that includes the previously inserted M, so the new M could be up to 2M.

Then, in the next operation, I can choose a subarray that includes the previous 2M, making it 4M, and so on.

This seems like M is doubling each time.

So, after k operations, M would be M * (2^k).

Therefore, the total sum would be S0 + M * (2^k - 1).

Wait, let's see:

- Initial sum: S0

- After 1 operation: S0 + M

- After 2 operations: S0 + M + 2M = S0 + 3M

- After 3 operations: S0 + 3M + 4M = S0 + 7M

- After 4 operations: S0 + 7M + 8M = S0 + 15M

- ...

- After k operations: S0 + (2^k - 1) * M

Yes, this seems to fit the pattern.

So, the sum after k operations is S0 + M * (2^k - 1).

Then, the answer would be (S0 + M * (2^k - 1)) modulo 10^9 + 7.

But I need to verify if this is indeed the correct formula.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=2, k=2, a=[-4, -7]

The maximum subarray sum M is max(-4, -7, -4-7) = -4.

So, according to the formula, sum = (-4 -7) + (-4) * (2^2 -1) = -11 + (-4)*3 = -11 -12 = -23.

But in the problem's note, it says the answer is 999,999,996, which is -23 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Indeed, -23 mod 1,000,000,007 is -23 + 1,000,000,007 = 999,999,984, but according to the note, it's 999,999,996.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me compute -11 + (-4)*3 = -11 -12 = -23.

-23 mod 1,000,000,007 = -23 + 1,000,000,007 = 999,999,984.

But the note says 999,999,996.

Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

In the first test case, the note says: "it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11, modulo 10^9 +7 this is 999,999,996."

Wait, so they are choosing to insert 0 in both operations, resulting in sum = -4 -7 + 0 +0 = -11.

-11 mod 1,000,000,007 is -11 + 1,000,000,007 = 999,999,996.

But according to my earlier formula, I had M = -4, and S0 = -11, and M*(2^k -1) = -4 * 3 = -12, so sum = -11 -12 = -23, which is different from the note's sum of -11.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

What's happening is that by choosing the empty subarray, which has sum 0, and inserting 0 in each operation, the sum remains -11, which is better than choosing M=-4 and getting -11 + (-12) = -23.

So, in cases where M is negative, choosing to insert 0 instead of M would be better.

Wait, but in this case, M=-4, which is worse than 0.

So, perhaps M should be max(0, maximum subarray sum).

Wait, but M is the maximum subarray sum, which could be negative if all elements are negative.

So, perhaps I need to set M to the maximum subarray sum, and if M is negative, then set it to 0, because inserting 0 is better than inserting a negative sum.

In other words, M = max(0, maximum subarray sum).

Then, the sum would be S0 + M * (2^k -1).

In the first test case, M = 0, so sum = -11 + 0*(2^2 -1) = -11, which matches the note.

In the second test case:

n=3, k=3, a=[2,2,8]

M = 12 (the entire array)

Sum = 2+2+8 + 12*(2^3 -1) = 12 + 12*7 = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches the note.

In the fourth test case:

n=5, k=1, a=[4,-2,8,-12,9]

M = 12 (subarray [4,-2,8])

Sum = (4-2+8-12+9) + 12*(2^1 -1) = 7 + 12*1 = 19, but the note says 17.

Wait, discrepancy here.

According to the note, they choose the subarray [4,-2,8] with sum 10, and insert it at the beginning, resulting in [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], sum=17.

But according to my formula, M=12, S0=7, sum=7+12*(2^1 -1)=7+12=19.

But in reality, the maximum sum is 17, which is less than what my formula suggests.

So, perhaps my formula is overestimating in some cases.

What's happening here?

In this case, the maximum subarray sum is 12 ([4,-2,8]), but when inserted, the new sum is only 17, not 19.

So, perhaps choosing to insert M=12 doesn't lead to the actual sum increasing by M*(2^k -1).

This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Let me think again.

Maybe the formula is not S0 + M*(2^k -1), but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in each operation, I can insert M, and M itself can be increased by previous insertions.

Wait, perhaps it's S0 + M * 2^{k} - M.

Wait, no, that would be S0 + M*(2^{k} -1).

Wait, but in the fourth test case, S0=7, M=12, k=1, so sum=7 + 12*(2^1 -1)=7+12=19, but the note says 17.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Maybe I need to consider that M can only be added up to k times, not multiplied by 2^k.

Wait, but in the second test case, with k=3, sum=96, which is S0=12 + 12* (2^3 -1)=12 + 84=96, which matches.

But in the fourth test case, with k=1, sum=19, but according to the note, it's 17.

So, perhaps my formula overestimates in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose different M for each operation.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, if I choose M=10 in the first operation (subarray [4,-2,8]), then insert 10, making the array [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], sum=17.

If I choose M=12 in the first operation, how is that possible?

Wait, in the fourth test case, the maximum subarray sum is indeed 10 ([4,-2,8]), not 12.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated M.

Let me compute the maximum subarray sum for [4,-2,8,-12,9].

Possible subarrays:

- [4]: 4

- [4,-2]: 2

- [4,-2,8]: 10

- [-2,8]: 6

- [8]:8

- [8,-12]: -4

- [-12]: -12

- [-12,9]: -3

- [9]:9

So, the maximum subarray sum is 10, not 12.

So, M=10.

Then, sum = S0 + M*(2^k -1) = 7 + 10*(1)=17, which matches the note.

So, earlier I mistakenly thought M=12, but actually M=10.

Therefore, my formula seems correct in this case.

Wait, but earlier I thought M=12, which was incorrect.

So, in general, M is the maximum subarray sum, which in this case is 10.

Thus, sum=7 +10*(2^1 -1)=7+10=17, which matches.

So, perhaps my formula is correct.

Let me check another test case.

The seventh test case:

n=6, k=1000, a=[-1e9, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9]

M=0, because all elements are negative.

So, sum = S0 + 0*(2^{1000}-1) = S0 +0 = S0.

S0 = -6*1e9.

But in the output, it's 42.

Wait, according to the note, the sum is -6*(1e9 +7) +42 = -6e9 -42 +42 = -6e9.

But in the output, it's 42.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute S0 modulo 1e9+7.

-6e9 mod (1e9+7) = -6e9 + 6*(1e9+7) = 42.

Yes, so sum = S0 +0 = S0 = -6e9, which modulo 1e9+7 is 42.

So, in this case, M=0, and the sum is S0, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2, k=1, a=[1e9,8]

Output:2.

Let's see:

M=1e9+8.

Sum=S0 + M*(2^1 -1)=1e9+8 +1e9+8=2e9+16.

But 2e9+16 mod 1e9+7 = 2e9+16 - 1e9+7 = e9+9, which is not 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, 2e9+16 - 2*(1e9+7)=2e9+16 -2e9 -14=2, which matches the output.

So, in this case, sum=2, which is correct according to my formula.

Therefore, it seems that the formula sum = S0 + M*(2^k -1) is correct.

Hence, the approach should be:

1. Compute the maximum subarray sum M using Kadane's algorithm or similar.

2. Compute the initial sum S0 of the array.

3. The final sum is S0 + M*(2^k -1), taken modulo 1e9+7.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

c = 0

maxi = 0

for ele in l:

if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):

maxi = max(c, maxi)

c = 0

else:

c += ele

maxi = max(c, maxi)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)



This seems to be implementing the formula sum = S0 + M*(2^k -1), where M is computed using a variation of Kadane's algorithm.

But there's a mistake in the way M is computed.

In the loop:

c = 0

maxi = 0

for ele in l:

if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):

maxi = max(c, maxi)

c = 0

else:

c += ele

maxi = max(c, maxi)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

This is similar to Kadane's algorithm but has a condition that if the element is negative and c <= abs(ele), reset c.

This is incorrect for finding the maximum subarray sum.

The standard Kadane's algorithm is:

max_current = max_global = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

max_current = max(a[i], max_current + a[i])

if max_current > max_global:

max_global = max_current

return max_global

In the given code, it's not correctly implementing Kadane's algorithm.

It should be:

c = 0

maxi = float('-inf')

for ele in l:

c = max(ele, c + ele)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

print((sum(l) + maxi * (2**k -1)) % 1000000007)

But in the given code, it's:

if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):

maxi = max(c, maxi)

c = 0

else:

c += ele

maxi = max(c, maxi)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

This is not standard Kadane's and may not correctly compute the maximum subarray sum.

In the first test case, a=[-4,-7], the maximum subarray sum should be -4, but according to this code:

c starts at 0.

First ele=-4 <0 and c=0 <= abs(-4)=4, so maxi=max(0,-4)=0, c=0.

Second ele=-7 <0 and c=0 <= abs(-7)=7, so maxi=max(0,0)=0, c=0.

So, M=0, which is correct in this case because inserting 0 is better than inserting -4.

But earlier, in the fourth test case, a=[4,-2,8,-12,9], the maximum subarray sum is 10 ([4,-2,8]), but let's see what this code computes:

c=0

ele=4 >=0, c=0+4=4, maxi=4

ele=-2 <0 and c=4 <= abs(-2)=2? 4 <=2? No, so c=4 + (-2)=2, maxi=4

ele=8 >=0, c=2+8=10, maxi=10

ele=-12 <0 and c=10 <= abs(-12)=12? 10 <=12? Yes, so maxi=max(10,10)=10, c=0

ele=9 >=0, c=0+9=9, maxi=10

Final maxi=10, which is correct.

So, in this case, it correctly computes M=10.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was incorrect, but in this case, it works.

Let me try another example: a=[1, -2, 3, -4, 5]

M should be 5 (the subarray [5]) or [3,-4,5]=4 or [1,-2,3,-4,5]=3 or others.

Wait, the maximum is 5.

According to this code:

c=0

ele=1 >=0, c=0+1=1, maxi=1

ele=-2 <0 and c=1 <= abs(-2)=2? 1<=2? Yes, maxi=max(1,1)=1, c=0

ele=3 >=0, c=0+3=3, maxi=3

ele=-4 <0 and c=3 <= abs(-4)=4? 3<=4? Yes, maxi=max(3,3)=3, c=0

ele=5 >=0, c=0+5=5, maxi=5

Final maxi=5, which is correct.

Another test case: a=[-1, -2, -3]

M=-1

According to this code:

c=0

ele=-1 <0 and c=0 <= abs(-1)=1? Yes, maxi=max(0,0)=0, c=0

ele=-2 <0 and c=0 <= abs(-2)=2? Yes, maxi=max(0,0)=0, c=0

ele=-3 <0 and c=0 <= abs(-3)=3? Yes, maxi=max(0,0)=0, c=0

Final maxi=0, which is better than -1, so it's correct in this context.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, M should be max(0, maximum subarray sum), which in this case is 0.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another test case: a=[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]

M=4 (subarray [4])

According to this code:

c=0

ele=-1 <0 and c=0 <=1? Yes, maxi=max(0,0)=0, c=0

ele=2 >=0, c=0+2=2, maxi=2

ele=-3 <0 and c=2 <=3? 2<=3? Yes, maxi=max(2,2)=2, c=0

ele=4 >=0, c=0+4=4, maxi=4

ele=-5 <0 and c=4 <=5? 4<=5? Yes, maxi=max(4,4)=4, c=0

Final maxi=4, which is correct.

So, it seems that this modified Kadane's algorithm is working correctly for these test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct in its approach.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray (which could be empty), computing its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array.

### Approach

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute the initial sum of the array.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - Use a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This sum will be used to maximize the total sum after k operations.

3. **Sum After k Operations**:
   - The optimal strategy is to add the maximum subarray sum (M) in each operation, but considering that M can be combined with previously added sums, leading to an exponential increase.
   - The formula to compute the final sum is: 
     \[
     \text{sum} = S0 + M \times (2^k - 1)
     \]
     where:
     - \( S0 \) is the initial sum of the array.
     - \( M \) is the maximum subarray sum.
   - This formula accounts for the exponential growth of the sum due to repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum in each operation.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Compute initial sum
        S0 = sum(l) % MOD
        
        # Find maximum subarray sum using a modified Kadane's algorithm
        c = 0
        maxi = 0
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        # Compute the final sum
        # sum = S0 + M * (2^k - 1)
        # Using modular exponentiation for (2^k) % MOD
        pow_2_k = pow(2, k, MOD)
        term = (maxi * (pow_2_k - 1)) % MOD
        total_sum = (S0 + term) % MOD
        print(total_sum)

# To run the function, uncomment the following line
# func()
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Sum Calculation**:
  - We calculate the sum of the array `S0` using the `sum` function and take it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
  - We use a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This modified algorithm handles negative numbers appropriately by resetting the current sum when it is not beneficial to include the current element.

- **Sum After k Operations**:
  - We use the formula \( S0 + M \times (2^k - 1) \) to compute the final sum, where \( M \) is the maximum subarray sum.
  - We use modular exponentiation (`pow(2, k, MOD)`) to compute \( 2^k \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) efficiently.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - All intermediate and final computations are taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
