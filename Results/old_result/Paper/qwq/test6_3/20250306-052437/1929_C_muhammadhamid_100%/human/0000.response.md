Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to go to the casino to earn money for a handbag. The casino has some specific rules for betting, and there's a promotion where Sasha can't lose more than a certain number of times in a row. The problem is asking whether, given these constraints, Sasha can make bets in such a way that he can guarantee that he will reach any desired amount of money, no matter how high.

First, I need to understand the betting rules. If Sasha bets y coins and wins, he gets y * k coins in return. So, his coins increase by y * (k - 1). If he loses, he loses y coins. Importantly, y has to be a positive integer and cannot exceed his current number of coins.

Also, there's this promotion that he can't lose more than x times in a row. That means after x consecutive losses, he has to win at least once.

Now, the question is whether, starting with a certain number of coins, a, Sasha can make bets in a way that, no matter what the sequence of wins and losses is (as long as it doesn't have more than x consecutive losses), he can eventually reach any target amount of coins.

This sounds like a problem about being able to grow his money indefinitely, given the constraints on betting and losing.

I need to think about how Sasha can bet to maximize his potential gains while managing the risk of losing consecutive times.

One strategy might be to bet smaller amounts when he's on a winning streak and larger amounts when he's on a losing streak, up to the limit of x consecutive losses.

Wait, but the problem says "for any integer n, Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at least n coins." So, it's not about maximizing expected value, but rather ensuring that, no matter how the wins and losses fall (as long as there are no more than x consecutive losses), he can still reach any target n.

This seems tricky. It's about having a betting strategy that is robust enough to handle any sequence of wins and losses, as long as there aren't x+1 consecutive losses.

I recall that in some gambling strategies, like the Martingale system, you double your bet after every loss to recoup previous losses when you eventually win. But here, the multiplier is k, which could be different from 2, and there's a limit on consecutive losses.

But in this problem, doubling the bet might not be the best approach, especially since k can be different from 2.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe I need to find a condition on k, x, and a such that Sasha can always increase his coins without bound.

Perhaps I should consider the worst-case scenario for Sasha, which would be losing as many times as possible without exceeding x consecutive losses.

Wait, but the problem allows any sequence without more than x consecutive losses. So, it's not just about sequences with up to x losses in a row, but any sequence that doesn't have x+1 losses in a row.

I need to think about whether Sasha can have a strategy where, even in the face of adversarial wins and losses (as long as there are no x+1 consecutive losses), he can still reach any target n.

This sounds similar to some problems in stochastic processes or gambling theory, but I need to find a way to approach it with the given constraints.

Let me consider a simple case. Suppose x=1, meaning Sasha can't lose more than once in a row. If he loses once, the next bet must be a win.

Let's say k=2 and a=1.

If he bets 1 and wins, he now has 2 coins.

If he bets 1 and loses, he has 0 coins, but that's not allowed since he can't bet negative coins. Wait, but the problem says he can't bet more than he has, and he has to bet a positive integer.

Wait, but if he loses his first bet of 1, he now has 0 coins, and he can't make any more bets because he can't bet 0 coins. So, in this case, he can't guarantee reaching any n, because if he loses once, he's stuck with 0 coins.

So, in this case, the answer should be "NO" because there's a possibility that he ends up with 0 coins if he loses the first bet.

But according to the sample input, when k=2, x=1, a=7, the answer is "YES", and when k=2, x=1, a=1, the answer is "NO". So, it depends on the initial number of coins.

So, perhaps there's a threshold for a, given k and x, such that if a is above this threshold, Sasha can guarantee reaching any n.

I need to find a way to calculate this threshold.

Let me try to model this.

Let's think recursively. Suppose Sasha has c coins currently.

He can bet y coins, where 1 ≤ y ≤ c.

If he wins, he gets y * k coins, so his new total is c - y + y * k = c + y * (k - 1).

If he loses, he loses y coins, so his new total is c - y.

But, he can't lose more than x times in a row.

So, in the sequence of bets, the losses are limited to x in a row.

I need to ensure that, no matter how the wins and losses fall (as long as there are no x+1 consecutive losses), Sasha can keep betting in such a way that he can reach any n.

This seems like a minimax kind of problem, where nature chooses the worst sequence of wins and losses (without more than x consecutive losses), and Sasha chooses his bets to maximize his coins.

But this seems too abstract. Maybe I need to think in terms of potential maximum and minimum amounts.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimum amount Sasha can have after a certain number of bets, given that he doesn't have more than x consecutive losses.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that Sasha can choose his bets in a way that, after a certain number of wins, he can grow his coins sufficiently to reach any n.

But he has to account for possible losses in between.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using some kind of recursion or dynamic programming, but that might not be efficient given the constraints.

Looking at the sample input, in the first case, k=2, x=1, a=7, answer is "YES". In the second case, k=2, x=1, a=1, answer is "NO".

From this, it seems that for k=2 and x=1, there is a minimum a required to guarantee reaching any n, which is a=7 in this case.

Wait, but in the first sample input, a=7 is "YES", and a=1 is "NO". So, perhaps for k=2 and x=1, the minimum a is 7.

But in the third test case, k=2, x=3, a=15, answer is "YES", and in the fourth, k=3, x=3, a=6, answer is "NO".

Hmm, seems like for different k and x, the required a changes.

I need to find a general formula or a way to compute, given k, x, and a, whether a is sufficient to guarantee reaching any n.

Let me try to think about the maximum possible loss Sasha can endure.

Since he can't have more than x consecutive losses, the worst sequence of losses and wins would be sequences where losses are grouped in blocks of size at most x.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum amount Sasha can lose in a sequence of bets.

But he can make an arbitrary number of bets, as long as he doesn't have x+1 consecutive losses.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

In the first sample:

k=2, x=1, a=7 → "YES"

k=2, x=1, a=1 → "NO"

k=2, x=3, a=15 → "YES"

k=3, x=3, a=6 → "NO"

k=4, x=4, a=5 → "NO"

k=5, x=4, a=7 → "YES"

k=4, x=88, a=1000000000 → "NO"

k=25, x=69, a=231 → "NO"

k=13, x=97, a=18806 → "NO"

Wait, in the first two cases, both have k=2 and x=1, but different a: 7 and 1, with "YES" and "NO" respectively. So, for k=2 and x=1, a threshold of 7 seems to apply.

In the third case, k=2 and x=3, a=15 → "YES"

Fourth case, k=3 and x=3, a=6 → "NO"

Fifth, k=4 and x=4, a=5 → "NO"

Sixth, k=5 and x=4, a=7 → "YES"

Seventh, k=4 and x=88, a=1000000000 → "NO"

Eighth, k=25 and x=69, a=231 → "NO"

Ninth, k=13 and x=97, a=18806 → "NO"

Hmm, seems like for different k and x, the required a varies.

I need to find a general condition.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose Sasha has c coins.

He can bet y coins, where 1 ≤ y ≤ c.

If he wins, his new amount is c + y*(k-1).

If he loses, his new amount is c - y.

But he can't have more than x consecutive losses.

So, in the worst case, he can have up to x consecutive losses.

After x losses, he must have at least one win.

So, perhaps I can model the minimal amount he can have after a sequence of x losses and one win.

Wait, but the problem is not about minimal amount, but about being able to reach any n.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of being able to increase his coins without bound.

If he can keep increasing his coins indefinitely, then he can reach any n.

But how?

Let me consider that with each win, his coins increase by y*(k-1), and with each loss, they decrease by y.

So, if he can choose y in a way that the potential increase outweighs the possible losses, he might be able to grow his coins indefinitely.

But he has to manage his bets so that he doesn't run out of coins during a sequence of losses.

This sounds like he needs to manage his bankroll to withstand up to x consecutive losses.

So, perhaps the minimal a required is such that after x consecutive losses, he still has enough coins to continue betting.

But in reality, it's more nuanced because he can adjust his bets based on the sequence of wins and losses.

Wait, but the problem says "for any outcome that does not contradict the rules described above", meaning that any sequence of wins and losses is possible, as long as there are no x+1 consecutive losses.

So, Sasha needs a strategy where, no matter what sequence of wins and losses occurs (as long as it doesn't have x+1 consecutive losses), he can keep betting and eventually reach any n.

This seems similar to having a strategy that can handle any sequence of wins and losses with losses not exceeding x in a row.

I need to find a condition that ensures that, with some betting strategy, Sasha can always increase his coins sufficiently to reach any n.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible loss Sasha might face.

If he can have enough initial coins to withstand up to x consecutive losses, then he can continue betting.

But that might not be sufficient to guarantee reaching any n.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal amount he can have after any sequence of wins and losses, given the constraints.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose Sasha has a certain amount of coins, and he wants to ensure that, no matter what sequence of wins and losses occurs (without x+1 consecutive losses), he can keep betting in a way that his coins can grow without bound.

One possible approach is to use a strategy where he bets a fraction of his current coins, adjusted based on the number of consecutive losses.

But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical condition that relates k, x, and a.

Looking at the sample inputs, for k=2 and x=1, a=7 is sufficient, but a=1 is not.

Similarly, for k=2 and x=3, a=15 is sufficient.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me try to compute what a should be in terms of k and x.

Suppose that Sasha can have up to x consecutive losses.

After x losses, he must have at least one win.

So, in the worst case, he suffers x losses in a row, and then has a win.

I need to compute the minimal a such that, after any sequence of up to x losses followed by a win, he can continue betting in a way that allows him to reach any n.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal a such that, after x losses and one win, his coins are still greater than or equal to a.

This would allow him to repeat the process indefinitely, thereby growing his coins without bound.

Let me formalize this.

Let s be the minimal a required.

Then, after x losses and one win, his coins should be at least s again.

Let's try to model this.

Suppose he starts with s coins.

He suffers x losses in a row, each time losing y coins.

After x losses, he has s - x*y coins.

Then, he has a win, where he bets y coins and wins y*k coins.

So, his new amount is (s - x*y) - y + y*k = s - x*y - y + y*k = s - y(x + 1 - k)

This should be >= s.

Wait, but that would imply s - y(x + 1 - k) >= s, which simplifies to -y(x + 1 - k) >= 0.

Since y is positive, this implies that x + 1 - k <= 0, or k >= x + 1.

But this doesn't make sense for all k and x.

Wait, perhaps I'm modeling this incorrectly.

Let me think again.

Suppose he starts with s coins.

He bets y1 coins and loses, so he has s - y1 coins.

Then he bets y2 coins and loses again, so he has s - y1 - y2 coins.

This continues up to x losses.

After x losses, he has s - y1 - y2 - ... - yx coins.

Then, he bets y(x+1) coins and wins, so he gets y(x+1)*k coins.

His new amount is (s - y1 - y2 - ... - yx - y(x+1)) + y(x+1)*k = s - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + y(x+1)*(k - 1)

This should be >= s.

So, s - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + y(x+1)*(k - 1) >= s

Simplifying, - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + y(x+1)*(k - 1) >= 0

This needs to hold for some choice of y1, y2, ..., y(x+1), where each y_i <= current coins.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that after x losses and one win, Sasha should have at least as many coins as he started with.

This would ensure that he can repeat this cycle indefinitely, growing his coins without bound.

So, s - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + y(x+1)*(k - 1) >= s

Which simplifies to y(x+1)*(k - 1) >= y1 + y2 + ... + yx

To maximize the left side and minimize the right side, but y(x+1) can be chosen based on the previous losses.

This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps I need to find a strategy where y_i is chosen in a specific way.

Let me consider a strategy where y_i is a fixed fraction of the current coins.

But that might not work well with the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe y_i is based on the number of consecutive losses so far.

Wait, perhaps I can set y_i to be the minimal possible bet, which is 1 coin, for each bet.

Then, after x losses, he has s - x coins.

Then, he wins and gets y*(k - 1) coins, so his new amount is s - x + 1*(k - 1) = s - x + k - 1

For this to be >= s, we need s - x + k - 1 >= s, which simplifies to k - 1 >= x, or k >= x + 1.

But this condition, k >= x + 1, isn't always true in the sample inputs.

For example, in the first sample, k=2 and x=1, which satisfies 2 >= 1 + 1, i.e., 2 >= 2, which holds.

In the third sample, k=2 and x=3, which would require 2 >= 4, which doesn't hold, but the answer is "YES". So, this condition isn't sufficient.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust this approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Sasha bets y coins each time, and y is fixed.

Then, after x losses, he has a - x*y coins.

Then, he wins and has a - x*y + y*(k - 1) = a - y(x - (k - 1)) coins.

For this to be >= a, we need - y(x - (k - 1)) >= 0, which implies x - (k - 1) <= 0, or k - 1 >= x.

Again, this is k >= x + 1.

But in the third sample, k=2, x=3, which is 2 >= 4, which is false, but the answer is "YES", which contradicts this condition.

So, this condition isn't sufficient.

Perhaps the strategy isn't to bet a fixed amount each time.

Maybe Sasha should adjust his bets based on previous outcomes.

For example, after a win, he bets more, or after a loss, he bets less.

This seems more flexible.

But it's getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some betting strategies, the key is to ensure that the potential gains outweigh the potential losses.

In this case, since losses are limited to x in a row, perhaps Sasha needs to have enough initial coins to withstand x losses, and then have a gain that allows him to not only recover but also make progress.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose Sasha bets y coins.

If he wins, he gains y*(k - 1).

If he loses, he loses y coins.

The worst sequence is x losses followed by one win.

So, after x losses, he has a - x*y coins.

Then, he wins and has a - x*y + y*(k - 1) = a - y*x + y*(k - 1) = a + y*(k - 1 - x)

For this to be >= a, we need y*(k - 1 - x) >= 0.

Since y is positive, this requires k - 1 - x >= 0, or k >= x + 1.

But as seen in the sample inputs, this isn't always the case when the answer is "YES".

So, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.

Wait, maybe I need to consider multiple cycles of losses and wins.

Suppose Sasha plans to have a sequence of x losses and one win repeatedly.

Then, after each cycle, his coins should be at least as much as before, plus some increment.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote the initial amount as s.

After x losses and one win, his amount is s + s*(some factor).

Wait, perhaps I need to find s such that after one cycle of x losses and one win, his amount is at least s + delta, where delta is positive.

But I need to ensure that he can repeat this indefinitely, growing his coins without bound.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal s required so that after any sequence of up to x losses and one win, his coins are sufficiently large to continue.

This seems too abstract.

Let me try to look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

In the first sample, k=2, x=1, a=7 → "YES"

k=2, x=1, a=1 → "NO"

So, for k=2 and x=1, a needs to be at least 7.

In the third sample, k=2, x=3, a=15 → "YES"

So, for k=2 and x=3, a needs to be at least 15.

Similarly, in the sixth sample, k=5, x=4, a=7 → "YES"

Wait, but according to the pattern from the first sample, for k=2 and x=1, a=7 works, and for k=2 and x=3, a=15 works.

Is there a formula that relates a to k and x?

Let me try to see.

For k=2 and x=1, a=7 works.

For k=2 and x=3, a=15 works.

Is there a formula like a >= some function of k and x?

Let me see.

In the first case, k=2, x=1, a=7.

What is 2^(x+1) - 1 = 2^(2) - 1 = 3, which is less than 7.

Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps a needs to be at least sum of a geometric series.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose Sasha wants to ensure that after any sequence of up to x losses, he can still make a bet that allows him to recover and grow.

So, after x losses, his coins should still be positive, and he should be able to make a bet that, when he wins, allows him to make progress.

But this is still too vague.

Let me try to look for a mathematical formula.

I found that in the first sample, a=7 for k=2 and x=1.

In the third sample, a=15 for k=2 and x=3.

Let me see what 2^(x+1) -1 is.

For x=1, 2^(2) -1 = 3, which is less than 7.

For x=3, 2^(4) -1 = 15, which matches the third sample.

Wait, but in the first sample, a=7 is "YES", but 2^(2) -1 =3 is less than 7.

Hmm, perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps a needs to be greater than or equal to some value based on k and x.

Let me consider that after x losses, he has a - sum of y_i for i=1 to x.

Then, he wins and gets y_(x+1)*k coins.

So, his new amount is a - sum(y_i for i=1 to x) + y_(x+1)*(k -1)

This needs to be >= a.

But this seems similar to what I did before.

Maybe I need to consider that y_i is chosen optimally.

Suppose y_i is always 1.

Then, after x losses, he has a - x.

Then, he wins and has a - x + 1*(k -1) = a - x + k -1.

For this to be >= a, we need -x + k -1 >=0, or k >= x +1.

But in the third sample, k=2 and x=3, which would require 2 >=4, which is false, but the answer is "YES", so this can't be the condition.

Wait, perhaps y_i is not always 1.

Maybe y_i increases based on previous outcomes.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose that to withstand x losses, Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the losses plus the bet required for the next win.

Wait, perhaps I can model this recursively.

Let me define s(x) as the minimal a required for given k and x.

Then, s(x) = 1 + s(x-1)

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps s(x) = 1 + s(x-1)/ (k -1)

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose x=0, meaning no losses allowed.

Then, Sasha can only win every bet.

In this case, he can choose y to be any amount, and his coins increase by y*(k-1) each time.

So, he can grow his coins indefinitely, as long as a >=1.

Wait, but in this problem, x is at least 1.

So, x=1 means he can lose at most once in a row.

Wait, perhaps s(x) = sum from i=0 to x of k^i.

But let's check.

For k=2 and x=1, sum from i=0 to 1 of 2^i = 1 + 2 = 3, but in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which is greater than 3.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Let me consider that after x losses, he needs to have enough to make a bet that, when he wins, brings him back to at least s(x).

So, s(x) = s(x-1) + s(x-1)/ (k-1)

Wait, perhaps s(x) = s(x-1) + ceil(s(x-1)/(k-1))

But this seems recursive.

Let me try to compute s(x) recursively.

Let's set s(0) =1.

Then, s(1) = s(0) + ceil(s(0)/(k-1)) = 1 + ceil(1/(k-1)) = 1 +1 =2, for k=2.

But in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which is more than 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate x times.

Let me try s=1, then for each of x iterations, s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)).

For k=2 and x=1:

s=1

s = 1 + ceil(1/(2-1)) =1 +1=2

But a=7 is "YES", which is more than 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate x times.

Wait, maybe s=1, then for x times, s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)).

Let me try for k=2, x=1:

s=1

s =1 + ceil(1/1)=1+1=2

But a=7 is "YES", which is more than 2.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate x times.

Wait, perhaps it's s=1, then for x times, s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)).

For k=2, x=1:

s=1

s=1 + ceil(1/1)=2

For x=2:

s=2 + ceil(2/1)=4

For x=3:

s=4 + ceil(4/1)=8

But in the third sample, k=2, x=3, a=15 is "YES", but according to this, s=8, which is less than 15.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, maybe s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)) +1.

Let me try for k=2, x=1:

s=1

s=1 + ceil(1/1) +1=1+1+1=3

For x=2:

s=3 + ceil(3/1) +1=3+3+1=7

For x=3:

s=7 + ceil(7/1) +1=7+7+1=15

This matches the sample inputs.

In the first sample, k=2, x=1, s=3, but a=7 is "YES", which is greater than or equal to s.

Wait, but according to this, for x=1, s=3, but in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which is greater than s.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate x times, starting from s=1, and at each step, s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)) +1.

For k=2, x=1:

s=1

s=1 + ceil(1/1) +1=1+1+1=3

For x=2:

s=3 + ceil(3/1) +1=3+3+1=7

For x=3:

s=7 + ceil(7/1) +1=7+7+1=15

This matches the third sample where k=2, x=3, a=15 is "YES".

Similarly, for k=2, x=1, a=7 is "YES", and s=3, which is less than 7.

Wait, but according to this, s should be 3 for x=1 and k=2, but in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which is greater than s.

Wait, perhaps I have it backwards.

Wait, perhaps a needs to be greater than or equal to s after x iterations.

But in the first sample, for x=1, s=3, but a=7 is "YES", which is greater than s.

Wait, maybe I need to set s=1, then iterate x times: s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)).

For k=2, x=1:

s=1

s=1 + ceil(1/1)=2

For x=2:

s=2 + ceil(2/1)=4

For x=3:

s=4 + ceil(4/1)=8

But in the third sample, a=15 is "YES", which is more than 8.

Wait, perhaps it's s=1, then for x times, s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)) +1.

For k=2, x=1:

s=1

s=1 +1 +1=3

For x=2:

s=3 + ceil(3/1) +1=3+3+1=7

For x=3:

s=7 + ceil(7/1) +1=7+7+1=15

This matches the sample where for x=3, a=15 is "YES".

Similarly, for x=1, s=3, but in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which is greater than s=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to set s=1, then iterate x times: s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)) +1, and then check if a >= s.

In the first sample, s=1 -> s=1+1+1=3, but a=7 >=3, which is "YES".

But in the second sample, k=2, x=1, a=1 <3, so "NO".

This seems consistent.

Similarly, for k=2, x=3, s=15, a=15 is "YES".

Now, let's check another sample.

Fourth sample: k=3, x=3, a=6 → "NO"

Let's compute s for k=3, x=3.

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + ceil(1/2) +1=1+1+1=3

Iteration 2: s=3 + ceil(3/2) +1=3+2+1=6

Iteration 3: s=6 + ceil(6/2) +1=6+3+1=10

So, s=10, but a=6 <10, so "NO", which matches the sample.

Wait, but in the sample, it's "NO", and a=6 <10.

Wait, but according to this, s=10, but in the iteration above, for x=3, k=3, s=10, but a=6 <10, so "NO".

Similarly, in the third sample, k=2, x=3, s=15, a=15 >=15, so "YES".

This seems consistent.

Another sample: k=5, x=4, a=7 → "YES"

Compute s for k=5, x=4.

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + ceil(1/4) +1=1+1+1=3

Iteration 2: s=3 + ceil(3/4) +1=3+1+1=5

Iteration 3: s=5 + ceil(5/4) +1=5+2+1=8

Iteration 4: s=8 + ceil(8/4) +1=8+2+1=11

So, s=11, but a=7 <11, which should be "NO", but the sample says "YES".

Wait, but according to this, a=7 <11, so "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

This contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Let me check the sample again.

Wait, in the sixth sample, k=5, x=4, a=7 → "YES"

But according to my calculation, s=11, which is greater than 7, but the answer is "YES".

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is a >= s after x iterations.

But in this case, a=7 <11, but the answer is "YES".

Wait, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose s(x) = s(x-1) + ceil(s(x-1)/(k-1))

For k=5, x=4:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + ceil(1/4)=1+1=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + ceil(2/4)=2+1=3

Iteration 3: s=3 + ceil(3/4)=3+1=4

Iteration 4: s=4 + ceil(4/4)=4+1=5

So, s=5, but a=7 >=5, which would be "YES".

But in the sample, a=7 is "YES", which matches.

Wait, but earlier, for k=3, x=3:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + ceil(1/2)=1+1=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + ceil(2/2)=2+1=3

Iteration 3: s=3 + ceil(3/2)=3+2=5

So, s=5, but in the fourth sample, a=6 >=5, which should be "YES", but the sample output is "NO".

Wait, this contradicts.

So, perhaps the formula is not s = s + ceil(s/(k-1)), but something else.

Alternatively, maybe s = s + floor(s/(k-1)) +1.

Let me try for k=5, x=4:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + floor(1/4) +1=1+0+1=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + floor(2/4) +1=2+0+1=3

Iteration 3: s=3 + floor(3/4) +1=3+0+1=4

Iteration 4: s=4 + floor(4/4) +1=4+1+1=6

So, s=6, and a=7 >=6, which is "YES", matching the sample.

For k=3, x=3:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + floor(1/2) +1=1+0+1=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + floor(2/2) +1=2+1+1=4

Iteration 3: s=4 + floor(4/2) +1=4+2+1=7

So, s=7, but in the fourth sample, a=6 <7, which should be "NO", matching the sample.

This seems consistent.

Similarly, for k=2, x=3:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + floor(1/1) +1=1+1+1=3

Iteration 2: s=3 + floor(3/1) +1=3+3+1=7

Iteration 3: s=7 + floor(7/1) +1=7+7+1=15

Which matches the third sample.

And for k=2, x=1:

s=1

Iteration 1: s=1 + floor(1/1) +1=1+1+1=3

Which matches the first sample.

So, perhaps the condition is a >= s after x iterations, where s is updated as s = s + floor(s/(k-1)) +1.

This seems to align with the sample inputs.

Therefore, the strategy is to compute s starting from 1, and for x iterations, update s = s + floor(s/(k-1)) +1, and check if a >= s.

If it is, then "YES", else "NO".

This seems to be a correct approach based on the sample inputs.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
