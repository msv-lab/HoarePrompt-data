Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k, and I need to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English letters appear as subsequences in s. And I have to make sure that s is as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities, any of them is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence because you can delete "b" and "d" to get it.

Okay, so for each test case, I have values of n and k. Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

1 2

2 1

2 2

2 3

Output:

ab

aa

baab

abcbac

Looking at the first test case:

n=1, k=2

Possible strings of length 1 using 'a' and 'b': "a" and "b"

The output is "ab". Both "a" and "b" are subsequences of "ab", which is correct.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Only one possible string: "aa"

Output is "aa". "aa" is a subsequence of itself.

Third test case:

n=2, k=2

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Output is "baab"

Let's check:

- "aa": "baab" has "aa" as a subsequence.

- "ab": "baab" has "baab" which contains "ab".

- "ba": "baab" has "ba".

- "bb": "baab" has "bb".

Fourth test case:

n=2, k=3

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

Output is "abcbac"

Let's verify a few:

- "aa": "a" from index 0 and "a" from index 3.

- "ab": "a" from index 0 and "b" from index 1.

- "ac": "a" from index 0 and "c" from index 4.

- "ba": "b" from index 1 and "a" from index 3.

- "bb": "b" from index 1 and "b" from index 4.

- "bc": "b" from index 1 and "c" from index 4.

- "ca": "c" from index 4 and "a" from index 5.

- "cb": "c" from index 4 and "b" from index 2.

- "cc": "c" from index 4 and "c" from index 5.

All of these are present as subsequences in "abcbac".

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)

So, what this code is doing is:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it reads n and k.

- It takes the first k letters of the alphabet.

- It repeats this string n times.

For example, for n=2, k=2:

'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

But in the sample input, for n=2, k=2, the output is 'baab', not 'abab'.

Wait, is 'abab' also correct? Let's check:

Possible strings:

"aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

- "aa": is "a" from index 0 and "a" from index 2.

- "ab": "a" from index 0 and "b" from index 1.

- "ba": "b" from index 1 and "a" from index 2.

- "bb": "b" from index 1 and "b" from index 3.

So, 'abab' would also be correct. But the sample output is 'baab'. Both seem to work.

Similarly, for n=2, k=3:

'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

But the sample output is 'abcbac'.

Both should work, but perhaps 'abcbac' is shorter or meets some other criteria.

Wait, 'abcabc' has length 6, and 'abcbac' also has length 6. So, they are the same length in this case.

But in other cases, maybe one is shorter than the other.

Wait, the problem says: "print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them."

So, I need to make sure that the program produces a string that is as short as possible.

Looking back at the program, it simply repeats the first k letters n times.

Is this always the shortest possible?

Let's consider n=1, k=2.

Output should be 'ab', which is length 2, and that's the shortest possible because there are 2 distinct characters needed.

For n=2, k=2:

'abab' has length 4, but 'baab' also has length 4.

Is there a shorter string that contains all possible combinations of length 2 from 'a' and 'b'?

Let's see: possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

Can we make a string shorter than length 4 that contains all these as subsequences?

Let's try 'aabb':

- "aa": a and a from indices 0 and 1.

- "ab": a from index 0 and b from index 2.

- "ba": a from index 1 and b from index 2.

- "bb": b from index 2 and b from index 3.

So, 'aabb' also works and has length 4, same as 'abab' or 'baab'.

Is there a string of length 3 that can contain all these subsequences?

Let's try 'abba':

- "aa": a from index 0 and a from index 3.

- "ab": a from index 0 and b from index 1.

- "ba": b from index 1 and a from index 3.

- "bb": b from index 1 and b from index 2.

So, 'abba' also works and has length 4.

What about 'abb':

- "aa": no two 'a's in 'abb'.

So, that's invalid.

'abab' seems necessary.

So, in this case, length 4 is the shortest possible.

Now, for n=2, k=3:

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

Sample output is 'abcbac', which has length 6.

Does 'abc' repeated twice, 'abcabc', also work?

- "aa": a from index 0 and a from index 3.

- "ab": a from index 0 and b from index 1.

- "ac": a from index 0 and c from index 2.

- "ba": b from index 1 and a from index 3.

- "bb": b from index 1 and b from index 4.

- "bc": b from index 1 and c from index 5.

- "ca": c from index 2 and a from index 3.

- "cb": c from index 2 and b from index 4.

- "cc": c from index 2 and c from index 5.

So, 'abcabc' works, and has length 6, same as 'abcbac'.

Is there a shorter string for this case?

Let's see if we can make a string of length 5 that contains all these subsequences.

Try 'abcbc':

- "aa": no two 'a's.

So, invalid.

'abcac':

- "aa": a from index 0 and a from index 4.

- "ab": a from index 0 and b from index 1.

- "ac": a from index 0 and c from index 2.

- "ba": b from index 1 and a from index 3.

- "bb": no two 'b's.

So, invalid.

Seems like length 6 is the shortest possible in this case.

Now, the program outputs 'abc' repeated n times, which for n=2, k=3 would be 'abcabc'.

But the sample output is 'abcbac', which is also length 6.

Both are acceptable.

Now, is the program correct?

Well, in the sense that it produces a string that contains all required subsequences and is of the shortest possible length, it seems correct for these cases.

But let's check for another case.

Consider n=3, k=2.

Possible strings: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"

What would the program output?

'ab' * 3 = 'ababab'

Is this the shortest possible?

Let's see.

Can we make a shorter string that contains all these subsequences?

It's getting complicated; perhaps length 6 is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to overlap them more efficiently.

This seems like it's related to de Bruijn sequences, but for subsequences instead of substrings.

A de Bruijn sequence of order n on a k-letter alphabet is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length n in the alphabet appears exactly once.

But here, we need subsequences, not substrings.

So, it's a bit different.

I recall that for subsequences, the minimal length of a string containing all possible subsequences of length n from a k-letter alphabet is known, but I'm not sure off the top of my head.

Wait, perhaps it's related to superpermutations, but for subsequences.

In any case, the program simply repeats the first k letters n times.

In the sample inputs, this seems to work, but is it always the minimal?

Let me consider n=2, k=1.

Output should be 'aa', which is minimal.

n=2, k=2: 'abab' or 'baab', both length 4, which seems minimal.

n=2, k=3: 'abcabc' or 'abcbac', both length 6, which seems minimal.

Another test case: n=3, k=2.

Program would output 'ababab'.

Is there a shorter string that contains all possible subsequences of length 3 from 'a' and 'b'?

Possible subsequences:

"aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"

Does 'ababab' contain all of these?

- "aaa": a from indices 0, 2, 4.

- "aab": a from indices 0, 2, b from index 1.

- "aba": a from index 0, b from index 1, a from index 2.

- "abb": a from index 0, b from indices 1 and 3.

- "baa": b from index 1, a from indices 2 and 4.

- "bab": b from index 1, a from index 2, b from index 3.

- "bba": b from indices 1 and 3, a from index 4.

- "bbb": b from indices 1, 3, and 5.

So, 'ababab' works.

Is there a shorter string that contains all these subsequences?

Let's try 'ababa':

- "aaa": a from indices 0, 2, 4.

- "aab": a from indices 0, 2, b from index 1.

- "aba": a from index 0, b from index 1, a from index 2.

- "abb": a from index 0, b from indices 1 and 3.

- "baa": b from index 1, a from indices 2 and 4.

- "bab": b from index 1, a from index 2, b from index 3.

- "bba": b from indices 1 and 3, a from index 4.

- "bbb": b from indices 1, 3, and 5. Wait, index 5 is beyond 'ababa'. So, "bbb" is not present.

So, 'ababa' is invalid for n=3, k=2.

What about 'ababb':

- "aaa": no three 'a's.

- "aab": a from indices 0, 2, b from index 1.

- "aba": a from index 0, b from index 1, a from index 2.

- "abb": a from index 0, b from indices 1 and 3.

- "baa": b from index 1, a from indices 2 and 4.

- "bab": b from index 1, a from index 2, b from index 3.

- "bba": b from indices 1 and 3, a from index 4.

- "bbb": b from indices 1, 3, and 5. Index 5 is beyond 'ababb', so "bbb" is missing.

So, 'ababb' is also invalid.

What about 'ababab':

This works, as previously established.

Is there a string of length 5 that works? From above, 'ababa' and 'ababb' don't cover all subsequences.

So, perhaps length 6 is minimal.

Hence, 'ababab' is acceptable.

Now, the program outputs 'ababab' for n=3, k=2, which seems correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=1.

Output should be 'a'.

Program would output 'a' * 1 = 'a', which is correct.

n=1, k=3:

Output should be 'abc'.

Program outputs 'abc' * 1 = 'abc', which is correct.

n=3, k=1:

Output should be 'aaa'.

Program outputs 'a' * 3 = 'aaa', which is correct.

n=2, k=3:

Program outputs 'abcabc', which, as per the sample, 'abcbac' is also acceptable.

Both are length 6, which seems minimal.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to produce a correct string of minimal length.

Is there any case where repeating 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n is not minimal?

Let me think about n=2, k=26.

Program would output 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated twice.

Is there a shorter string that contains all possible two-letter combinations from the first 26 letters?

Well, in this case, 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is one possibility.

But perhaps there is a way to overlap some letters to make it shorter.

For example, 'xyzxy' contains "xy", "xz", "yz" etc.

But with n=2 and k=26, it's probably minimal to have 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated twice, which is length 52.

Is there a way to make it shorter? Maybe, but probably not significantly.

So, for practical purposes, repeating it n times is acceptable and correct.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. The goal is to create `s` with the smallest possible length.

## Approach
1. **Understanding Subsequences**: A subsequence can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
2. **Generate the String `s`**: To ensure that all combinations of the first `k` letters of the alphabet of length `n` are covered as subsequences, we repeat the string composed of the first `k` letters `n` times. This approach guarantees that all possible combinations are included in `s`.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        alphabet_slice = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
        result = alphabet_slice * n
        print(result)

# To run the function for the test cases
func()
```

## Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, we read the values of `n` and `k`.
2. **Generating the Required String**:
    - We take the first `k` letters of the alphabet.
    - We repeat this slice `n` times to form the result string `s`.
3. **Output the Result**: For each test case, we print the generated string `s`.

This approach ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are included in `s`, and it does so with a straightforward and efficient method.

**Correctness: True**
