Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array of integers, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. The score is defined as the MEX of the array that Alice constructs.

First, let's understand what MEX is. MEX stands for Minimum EXcludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3, and the MEX of [1, 2, 3] is 0.

Now, the game is played in turns, with Alice starting first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from the array a, appends it to her array c, and deletes it from a. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from a, and deletes it from a. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c.

Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

Given that, I need to find out what the final score will be.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be trying to compute the MEX based on the frequency of each number in the array. It's using a Counter to count the occurrences of each number and then iterating through the numbers from 0 to n-1 to find the MEX.

But I need to verify if this approach correctly considers the game's dynamics.

Let me think about how the game progresses.

Since Alice and Bob are alternately removing elements from a, and Alice has the power to choose what goes into c, her strategy should focus on including elements that help maximize the MEX of c.

However, Bob is trying to minimize the MEX of c by influencing which elements are removed from a.

Wait, but Bob doesn't directly control what goes into c; he only deletes elements from a on his turn.

So, Alice can choose which elements to include in c, and Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose from by deleting elements on his turn.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

A possible game is:

1. Alice chooses 1, so c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

2. Bob chooses 0, a = [0, 1]

3. Alice chooses 0, c = [1, 0], a = [1]

4. Bob chooses 1, a is empty

Final c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

Another possible game:

1. Alice chooses 0, c = [0], a = [0, 1, 1]

2. Bob chooses 1, a = [0, 1]

3. Alice chooses 1, c = [0, 1], a = [0]

4. Bob chooses 0, a is empty

Final c = [0, 1], MEX is 2.

Seems like regardless of their choices, MEX is 2.

But is this always the case?

Wait, in this scenario, all numbers are less than 2, and there are enough duplicates to allow Alice to collect both 0 and 1.

But what if there were only one 0 or one 1?

Let's consider another example.

n = 3

a = [0, 1, 1]

Possible game:

1. Alice chooses 1, c = [1], a = [0, 1]

2. Bob chooses 0, a = [1]

3. Alice chooses 1, c = [1, 1], a = empty

MEX of c is 0.

But another possible game:

1. Alice chooses 0, c = [0], a = [1, 1]

2. Bob chooses 1, a = [1]

3. Alice chooses 1, c = [0, 1], a = empty

MEX is 2.

So in this case, depending on the choices, MEX can be 0 or 2.

Since Alice wants to maximize and Bob wants to minimize, I need to find the outcome when both play optimally.

In this case, Alice can ensure MEX 2 by choosing 0 in her first turn.

But how?

Wait, in the first scenario, if Alice chooses 1 first, then Bob can choose 0, leaving Alice with only 1, resulting in c = [1,1], MEX = 0.

But if Alice chooses 0 first, then Bob chooses 1, and Alice chooses 1, resulting in c = [0,1], MEX = 2.

So Alice's choice of picking 0 first leads to a higher MEX.

Therefore, Alice should prioritize picking numbers that allow her to have a complete set in c.

Wait, but in the first example, picking 1 first still led to MEX 2.

So perhaps the key is to ensure that Alice can collect all the necessary numbers to maximize MEX.

But this seems vague.

Let me think differently.

The MEX of c is the smallest non-negative integer not in c.

Alice wants to maximize this, meaning she wants c to contain as many small integers as possible.

Bob, however, wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from having small integers in c.

So, Alice should try to include as many small integers in c as possible, while Bob tries to prevent that.

Given that Alice can choose which elements to include in c, and Bob can only delete elements from a, Alice has more control over what goes into c.

But Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose from.

Wait, but Bob can choose any element to delete on his turn, which might be strategic.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in a.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice can potentially include some of those in c, even if Bob deletes some.

If a number appears only once, Alice must include it in c on her turn or lose the opportunity forever.

Because if Bob picks it, it's removed from a and doesn't go into c.

So, for numbers that appear only once, Alice should prioritize including them in c.

Because if she doesn't, and Bob picks them, they're lost, and she can't include them in c.

Wait, but Bob can pick any element, including those that appear multiple times.

So, Bob might choose to pick the unique elements to prevent Alice from including them in c.

Wait, but in the first example, there are no unique elements, and the MEX is 2.

In the second example, with a = [0,1,1], if Alice picks 0, she ensures that 0 is in c, and then regardless of Bob's choice, she can pick 1, resulting in c = [0,1], MEX = 2.

But if she picks 1 first, Bob can pick 0, and then Alice is left with only 1, resulting in c = [1,1], MEX = 0.

So, in this case, Alice's choice matters.

Therefore, Alice should prioritize picking the unique elements first to ensure they are included in c.

Wait, but in the first example, all elements have duplicates, so it doesn't matter.

In the second example, there are duplicates for 1 but 0 appears only once.

So, Alice should pick 0 first to ensure it's in c.

Similarly, in the third example from the problem:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

Possible game:

1. Alice chooses 1, c = [1], a = [1]

2. Bob chooses 1, a is empty

Final c = [1], MEX = 0

Another possible game:

1. Alice chooses 1, c = [1], a = [1]

2. Bob chooses 1, a is empty

Final c = [1], MEX = 0

So, MEX is 0 because 0 is not in c.

Bob can prevent Alice from including 0 in c by ensuring that 0 is deleted.

Wait, but in this case, there is no 0 in a to begin with.

So, c can only have 1, and MEX is 0.

Hence, the output is 0.

Okay, so in this case, since 0 is not present in a, regardless of the game, c won't have 0, so MEX is 0.

So, the MEX is determined by the smallest number from 0 to n that is not present in c.

Alice wants to include as many small numbers in c as possible, while Bob tries to prevent that.

Given that, perhaps the way to approach this is to look at the frequency of each number.

If a number appears an even number of times, Bob can pair the deletions such that Alice can include one of them in c.

If a number appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that at least one of them is included in c.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have counts of each number from 0 to n-1.

For each number i from 0 to n-1:

- If count[i] is 0, then i is not in a, so MEX is i.

- If count[i] is positive, we need to see if Alice can include i in c.

Alice can include i in c if she picks it before all instances are deleted by Bob.

Given that Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting, and Alice can choose which element to append to c.

Wait, but Bob can delete any element on his turn.

So, Bob can choose to delete elements that Alice hasn't included yet.

This seems complex.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can include them in c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that Alice can include at least ceil(count[i]/2) instances of i in c.

Because for each pair of i, Alice and Bob can each take one.

If count[i] is odd, Alice can include one more.

But is that accurate?

Let's consider:

- If count[i] = 1, Alice can include it in c.

- If count[i] = 2, Alice can include 1 in c, Bob deletes one.

- If count[i] = 3, Alice can include 2 in c, etc.

Wait, but this might not be correct.

Let me think with an example.

n = 3

a = [0,1,1]

counts: 0:1, 1:2

Alice can include 0 in c, and include one 1, so c = [0,1], MEX = 2.

Alternatively, if Alice includes one 1 first, Bob can delete the other 1, leaving Alice with only one 1 to include, resulting in c = [1,1], MEX = 0.

So, in this case, Alice should prioritize including the unique elements first.

Hence, for each number i from 0 to n-1, if it appears only once, Alice should include it in c on her turn.

If it appears multiple times, she can include floor(count[i]/2) or ceil(count[i]/2) instances, depending on the parity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of turns Alice gets.

Total turns are n, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting.

So, Alice gets ceil(n/2) turns, Bob gets floor(n/2) turns.

In those turns, Alice can choose which elements to include in c.

But Bob can delete any elements on his turns, potentially removing elements that Alice hasn't included yet.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

The MEX is the smallest missing number in c.

To maximize MEX, Alice wants c to contain as many small numbers as possible.

To minimize MEX, Bob wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

So, for each number i from 0 to n-1, we need to determine if Alice can include i in c.

If Alice can include i in c, then MEX cannot be i.

If Alice cannot include i in c, then MEX is i.

Hence, the smallest i for which Alice cannot include i in c is the MEX.

So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest i such that Alice cannot ensure that i is in c, given optimal play by both players.

Now, to determine for each i whether Alice can include i in c.

Given that Alice starts first and both play optimally.

Let's consider the frequency of i.

- If count[i] = 0, obviously MEX is i.

- If count[i] = 1, Alice can include it in c if she picks it before Bob deletes it.

But Bob can choose to delete it on his turn if it's still in a.

Wait, but Alice can choose to pick it on her turn.

So, if count[i] = 1, Alice can include it in c by picking it on her turn.

Bob cannot delete it before Alice picks it because Alice picks first.

Wait, but Bob picks after Alice.

So, if Alice doesn't pick it, Bob can pick it and delete it, preventing Alice from including it in c.

Hence, for count[i] = 1, Alice must pick it on her turn to include it in c; otherwise, Bob can delete it.

Similarly, for count[i] >= 2, Alice can include at least one in c, because even if Bob deletes one, Alice can pick another.

Wait, but if count[i] = 2, Alice picks one, Bob picks another, so Alice only includes one.

Wait, no, Bob deletes it, doesn't include it in c.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a, appends that element to c, and then deletes it from a.

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a, and then deletes it from a.

So, both delete the element after picking, but only Alice includes it in c.

Hence, for count[i] = 1, if Alice picks it, it goes to c; if Bob picks it, it doesn't go to c.

So, for count[i] = 1, Alice can choose to include it in c by picking it.

Bob can also pick it, but if he does, it's deleted without going to c.

Hence, for count[i] = 1, if Alice picks it, it's in c; if Bob picks it, it's not in c.

Since Alice goes first, she can choose to pick it.

But Bob might have the option to pick it on his turn if Alice doesn't pick it.

Hence, for count[i] = 1, Alice can ensure it's in c by picking it on her turn.

For count[i] >= 2, Alice can include at least one in c, because even if Bob picks one, Alice can pick another.

Hence, for all i where count[i] >= 1, Alice can include at least one in c.

Wait, but that can't be right, because in the third example, a = [1,1], n=2, and MEX is 0, meaning 0 is not in c.

But in this case, count[0] = 0, so Alice can't include 0 in c because it's not present in a.

Hence, MEX is 0.

Wait, but according to my previous logic, for count[i] >=1, Alice can include at least one in c.

But in this case, count[0] = 0, so she can't include 0 in c.

Hence, MEX is 0.

Wait, but in the second example, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], MEX should be 1.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, why would MEX be 1 if a = [0,1,2,3], and Alice can include all of them in c.

Wait, no, Alice gets ceil(4/2) = 2 turns, Bob gets floor(4/2) = 2 turns.

So, Alice can include 2 elements in c.

Bob can delete 2 elements without including them in c.

Hence, c will have 2 elements, and a will be empty.

So, possible c could be [0,1], MEX = 2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Looking back:

Sample Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Sample Output:

2

1

0

So, for n=4, a=[0,0,1,1], output is 2.

For n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], output is 1.

For n=2, a=[1,1], output is 0.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], output is 1.

But if Alice includes 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the output is 1, which suggests that Bob can force the MEX to be 1.

How is that possible?

Let me think about the second test case.

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

1. Alice picks 0 and includes it in c, a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 1 and deletes it, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 2 and includes it in c, c=[0,2], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3 and deletes it, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Another possible game:

1. Alice picks 1, includes in c, a=[0,2,3]

2. Bob picks 0, deletes it, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, includes in c, c=[1,2], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, deletes it, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0.

Wait, in this case, MEX is 0.

But the sample output is 1.

So, perhaps Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, but in this case, MEX is 0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, if c=[1,2], MEX is 0, since 0 is not in c.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the sample input, second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], output=1.

But according to my calculation, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Wait, no, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Wait, no, c=[0,2], the smallest missing number is 1, so MEX=1.

Wait, but earlier I thought c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Yes, that matches the sample output.

But in the other possible game, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, depending on the choices, MEX can be 0 or 1.

Since Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, the final MEX would be the minimum of the maximum choices Alice can make.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of game theory and determine the optimal strategy for both players.

But that seems too time-consuming for this problem.

Is there a simpler way to determine the MEX based on the frequencies of the numbers?

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n-1 and check if they are present in the array.

If a number is not present, it prints that number as the MEX.

If a number is present only once, and it's the first such number, it might affect the MEX.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], all numbers are present at least twice.

So, Alice can include at least one of each in c.

Hence, c can have both 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], but according to the sample output, MEX=1.

Wait, but if Alice includes 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the output is 1.

So, perhaps there's something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is determined by the minimal missing number in c, and Bob can force it to be 1 in the second test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice gets floor((n+1)/2) turns, and Bob gets floor(n/2) turns.

Wait, for n=4, Alice gets 2 turns, Bob gets 2 turns.

Alice can include 2 elements in c.

Bob can delete 2 elements without including them in c.

Hence, depending on their choices, c can have certain elements.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3].

If Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], a=[2,3].

Bob picks 2 and 3, deletes them.

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

So, perhaps Bob can force a lower MEX.

Wait, perhaps if Alice picks 0 and 2.

Then c=[0,2], a=[1,3].

Bob picks 1 and 3, deletes them.

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Similarly, if Alice picks 0 and 3, c=[0,3], MEX=1.

If Alice picks 1 and 2, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the possible MEX values are 0 and 1.

Since Alice wants to maximize, she would choose strategies that lead to MEX=2, but in this case, it seems that MEX=1 is the best she can guarantee, as Bob can force MEX=1 by deleting elements in a way that prevents Alice from having both 0 and 1 in c.

Hence, the minimal MEX that Alice can guarantee is 1.

Wait, but in the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], Alice can always include both 0 and 1 in c, so MEX=2.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], Alice can include two elements, but Bob can delete the other two in such a way that Alice cannot have both 0 and 1 in c.

Wait, but in one scenario, c=[0,2], MEX=1; in another, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the minimal MEX Alice can guarantee is 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

In the third test case, a=[1,1], n=2.

Alice picks 1, includes in c, a=[1].

Bob picks 1, deletes it.

Final c=[1], MEX=0.

Hence, output is 0.

So, how do we generalize this?

Looking at these examples, it seems that the MEX is determined by the smallest number that Alice cannot guarantee to include in c.

Hence, for each i from 0 to n-1, we need to check if Alice can include i in c.

If she can, then MEX cannot be i.

If she cannot, then MEX is i.

So, for each
