Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column.

I start first by placing a white rook at some position (r, c), and then the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r equals c, in which case it skips its turn. We've already played k moves, and I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward.

First, I need to understand what a configuration is. A configuration is a way of placing rooks on the board such that no two rooks attack each other, and considering the colors as well. So, the position and color matter.

Given that, two configurations are different if there's at least one position where the rooks differ in presence or color.

Now, the problem says that it's guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. So, I don't have to worry about whether the initial k moves are valid; they are.

My task is to continue the game from here until no more moves can be made and count how many different final configurations are possible.

Let me think about how the game progresses.

I start by placing a white rook, then the computer places a black rook, and so on.

But there's a twist: when I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips its turn.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says if r == c, the computer can't mirror the move and skips its turn. So, in that case, only my move is made, and the computer does nothing.

Okay, so the game alternates between me and the computer, but sometimes the computer skips.

Now, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game from the current state.

Let me consider the state of the board after k moves have been made by me and the computer has mirrored them, except when r == c.

I need to consider the current state of the board, i.e., which positions are already occupied by rooks, and their colors.

But wait, the problem says that it's guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, meaning that no two rooks are attacking each other so far.

So, I can assume that the current board state is valid.

Now, I need to continue the game until no more moves can be made, and count the number of possible final configurations.

I need to find a way to model this.

Let me think about the game mechanics.

Each time I place a white rook at (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips.

So, essentially, each of my moves leads to the computer's move, except when r == c.

So, the game progresses in turns, where each turn consists of my move and possibly the computer's move.

But sometimes, the computer skips.

I need to find a way to model this back and forth until no more moves can be made.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of available rows and columns.

Each time I place a rook at (r, c), I'm removing row r and column c from the available spots for future moves, because no other rook can be in the same row or column.

Similarly, when the computer places a rook at (c, r), it's removing row c and column r.

But wait, in chessboard terms, rows and columns are distinct, but in this problem, it's an n x n grid, so rows are from 1 to n, columns from 1 to n.

Wait, are the rows and columns 1-indexed or 0-indexed? The problem doesn't specify, but in chess, rows and columns are typically 1-indexed.

Assuming they are 1-indexed.

So, when I place a rook at (r, c), I'm removing row r and column c from available spots.

Similarly, when the computer places a rook at (c, r), it's removing row c and column r.

But if r == c, then the computer skips, so only my move is made, and row r and column r are removed.

Wait, but in this case, since r == c, placing a rook at (r, r) removes row r and column r.

But the computer skips, so no additional removal.

In other cases, placing at (r, c) and (c, r) removes rows r and c, and columns c and r.

Wait, but in chess, rows and columns are distinct, but in this problem, it's a grid where rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n.

So, when a rook is placed at (r, c), it attacks all squares in row r and column c.

Similarly, a rook at (c, r) attacks all squares in row c and column r.

So, after placing rooks at (r, c) and (c, r), the remaining available squares are those not in rows r or c, and not in columns c or r.

Wait, but in terms of available spots for future moves, any square in the remaining board that doesn't conflict with already placed rooks.

But this seems a bit messy to think about directly.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the remaining available rows and columns after accounting for the placed rooks.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a bipartite graph, where one set represents rows, and the other set represents columns, and edges represent possible placements.

But that might be too complicated for this context.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

Each rook placed at (r, c) occupies row r and column c.

Similarly, a rook at (c, r) occupies row c and column r.

So, after k moves, with both me and the computer placing rooks accordingly, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to keep track of which rows and columns are already occupied.

Then, the remaining available spots are those where neither the row nor the column is already occupied.

So, perhaps I can calculate the number of remaining rows and columns that are still available.

Wait, more precisely, the number of remaining rows that are not occupied and the number of remaining columns that are not occupied.

But since rooks placed by me and the computer occupy both rows and columns, I need to account for the intersections.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the independence number of a bipartite graph, but that seems too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining board.

But the complication here is that me and the computer are alternately placing rooks, and the computer mirrors my moves.

Wait, but in the end, I need to count the number of possible final configurations, considering the rules of the game.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the number of ways to place the remaining rooks, given the constraints.

Let me try to simplify the problem.

Suppose that after k moves, with me and the computer placing rooks as per the rules, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find out how many ways we can continue placing rooks until no more moves are possible, considering the game's turn-based nature and the computer's mirroring strategy.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I can think about the symmetries in the problem.

Given that the computer mirrors my moves, there seems to be a symmetry along the main diagonal of the board.

Wait, when I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), unless r == c.

So, for r != c, there are two rooks placed: one at (r, c) and one at (c, r).

For r == c, only one rook is placed at (r, r).

So, the board has some symmetry because of this mirroring.

But, the colors of the rooks matter: white for me, black for the computer.

So, even if positions are mirrored, the colors are different.

Given that, the configurations are distinct based on both position and color.

I need to count all possible distinct configurations that can arise from continuing the game.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think about the problem in terms of available positions and how they are being occupied.

Let me consider that after k moves, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find out how many ways to place additional rooks, considering the game's rules, until no more moves are possible.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to find a mathematical formula or a recursive way to compute the number of possible final configurations.

Let me consider smaller cases to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1

My move: (1, 2)

Computer's move: (2, 1)

So, rooks are at (1,2) and (2,1)

Now, I need to place another white rook in a position that doesn't attack any existing rook.

Possible positions are:

(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)

But wait, (3,3) is fine, but if I place at (3,4), computer will place at (4,3), and vice versa.

So, if I place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3), and then no more moves are possible.

Similarly, if I place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4), which is the same as the previous configuration, just mirrored.

But since colors matter, they are different.

Wait, no, in this case, placing at (3,4) and computer placing at (4,3) is different from placing at (4,3) and computer placing at (3,4), because the colors are different.

But in terms of configuration, since positions are different, they are distinct.

But in the explanation, it says that configurations where rooks are placed at (3,4) and (4,3) are considered different from placing at (4,3) and (3,4), because of the colors.

Wait, but in the first test case, it says there are 3 possible configurations.

Looking back at the explanation:

1. I place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

2. I place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4)

3. I place at (3,3), then at (4,4), or the other way around, but they result in the same configuration.

So, in total, 3 distinct configurations.

So, in this case, the answer is 3.

Now, given that, I need to generalize this for any n and k.

But this seems non-trivial.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of remaining available positions after accounting for the occupied rows and columns.

Each rook placed at (r,c) occupies row r and column c.

Similarly, the computer's rook at (c,r) occupies row c and column r.

So, after k moves, with me and the computer placing rooks, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find out how many ways to place additional rooks in the remaining available positions, considering the game's rules.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

Let me define:

Let R be the set of rows that are not yet occupied.

Let C be the set of columns that are not yet occupied.

Then, the available positions are those where both the row and the column are available, i.e., positions (r,c) where r ∈ R and c ∈ C.

Now, in each turn, I choose a position (r,c) from the available positions, place a white rook there, and then the computer places a black rook at (c,r), unless r == c, in which case it skips.

Then, the available positions are updated by removing row r and column c (and row c and column r if the computer places a rook).

This seems a bit involved.

Maybe I can think about the problem in terms of graph theory, where rows and columns are two sets of vertices, and positions are edges.

But that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of permutations or derangements.

Wait, but it's not exactly a permutation, because multiple rooks can be placed as long as no two are in the same row or column.

Wait, actually, it's similar to placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, which is equivalent to selecting a subset of the grid where no two elements are in the same row or column.

But in this problem, we have to consider the coloring and the mirroring.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

Looking back at the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1

Answer is 3.

Looking at the second test case:

n = 8, k = 1

Answer is 331.

Third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4

Answer is 671968183.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4.

So, any solution must be efficient.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs, it seems like the answer is related to some combinatorial calculation.

Looking at the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1

After the first move, two positions are occupied: (1,2) and (2,1)

Remaining available positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)

But in the explanation, it says that there are three possible configurations.

Looking closely:

- If I place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

- If I place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4)

- If I place at (3,3), then I can place at (4,4), or vice versa, but they result in the same configuration.

So, in total, 3 distinct configurations.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is related to the number of ways to pair up the remaining positions, considering the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing (r,c) and (c,r), and choosing which pairs to place rooks.

But in the case where r == c, it's a single position.

So, maybe I can group the remaining positions into pairs {(r,c), (c,r)} where r != c, and single positions where r == c.

Then, for each pair, I can choose to place rooks in both positions or neither.

And for single positions, I can choose to place a rook or not.

But in the game's context, since the computer mirrors my moves, I have to place in one position, and the computer places in the other.

So, perhaps for each pair, I have two choices: place rooks in both or not.

And for single positions, I have the choice to place a rook or not.

But I need to make sure that once I place a rook in a pair, the computer places its rook in the mirrored position.

Wait, but in the game, I choose a position, place my rook, and then the computer places its rook in the mirrored position.

So, it's not that I choose to place in both positions at once; it's a sequential process.

But in the end, I need to count the number of possible final configurations.

Maybe I can think of it as choosing a subset of the remaining pairs to place rooks in, considering the game's rules.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Perhaps I can think about the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

Let me define:

Let S be the set of rows not yet occupied.

Let T be the set of columns not yet occupied.

After k moves, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find out the sizes of S and T.

Wait, but since each rook placed occupies both a row and a column, the number of occupied rows and columns will be related to the number of moves.

Wait, no, actually, each rook placed occupies one row and one column.

So, if I place a rook at (r,c), row r and column c are occupied.

Then, the computer places a rook at (c,r), occupying row c and column r.

So, in total, rows r and c are occupied, and columns c and r are occupied.

Wait, but if r != c, then two rows and two columns are occupied.

If r == c, then only one row and one column are occupied.

Wait, but in the first move, when k = 1, and I place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1), so rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

So, in this case, S = {3,4}, T = {3,4}

So, remaining available positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)

Now, in the next move, I can choose any of these positions.

If I choose (3,4), then computer chooses (4,3), and then no more moves are possible.

Similarly, if I choose (4,3), computer chooses (3,4), and no more moves.

If I choose (3,3), then I can choose (4,4) next, and vice versa, but the configurations are the same since the order doesn't matter in the final configuration.

Hence, 3 distinct configurations.

So, in this case, the number of configurations is 3.

Now, how can I generalize this?

Let me think about the number of remaining rows and columns that are not occupied.

In the general case, after k moves, with me and the computer placing rooks accordingly, some rows and columns are occupied.

Let me define:

Let R be the set of rows occupied by any rook (mine or computer's).

Let C be the set of columns occupied by any rook.

Each time I place a rook at (r,c), row r and column c are occupied.

Computer places a rook at (c,r), occupying row c and column r, unless r == c.

So, for each of my moves where r != c, four positions are occupied: rows r and c, columns r and c.

Wait, but actually, rows r and c are occupied, and columns r and c are occupied.

Wait, no: when I place at (r,c), row r and column c are occupied by my rook.

Computer places at (c,r), occupying row c and column r with its rook.

So, in total, rows r and c are occupied, and columns r and c are occupied.

Hence, for each pair (r,c) where r != c, four positions are occupied: rows r and c, columns r and c.

But wait, positions are single squares, not rows or columns.

Wait, no: when a rook is placed at (r,c), it occupies that position and attacks entire row r and column c.

But in terms of occupied rows and columns, placing a rook at (r,c) occupies row r and column c.

Similarly, placing at (c,r) occupies row c and column r.

So, in total, rows r and c are occupied, and columns r and c are occupied.

Hence, for each pair (r,c) where r != c, two rows and two columns are occupied.

But wait, in the first test case, with n=4, k=1, and move (1,2), computer places at (2,1), so rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

Hence, remaining rows are 3 and 4, and remaining columns are 3 and 4.

So, available positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)

Now, in the next move, I can choose any one of these positions.

If I choose (3,4), computer chooses (4,3), and then no more moves are possible.

Similarly, if I choose (4,3), computer chooses (3,4), and no more moves are possible.

If I choose (3,3), then I can choose (4,4) next, and vice versa, but the configurations are the same.

Hence, 3 distinct configurations.

Now, in this case, it seems that the number of configurations is related to the number of ways to pair up the remaining positions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing (r,c) and (c,r).

In the remaining available positions, for r != c, pair (r,c) and (c,r), and for r == c, it's a single position.

Then, for each pair, I can choose to place both rooks or not.

And for single positions, I can choose to place a rook or not.

But in the game's context, since the computer mirrors my moves, it's not exactly choosing both at once.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as choosing a subset of the pairs to place both rooks, and choosing which single positions to place a rook.

Then, the number of configurations would be 2^p * 2^s, where p is the number of pairs and s is the number of single positions.

But in the first test case, there are two pairs: {(3,4),(4,3)} and one single position {(3,3)} and {(4,4)}, but in the explanation, it's considered as one single position.

Wait, no: (3,3) and (4,4) are two single positions.

So, p = 1 (pair: (3,4) and (4,3)), and s = 2 (single positions: (3,3) and (4,4))

Hence, total configurations would be 2^1 * 2^2 = 8.

But according to the explanation, there are only 3 configurations.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Hence, this approach is wrong.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the game, me and the computer are alternately placing rooks, with the computer mirroring my moves.

So, in terms of the final configuration, for each pair (r,c) and (c,r), either both are occupied with rooks of different colors or neither is occupied.

For positions where r == c, only one rook can be placed, by me.

So, in the final configuration, for each pair (r,c) with r != c, either both positions have rooks of different colors or neither has a rook.

For positions where r == c, either it has my rook or it doesn't.

Now, in terms of counting the number of possible final configurations, it's equivalent to choosing which pairs to place both rooks and which single positions to place a rook.

But in the first test case, with p = 1 and s = 2, according to this, it should be 2^1 * 2^2 = 8, but the explanation says only 3.

So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps there are dependencies between the pairs and singles.

Let me think carefully.

In the first test case:

- Pair: {(3,4), (4,3)}

- Singles: {(3,3), (4,4)}

Now, if I choose to place rooks in both positions of the pair, then the computer will place the mirrored rooks, so no additional moves are possible.

Hence, one configuration.

If I choose not to place rooks in the pair, then I can choose to place rooks in the singles.

But since the singles are (3,3) and (4,4), placing a rook at (3,3) doesn't prevent placing at (4,4), and vice versa.

But in the explanation, placing at (3,3) and then at (4,4) results in the same configuration as placing at (4,4) and then at (3,3), because the order doesn't matter in the final configuration.

Hence, only one configuration for choosing both singles.

Similarly, choosing only one of the singles results in two more configurations.

Hence, total of 1 (pair) + 1 (both singles) + 2 (one single) = 4 configurations.

But according to the explanation, it's 3.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the explanation, it says that placing at (3,3) and then at (4,4) is the same as placing at (4,4) and then at (3,3), because the configurations are the same.

But in my count, I have:

1. Pair: (3,4) and (4,3)

2. Both singles: (3,3) and (4,4)

3. Only (3,3)

4. Only (4,4)

Hence, 4 configurations.

But in the explanation, it says there are 3 configurations.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that choosing both singles is equivalent to choosing neither the pair nor any single, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that choosing both singles blocks each other's rows and columns, making it invalid.

Wait, no, in the first test case, placing at (3,3) and (4,4) is allowed because they don't attack each other.

Hence, I'm confused.

Perhaps there's an error in my reasoning.

Let me look back at the explanation.

In the first test case, it mentions three configurations:

1. Place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

2. Place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4)

3. Place at (3,3), then at (4,4), or the other way around, but they result in the same configuration.

So, according to this, configurations 1 and 2 are distinct, and configuration 3 is another distinct configuration.

Hence, total of 3 configurations.

But according to my earlier count, I had 4 configurations.

So, perhaps I need to consider that configurations 1 and 2 are actually the same because they both have rooks at (3,4) and (4,3), just placed in different orders, but in the final configuration, the positions are the same with different colors.

Wait, but in the explanation, they are considered different because the colors are different.

Wait, no, in the explanation, it seems that configurations 1 and 2 are considered different, but configurations where rooks are placed at (3,3) and (4,4) in different orders are considered the same.

Wait, I need to read the explanation more carefully.

In the explanation, it says:

1. You place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

2. You place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4)

3. You place at (3,3), then at (4,4), or the other way around, but they result in the same configuration.

Hence, 3 configurations.

So, in this context, configurations 1 and 2 are considered different because the positions are different, even though they involve the same pair, but with different colors.

While configurations where you place at (3,3) and then (4,4), or vice versa, are considered the same because the final positions are the same, regardless of the order.

Hence, in my earlier count, configurations 1 and 2 are distinct, and configuration 3 is another distinct configuration, totaling 3.

So, my earlier count of 4 was incorrect because choosing both singles is only one configuration, regardless of the order in which they are placed.

Hence, the correct count is 3.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of ways to choose subsets of the single positions.

In this case, with p = 1 pair and s = 2 singles, the number of configurations would be 2^p * (s + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6, which is not matching the explanation.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^p * 2^s = 2 * 4 = 8, but that's also not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract some invalid configurations.

But this is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model the remaining game as a graph where nodes represent remaining rows and columns, and edges represent possible placements.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that after accounting for the initial k moves, the remaining board can be divided into independent components, and the number of configurations is the product over these components.

In the first test case, there is one pair {(3,4), (4,3)} and two single positions {(3,3), (4,4)}.

Each pair can be either chosen (both positions get rooks) or not chosen.

Each single position can be chosen or not, independently.

Hence, total configurations should be 2 (for the pair) * 2 (for (3,3)) * 2 (for (4,4)) = 8.

But according to the explanation, it's 3.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

Perhaps not all combinations are possible due to the game's rules.

Wait, maybe the pair and the single positions are not independent.

For example, if I choose the pair, then I can't choose the singles, because placing at (3,4) and (4,3) blocks rows 3 and 4, so (3,3) and (4,4) can't be chosen anymore.

Wait, no.

In the first test case, if I choose the pair {(3,4), (4,3)}, then rows 3 and 4 are occupied, so singles {(3,3)} and {(4,4)} can't be chosen anymore.

Hence, in this case, choosing the pair excludes choosing the singles.

Similarly, if I don't choose the pair, I can choose any subset of the singles.

Hence, total configurations would be:

- Choose the pair: 1 configuration

- Don't choose the pair, and choose any subset of the singles: 2^2 = 4 configurations

Hence, total 1 + 4 = 5 configurations.

But according to the explanation, it's 3.

Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps choosing the pair doesn't count as one configuration, but rather as two configurations, since me and the computer place rooks in sequence.

Wait, no, in the explanation, choosing the pair is one configuration.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of ways to choose subsets of the remaining positions, considering the game's rules.

Given that the game is turn-based and the computer mirrors my moves, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of the remaining pairs and singles, with some constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps I can think about the number of remaining rows and columns that are free.

Let me define:

Let S be the set of rows that are not yet occupied.

Let T be the set of columns that are not yet occupied.

After k moves, some rows and columns are occupied.

Each time I place a rook at (r,c), row r and column c are occupied.

Computer places a rook at (c,r), occupying row c and column r.

Hence, for each of my moves where r != c, rows r and c and columns r and c are occupied.

For r == c, only row r and column r are occupied.

Hence, the number of remaining rows and columns that are free can be calculated.

Let me try to compute the sizes of S and T.

In the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1

My move: (1,2)

Computer's move: (2,1)

Hence, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

Hence, S = {3,4}, T = {3,4}

So, |S| = 2, |T| = 2

Now, the number of configurations is 3.

I need to find a formula that, given |S| and |T|, computes the number of configurations.

But in this case, |S| = |T| = 2, and answer is 3.

Wait, but in general, |S| may not equal |T|.

Wait, in this problem, since each rook placement affects both a row and a column, and the computer mirrors the moves, it's possible that |S| != |T|.

Wait, in the first test case, |S| = |T| = 2, and answer is 3.

Wait, is there a relation between |S|, |T|, and the number of configurations?

Let me consider that the number of configurations is equal to C(|S|, |T|), where C is some function.

But I need to find a general formula.

Looking back at the first test case, with |S| = 2, |T| = 2, answer is 3.

Looking at the second test case:

n = 8, k = 1

Move: (7,6)

Computer's move: (6,7)

Hence, rows 6 and 7 are occupied, columns 6 and 7 are occupied.

So, S = {1,2,3,4,5,8}, |S| = 6

T = {1,2,3,4,5,8}, |T| = 6

Answer is 331.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4

After k moves, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find a general formula for the number of configurations based on |S| and |T|.

Wait, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the colors.

But this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of subsets of the remaining positions where no two positions share the same row or column.

But again, this seems too general.

Let me consider that in the remaining board, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of positions where no two positions share a row or column, and considering the coloring.

But this is essentially counting the number of possible placements of non-attacking rooks on the remaining board, with two colors for each position.

But in the problem, the computer mirrors my moves, so it's not exactly the same.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to find a pattern in the answers.

Looking back at the first test case:

|S| = 2, |T| = 2, answer = 3

Second test case:

|S| = 6, |T| = 6, answer = 331

Third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4, but I don't know |S| and |T|.

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between |S| and |T|.

In the first test case, |S| = |T| = n - 2*k when k moves are made and r != c.

Wait, in the first test case, k = 1, and r != c, so |S| = n - 2*k = 4 - 2*1 = 2, which matches.

Similarly, in the second test case, n = 8, k = 1, |S| = 8 - 2*1 = 6, which matches.

In the third test case, n = 1000, k = 4, but it's more complicated because some moves may have r == c.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that for each of the k moves, if r != c, then two positions are placed: (r,c) and (c,r), occupying four positions (rows r, c and columns r, c).

If r == c, then only one position is placed: (r,r), occupying row r and column r.

Hence, for each move where r != c, the number of occupied rows and columns increases by 2.

For moves where r == c, it increases by 1.

Hence, the total number of occupied rows and columns is 2*m + s, where m is the number of moves where r != c, and s is the number of moves where r == c.

But in the input, we're given k, the number of moves I've already made, and the corresponding computer moves.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

Hence, I can calculate the number of remaining rows and columns that are free.

Let me denote:

Let m be the number of moves where r != c.

Let s be the number of moves where r == c.

Then, total occupied rows and columns are 2*m + s.

Hence, |S| = n - (2*m + s)

Similarly, |T| = n - (2*m + s)

Hence, |S| = |T|.

Hence, in general, |S| = |T|.

Hence, I can denote l = |S| = |T|.

Now, in the first test case, l = 2, answer = 3

Second test case, l = 6, answer = 331

Third test case, n = 1000, k = 4, but I need to compute l.

Given that, I can compute l = n - (2*m + s)

But in the input, I'm given k, and for each move, I can determine if r == c or not.

Hence, I can compute m and s from the input.

But in the code provided, it seems to compute l differently.

Looking at the code:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

(n, k) = (L[0], L[1])

for j in range(k):

L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

(a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])

if a != b:

n -= 2

else:

n -= 1

print(func_1(n))

continue

def func_1(n):

dp = [1, 1]

for i in range(2, n + 1):

dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]

dp.pop(0)

return dp[-1]

So, in the code, for each of the k moves, if a != b, n -= 2, else n -=1.

Hence, l = n - (2*m + s), which is what the code is doing.

Then, it computes func_1(l), which seems to be computing some dynamic programming array.

Now, I need to verify if this func_1(l) correctly computes the number of configurations.

Looking at func_1(n):

It initializes dp = [1,1]

Then, for i from 2 to n, it computes dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2], modulo 10^9 + 7.

Then, it returns dp[n].

So, it's computing some recurrence relation.

I need to see if this recurrence correctly models the number of configurations.

Looking back at the first test case:

l = 2

func_1(2) should return 3, which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

l = 6

func_1(6) should return 331, which matches.

Third test case:

l = 1000 - (something based on k=4 moves), but the answer is 671968183.

Assuming the code is correct, I need to verify if this recurrence correctly models the number of configurations.

Let me try to see what this recurrence represents.

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]

This looks similar to the recurrence for the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, but with some modifications.

Wait, in standard rook placements, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an n x n board is given by the number of permutations of n things taken k at a time.

But in this problem, it's more complicated due to the coloring and the mirroring.

Alternatively, perhaps this recurrence counts the number of matchings in a bipartite graph, but again, it's not directly applicable here.

Let me try to see if this recurrence gives the correct answers for small values.

Compute func_1(n) for n from 0 to 6:

n=0: dp[0] = 1 (base case)

n=1: dp[1] = 1 (base case)

n=2: dp[2] = dp[1] + 2*(1)*dp[0] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 3

n=3: dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*(2)*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

n=4: dp[4] = dp[3] + 2*(3)*dp[2] = 7 + 6*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

n=5: dp[5] = dp[4] + 2*(4)*dp[3] = 25 + 8*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

n=6: dp[6] = dp[5] + 2*(5)*dp[4] = 81 + 10*25 = 81 + 250 = 331

So, for n=2, dp[2] = 3, which matches the first test case.

For n=6, dp[6] = 331, which matches the second test case.

For n=1000 - (something based on k=4), it computes dp[l], and the answer is 671968183.

So, it seems that func_1(l) correctly computes the number of configurations for the remaining board.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible in a chess game where two players alternately place rooks on a grid under specific constraints. We must ensure that no two rooks attack each other, considering their positions and colors.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup and Input Parsing**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the grid size `n` and the number of pre-played moves `k`.
   - Adjust `n` based on the pre-played moves to find the remaining available positions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - Use a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - The DP array is maintained to store intermediate results efficiently.
   - The recurrence relation accounts for placing rooks in such a way that no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Perform all computations modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])

        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue
