Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column, right? So, we need to place them such that no two are in the same row or column.

I start first, placing a white rook, and then the computer places a black rook by mirroring my move, meaning if I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r). But if r equals c, so the positions are the same, the computer skips its turn.

We've already played k moves, and for each of these k moves, the computer has mirrored them if possible. Now, we need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward, following the same rules, until no more moves can be made. And since the number can be large, we have to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what a configuration is. A configuration is a way of placing rooks on the board, considering both white and black rooks, and their positions. Two configurations are different if there's at least one position where the rooks differ in presence or color.

Given that, I need to count all possible ways the game can proceed from the current state to the end, where no more moves can be made, and each way represents a unique configuration.

Let's think about how the game progresses. Each turn, I place a white rook in a position that doesn't attack any existing rook, and then the computer mirrors that move if possible, placing a black rook at (c, r) if I placed at (r, c), unless r = c, in which case it skips.

So, the key here is to understand the constraints imposed by the moves already made and how they affect future moves.

I need to consider the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, because new rooks cannot be placed in those rows or columns.

Wait, actually, rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, so if a row or column already has a rook, no other rooks can be placed in that row or column.

But in this problem, since we're placing rooks alternately and ensuring they don't attack each other, it means that each new rook must be placed in a previously unoccupied row and column.

This sounds a lot like placing non-attacking rooks on the board, which is similar to placing permutations, but with the added complexity of mirroring moves.

Given that, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without attacking each other, considering the mirroring constraint.

Let's consider the state of the board after k moves have been made, including the computer's mirrored moves.

I need to determine how many rows and columns are still available for placing new rooks.

Each move I make occupies one row and one column for me, and potentially one row and one column for the computer, depending on whether the positions are mirrored.

Wait, actually, when I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), provided r != c. If r = c, the computer skips.

So, for each of my moves where r != c, two rooks are placed: one at (r, c) and one at (c, r). If r = c, only one rook is placed at (r, c).

Therefore, for k moves I've made, and considering the computer's mirrored moves, the total number of rooks placed so far is k plus the number of mirrored moves, which is k minus the number of moves where r = c.

Let me define:

- Let s be the number of moves where r = c.

- Then, the total number of rooks placed so far is k + (k - s) = 2k - s.

Because for each r != c, two rooks are placed, and for r = c, only one rook is placed.

Wait, no. Wait a minute.

Wait, if r != c, then I place one rook at (r, c), and the computer places one at (c, r), so two rooks.

If r = c, then I place one rook at (r, c), and the computer skips.

So, total rooks placed so far are:

- For each move where r != c: 2 rooks.

- For each move where r = c: 1 rook.

So, if s is the number of moves where r = c, then the total rooks placed are 2*(k - s) + s = 2k - s.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, each rook occupies one row and one column, so for the rows and columns that have rooks, they cannot have any more rooks.

Therefore, the number of rows and columns that are still available for placing new rooks is n minus the number of unique rows and columns that have already been occupied.

Wait, but since each rook occupies a unique row and a unique column, we need to account for both rows and columns.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, each rook occupies one row and one column, but it's possible that multiple rooks occupy the same row or column, but in this problem, since we're placing non-attacking rooks, each row and each column can have at most one rook.

Wait, but in standard chess, rooks attack along rows and columns, so if two rooks are in the same row or column, they attack each other.

Therefore, in this problem, since we're placing rooks that don't attack each other, each row and each column can have at most one rook.

But in this problem, both me and the computer place rooks that don't attack any existing rooks, including each other's rooks.

So, overall, the board must have rooks placed such that no two share the same row or column.

Therefore, the placed rooks correspond to a partial permutation of the board.

Now, given that, the remaining part of the board where rooks can be placed is equivalent to a bipartite graph where rows and columns are the two sets, and edges connect unoccupied rows to unoccupied columns.

Placing a rook corresponds to selecting an edge and removing the corresponding row and column from the graph.

Now, the problem is to count the number of perfect matchings in this bipartite graph, but with the added constraint of the mirroring moves.

Wait, but it's not exactly perfect matchings, because we can have a varying number of rooks placed, depending on the moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of ways to complete the placement of rooks until no more moves can be made, considering the mirroring constraint.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's determine how many rows and columns are already occupied by the initial k moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

Let s be the number of moves where r = c.

Then, the total number of rooks placed so far is 2k - s.

But, each rook occupies one row and one column.

Therefore, the number of unique rows occupied is equal to the number of unique columns occupied.

Wait, is that necessarily true?

Wait, suppose I have rooks placed at (1,2) and (2,1). Then, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

Similarly, if I have a rook at (3,4) and (4,3), rows 3 and 4 are occupied, columns 3 and 4 are occupied.

If I have a rook at (5,5), then row 5 and column 5 are occupied.

So, in general, the number of unique rows occupied is equal to the number of unique columns occupied, and it's equal to the total number of rooks placed.

Wait, no. Wait, in the above example:

- rooks at (1,2), (2,1), (3,4), (4,3), (5,5)

- unique rows occupied: 1,2,3,4,5

- unique columns occupied: 1,2,3,4,5

So, yes, the number of unique rows occupied equals the number of unique columns occupied, and it's equal to the total number of rooks placed.

Wait, but in general, is this always the case?

Wait, suppose I place a rook at (1,2), then the computer places at (2,1).

Now, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

Then, if I place another rook at (3,4), computer places at (4,3).

Now, rows 1,2,3,4 are occupied, and columns 1,2,3,4 are occupied.

If I place a rook at (5,5), then only row 5 and column 5 are occupied.

So, in general, the number of unique rows occupied is equal to the number of unique columns occupied, and both are equal to the total number of rooks placed.

Therefore, if t is the total number of rooks placed so far, then the number of rows occupied is t, and the number of columns occupied is t.

Therefore, the number of rows available for placing new rooks is n - t, and similarly for columns.

Now, from this point onward, I need to place rooks in the remaining available rows and columns, following the same rules: I place a white rook, then the computer mirrors it if possible.

I need to count the number of ways to place rooks until no more moves can be made.

Now, the mirroring complicates things because it affects how the rooks are placed.

Let me think about the mirroring.

If I place a rook at (r,c) where r != c, then the computer places a rook at (c,r).

So, effectively, for each such move, two rooks are placed: one at (r,c) and one at (c,r).

If r = c, then only one rook is placed at (r,c), and the computer skips.

So, in terms of occupied rows and columns, each pair (r,c) and (c,r) occupies rows r and c, and columns r and c.

Wait, but since rows and columns are the same indices, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, in terms of available spots, after placing rooks at (r,c) and (c,r), rows r and c are occupied, and columns r and c are occupied.

Wait, but in terms of the board, since it's n x n, rows and columns are both labeled from 1 to n.

So, if I place a rook at (r,c), that occupies row r and column c.

Then, if the computer places a rook at (c,r), that occupies row c and column r.

So, now, rows r and c are both occupied, and columns r and c are both occupied.

Wait, but in terms of placing new rooks, I cannot place a rook in any row that's already occupied or any column that's already occupied.

So, for each pair (r,c) and (c,r), we're effectively removing rows r and c and columns r and c from future placements.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I place a rook at (r,c), that occupies row r and column c.

Then, the computer places a rook at (c,r), which occupies row c and column r.

So, now, rows r and c are both occupied, and columns r and c are both occupied.

Therefore, for future moves, I cannot place any rook in rows r or c, nor in columns r or c.

Wait, but in standard non-attacking rook placement, placing a rook in (r,c) would prevent any other rook in row r or column c.

So, in this case, placing rooks at (r,c) and (c,r) would prevent any rook in rows r and c, and columns r and c.

Therefore, the available board for future moves is reduced by removing rows r and c, and columns r and c.

Wait, but in terms of the board, if I remove rows r and c, and columns r and c, then the remaining board is n - 2 x n - 2, assuming r and c are distinct.

Wait, but if r = c, then placing a rook at (r,c) and the computer skipping means only row r and column r are occupied.

So, in that case, the remaining board is n - 1 x n - 1.

Wait, so, in general, for each pair where r != c, we're reducing the board by 2 rows and 2 columns, and for each r = c, we're reducing the board by 1 row and 1 column.

Wait, but in terms of the occupied rows and columns, it's a bit more nuanced because of overlaps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of available rows and columns left.

Let me try to model this.

Let's say t is the total number of rooks placed so far, which is 2k - s, where s is the number of moves where r = c.

But, as we saw earlier, the number of unique rows occupied is t, and the number of unique columns occupied is t.

Wait, no, actually, no.

Wait, let's think again.

Suppose I have k moves, with s of them being where r = c.

Then, the total number of rooks placed is 2k - s.

But the number of unique rows occupied is the number of distinct rows in all rooks placed, which is the union of rows from my moves and the computer's moves.

Similarly for columns.

Wait, let's consider:

- My moves: k moves at positions (r1, c1), (r2, c2), ..., (rk, ck)

- Computer's moves: for each my move, if ri != ci, then it places at (ci, ri)

So, the set of all rooks placed is:

- For each i from 1 to k:

- rook at (ri, ci)

- if ri != ci, rook at (ci, ri)

Therefore, the total number of rooks is k plus the number of pairs where ri != ci.

Which is k + (k - s), where s is the number of moves where ri = ci.

So, total rooks t = 2k - s.

Now, the unique rows occupied are the union of all rows in these rooks.

Similarly for columns.

So, unique rows occupied are the set of all ri and ci where rook is placed.

Wait, but since for each rook at (ri, ci), row ri is occupied, and for rook at (ci, ri), row ci is occupied.

Wait, but row ri is already occupied by the rook at (ri, ci), so the rook at (ci, ri) doesn't add any new row occupation if ci was already occupied by some previous move.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to keep track of the set of occupied rows and columns.

Let me define:

- Let R be the set of rows occupied.

- Let C be the set of columns occupied.

Initially, R and C are empty.

For each of my k moves:

- Place a rook at (r, c):

- Add r to R

- Add c to C

- If r != c:

- Computer places a rook at (c, r):

- Add c to R

- Add r to C

So, in total:

- For each my move at (r, c):

- Add r to R

- Add c to C

- If r != c:

- Add c to R

- Add r to C

But this is redundant because adding r to R and c to C is already done.

So, effectively:

- R is the union of all r and c from my moves.

- C is the union of all r and c from my moves.

Wait, no. Wait, let's see.

Wait, for my move at (r, c):

- Add r to R

- Add c to C

- If r != c:

- Computer places at (c, r):

- Add c to R

- Add r to C

So, in total:

- R = union of all r and c from my moves and computer's moves

- C = union of all r and c from my moves and computer's moves

But since the computer's moves are at (c, r) for r != c, then:

- R = union of all r and c from my moves

- C = union of all r and c from my moves

So, R and C are the same set.

Therefore, the number of unique rows occupied is equal to the number of unique columns occupied, and it's equal to the number of distinct rows and columns from my k moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

Wait, but in terms of counting, it's better to think in terms of the number of unique rows (or columns) occupied.

Let me denote:

- Let S be the set of all rows and columns that have been occupied by any rook, either mine or the computer's.

- Then, S = union of all rows and columns from my moves and the computer's moves.

But since the computer's moves are at (c, r) for my move at (r, c), then S is just the union of all rows and columns from my moves and the computer's moves, which is the same as the union of all r and c from my moves.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think carefully.

For my move at (r, c):

- Place a rook at (r, c):

- Add r to R

- Add c to C

- If r != c:

- Computer places a rook at (c, r):

- Add c to R

- Add r to C

So, in total:

- R = union of all r and c from my moves and, if r != c, c and r from the computer's moves.

- But since R already has r and c from my moves, adding c and r from the computer's moves doesn't add anything new.

Therefore, R = union of all r and c from my moves.

Similarly, C = union of all r and c from my moves.

Therefore, R = C.

So, the number of unique rows occupied is equal to the number of unique columns occupied, and it's equal to the number of distinct rows and columns from my k moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

Let me denote u as the number of unique rows (or columns) occupied.

Now, u is the number of distinct rows (or columns) from all my moves and the computer's moves.

Given that, u is equal to the number of distinct rows from my moves plus the number of distinct columns from my moves, minus the number of moves where r = c.

Wait, no. Wait, more carefully:

- Let me define:

- Let R_m be the set of rows from my moves: {r1, r2, ..., rk}

- Let C_m be the set of columns from my moves: {c1, c2, ..., ck}

- Then, the total set of occupied rows R = R_m union C_m (because for each my move at (r, c), computer places at (c, r), adding c to R)

- Similarly, the total set of occupied columns C = R_m union C_m

- Therefore, u = |R_m union C_m|

So, u is the number of unique rows and columns from my moves, considering both rows and columns together.

Now, the remaining available rows and columns are n - u.

From this point onward, I need to place rooks in the remaining (n - u) x (n - u) subboard, following the same rules: I place a white rook, then the computer mirrors it if possible.

I need to count the number of ways to place rooks in this subboard until no more moves can be made.

Now, in this subboard, since it's a square board, and we're placing non-attacking rooks, it's similar to placing permutations on this subboard.

But with the mirroring constraint, it's a bit different.

Let me think about the mirroring.

In the subboard, when I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r), unless r = c.

So, effectively, for each pair (r, c) and (c, r), they are placed together.

Therefore, the placement is symmetric with respect to the diagonal.

Now, in terms of counting the number of ways to place rooks with this symmetry, it's similar to counting the number of symmetric relations on the subboard, but with the non-attacking constraint.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of pairing the moves.

Each of my moves corresponds to the computer's move, unless r = c.

So, for pairs where r != c, two rooks are placed: (r, c) and (c, r).

For pairs where r = c, only one rook is placed at (r, c).

Now, in the remaining subboard, when I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), provided r != c.

So, the game progresses by placing pairs of rooks symmetrically across the diagonal, except when r = c.

Therefore, the number of ways to complete the game is equivalent to the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the subboard, considering the mirroring constraint.

Now, in the subboard of size m = n - u, I need to place rooks in pairs: (r, c) and (c, r), unless r = c.

So, effectively, I'm choosing pairs of positions that are either distinct and symmetric or on the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing a subset of positions that are either on the diagonal or paired with their symmetric position.

But that seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that the remaining board is an m x m board, where m = n - u, and I need to place non-attacking rooks, with the mirroring constraint.

Given that, perhaps the number of ways to place the rooks is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of positions on the board, such that no two positions share the same row or column, and considering the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think recursively.

Let me define f(m) as the number of ways to complete the game on an m x m subboard.

Then, f(m) is the number of ways to place rooks on the m x m board, following the rules.

Now, in each turn, I can choose to place a rook at (r, c), and the computer places at (c, r), provided r != c.

If r = c, I place a rook at (r, c), and the computer skips.

So, in terms of f(m), I need to consider all possible first moves and how they reduce the board.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be derived.

Let me consider small values of m and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's compute f(m) for small m.

For m = 0: no board, only one way: do nothing. So f(0) = 1.

For m = 1: a 1x1 board. I can place a rook at (1,1), and the computer skips. Then, no more moves. So, only one configuration: the one with a single white rook at (1,1). So f(1) = 1.

Wait, but according to the problem, configurations differ based on the presence and color of rooks. So, in this case, placing a white rook at (1,1) is one configuration, and not placing any rook is another configuration only if it's a valid state, but in this case, I have to continue placing until no more moves can be made, so in m=1, I must place the rook at (1,1), so only one configuration.

Wait, but according to the problem, "continue playing the game until there are no valid moves remaining." So, in m=1, I can place a rook at (1,1), and the computer skips, and then there are no more moves, so only one configuration.

For m = 2: a 2x2 board.

Possible moves:

1. I place a rook at (1,1), computer skips. Then, no more moves, since rows 1 and columns 1 are occupied.

   - Configuration: white rook at (1,1)

2. I place a rook at (1,2), computer places at (2,1). Then, no more moves, since rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

   - Configuration: white rook at (1,2), black rook at (2,1)

So, two possible configurations.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case with n=4 and k=1, the output is 3, which seems to suggest that f(2) might be 2, but let's see.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, k=1, with move (1,2). So, after my move at (1,2), computer moves at (2,1). So, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, columns 1 and 2 are occupied. Remaining board is 2x2 subboard at positions (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4
