Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of numbers, and I need to split it into two subsequences: s and t. The goal is to minimize the total penalty, which is defined as the sum of p(s) and p(t), where p(b) is the number of indices in b where b_i < b_{i+1}.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], some possible subsequences are [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even an empty sequence.

The problem allows me to split the array into two such subsequences, s and t, and I have to make sure that every element of the original array is in either s or t. The objective is to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the number of increasing pairs in s and in t.

I need to think about how to distribute the elements of the array into s and t to minimize the total number of increasing pairs.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One possible split is s = [2, 4, 5] and t = [1, 3]. Let's see the penalties:

For s: 2 < 4 < 5, so p(s) = 2

For t: 1 < 3, so p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 2 + 1 = 3

Is this the minimal possible? Let's see if there's a better split.

Another split could be s = [1, 2, 3] and t = [4, 5]. For s: 1 < 2 < 3, p(s) = 2

For t: 4 < 5, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3 again.

What if s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4]? For s: 1 < 3 < 5, p(s) = 2

For t: 2 < 4, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3.

Another split: s = [1, 2, 4] and t = [3, 5]. For s: 1 < 2 < 4, p(s) = 2

For t: 3 < 5, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3.

It seems like no matter how I split, I get a total penalty of 3. Is there a way to get a lower penalty?

What if I try s = [1, 3] and t = [2, 4, 5]? For s: 1 < 3, p(s) = 1

For t: 2 < 4 < 5, p(t) = 2

Total penalty = 3.

Same as before.

Is there a split where I can get a lower total penalty? Let's try s = [1, 2, 3, 4] and t = [5]. For s: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4, p(s) = 3

For t: no increasing pairs since it's a single element, p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 3.

Still 3.

What if s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4]? We already saw that gives total penalty 3.

Is there a way to get total penalty less than 3? Maybe s = [1, 2, 4] and t = [3, 5]? That's still total penalty 3.

It seems like 3 is the minimal possible for this array.

Let's look at the second example:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

The problem says that a possible split is s = [8, 3, 1] and t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3], giving p(s) = 0 and p(t) = 1, for a total penalty of 1.

Is there a way to get a lower total penalty, say 0? That would mean both s and t have no increasing pairs. Is that possible?

For s to have no increasing pairs, any two consecutive elements in s should not have the earlier one less than the later one. Similarly for t.

Let's try to find such a split.

One way to achieve p(s) = 0 and p(t) = 0 is to make sure that in both s and t, the sequence is non-increasing.

Is it possible to split the array into two non-increasing subsequences?

Looking at the array: [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

Let's see:

One possible split:

s = [8, 3, 1]

t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

s is 8 > 3 > 1, which is non-increasing.

t is 2 > 1 < 7 > 4 > 3, which has one increasing pair: 1 < 7, so p(t) = 1.

Total penalty is 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the example.

Can I make t non-increasing as well? If I can, then total penalty would be 0.

Let me try to split the array differently.

s = [8, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3]

t = [2, 7]

s: 8 > 3 > 1 >= 1 > 4 > 3, which is non-increasing.

t: 2 < 7, which is an increasing pair, so p(t) = 1.

Total penalty is 0 + 1 = 1.

Not better than before.

What if s = [8, 3, 1, 7, 4, 3]

t = [2, 1]

s: 8 > 3 < 7 > 4 > 3, which has one increasing pair: 3 < 7, so p(s) = 1

t: 2 > 1, which is non-increasing, p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 1 + 0 = 1.

Same as before.

Is there a split where both s and t are non-increasing?

Let's try s = [8, 3, 1, 1, 3]

t = [2, 7, 4]

s: 8 > 3 > 1 >= 1 > 3, which is non-increasing.

t: 2 < 7 > 4, which has one increasing pair: 2 < 7, p(t) = 1.

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Still 1.

Another split: s = [8, 2, 1, 1, 3]

t = [3, 7, 4]

s: 8 > 2 > 1 >= 1 > 3, which is not entirely non-increasing because 1 < 3.

Wait, 1 > 3 is false, so s has an increasing pair there.

So p(s) = 1 (from 1 < 3)

t: 3 < 7 > 4, which has one increasing pair: 3 < 7, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 1 + 1 = 2.

Worse than before.

Seems like achieving total penalty 0 is not possible, because in any split where s is non-increasing, t ends up having at least one increasing pair.

Therefore, the minimal possible penalty is 1 for this case.

Looking at the third example:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Possible split: s = [] (empty), t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

p(s) = 0 (empty sequence has no increasing pairs)

p(t) = 0 (no increasing pairs since all elements are equal)

Total penalty = 0 + 0 = 0

Indeed, that's the minimal possible.

Similarly, for n = 1, a = [1], splitting s = [], t = [1] gives penalty 0.

For n = 2, a = [2, 1], splitting s = [2, 1], t = [] gives p(s) = 0 (since 2 > 1), p(t) = 0, total penalty = 0.

So, in some cases, it's possible to achieve zero penalty.

Now, I need to find a general way to compute the minimal possible penalty for any given array.

I need an efficient algorithm, considering that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (number of test cases) up to 10^4, with the total sum of n across all test cases being up to 2*10^5.

So, time complexity should be O(n) per test case, or at least O(n log n), but preferably closer to linear.

Let me think about the properties of the sequences s and t.

The penalty is the number of increasing pairs in s and t combined.

I need to minimize this sum.

This seems similar to decomposing the array into two sequences where the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

One approach could be to distribute the elements into s and t in such a way that increasing pairs are minimized.

An intuitive idea is to try to maximize the number of non-increasing sequences within s and t.

Wait, actually, I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

So, if I can make s and t as non-increasing as possible, that would minimize the number of increasing pairs.

In other words, if both s and t are non-increasing, then p(s) + p(t) would be zero.

But, it might not always be possible to split the array into two non-increasing subsequences.

In such cases, I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs in s and t combined.

I recall that any sequence can be split into two sequences such that at least one of them is a decreasing subsequence. Wait, that might not be accurate.

Actually, in the context of the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, any sequence of length n contains an increasing or decreasing subsequence of length at least sqrt(n). But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to build s and t one element at a time, deciding for each element whether to put it in s or t, in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

I need to maintain the sequences s and t in a way that allows me to efficiently decide where to place the next element.

One way to do this is to use greedy algorithms, similar to those used in longest increasing subsequence problems.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem using dynamic programming or greedy approaches.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element, decide whether to place it in s or in t.

When placing it in s or t, I need to ensure that I'm minimizing the number of increasing pairs.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I should try to place each element in a sequence where it causes the least number of new increasing pairs.

Ideally, I would place it in the sequence where it is as large as possible, to minimize the number of elements smaller than it in that sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two separate sequences s and t, and for each new element, choose to place it in the sequence where it can be placed without creating an increasing pair, or in the sequence where it creates the least number of increasing pairs.

This sounds a bit like the standard greedy algorithm for coloring a graph with two colors, where you try to minimize some conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as trying to split the sequence into two sequences, each as decreasing as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue or some sorted data structure to keep track of the sequences.

Let me think about it step by step.

Initialize two empty lists s and t.

Iterate through each element in the array.

For each element, decide whether to place it in s or in t.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to consider the impact of adding the element to s or t.

If I add it to s, I need to see how many increasing pairs it creates in s.

Similarly for t.

But checking this for each element at each step would be too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

An optimization could be to maintain the last elements of s and t.

Let's say x is the last element of s, and y is the last element of t.

When considering a new element a_i, I have a few options:

1. If a_i <= x, I can place it in s without creating a new increasing pair in s.

2. If a_i <= y, I can place it in t without creating a new increasing pair in t.

3. If a_i > x and a_i > y, then placing it in s would create an increasing pair in s, and similarly for t.

In this case, I have to choose which sequence to place it in, minimizing the total penalty.

Wait, actually, if a_i > x, placing it in s would create an increasing pair in s, adding 1 to p(s).

Similarly, if a_i > y, placing it in t would add 1 to p(t).

So, I need to choose the sequence where the penalty increase is smaller.

But since I'm trying to minimize the sum p(s) + p(t), and both penalties are independent, I should place it in the sequence where the last element is smaller than or equal to a_i, if possible, to avoid creating an increasing pair.

Wait, no. If a_i > last element of s, placing it in s would create an increasing pair, adding 1 to p(s). Similarly for t.

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), I should try to place a_i in a sequence where the last element is as large as possible, to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I should place a_i in the sequence where the last element is less than or equal to a_i, if possible.

If both sequences have their last elements less than a_i, then I have to choose which sequence to place a_i in, knowing that it will create an increasing pair in that sequence.

In that case, perhaps I should choose the sequence with the smaller last element to place a_i, to minimize the impact on future elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that I want both s and t to be as decreasing as possible.

So, I want to minimize the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This is similar to minimizing the number of times s or t increases.

So, perhaps I can model this as assigning each element to s or t, trying to make s and t as decreasing as possible.

This sounds similar to the problem of decomposing a sequence into two decreasing subsequences.

In fact, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to decompose a sequence is equal to the size of the longest increasing subsequence in that sequence.

But in this problem, I'm only allowed to use two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps not directly applicable.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I maintain two sequences s and t, and for each new element, I decide to place it in s or t based on some criteria.

I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to model this problem as a dynamic programming problem.

Let's define dp[i][j], where i is the current index in the array, and j represents the state of the last elements in s and t.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that the penalty is the number of times an element is followed by a larger one in s and t.

So, I need to minimize the total number of times b_i < b_{i+1} in s and t.

This is equivalent to minimizing the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

I need to distribute the elements into s and t in a way that minimizes this count.

An idea is to assign elements to s and t in a way that tries to minimize the number of times we have b_i < b_{i+1} in each sequence.

One way to do this is to assign elements to s or t based on the last elements of s and t.

Let me try to formalize this.

Maintain two variables: last_s and last_t, representing the last elements of s and t, respectively.

Initialize last_s and last_t to infinity.

Iterate through each element a_i in the array.

For each a_i, I have two choices: assign it to s or to t.

If a_i <= last_s, assign it to s, and set last_s = a_i.

Similarly, if a_i <= last_t, assign it to t, and set last_t = a_i.

If a_i > last_s and a_i > last_t, then I have to assign it to the sequence where it creates the least penalty.

In this case, assigning it to s would create one increasing pair in s, and assigning it to t would create one increasing pair in t.

Since both options increase the penalty by one, I can choose to assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element, to potentially allow more flexibility in the future.

Wait, but I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the number of increasing pairs in s and t as I build them.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I try to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs in s and t.

Wait, but I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

Another idea: since s and t are subsequences, their order must be maintained as in the original array.

So, when building s and t, I need to make sure that the order of elements in s and t respects their original order in a.

This complicates things.

Let me consider that s and t are built by choosing elements from a in order, without changing their relative order.

So, s and t are both subsequences of a, and every element of a is in exactly one of s or t.

I need to assign each element to s or t in a way that minimizes p(s) + p(t).

This seems like a classic optimization problem.

Perhaps I can model this using greedy algorithms.

Let me consider a greedy approach where, for each element, I choose to assign it to the sequence (s or t) where it causes the least increase in penalty.

If a_i <= last_s, assign it to s without increasing p(s).

Similarly, if a_i <= last_t, assign it to t without increasing p(t).

If a_i > last_s and a_i > last_t, then assigning it to s would increase p(s) by 1, and assigning it to t would increase p(t) by 1.

In this case, I can choose to assign it to the sequence with the smaller current penalty, to minimize the total penalty.

Wait, but both penalties would increase by 1, so it's the same.

Perhaps I should assign it to the sequence with the larger last element, to minimize the potential for future increasing pairs.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I maintain two separate decreasing subsequences, s and t.

I can use a greedy approach to assign each element to the sequence where it can be placed without breaking the decreasing order, and if that's not possible, assign it to the sequence that has the smallest last element among s and t.

This way, I'm trying to keep s and t as decreasing as possible.

At the end, the total penalty would be the sum of the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This seems similar to the standard greedy algorithm for assigning elements to chains in the decreasing order.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize s and t as empty lists.

Initialize last_s and last_t to infinity.

Initialize penalty to 0.

For each element a_i in the array:

if a_i <= last_s:

assign a_i to s

last_s = a_i

elif a_i <= last_t:

assign a_i to t

last_t = a_i

else:

assign a_i to the sequence with the smaller last element

increment penalty by 1

set last_s or last_t accordingly

Wait, but in this case, assigning to the sequence with the smaller last element minimizes the potential for future increasing pairs.

Wait, actually, if I assign to the sequence with the smaller last element, I might be allowing more elements to be assigned to that sequence without creating increasing pairs.

Wait, no.

If I assign to the sequence with the smaller last element, and a_i is larger than both last_s and last_t, then assigning to the sequence with the smaller last element might create an increasing pair, but it allows the other sequence to potentially accept more elements in the future.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think about it differently.

I recall that in the standard patience sorting algorithm for finding the longest increasing subsequence, we maintain a list of the smallest tail elements of the sequences.

Perhaps I can adapt that idea here.

In this problem, since I have two sequences, s and t, I can maintain two variables: last_s and last_t, representing the last elements of s and t.

Initialize last_s and last_t to infinity.

Initialize penalty to 0.

For each element a_i in the array:

if a_i <= last_s:

assign a_i to s

last_s = a_i

elif a_i <= last_t:

assign a_i to t

last_t = a_i

else:

assign a_i to the sequence with the smaller last element

increment penalty by 1

set last_s or last_t to a_i

This seems like a reasonable approach.

Let me test it with the first example:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Initialize last_s = inf, last_t = inf, penalty = 0

i=0, a_i=1

1 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=1

i=1, a_i=2

2 > 1 and 2 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 > 1 and 3 > 2, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, which is last_s=1 < last_t=2, so assign to s, last_s=3, penalty +=1 (now penalty=1)

i=3, a_i=4

4 > 3 and 4 > 2, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, last_s=3 < last_t=2, so assign to s, last_s=4, penalty +=1 (now penalty=2)

i=4, a_i=5

5 > 4 and 5 > 2, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, last_s=4 < last_t=2, so assign to s, last_s=5, penalty +=1 (now penalty=3)

Total penalty = 3, which matches the first example.

Good.

Let's try the second example:

n=8

a=[8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=8

8 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=8

i=1, a_i=2

2 <=8, assign to s, last_s=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 >2 and 3 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=3

i=3, a_i=1

1 <=2, assign to s, last_s=1

i=4, a_i=1

1 <=1, assign to s, last_s=1

i=5, a_i=7

7 >1 and 7 >3, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, last_s=1 < last_t=3, so assign to s, last_s=7, penalty +=1 (now penalty=1)

i=6, a_i=4

4 >7 and 4 >3, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, last_s=7 > last_t=3, so assign to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1 (now penalty=2)

i=7, a_i=3

3 >7 and 3 >4, assign to s or t based on smaller last element, last_s=7 > last_t=4, so assign to t, last_t=4 >=3, assign to t, last_t=3

Wait, 3 <=4, so assign to t, last_t=3

No penalty increase.

Total penalty =2, but according to the example, it's 1.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't optimal.

Wait, in the second example, the minimal penalty is 1, but my approach gives 2.

So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that I can assign a_i to s or t based on some other criteria.

Perhaps I should assign a_i to the sequence where it causes the least increase in the penalty.

Wait, but in practice, that's what I'm doing.

Alternatively, maybe I should prioritize assigning to one sequence over the other.

Wait, perhaps I should always assign to the sequence that has the smallest last element.

Let me try that with the second example.

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=8

8 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=8

i=1, a_i=2

2 <=8, assign to s, last_s=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 >2 and 3 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=3

i=3, a_i=1

1 <=2, assign to s, last_s=1

i=4, a_i=1

1 <=1, assign to s, last_s=1

i=5, a_i=7

7 >1 and 7 >3, assign to s or t based on smallest last element, last_s=1 < last_t=3, assign to s, last_s=7, penalty +=1 (penalty=1)

i=6, a_i=4

4 >7 and 4 >3, assign to s or t based on smallest last element, last_s=7 > last_t=3, assign to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1 (penalty=2)

i=7, a_i=3

3 <=4, assign to t, last_t=3

Total penalty=2, which is higher than the minimal possible.

But in the example, they achieved a penalty of 1.

So, perhaps this approach isn't optimal.

Let me think about another strategy.

What if I try to maximize the number of decreasing sequences in s and t?

Wait, but I have to split into two sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as finding a decomposition of the sequence into two decreasing subsequences, and if that's not possible, then accept some increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of increasing pairs needed by decomposing the sequence into two sequences, each as decreasing as possible.

This seems related to the problem of sorting sequences into decreasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the patience sorting algorithm to find the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed, but since I'm limited to two subsequences, I need to calculate the minimal penalty accordingly.

In other words, if the sequence can be decomposed into two decreasing subsequences, the penalty is zero.

Otherwise, I need to account for the elements that cause increases in the sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of increasing pairs by calculating how far the sequence is from being decomposable into two decreasing subsequences.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal number of increasing pairs is equal to the number of elements that cannot be placed into two decreasing subsequences minus some value.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix one sequence, say s, to be a decreasing subsequence.

Then, assign the remaining elements to t.

In this case, t might have some increasing pairs.

But I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

This doesn't seem directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using dynamic programming, where dp[i][j] represents the minimal penalty for the first i elements, with j indicating which sequence the i-th element is assigned to.

But with n up to 2e5, this would be too slow.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that the total penalty is equal to the number of times an element is placed in a sequence where it is larger than the previous element in that sequence.

So, for each sequence, every time an element is larger than the previous one in that sequence, it contributes one to the penalty.

Therefore, to minimize the total penalty, I need to minimize the number of times elements increase within s and t.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of times elements decrease within s and t.

In other words, maximize the number of decreasing pairs in s and t.

Wait, no.

Actually, minimizing the number of increasing pairs is equivalent to maximizing the number of non-increasing pairs.

But I need to minimize the increasing pairs.

Let me think about it in terms of avoiding increasing pairs.

I need to assign elements to s and t in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs in each sequence.

One way to do this is to assign elements to s and t such that each sequence is as decreasing as possible.

So, I should try to assign elements to s and t in a way that maintains the decreasing order as much as possible.

This sounds similar to the standard patience sorting algorithm for finding the longest decreasing subsequence.

Wait, perhaps I can use a modified version of the patience sorting algorithm to assign elements to two decreasing sequences.

Let me recall how patience sorting works for finding the longest decreasing subsequence.

We maintain a list of the smallest tail elements of the sequences.

For each element, we place it into the leftmost sequence that can accommodate it (i.e., the sequence whose tail is greater than or equal to the current element).

If no such sequence exists, we start a new sequence.

In this problem, since I'm limited to two sequences, s and t, I can adapt this approach.

So, for each element a_i, I try to place it into the sequence (s or t) where the last element is greater than or equal to a_i.

If I can't place it into either sequence without creating an increasing pair, I have to choose one of the sequences to place it into, which will increase the penalty by one.

Wait, but in standard patience sorting, if you can't place the element into any existing sequence, you start a new sequence.

But in this problem, I'm only allowed to have two sequences, s and t.

So, if I try to place an element into one of the two sequences, and it can't be placed without creating an increasing pair, I have to choose one sequence to place it into, which will create an increasing pair.

In that case, I have to choose which sequence to place it into, and accept the penalty.

But in the standard patience sorting, you would start a new sequence, but since I'm limited to two sequences, I have to assign it to one of the existing sequences and accept the penalty.

So, perhaps I can model this as follows:

- Maintain two sequences s and t, initialized as empty.

- Initialize last_s and last_t to infinity.

- Initialize penalty to 0.

- For each element a_i in the array:

- If a_i <= last_s, assign it to s, set last_s = a_i.

- Else if a_i <= last_t, assign it to t, set last_t = a_i.

- Else, assign it to the sequence with the smallest last element, set the last element of that sequence to a_i, and increment penalty by 1.

This seems similar to the standard patience sorting algorithm, but with two sequences and penalizing when we have to place an element in a sequence where it creates an increasing pair.

In the first example, this approach gives the correct penalty of 3.

In the second example, let's see:

n=8

a=[8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=8

8 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=8

i=1, a_i=2

2 <=8, assign to s, last_s=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 >2 and 3 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=3

i=3, a_i=1

1 <=2, assign to s, last_s=1

i=4, a_i=1

1 <=1, assign to s, last_s=1

i=5, a_i=7

7 >1 and 7 >3, assign to the sequence with the smaller last element, which is last_s=1 < last_t=3, assign to s, last_s=7, penalty +=1 (penalty=1)

i=6, a_i=4

4 >7 and 4 >3, assign to the sequence with the smaller last element, last_s=7 > last_t=3, assign to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1 (penalty=2)

i=7, a_i=3

3 <=4, assign to t, last_t=3

Total penalty=2, but the example shows 1.

So, perhaps this approach isn't optimal.

Wait, maybe I need to choose which sequence to assign to based on different criteria.

Let me try assigning a_i to the sequence where it causes the least increase in the penalty.

In other words, assign it to the sequence where the last element is as large as possible, to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

Wait, but in practice, that's what I'm doing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assign it to the sequence that has the smallest last element among the sequences where a_i can be placed without creating an increasing pair.

Wait, but in the standard patience sorting, we assign to the leftmost sequence where we can place the element.

In this problem, since I have only two sequences, maybe I need to prioritize assigning to the sequence that allows maintaining the decreasing order as much as possible.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I try to maximize the number of elements placed without creating increasing pairs in s and t.

This would minimize the number of increasing pairs.

So, I should assign each element to the sequence where it can be placed without creating an increasing pair, if possible.

If not, assign it to the sequence where it causes the least harm, i.e., the sequence with the smallest last element.

Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier.

Perhaps I need to adjust how I handle the assignment when a_i > last_s and a_i > last_t.

In such cases, maybe I should assign it to the sequence with the larger last element, to maximize the potential for future elements to be placed without creating increasing pairs.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I did earlier.

Let me try this with the second example.

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=8

8 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=8

i=1, a_i=2

2 <=8, assign to s, last_s=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 >2 and 3 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=3

i=3, a_i=1

1 <=2, assign to s, last_s=1

i=4, a_i=1

1 <=1, assign to s, last_s=1

i=5, a_i=7

7 >1 and 7 >3, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is last_t=3, assign to t, last_t=7, penalty +=1 (penalty=1)

i=6, a_i=4

4 >7 and 4 >3, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is last_t=7, assign to t, last_t=7 >=4, assign to t, last_t=4, no penalty increase.

i=7, a_i=3

3 <=4, assign to t, last_t=3

Total penalty=1, which matches the example.

Great, this seems better.

So, the modified approach is:

- Maintain two sequences s and t, with last_s and last_t initialized to infinity.

- For each element a_i:

- If a_i <= last_s, assign to s, set last_s = a_i

- Else if a_i <= last_t, assign to t, set last_t = a_i

- Else, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, set the last element of that sequence to a_i, and increment penalty by 1.

This way, when I have to assign an element to a sequence where it creates an increasing pair, I choose the sequence with the larger last element, to potentially allow more flexibility in the future.

This seems to work for the second example.

Let me verify it with the first example.

n=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=1

1 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=1

i=1, a_i=2

2 >1 and 2 <= inf, assign to t, last_t=2

i=2, a_i=3

3 >1 and 3 >2, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is last_t=2, assign to t, last_t=3, penalty +=1 (penalty=1)

i=3, a_i=4

4 >1 and 4 >3, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is last_t=3, assign to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1 (penalty=2)

i=4, a_i=5

5 >1 and 5 >4, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is last_t=4, assign to t, last_t=5, penalty +=1 (penalty=3)

Total penalty=3, which matches the first example.

Good.

Let me check the third example.

n=5

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=3

3 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=3

i=1, a_i=3

3 <=3, assign to s, last_s=3

i=2, a_i=3

3 <=3, assign to s, last_s=3

i=3, a_i=3

3 <=3, assign to s, last_s=3

i=4, a_i=3

3 <=3, assign to s, last_s=3

Total penalty=0, which matches the example.

Perfect.

Another example:

n=1

a=[1]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=1

1 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=1

Total penalty=0, matches the example.

One more example:

n=2

a=[2,1]

Initialize last_s=inf, last_t=inf, penalty=0

i=0, a_i=2

2 <= inf, assign to s, last_s=2

i=1, a_i=1

1 <=2, assign to s, last_s=1

Total penalty=0, matches the example.

Seems like this approach works for the given examples.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Since n can be up to 2e5, I need an O(n log n) or O(n) solution.

In this approach, the main operations are comparisons and assignments, which are O(1) per element.

So, the total time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in code.

I need to keep track of last_s and last_t, initialized to infinity.

I can use float('inf') in Python.

Initialize penalty to 0.

Iterate through each element a_i in the array.

If a_i <= last_s, assign to s, set last_s = a_i

Else if a_i <= last_t, assign to t, set last_t = a_i

Else, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, set that last element to a_i, and increment penalty by 1.

In code, this can be implemented using variables last_s and last_t.

I don't need to store the actual sequences s and t, just their last elements, since I only care about the penalty, which is determined by the relative order of elements within s and t.

Therefore, I can proceed with this plan.

Now, considering that there are multiple test cases, and the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 2e5, I need to make sure that my code reads input efficiently.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.readline is faster than using input().

So, I should use sys.stdin to read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them accordingly.

Let me sketch a rough plan for the code:

- Read all input at once using sys.stdin.read()

- Split the input into tokens

- Use an index to track the current position in the token list

- For each test case:

- Read t, the number of test cases

- For each test case:

- Read n, the size of the array

- Read the array a as a list of integers

- Initialize last_s and last_t to float('inf')

- Initialize penalty to 0

- For each element a_i in a:

- If a_i <= last_s:

- Assign to s

- last_s = a_i

- Elif a_i <= last_t:

- Assign to t

- last_t = a_i

- Else:

- Assign to the sequence with the larger last element

- Set that last element to a_i

- Increment penalty by 1

- After processing all elements, print the penalty

Implementing this should solve the problem correctly.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1

As in the example, penalty should be 0.

Edge case 2: All elements are increasing

For example, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Penalty should be n-1, which is 4 in this case.

Wait, in the first example, it's 3 for
