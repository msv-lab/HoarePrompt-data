Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They're playing a game where they throw a ball to each other. The ball starts with player x, and there are m throws in total. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction, which can be clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown.

My task is to figure out which players could have the ball after m throws, based on the information about the throws. I need to consider that for some throws, the direction is known (clockwise or counterclockwise), and for others, it's unknown, meaning it could be either direction.

First, I need to understand how the ball moves in the circle. Since they're standing in a circle, the concept of distance is modular. For example, if there are 6 players and someone throws the ball 2 positions clockwise, player 1 would pass to player 3, player 2 to player 4, and so on. If they throw counterclockwise, player 1 would pass to player 5, player 2 to player 1, etc.

I need to keep track of all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw, considering the directions that are known and the ones that are unknown.

Let me think about how to model this. I can represent the circle as a list of players from 1 to n. But since player 1 comes after player n in the circle, I need to handle the modulo operation carefully.

In programming, indices usually start from 0, but players are numbered from 1 to n. So, I might need to adjust for that.

Wait, actually, in Python, sets can be used to keep track of possible positions, since the order doesn't matter, and I need to avoid duplicates.

Let me consider the initial position: the ball starts with player x. So, initially, the set of possible positions is just {x}.

Then, for each throw, I need to update this set based on the throw's distance and direction.

If the direction is '0', it's clockwise, so from any position q, the new position is (q + r) % n.

If the direction is '1', it's counterclockwise, so from any position q, the new position is (q - r) % n.

If the direction is '?', it could be either, so I need to consider both (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the clockwise distance from y1 to y2 is the number of transitions clockwise that need to be made to move from y1 to y2." Similarly for counterclockwise.

So, when throwing clockwise with distance r, the ball moves r positions clockwise.

Similarly for counterclockwise.

I need to make sure that the modulo operation handles the wrapping around correctly.

One thing to be careful about is that in Python, negative numbers modulo n still give a positive result, which is what we want. For example, (1 - 3) % 6 = (-2) % 6 = 4, which would correspond to player 5, since players are numbered from 1 to n.

Wait, hold on. If n=6, and q=1, r=3, then (1 + 3) % 6 = 4, which is player 4.

(1 - 3) % 6 = (-2) % 6 = 4, which again is player 4.

Wait, but in a circle of 6 players, throwing 3 clockwise from 1 goes to 4.

Throwing 3 counterclockwise from 1 should go to 7 - 3 = 4 (since 7 is equivalent to 1), but in this case, it seems the modulo operation gives the same result for both directions.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Actually, in a circle of n players numbered 1 to n, the positions can be thought of as indices 0 to n-1 if we adjust the numbering.

Let's try reindexing: let's consider player 1 as position 0, player 2 as position 1, ..., player n as position n-1.

Then, throwing r positions clockwise from position q would be (q + r) % n.

Throwing r positions counterclockwise from position q would be (q - r) % n.

At the end, I can convert back to the original numbering by adding 1 to each position.

This might make the calculations easier.

But in the given code, the player numbers are from 1 to n, and the code uses (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n directly, considering player 1 as 1, up to player n as n.

I need to check if this causes any issues.

Let's see: if n=6, and q=1, r=3, then (1 + 3) % 6 = 4, which corresponds to player 4.

(1 - 3) % 6 = (-2) % 6 = 4, again player 4.

But in reality, throwing 3 counterclockwise from player 1 should go to player 5, not player 4.

Wait, let's see: in a circle of 6 players:

- Player 1's clockwise neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6

- Player 1's counterclockwise neighbors: 6,5,4,3,2

So, throwing 3 clockwise from 1 goes to 4.

Throwing 3 counterclockwise from 1 goes to 5.

But according to the code, both (1 + 3) % 6 = 4 and (1 - 3) % 6 = 4, which corresponds to player 4, but in one case it should be player 5.

This seems incorrect.

I think the issue is that in Python, (a - b) % n works correctly for negative numbers, but I need to ensure that the result is interpreted correctly.

Wait, in Python, (1 - 3) % 6 = (-2) % 6 = 4, which should correspond to player 5, since player 1 is 1, player 2 is 2, ..., player 6 is 6.

Wait, no. If q=1, n=6, then (1 - 3) % 6 = 4, which should be player 5, because positions are 1 to 6.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indexing.

Let me try to think differently.

Let's consider that player 1 is position 1, player 2 is position 2, ..., player n is position n.

Then, to handle the modulo operation correctly, I need to make sure that when I do (q + r) % n, if it's 0, it should wrap around to n.

Similarly, (q - r) % n should also handle negative numbers properly.

In Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive remainder, so (q - r) % n should work correctly.

For example, with n=6, q=1, r=3:

(1 + 3) % 6 = 4, which is player 4.

(1 - 3) % 6 = (-2) % 6 = 4, which is player 5.

Wait, but in the circle, player 1's counterclockwise neighbor by 3 should be player 5.

So, (1 - 3) % 6 = 4, which corresponds to player 5.

Wait, but in the code, it's adding and subtracting r from q and taking modulo n, which seems to be working correctly.

Wait, maybe I was mistaken earlier.

Let me map the positions:

- Player 1: position 1

- Player 2: position 2

- ...

- Player 6: position 6

Throwing clockwise by r: q + r, then take modulo n, but considering that player n +1 is player 1, etc.

Wait, in general, for q + r, if q + r > n, then it wraps around.

So, (q + r) % n, but in Python, if q + r = 7 and n=6, then 7 % 6 =1, which corresponds to player 1.

Similarly, (q - r) % n handles negative values correctly.

So, it seems the code is handling the positions correctly.

Now, in the code, there's a line:

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

This is because when q - r is 0, it should correspond to player n.

For example, if q=3, r=3, then (3 - 3) % 6 =0, which corresponds to player 6.

So, the code adjusts by replacing 0 with n.

That makes sense.

Now, the main part is that for each throw, depending on the direction c, it updates the set of possible positions.

If c is '0', only clockwise is possible.

If c is '1', only counterclockwise.

If c is '?', both directions are possible.

So, for each throw, for each current possible position q, it adds (q + r) % n if direction is '0' or '?', and (q - r) % n if direction is '1' or '?'.

Then, it updates the set of possible positions.

After all throws, it prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

This seems correct.

Let me check with an example.

Take the first example in the input:

6 3 2

2 ?

2 ?

2 ?

So, n=6, m=3, x=2.

Initial ans = {2}

First throw, r=2, c='?'

So, for q=2, possible new positions: (2+2)%6=4 and (2-2)%6=0, which corresponds to player 6.

So, ans = {4,6}

Second throw, r=2, c='?'

For q=4: (4+2)%6=0 (player 6), (4-2)%6=2

For q=6: (6+2)%6=2, (6-2)%6=4

So, ans = {2,4,6}

Third throw, r=2, c='?'

For q=2: (2+2)%6=4, (2-2)%6=0 (player 6)

For q=4: (4+2)%6=0 (player 6), (4-2)%6=2

For q=6: (6+2)%6=2, (6-2)%6=4

So, ans = {2,4,6}

Which matches the first output in the example.

Another example:

12 1 2

3 1

So, n=12, m=1, x=2

First throw, r=3, c='1' (counterclockwise)

So, q=2, new position: (2 - 3) % 12 = (-1) % 12 =11

ans = {11}

Which matches the second output in the example.

One more example:

10 7 4

2 ?

9 1

4 ?

7 0

2 0

8 1

5 ?

I need to simulate this step by step.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when c='?', both directions are possible, so from q=10: (10 +5)%10=5 and (10 -5)%10=5, but 5 is already included.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that q=10 -5=5, and q=10 +5=15%10=5

So, no new players.

But according to the sample output, player 9 should be included, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps in the sixth throw, from q=10: (10 -8)%10=2

But maybe there's another way to reach q=9.

Wait, perhaps in the fifth throw, from q=10: (10 +2)%10=0 ->10, but maybe I missed something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that q=10 +2=12%10=2, but in the fifth throw, c='0' (clockwise), so only q + r.

Wait, no, q + r =10 +2=12%10=0 ->10

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the way I handle q + r and q - r.

Wait, maybe the issue is with handling q - r correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the modulo operation for q - r.

Wait, in Python, negative modulo positive works as expected, so (q - r) % n should be fine.

I'm stuck here. Maybe the code is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample output.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, player numbers are from 1 to n, and the operations are correctly handled as (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, with adjusting 0 to n.

But according to my calculations, for the third test case, the final answer should be {1,3,5,7}, but the sample output shows {3,5,7,9}.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the operations.

So, ans = {1,3,5,7}

But sample output is 3,5,7,9

Wait, maybe I need to consider that q=9 was in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that q=9 was in ans before, but was removed in some steps.

But according to my calculations, after the third throw, ans={1,3,5,7,9}, but then in the fourth throw, only q=1,3,5,7,9 are considered, and their clockwise throws lead to q=8,10,2,4,6.

Wait, no, wait, in the fourth throw, r=7, c='0' (clockwise)

From q=1: 8

From q=3: 10

From q=5: 12%10=2

From q=7: 14%10=4

From q=9: 16%10=6

So, ans={2,4,6,8,10}

Then, fifth throw, r=2, c='0' (clockwise)

From q=2: 4

From q=4: 6

From q=6: 8

From q=8: 10

From q=10: 10

ans={4,6,8,10}

Sixth throw, r=8, c='1' (counterclockwise)

From q=4: (4-8)%10=6

From q=6: (6-8)%10=8

From q=8: (8-8)%10=0 ->10

From q=10: (10-8)%10=2

ans={2,6,8,10}

Seventh throw, r=5, c='?' (unknown direction)

From q=2: 7,7

From q=6: 1,1

From q=8: 3,3

From q=10: 5,5

ans={1,3,5,7}

But sample output is 3,5,7,9

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial ans after third throw should include q=9.

Wait, in the third throw, from q=9: (9 +4)%10=3, (9 -4)%10=5

So, from q=9: 3 and 5

But q=9 is already in the set, but 3 and 5 are already in the set.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that q=9 is included in ans after third throw.

Wait, in the third throw, starting from ans={3,7}, throwing r=4, c='?'

From q=3: 7,9

From q=7: 1,3

So, ans={1,3,7,9}

Then, fourth throw, r=7, c='0' (clockwise)

From q=1: 8

From q=3: 10

From q=7: 4

From q=9: 6

ans={4,6,8,10}

Fifth throw, r=2, c='0' (clockwise)

From q=4: 6

From q=6: 8

From q=8: 10

From q=10: 10

ans={6,8,10}

Sixth throw, r=8, c='1' (counterclockwise)

From q=6: 8

From q=8: 10

From q=10: 2

ans={2,8,10}

Seventh throw, r=5, c='?' (unknown direction)

From q=2: 7,7

From q=8: 3,3

From q=10: 5,5

ans={3,5,7}

But sample output is 3,5,7,9

I'm not sure where player 9 comes from.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that q=10 -5=5, but in the seventh throw, q=10 only leads to q=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that q=9 was in earlier steps and should be included.

But according to my calculations, it's not.

Maybe the code is incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when c='?', it's either direction, so I need to consider both possibilities.

Wait, in the seventh throw, from q=10: (10 +5)%10=5, (10 -5)%10=5
