Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

The task is to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints together. And it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line has an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line is an integer n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each describing a constraint with two integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and x is the value.

The output should be, for each test case, a single integer representing the number of possible k values that satisfy all the constraints.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

2

1 5

2 4

...

Output:

7

0

90

0

0

800000000

In the first test case, with constraints:

k >= 3

k <= 10

k != 1

k != 5

The possible k values are 3,4,6,7,8,9,10, which are 7 values.

In the second test case:

k >= 5

k <= 4

which is impossible, so 0.

So, the approach should be:

1. Find the overall range of k by considering all the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

2. Then, exclude the values specified by "not equal to" constraints within that range.

To implement this:

- Track the lower bound by taking the maximum of all "greater than or equal to" values.

- Track the upper bound by taking the minimum of all "less than or equal to" values.

- Then, the total possible k values without considering "not equal to" constraints would be upper bound - lower bound + 1, provided the upper bound is greater than or equal to the lower bound.

- Then, subtract the number of "not equal to" values that fall within this range.

But, there's a catch: the "not equal to" constraints must be considered only if they fall within the range defined by the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

So, in the first example:

- Lower bound: max of [3] (from 1 3) = 3

- Upper bound: min of [10] (from 2 10) = 10

- "Not equal to" values: [1,5] but only 5 is within the range [3,10], so we subtract 1 for k=5.

- Total possible k: 10 - 3 + 1 = 8, minus 1 for k=5, so 7.

In the second example:

- Lower bound: max of [5] = 5

- Upper bound: min of [4] = 4

- Since lower bound > upper bound, no possible k, so 0.

Seems straightforward. Now, considering the constraints:

- t <= 500

- n <= 100 for each test case

- x can be up to 10^9

- No two constraints are the same

- At least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint per test case

So, efficiency shouldn't be a major issue since n is small (100), and t is 500, so total operations are manageable.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import math

import re

n = func_1()

ans = []

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for i in range(n):

ans.append(func_7())

for i in ans:

print(i)

def func_1(isOne=False):

if not isOne:

return int(input())

else:

return 1

def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):

line = input()

if space:

items = line.split()

else:

items = list(line)

if to_int:

return [int(i) for i in items]

else:

return items

def func_3(arr, sym):

string = ''

for i in arr:

string += str(i) + sym

return string

def func_4(string, substring):

indices = []

index = string.find(substring)

while index != -1:

indices.append(index)

index = string.find(substring, index + 1)

return indices

def func_5(arr, element):

return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]

def func_6(arr, index, value):

for subArray in arr:

if subArray[index] == value:

return subArray

return None

def func_7():

n = int(input())

start = -1

end = 1000000000.0

num = []

for i in range(n):

(t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

if t == 1:

if start < v:

start = v

if t == 2:

if end > v:

end = v

if t == 3:

num.append(v)

count_num = 0

for i in num:

if i < start or i > end:

continue

else:

count_num += 1

if start > end:

return 0

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

So, this program defines several functions, but only func_1 and func_7 are relevant for this problem.

func_1 reads the number of test cases, and func_7 handles each test case.

In func_7:

- It reads n, the number of constraints.

- Initializes start to -1 (lower bound) and end to 1000000000.0 (upper bound).

- num is a list to store the values from type 3 constraints.

- It reads each of the n constraints:

- If t == 1, it updates start to be the maximum of current start and v.

- If t == 2, it updates end to be the minimum of current end and v.

- If t == 3, it appends v to num.

- Then, it counts how many values in num fall within the range [start, end].

- If start > end, it returns 0.

- Otherwise, it returns (end - start + 1) - count_num, but only if end - start + 1 >= count_num, else 0.

First, there's an issue with the initialization of start and end.

- start is initialized to -1, which is fine if all type 1 constraints are greater than -1, but according to the problem, x can be as low as 1, so it's not necessarily incorrect.

- end is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is a float. But since x are integers, it's better to use an integer value, like 1000000000.

- However, the problem states that x can be up to 10^9, which is fine for integer representation in Python.

- But more importantly, the problem guarantees that there is at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, so start and end will be updated accordingly.

- The program then reads each constraint and updates start and end accordingly.

- For type 3 constraints, it collects the x values in the list num.

- Then, it counts how many values in num are within the range [start, end].

- Finally, if start > end, it returns 0, else it returns (end - start + 1) - count_num, but only if end - start + 1 >= count_num, else 0.

Wait, the last part is a bit confusing.

In the return statement:

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

This seems unnecessary because if start > end, it already returns 0.

But, if start <= end, and end - start + 1 < count_num, it returns 0, else it returns end - start + 1 - count_num.

Is this necessary?

Let's consider:

- total possible k without considering type 3: end - start + 1

- number of k to exclude: count_num

- so, the result should be max(0, end - start + 1 - count_num)

Which is equivalent to end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num, else 0.

So, the code is correct in this regard.

But, is there any scenario where end - start + 1 < count_num?

Considering that count_num is the number of type 3 constraints that fall within [start, end], and there can be up to n such constraints, which is up to 100, and end - start + 1 can be up to 10^9 - 1 + 1 = 10^9.

So, end - start + 1 >= count_num almost always, except in pathological cases where n is large and start and end are very close.

But given n <= 100, and x up to 10^9, it's highly unlikely that count_num would exceed end - start + 1.

But the code handles it correctly by returning 0 in such a case.

Now, let's check if the program handles all aspects correctly.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases, using func_1(), which simply reads an integer from input.

Then, for each test case, it calls func_7() and collects the answers in a list ans, and finally prints each answer.

Now, in func_7():

- It reads n.

- Initializes start = -1, end = 1000000000.0

- Reads n constraints:

- For t == 1: if start < v: start = v

- For t == 2: if end > v: end = v

- For t == 3: num.append(v)

- Then, counts how many values in num are within [start, end]

- If start > end: return 0

- Else: return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

Seems correct.

But, there is a potential issue with the initialization of start and end.

- start is initialized to -1, which is fine as long as there is at least one t==1 constraint, which is guaranteed.

- end is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is a float. However, in Python, when you perform end - start + 1, since end is a float and start is an integer, the result will be a float.

- But, in Python, subtracting integers from floats is fine, and the result will be a float.

- However, the problem requires outputting integers, and the program uses print(i), where i is the result of end - start + 1 - count_num or 0.

- In Python, if end is a float and start is an integer, end - start + 1 will be a float.

- Subtracting count_num (integer) from a float will result in a float.

- When printing a float that represents an integer, Python will output it with a decimal point, e.g., 7.0 instead of 7.

- However, in the sample output, the answers are integers without decimal points.

- This might not be a problem because in Python, printing a float that is a whole number will include the decimal point, but the problem likely accepts it as long as it's the correct numerical value.

- But to be precise, it's better to ensure that the output is an integer without a decimal point.

So, to fix this, we can make sure that end is an integer.

Change the initialization of end to 1000000000 instead of 1000000000.0.

Also, start is initialized to -1, which is fine.

Another thing to consider is that x can be as low as 1, but start is initialized to -1, which is lower than 1, so it will be updated by any t==1 constraint.

Now, let's verify with the first test case:

Input:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

Processing:

- n = 4

- start = -1

- end = 1000000000.0

- Read constraints:

- t=1, v=3: start = max(-1, 3) = 3

- t=2, v=10: end = min(1000000000.0, 10) = 10

- t=3, v=1: num = [1]

- t=3, v=5: num = [1,5]

- count_num: check how many in num are within [3,10]

- 1 < 3, so skip

- 5 is within [3,10], so count_num = 1

- start (3) <= end (10), so return 10 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

- n=2

- start=-1

- end=1000000000.0

- t=1, v=5: start = max(-1,5) = 5

- t=2, v=4: end = min(1000000000.0,4) = 4

- start (5) > end (4), so return 0, which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

- n=10

- start=-1

- end=1000000000.0

- Process constraints one by one:

- t=3, v=6: num=[6]

- t=3, v=7: num=[6,7]

- t=1, v=2: start = max(-1,2) = 2

- t=1, v=7: start = max(2,7) = 7

- t=3, v=100: num=[6,7,100]

- t=3, v=44: num=[6,7,100,44]

- t=2, v=100: end = min(1000000000.0,100) = 100

- t=2, v=98: end = min(100,98) = 98

- t=1, v=3: start = max(7,3) = 7

- t=3, v=99: num=[6,7,100,44,99]

- Now, count_num: how many in num are within [7,98]

- num: 6 <7, skip

- 7 ==7, count_num=1

- 100 >98, skip

- 44 is within [7,98], count_num=2

- 99 >98, skip

- So, count_num=2

- start (7) <= end (98), so return 98 - 7 + 1 - 2 = 92 -2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, considering edge cases:

- All constraints are t==1 and t==2, no t==3:

- In this case, num is empty, count_num=0, so return end - start +1

- If start > end, return 0

- If start <= end, return end - start +1

- Which is correct.

- All constraints are t==3:

- Wait, no, the problem states that there is at least one t==1 and one t==2, so this won't happen.

- Only one t==1 and one t==2, rest are t==3:

- Correctly handles by counting the excluded values within the range.

- start and end are updated correctly.

- Negative values: although the problem says x are positive integers, but in the constraints, x can be up to 10^9, but starting start at -1 is fine.

- Floating points: end is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is a float. But in Python, end - start +1 will be a float, and subtracting count_num will result in a float. But since the final answer should be an integer, it's better to ensure that end is an integer.

- To fix this, change end = 1000000000 instead of 1000000000.0

- Also, in Python, 1000000000.0 - start +1 will be a float, and subtracting count_num will keep it a float.

- But in the sample outputs, integers without decimals are expected. So, it's better to ensure that the result is an integer.

- In Python, if end is an integer, end - start +1 will be an integer, and subtracting count_num will also be an integer.

- So, it's better to initialize end = 1000000000

- Also, start = -1 is fine.

- Another thing: in the return statement, if end - start +1 < count_num, return 0, else return end - start +1 - count_num

- But in reality, end - start +1 can be less than count_num if many t==3 constraints fall within the range.

- However, since n <=100 and x up to 10^9, it's unlikely, but possible.

- The code handles it correctly by returning 0 in such cases.

- But in practice, count_num can't exceed end - start +1 because you can't have more exclusions than the total number of possible k.

- Wait, no, if multiple t==3 constraints exclude the same k, count_num could be larger than end - start +1.

- But in the problem, it's guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same, meaning no duplicate (a,x) pairs.

- So, for t==3, all x are unique.

- Therefore, count_num is the number of unique x values from t==3 that fall within [start, end].

- So, it's possible that count_num > end - start +1 if the range is small and many exclusions.

- For example:

n=100

t=1 x=1

t=2 x=100

t=3 x=1

t=3 x=2

...

t=3 x=100

Here, end - start +1 =100, count_num=100, so return 0, which is correct.

Another example:

n=3

t=1 x=5

t=2 x=5

t=3 x=5

- start=5, end=5

- count_num=1 (x=5 is within [5,5])

- so, 5-5+1 -1 =1-1=0, which is correct, since k cannot be 5.

Another example:

n=3

t=1 x=1

t=2 x=3

t=3 x=2

- start=1, end=3

- count_num=1 (only x=2 is within [1,3])

- so, 3-1+1 -1 =3 -1=2

- Possible k:1 and 3

- Correct, since k cannot be 2.

Seems correct.

Now, checking the code again:

def func_7():

n = int(input())

start = -1

end = 1000000000.0

num = []

for i in range(n):

(t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

if t == 1:

if start < v:

start = v

if t == 2:

if end > v:

end = v

if t == 3:

num.append(v)

count_num = 0

for i in num:

if i < start or i > end:

continue

else:

count_num += 1

if start > end:

return 0

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

As discussed, changing end = 1000000000.0 to end = 1000000000 to avoid float issues.

Also, ensuring that start and end are integers.

In Python, even if end is a float, end - start +1 will be a float, but since we're dealing with integers, it's better to keep end as an integer.

So, modifying the code:

def func_7():

n = int(input())

start = -1

end = 1000000000

num = []

for i in range(n):

(t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

if t == 1:

if start < v:

start = v

if t == 2:

if end > v:

end = v

if t == 3:

num.append(v)

count_num = 0

for i in num:

if i < start or i > end:

continue

else:

count_num += 1

if start > end:

return 0

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

This should fix the potential float issue.

Now, checking if there are any other potential errors.

- The problem guarantees that no two constraints are the exact same, so no duplicate (a,x) pairs.

- So, no need to handle duplicates.

- Also, guaranteed that there is at least one t==1 and one t==2 constraint, and that the answer is finite.

- So, no need to handle cases where start > end without the guarantee.

- The code handles the counting of excluded values correctly.

- The final return statement correctly calculates the number of possible k values.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a given set of constraints. The constraints include lower and upper bounds for \( k \), as well as specific values that \( k \) must not equal. 

### Approach

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the number of constraints, \( n \).
   - Read each constraint which can be of three types:
     - Type 1: \( k \) must be greater than or equal to a certain value \( x \).
     - Type 2: \( k \) must be less than or equal to a certain value \( x \).
     - Type 3: \( k \) must not equal a certain value \( x \).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - Track the lower bound by taking the maximum value from all Type 1 constraints.
   - Track the upper bound by taking the minimum value from all Type 2 constraints.
   - Collect all values from Type 3 constraints that fall within the range defined by the lower and upper bounds.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - Calculate the total number of possible \( k \) values within the range [lower bound, upper bound].
   - Subtract the count of Type 3 constraints that fall within this range to exclude invalid values.
   - Ensure the result is non-negative.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1

def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        elif t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        elif t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if start <= i <= end:
            count_num += 1
    if start > end:
        return 0
    possible_k = end - start + 1
    return possible_k - count_num if possible_k >= count_num else 0

t = func_1()
ans = []
for _ in range(t):
    ans.append(func_7())
for res in ans:
    print(res)
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` is initialized to -1 to handle any lower bound constraints.
   - `end` is initialized to a large value (1,000,000,000) to handle any upper bound constraints.
   - `num` is a list to store values from Type 3 constraints.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's Type 1, update `start` to the maximum value among all Type 1 constraints.
     - If it's Type 2, update `end` to the minimum value among all Type 2 constraints.
     - If it's Type 3, store the value in `num`.

3. **Counting Exclusions:**
   - Count how many values in `num` fall within the range [start, end].

4. **Calculating Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, no possible \( k \) values exist.
   - Otherwise, calculate the total possible \( k \) values as `end - start + 1`.
   - Subtract the count of excluded values to get the final count of valid \( k \) values.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for all constraints and compute the number of valid integers \( k \) efficiently.
