Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses. Let's consider an example to get a better grasp.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

So, cow positions are 1 to 6 with ratings as given.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: Position 1 (12) vs Position 2 (10). 12 > 10, so Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 (Position 1, 12) vs Position 3 (14). 14 > 12, so Position 3 wins.

- Match 3: Winner of Match 2 (Position 3, 14) vs Position 4 (11). 14 > 11, Position 3 wins.

- Match 4: Winner of Match 3 (Position 3, 14) vs Position 5 (8). 14 > 8, Position 3 wins.

- Match 5: Winner of Match 4 (Position 3, 14) vs Position 6 (3). 14 > 3, Position 3 wins.

So, in this case, my cow (Position 1) won only one match.

But the problem allows me to swap my cow with any other position exactly once to maximize its wins.

Let me think about swapping Position 1 with, say, Position 3.

So, new positions:

Position 1: 14

Position 2: 10

Position 3: 12

Position 4: 11

Position 5: 8

Position 6: 3

Tournament:

- Match 1: Position 1 (14) vs Position 2 (10). 14 > 10, Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Position 1 (14) vs Position 3 (12). 14 > 12, Position 1 wins.

- Match 3: Position 1 (14) vs Position 4 (11). 14 > 11, Position 1 wins.

- Match 4: Position 1 (14) vs Position 5 (8). 14 > 8, Position 1 wins.

- Match 5: Position 1 (14) vs Position 6 (3). 14 > 3, Position 1 wins.

So, my cow (original Position 1, now Position 1 with rating 14) wins all 5 matches.

Wait, but in the original problem, it says to swap my cow with another position, meaning swap Position 1 with Position 3, but in this case, my cow is still Position 1, just with a different rating.

No, wait. If I swap Position 1 with Position 3, my cow (original Position 1 with rating 12) goes to Position 3, and the cow with rating 14 goes to Position 1.

So, new positions:

Position 1: 12

Position 2: 10

Position 3: 14

Position 4: 11

Position 5: 8

Position 6: 3

Tournament:

- Match 1: Position 1 (12) vs Position 2 (10). 12 > 10, Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Position 1 (12) vs Position 3 (14). 14 > 12, Position 3 wins.

- Match 3: Position 3 (14) vs Position 4 (11). 14 > 11, Position 3 wins.

- Match 4: Position 3 (14) vs Position 5 (8). 14 > 8, Position 3 wins.

- Match 5: Position 3 (14) vs Position 6 (3). 14 > 3, Position 3 wins.

So, my cow (now at Position 3 with rating 12) doesn't win any matches after the first one where it loses to Position 3.

Wait, no. My cow is at Position 3 with rating 14, since I swapped Position 1 and Position 3.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Original positions:

Position 1: 12 (my cow)

Position 2: 10

Position 3: 14

Position 4: 11

Position 5: 8

Position 6: 3

If I swap Position 1 and Position 3:

New positions:

Position 1: 14

Position 2: 10

Position 3: 12 (my cow)

Position 4: 11

Position 5: 8

Position 6: 3

Tournament:

- Match 1: Position 1 (14) vs Position 2 (10). 14 > 10, Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Position 1 (14) vs Position 3 (12). 14 > 12, Position 1 wins.

- Match 3: Position 1 (14) vs Position 4 (11). 14 > 11, Position 1 wins.

- Match 4: Position 1 (14) vs Position 5 (8). 14 > 8, Position 1 wins.

- Match 5: Position 1 (14) vs Position 6 (3). 14 > 3, Position 1 wins.

So, my cow at Position 3 with rating 12 doesn't get to participate in any matches beyond the initial matches where it's defeated.

Wait, but in this scenario, my cow is at Position 3 with rating 12, and Position 1 has rating 14, which wins all matches.

So, my cow doesn't win any matches in this case.

But in the problem statement, for the first test case, it says it's optimal to do nothing, and my cow wins 1 match.

If I swap, my cow wins 0 matches.

So, doing nothing is better.

In the second test case:

n = 6, k = 5

ratings = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

So, my cow is at position 5 with rating 12.

The optimal swap is to swap position 5 with position 3 (rating 727).

New positions:

Position 1: 7

Position 2: 2

Position 3: 12 (my cow)

Position 4: 10

Position 5: 727

Position 6: 13

Tournament:

- Match 1: Position 1 (7) vs Position 2 (2). 7 > 2, Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Position 1 (7) vs Position 3 (12). 12 > 7, Position 3 wins.

- Match 3: Position 3 (12) vs Position 4 (10). 12 > 10, Position 3 wins.

- Match 4: Position 3 (12) vs Position 5 (727). 727 > 12, Position 5 wins.

- Match 5: Position 5 (727) vs Position 6 (13). 727 > 13, Position 5 wins.

So, my cow at Position 3 wins 2 matches.

Without swapping, original positions:

Position 1: 7

Position 2: 2

Position 3: 727

Position 4: 10

Position 5: 12

Position 6: 13

Tournament:

- Match 1: Position 1 (7) vs Position 2 (2). 7 > 2, Position 1 wins.

- Match 2: Position 1 (7) vs Position 3 (727). 727 > 7, Position 3 wins.

- Match 3: Position 3 (727) vs Position 4 (10). 727 > 10, Position 3 wins.

- Match 4: Position 3 (727) vs Position 5 (12). 727 > 12, Position 3 wins.

- Match 5: Position 3 (727) vs Position 6 (13). 727 > 13, Position 3 wins.

So, my cow at Position 5 never gets a chance to participate.

Hence, swapping to Position 3 allows my cow to win 2 matches, which is better than 0 if not swapping.

Third test case:

n = 2, k = 2

ratings = [1000000000, 1]

So, my cow is at Position 2 with rating 1.

Match 1: Position 1 (1000000000) vs Position 2 (1). 1000000000 > 1, Position 1 wins.

My cow loses in the first match.

If I swap Position 2 with Position 1:

Position 1: 1

Position 2: 1000000000

Match 1: Position 1 (1) vs Position 2 (1000000000). 1000000000 > 1, Position 2 wins.

My cow is at Position 2 with rating 1000000000 and wins 1 match.

But according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, but in this case, my cow wins 1 match after swapping.

But the sample output is 0, which contradicts my conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, the sample output is:

1

2

0

For the three test cases, respectively.

In the third test case, it's 0, but according to my reasoning, swapping allows my cow to win 1 match.

So, perhaps there's something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the problem is that after swapping, the tournament proceeds differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after swapping, the tournament proceeds with the new positions.

Wait, in the third test case, if I swap Position 1 and Position 2:

New positions:

Position 1: 1

Position 2: 1000000000

Match 1: Position 1 (1) vs Position 2 (1000000000). 1000000000 > 1, Position 2 wins.

So, my cow at Position 2 wins 1 match.

But the sample output is 0, which suggests that the maximum number of wins is 0.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"You can choose to swap your cow with another cow only once, or choose to do nothing."

"Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve."

In the third test case, even if I swap my cow to Position 1 with rating 1, it will lose to Position 2's cow with rating 1000000000 in the first match.

So, my cow wins 0 matches.

Without swapping, my cow is at Position 2 with rating 1, and it loses to Position 1's cow with rating 1000000000 in the first match.

Again, my cow wins 0 matches.

Hence, regardless of swapping or not, my cow cannot win any matches in the third test case.

So, the sample output is correct: 0.

I must have misread the ratings earlier.

Now, back to the problem.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of wins for my cow, either by swapping it to another position or keeping it in its original position.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses.

The tournament is a series of matches where:

- The first match is between Position 1 and Position 2.

- The winner of the previous match plays against the next cow in line (Position i+1).

This continues until all cows have been included in the matches.

My cow can win matches only if it keeps winning against the subsequent cows.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to position my cow such that it can win as many consecutive matches as possible.

Given that the cows' ratings are unique, the cow with the highest rating will win all matches if positioned correctly.

But, since I can only swap my cow with one other cow, I need to choose a position where my cow can win against the maximum number of subsequent cows.

Let me think about the two scenarios:

1. **Do nothing:** Keep my cow in its original position and see how many wins it can achieve.

2. **Swap my cow with another cow:** Choose a position to swap my cow to and see how many wins it can achieve from there.

I need to calculate the maximum number of wins in both scenarios and choose the higher one.

First, let's consider the "do nothing" scenario.

In this case, the tournament proceeds as described, and I need to track how many wins my cow achieves.

Now, for the "swap" scenario, I need to choose another position to swap my cow with.

But, since I can only swap once, I need to choose the best possible position to maximize my cow's wins.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament is essentially a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.

However, the matches are structured in a specific way: each match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

This is different from a standard single-elimination tournament where the pairing can be more arbitrary.

Given this structure, the number of wins my cow can achieve depends on how many consecutive cows it can defeat starting from its position.

Wait, actually, it's not exactly starting from its position, because the tournament starts with Position 1 vs Position 2, and then the winner plays Position 3, and so on.

So, my cow can only participate in the tournament if it is either in Position 1 or Position 2 initially, or if it is Position i+1 and the winner of the previous match is still winning.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to model the tournament in a way that I can determine the number of wins for my cow.

One way is to simulate the tournament and see how many matches my cow wins.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, simulating each tournament would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the tournament continues as long as the winner of the previous match can defeat the next cow.

So, the number of wins is the length of the winning streak starting from the initial match.

I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow, either in its original position or in a swapped position.

Let me consider that if I swap my cow with another cow, I'm effectively changing its position in the line.

I need to choose a position where my cow can participate in as many matches as possible and keep winning.

But how do I determine that?

Let me think about the tournament progression.

Suppose I have the sequence of cows in positions 1 to n.

The tournament starts with Position 1 vs Position 2.

The winner then plays Position 3, and so on, until all cows have been included.

My cow can only win matches if it is the winner of a match and proceeds to the next match.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to position my cow such that it can win against as many subsequent cows as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that come after a certain position.

But the ratings are unique, so there is a unique ordering based on ratings.

Let me consider that the higher-rated cow always wins.

So, if my cow has the highest rating among the first m cows, it can win m-1 matches.

But I need to be careful because the tournament structure is sequential.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many cows have lower ratings than my cow, starting from its position, and considering the path it takes through the tournament.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand its logic.

The program seems to handle t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the list s of ratings.

- Swap s[0] and s[k-1].

- Then, it seems to simulate some matches and count the number of wins.

- Then, it swaps back s[0] and s[k-1].

- Then, it does some other operations and counts another number of wins.

- Finally, it prints the maximum of the two counts.

Wait, this seems to correspond to two scenarios:

1. Swapping my cow to Position 1.

2. Keeping my cow in its original position.

But according to the problem, I can swap my cow with any position, not just Position 1.

Wait, in the code, it swaps s[0] and s[k-1], which is Position 1 and Position k.

Then, it counts the number of wins in this scenario.

Then, it swaps back s[0] and s[k-1].

Then, it seems to choose another position p and swap s[p] with s[k-1], but it's not clear.

This seems flawed because the problem allows swapping my cow with any other cow, not just Position 1.

Moreover, the logic inside the function seems incorrect because it doesn't properly simulate the tournament.

Let me try to think of a correct approach.

First, consider the "do nothing" scenario.

Simulate the tournament without any swap and count how many matches my cow wins.

Then, consider swapping my cow with another cow and simulate the tournament again, choosing the swap that maximizes my cow's wins.

Finally, choose the maximum between the "do nothing" and the "swap" scenarios.

But simulating the tournament for each possible swap is too slow.

I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of wins.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the cows are effectively being compared in a specific order, and the one with the highest rating among the first m cows will win all matches until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but the ratings are unique, so there is a unique cow with the highest rating.

If I can position my cow to have the highest rating among the cows it faces, it can win all those matches.

But I can only swap my cow with one other cow.

So, I need to choose a position where my cow has the highest rating among the cows it will face in the tournament.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the tournament can be modeled as a sequence of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match against the next cow.

So, it's like a linked list where each match depends on the previous one.

This is similar to a tournament bracket.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a binary tree, where each match is a node, and the winner proceeds to the next match.

But with the given match structure, it's more like a sequential tournament where the winner of each match plays the next cow in line.

Given that, perhaps I can find the maximum number of consecutive cows my cow can defeat, starting from a certain position.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow and see how many wins it can achieve from there.

If I place my cow at position p, then it will participate in the tournament starting from position p, and it will keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the next cow it faces.

So, from position p, my cow can win against all cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than my cow that are after position p, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but the tournament structure is such that the winner of each match proceeds to the next match against the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will only participate in the tournament if it is the winner of the previous match.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a better way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the cows are being compared in order, and the one with the highest rating among the first m cows will win all matches until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum number of cows with lower ratings than my cow, starting from a certain position, without encountering a cow with a higher rating.

This seems similar to finding the length of the longest suffix of cows with lower ratings than my cow, starting from a certain position, without any higher-rated
