Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. For any chosen i, the operation affects three consecutive elements: the one before, the one at i, and the one after. It subtracts 1 from the previous and next elements and subtracts 2 from the element at i. So, it's like spreading out some value from the center to its neighbors.

I need to think about how these operations can be used to zero out the entire array. Since the operations can be applied any number of times, and to any eligible i, I should consider what constraints this imposes on the array.

One way to approach this is to consider the operations as a system of equations. Each operation corresponds to subtracting certain amounts from specific positions, and I need to see if I can reach all zeros from the initial state.

Let's consider the array indices from 1 to n. For each operation at index i, the changes are:

- a[i-1] -= 1

- a[i] -= 2

- a[i+1] -= 1

If I apply this operation multiple times, say k times at index i, then:

- a[i-1] -= k

- a[i] -= 2k

- a[i+1] -= k

So, effectively, each operation at i contributes -k to a[i-1], -2k to a[i], and -k to a[i+1].

Now, to make all elements zero, for each position j, the total subtraction from a[j] should equal its initial value.

Let's think about this in terms of linear algebra. If I have n variables (the initial values), and each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific combination from these variables, I need to see if the system of equations has a solution where all a[j] become zero.

However, since n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me try to find a pattern or a way to sequentially determine the operations.

Starting from the left, consider the first element a[1]. Since operations can only affect a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1] for i from 2 to n-1, the first element can only be affected by operations at i=2 (which affects a[1], a[2], a[3]).

So, to zero out a[1], I need to perform operations at i=2 such that a[1] -= k, where k is the number of operations at i=2. Since a[1] should become zero, k should be equal to a[1].

But wait, operations at i=2 also affect a[2] and a[3]. Specifically, a[2] -= 2k and a[3] -= k.

So, if I set k = a[1], then a[1] becomes zero, a[2] becomes a[2] - 2a[1], and a[3] becomes a[3] - a[1].

Now, moving to a[2], after the operations at i=2, its new value is a[2] - 2a[1]. To zero out a[2], I need to perform operations at i=3, which will affect a[2], a[3], and a[4].

Operations at i=3: a[2] -= 1, a[3] -= 2, a[4] -= 1 per operation.

Wait, but operations at i=3 affect a[2], a[3], and a[4], but a[2] is already modified by the operations at i=2.

So, perhaps I can sequentially determine the number of operations at each i, starting from i=2 to i=n-1.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let op[i] be the number of operations performed at index i.

Then, for each position j:

- If j=1: a[j] -= op[2]

- If j=2: a[j] -= 2*op[2] + op[3]

- If j=3: a[j] -= op[2] + 2*op[3] + op[4]

- ...

- If j=i: a[j] -= op[i-1] + 2*op[i] + op[i+1]

- ...

- If j=n-2: a[j] -= op[n-3] + 2*op[n-2] + op[n-1]

- If j=n-1: a[j] -= op[n-2] + 2*op[n-1]

- If j=n: a[j] -= op[n-1]

Wait, but in the problem, operations are only allowed for i from 2 to n-1, so op[i] for i from 2 to n-1.

But actually, in the code provided, it's implemented differently. Let's look at the given program.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

Then, it iterates from i=0 to n-3 (since n-2 is the last valid i for operations).

For each i from 0 to n-3, it sets opNum = a[i], which seems to be the number of operations to apply at this position.

Then, it updates a[i], a[i+1], and a[i+2] by subtracting opNum, 2*opNum, and opNum respectively.

After these operations, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait, but in the problem, n starts from 1 to n, while in the code, the array is indexed from 0 to n-1 in Python.

So, a[0] corresponds to a_1, a[1] to a_2, and so on.

Let me see if this approach makes sense.

Essentially, for each i from 1 to n-2 (1-indexed, or 0 to n-3 in Python), it determines the number of operations opNum = a[i-1] (since a[i-1] is a[i-1] in 1-indexed terms), and applies opNum operations at position i.

Then, it checks if the last two elements (a[n-1] and a[n-2]) are zero after these operations.

Is this correct?

Let me try with the first example:

n=5, a=[1,3,5,5,2]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=1, so opNum=1

Update:

a[0] -=1 → 0

a[1] -=2 →3-2=1

a[2] -=1 →5-1=4

Now, a=[0,1,4,5,2]

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[1] -=1 →0

a[2] -=2 →4-2=2

a[3] -=1 →5-1=4

Now, a=[0,0,2,4,2]

Step 3: i=2, a[2]=2, opNum=2

Update:

a[2] -=2 →0

a[3] -=4 →4-4=0

a[4] -=2 →2-2=0

Now, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

So, it works for this case.

Let's see another example where the answer is "NO".

n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=2, opNum=2

Update:

a[0]-=2 →0

a[1]-=4 →4-4=0

a[2]-=2 →4-2=2

Now, a=[0,0,2,5,1]

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=0, opNum=0

No change.

Step 3: i=2, a[2]=2, opNum=2

Update:

a[2]-=2 →0

a[3]-=4 →5-4=1

a[4]-=2 →1-2=-1

Now, a=[0,0,0,1,-1]

The last two elements are not zero, so "NO".

Seems correct.

Another "YES" case:

n=5, a=[0,1,3,3,1]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=0, opNum=0

No change.

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[1]-=1 →0

a[2]-=2 →3-2=1

a[3]-=1 →3-1=2

Now, a=[0,0,1,2,1]

Step 3: i=2, a[2]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[2]-=1 →0

a[3]-=2 →2-2=0

a[4]-=1 →1-1=0

Now, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

"YES"

A "NO" case:

n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Already did this one, "NO"

Another "NO" case:

n=4, a=[1,2,7,2]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[0]-=1 →0

a[1]-=2 →2-2=0

a[2]-=1 →7-1=6

Now, a=[0,0,6,2]

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=0, opNum=0

No change.

Step 3: i=2, a[2]=6, opNum=6

Update:

a[2]-=6 →0

a[3]-=12 →2-12=-10

Now, a=[0,0,0,-10]

Last two elements are not zero, "NO"

Seems consistent.

So, the approach in the code seems to work for these examples.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let's think about what this approach is doing.

It's processing the array from left to right, at each step choosing the number of operations based on the current value of the leftmost unprocessed element, and applying those operations to reduce that element to zero, while updating the next two elements accordingly.

Then, after processing up to n-3 positions, it checks if the last two elements are zero.

I need to verify if this guarantees that the entire array can be zeroed out.

Let me consider the operations in terms of linear algebra.

Each operation at position i corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array:

For i from 2 to n-1:

- a[i-1] -=1

- a[i] -=2

- a[i+1] -=1

So, each operation is like subtracting a vector with -1 at i-1, -2 at i, and -1 at i+1.

The question is whether the initial array can be expressed as a linear combination of these operation vectors.

Since we're dealing with integer values and subtraction, and we want to reach zero, it's about solving a system of linear equations where the coefficients are the operation vectors, and the constants are the initial array values.

Given that, the approach in the code seems to be a form of Gaussian elimination, processing one variable at a time and eliminating its influence from the remaining equations.

In this specific structure, where each operation affects three consecutive elements, it's similar to solving a tridiagonal system.

The approach in the code processes the array from the start, fixing the number of operations at each position to zero out the current element, and propagating the changes to the next elements.

This is similar to forward substitution in solving tridiagonal matrices.

Then, after processing up to n-3, it checks if the last two elements are zero.

Wait, but in a tridiagonal system, you would typically have a specific method to solve it, ensuring that all equations are satisfied.

In this approach, by sequentially zeroing out elements from the start, it may not account for the constraints on the last few elements.

Let me think about a case where this approach might fail.

Suppose n=4, a=[1,2,1,0]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[0]-=1 →0

a[1]-=2 →2-2=0

a[2]-=1 →1-1=0

Now, a=[0,0,0,0]

"YES"

Another case: n=4, a=[1,2,2,1]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[0]-=1 →0

a[1]-=2 →2-2=0

a[2]-=1 →2-1=1

Now, a=[0,0,1,1]

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=0, opNum=0

No change.

Step 3: i=2, a[2]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[2]-=1 →0

a[3]-=2 →1-2=-1

Now, a=[0,0,0,-1]

Last two elements are not zero, "NO"

But is there a way to make all elements zero in this case?

Let's see.

Original array: [1,2,2,1]

Possible operations:

- Apply operation at i=2: a[1]-=1, a[2]-=2, a[3]-=1 → [0,0,0,1]

Now, a=[0,0,0,1]

Cannot make a[4]=0 without affecting others, since operations only affect up to i=3.

So, "NO" is correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[0,0,0,0]

Already zero, "YES"

Another test case: n=4, a=[1,0,1,0]

Step 1: i=0, a[0]=1, opNum=1

Update:

a[0]-=1 →0

a[1]-=2 →0-2=-2

a[2]-=1 →1-1=0

Now, a=[0,-2,0,0]

Step 2: i=1, a[1]=-2, opNum=-2

But opNum cannot be negative, as it represents the number of operations, which must be non-negative.

In the code, it sets opNum = a[i], but if a[i] is negative, it would set opNum to negative, which doesn't make sense in the context of operations.

In the code, it checks if a[i] < 0 during processing, and if so, it prints "NO" immediately.

In this case, a[1] becomes -2, which is negative, so it would print "NO", which is correct because you can't have negative operations.

So, the approach seems to handle this correctly.

Wait, but in the initial description, the problem states that any index i can be used zero or more times, implying that opNum is non-negative.

Hence, if at any point a[i] becomes negative before processing is complete, it's impossible to reach all zeros.

Therefore, the approach in the code seems valid.

It processes the array from left to right, zeroing out each element by choosing the necessary operations, and propagating the changes to the next elements.

If at any point an element becomes negative before it's processed, it's impossible to proceed, hence "NO".

Finally, it checks if the last two elements are zero after processing.

This seems to be a correct implementation of the approach.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make all elements of a given array zero by repeatedly performing a specific operation on the array. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and modifying the elements at positions \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Operation**: Each operation at index \( i \) subtracts 1 from \( a[i-1] \), 2 from \( a[i] \), and 1 from \( a[i+1] \). This can be thought of as applying a specific pattern of subtractions across three consecutive elements.

2. **Sequential Processing**: We process the array from the start to the end,逐个零ing out each element by choosing the appropriate number of operations at each step. For each position \( i \), we calculate how many operations are needed to make \( a[i] \) zero and apply those operations, which also affects the next two elements.

3. **Check for Negative Values**: If at any point an element becomes negative before we can process it, it means it's impossible to make all elements zero, and we should return "NO".

4. **Final Check**: After processing all but the last two elements, we check if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it means the entire array can be made zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    numTest = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        stop = False
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop:
            continue
        if a[-1] != 0 or a[-2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: We read all input data at once for efficiency, split it into a list, and then process it step by step.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, we read the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - We iterate through the array from the start to the third-to-last element. For each position \( i \), we calculate the number of operations needed to zero out \( a[i] \) and apply these operations to \( a[i] \), \( a[i+1] \), and \( a[i+2] \).
   - If at any point \( a[i] \) is negative, we immediately conclude that it's impossible to make all elements zero and output "NO".
   
3. **Final Check**: After processing, we check the last two elements of the array. If both are zero, we output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of zeroing out the array for each test case, adhering to the problem constraints and efficiently handling up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) elements in total.
