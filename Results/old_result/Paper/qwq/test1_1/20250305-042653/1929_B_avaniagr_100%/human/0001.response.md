Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The grid has 4n - 2 diagonals in total. I need to find the minimum number of cells he needs to color to satisfy this condition.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, diagonals can be either main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) or anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left). For an n x n grid, there are n main diagonals and n anti-diagonals, but actually, there are more because each diagonal that isn't on the main or anti-diagonal lines also counts.

Wait, the problem says "a square grid of size n x n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals." So, for an n x n grid, there are 4n - 2 diagonals in total. That makes sense because there are 2n - 1 diagonals sloping one way and 2n - 1 sloping the other way, but perhaps overlapping in the center for odd n.

But according to the problem, it's 4n - 2 in total, so maybe it's considering both main and anti-diagonals separately.

Let me think about a small n, say n=2.

For n=2:

- Main diagonals: from (1,1) to (2,2)

- Anti-diagonals: from (1,2) to (2,1)

- But there are also other diagonals like single cells that are their own diagonals, but I think the problem considers only the standard diagonals.

Wait, for n=2:

- Main diagonal: cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Anti-diagonal: cells (1,2) and (2,1)

- Other diagonals: single cells, but I think the problem considers only the diagonals that span from one edge to another.

Wait, according to the problem, for n=2, number of diagonals is 4*2 - 2 = 6, but in a 2x2 grid, there are only 2 main diagonals and 2 anti-diagonals, totaling 4, but perhaps they include all possible diagonals of different lengths.

Wait, maybe I need to confirm how many diagonals there are in an n x n grid.

In general, for an n x n grid, the number of diagonals going in one direction is 2n - 1, and similarly for the other direction, so total diagonals are 4n - 2.

Wait, perhaps it's 2*(2n - 1) = 4n - 2.

Okay, so for n=2, it should be 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Let me list them:

- Main diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Diagonals with only (1,2) and only (2,1), but wait, are single cells considered as diagonals? Probably not.

Wait, perhaps all lines of cells that are aligned diagonally are considered diagonals, regardless of their length.

So for n=2:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2) and (2,1)

- Diagonals with only (1,1)

- Diagonals with only (1,2)

- Diagonals with only (2,1)

- Diagonals with only (2,2)

Total 6 diagonals, which matches 4*2 - 2 = 6.

So, in general, for an n x n grid, there are 4n - 2 diagonals: some are longer diagonals spanning multiple cells, and some are single-cell diagonals.

Now, the problem is to color as few cells as possible such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to minimize the number of colored cells, given that I need to cover at least k diagonals.

This sounds like a set cover problem, where each cell covers some diagonals, and I need to select the minimal number of cells to cover at least k diagonals.

However, set cover is NP-hard, but given the constraints (n can be up to 1e8), it's impossible to solve it directly.

Therefore, there must be a smarter way to determine the minimal number of cells needed based on n and k.

Let me think about the properties of the grid and the diagonals.

First, in an n x n grid:

- There are 2n - 1 main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right)

- There are 2n - 1 anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left)

- Total diagonals: 4n - 2

Wait, but actually, the main diagonals and anti-diagonals together make 2*(2n - 1) = 4n - 2 diagonals, which matches the problem's statement.

So, each diagonal is a line of cells going either from top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left.

Each diagonal can be identified by its slope: positive for main diagonals and negative for anti-diagonals.

Now, each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Therefore, each cell is part of exactly two diagonals.

This is crucial because it means that coloring one cell covers two diagonals.

Moreover, the diagonals have different lengths: from 1 to n cells.

The main diagonal and anti-diagonal that pass through the center (if n is odd) are the longest, with n cells, while those near the corners are shorter.

Given that, I need to cover at least k diagonals with the minimal number of cells.

Let me consider the overlapping between diagonals via cells.

Since each cell covers exactly two diagonals, one main and one anti-diagonal, selecting a cell allows me to cover two diagonals at once.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I need to select cells such that the union of the diagonals they cover has at least k diagonals.

I need to minimize the number of cells, so I should maximize the number of new diagonals covered with each cell I select.

In other words, I should prefer cells that cover diagonals that are not yet covered.

But this sounds complicated to model directly.

Let me consider extreme cases.

Case 1: k = 1

I need to cover at least one diagonal. Since each cell covers two diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is 1, because one cell covers two diagonals, which is more than enough to cover at least one diagonal.

Wait, but if k=1, and I need to cover at least one diagonal, then coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is sufficient. So, minimal number of cells is 1.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for n=2, k=3, the output is 2.

Wait, n=2, k=3: 4n-2=6 diagonals. To cover at least 3 diagonals, it requires 2 cells.

Wait, but for k=1, it should be 1 cell, but in the sample input, there is no k=1 for n=2.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3, k=4, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there is a general formula.

Let me consider that each cell covers two diagonals, one main and one anti-diagonal.

Therefore, if I select m cells, they can cover up to 2m diagonals, but there might be overlaps if some diagonals are covered by multiple cells.

However, in the best case, where no two cells cover the same diagonals, m cells can cover 2m diagonals.

But in reality, there will be overlaps, so to cover k diagonals, m needs to be at least ceil(k / 2).

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=4, output is 2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3, k=3, output is 2, which is also ceil(3/2)=2.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but in the sample output, it's 6. Wait, maybe not exactly ceil(k/2).

Wait, n=3, k=10: 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals, output is 6.

But ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6. So, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, perhaps there are dependencies based on n.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs:

Sample Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Sample Output:

2

2

6

2

Looking at these, for n=3, k=4, output=2

n=3, k=3, output=2

n=3, k=10, output=6

n=3, k=9, output=5

n=4, k=7, output=4

n=7, k=11, output=6

n=2, k=3, output=2

Looking for patterns.

For n=3, k=4, output=2

k=3, output=2

k=9, output=5

k=10, output=6

For n=4, k=7, output=4

For n=7, k=11, output=6

For n=2, k=3, output=2

Wait, for n=3, k=10 (all diagonals), output=6

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, output=5

Wait, perhaps for covering all diagonals, it's equal to the number of diagonals minus something.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of diagonals that are not covered by the intersection of main and anti-diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

But let's think differently.

Suppose I need to cover all diagonals, i.e., k=4n-2.

In this case, I need to cover all diagonals, which means covering all main and anti-diagonals.

Since each cell covers exactly one main and one anti-diagonal, to cover all main and anti-diagonals, I need to select cells such that their coverage includes all main and anti-diagonals.

This sounds like finding a minimal set of cells that intersect all main and anti-diagonals.

In other words, it's similar to a hitting set problem, where I need to hit all main and anti-diagonals.

But hitting set is also NP-hard, but perhaps there is a pattern or formula for this specific case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the problem of placing queens on a chessboard to cover all diagonals.

Wait, but that's more complex.

Let me consider the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

For n=2:

- Diagonals: two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals.

- To cover all four diagonals, I need to select at least two cells, because each cell covers two diagonals, and there are four in total.

- So, ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3:

- Diagonals: 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals.

- To cover all 10 diagonals, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but in the sample, it's 6. So, perhaps it's not just ceil(k/2).

Wait, maybe for k up to a certain value, it's ceil(k/2), but for higher k, it's different.

Looking back at the sample:

n=3, k=4, output=2 (ceil(4/2)=2)

n=3, k=3, output=2 (ceil(3/2)=2)

n=3, k=9, output=5 (ceil(9/2)=5)

n=3, k=10, output=6 (ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6)

n=4, k=7, output=4 (ceil(7/2)=4)

n=7, k=11, output=6 (ceil(11/2)=6)

n=2, k=3, output=2 (ceil(3/2)=2)

So, in most cases, it's ceil(k/2), but for n=3, k=10, it's 6 instead of ceil(10/2)=5.

So, perhaps there is a constraint based on n.

Wait, for n=3, k=10 (all diagonals), output is 6, which is higher than ceil(10/2)=5.

Similarly, for n=4, k=14, perhaps the output would be higher than ceil(14/2)=7.

Wait, but for n=4, k=7, output is 4, which matches ceil(7/2)=4.

So, perhaps when k is up to a certain value, it's ceil(k/2), but when k is close to or equal to 4n-2, it's different.

Wait, perhaps there is a threshold where k exceeds a certain value, and then the formula changes.

Looking at n=3, k=9, output=5 (which is ceil(9/2)=5)

k=10, output=6 (which is higher than ceil(10/2)=5)

So, perhaps when k > some value, the formula changes.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

For n=3, to cover all 10 diagonals, it requires 6 cells.

Similarly, for n=4, to cover all 14 diagonals, it might require 8 cells.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, output=6.

For n=3, k=9, output=5.

For n=3, k=4, output=2.

For n=3, k=3, output=2.

So, perhaps for k up to 4n-4, it's ceil(k/2), and for k >= 4n-3, it's different.

Wait, for n=3, 4n-4=8, 4n-3=9, 4n-2=10.

So, for k <= 8, it's ceil(k/2).

For k=9, it's 5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For k=10, it's 6, which is higher than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, perhaps for k <= 4n-4, it's ceil(k/2), for k=4n-3, it's 2n-1, and for k=4n-2, it's 2n.

Looking at the sample:

n=3, k=10, output=6 (which is 2*3)

n=3, k=9, output=5 (which is 2*3 -1)

n=3, k=4, output=2 (which is ceil(4/2)=2)

n=3, k=3, output=2 (which is ceil(3/2)=2)

n=4, k=7, output=4 (ceil(7/2)=4)

n=7, k=11, output=6 (ceil(11/2)=6)

n=2, k=3, output=2 (ceil(3/2)=2)

So, it seems that for k <= 4n-4, the output is ceil(k/2).

For k=4n-3, output is 2n-1.

For k=4n-2, output is 2n.

Wait, for n=3:

- k=10 (4n-2=10), output=6 (2*3)

- k=9 (4n-3=9), output=5 (2*3 -1)

- k=8 (4n-4=8), output=4 (ceil(8/2)=4)

Wait, but in the sample, for k=10, output=6, which is 2n.

For k=9, output=5, which is 2n-1.

For k<=8, output is ceil(k/2).

Similarly, for n=4:

- 4n-4=12, 4n-3=13, 4n-2=14.

- For k=7, output=4 (ceil(7/2)=4)

- For k=13, output should be 2*4 -1=7

- For k=14, output should be 2*4=8

But in the sample, only k=7 is given for n=4, which matches ceil(7/2)=4.

Similarly, for n=7, k=11, output=6 (ceil(11/2)=6)

For n=7, k=26 (4*7-2=26), output should be 2*7=14.

So, generalizing:

- If k <= 4n - 4, then the minimal number of cells is ceil(k / 2)

- Else if k == 4n - 3, then the minimal number of cells is 2n - 1

- Else if k == 4n - 2, then the minimal number of cells is 2n

This seems to match all the sample inputs.

Wait, but for n=3, k=9, output=5, which is 2*3 -1=5.

Wait, 2*3 -1=5, yes.

Similarly, for n=3, k=10, output=6, which is 2*3=6.

For n=4, k=7, output=4, which is ceil(7/2)=4.

So, this seems to be the pattern.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed is:

- ceil(k / 2), if k <= 4n - 4

- 2n -1, if k == 4n -3

- 2n, if k == 4n -2

This makes sense because:

- For k up to 4n -4, you can cover k diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells, since each cell covers 2 diagonals.

- For k = 4n -3, you need 2n -1 cells.

- For k = 4n -2, you need 2n cells.

Wait, but why the special cases for k=4n-3 and k=4n-2?

Perhaps, to cover all diagonals, you need a specific number of cells that is higher than just ceil(k / 2).

In other words, there is a constraint in how you can cover the diagonals, especially when k is close to the maximum number of diagonals.

Therefore, the formula accounts for these special cases.

Hence, the program provided seems to implement this logic.

Looking at the program:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

if k <= 4 * n - 4:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

elif k == 4 * n - 3:

print(2 * n - 1)

elif k == 4 * n - 2:

print(2 * n)

It reads multiple test cases, reads n and k, and based on the value of k, prints the minimal number of cells needed.

It uses math.ceil(k / 2) when k <= 4n -4.

And for k=4n-3, it prints 2n-1, and for k=4n-2, it prints 2n.

This matches the pattern I observed from the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, this program seems to be correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
