Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vasya has an array `a` of length `n`, and he wants to add a permutation `p` of length `n` to it. That means for each index `i`, he'll compute `a_i + p_i`. After doing this for all elements, he wants to find out the maximum number of elements in the new array that are equal to the same number.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length `n` is a sequence containing each number from 1 to `n` exactly once, in any order. For example, for `n=3`, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], etc.

So, the task is to choose one such permutation `p`, add it to `a`, and then see how many elements in the resulting array are the same. I need to maximize this count.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I have multiple test cases, and for each test case, I read `n` and then the array `a` of `n` integers.

Looking at the given code, it seems to try to find some kind of mapping by calculating `m - a[i] + 1` for each element, where `m` is the maximum value in `a`. Then it sorts these values and collects unique values that are between 1 and `n` inclusive, and finally prints the count of these unique values.

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Let me think differently.

I need to maximize the number of elements that become equal after adding a permutation `p` to `a`.

So, for each element `a_i`, I can add `p_i` to it, where `p` is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

I need to choose `p` such that as many `a_i + p_i` as possible are equal.

Let me consider the differences between the elements.

Suppose I want all `a_i + p_i` to be equal to some target value `t`. Then, for each `i`, `p_i = t - a_i`.

But `p` has to be a permutation of [1,2,...,n], meaning all `p_i` are distinct integers from 1 to n.

So, for a chosen `t`, the `p_i` values must be distinct and within 1 to n.

Therefore, for a specific `t`, the number of valid `i` where `t - a_i` is between 1 and n, and all these `t - a_i` are distinct, will give me the number of elements that can be made equal to `t`.

I need to choose `t` such that this number is maximized.

So, perhaps I can iterate over possible `t` values and find the one that allows the maximum number of valid `p_i`.

But iterating over all possible `t` might be inefficient, especially since `a_i` can be up to 10^9.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the differences.

Let me define `d_i = t - a_i`, which should be a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

So, for each `i`, `d_i = t - a_i`, and `d_i` must be unique and between 1 and n.

Therefore, for a given `t`, the set `{t - a_1, t - a_2, ..., t - a_n}` must be exactly the set [1,2,...,n], possibly excluding some values if the set has duplicates or values out of range.

Wait, but I need to choose `p` such that `p_i = t - a_i`, and `p` is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

So, for a given `t`, `p_i = t - a_i` must be a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

But this seems too restrictive, because for a specific `t`, `t - a_i` might not be integers from 1 to n.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the relative differences.

Suppose I sort the array `a`.

Let's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_sorted = sorted(a)`.

Now, if I choose `p` to be a permutation that matches the sorted order, maybe I can make some elements equal.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the frequency of the sums.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of permutations.

A permutation `p` of [1,2,...,n] can be arranged in any order, but all values must be distinct and cover the range [1,n].

So, the sum `a_i + p_i` needs to be equal for as many `i` as possible.

Another way to look at it is to pair each `a_i` with a unique `p_i` such that `a_i + p_i` is the same.

This means that for those pairs, `p_i = t - a_i`, where `t` is the target sum.

So, for each `i`, `t = a_i + p_i`, and since `p_i` is unique and between 1 and n, `t` must be such that `a_i + p_i` is the same for multiple `i`s.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the frequency of `a_i + p_i` for all possible `p`.

But that seems too broad.

Let me consider that `p` is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], so the set of `p_i` is fixed.

Therefore, for a chosen `t`, the number of `i` where `t - a_i` is in [1,2,...,n] and all `t - a_i` are distinct will give me the count of elements that can be made equal to `t`.

So, to maximize this count, I need to find `t` such that as many `t - a_i` are distinct and within [1,n].

This sounds similar to finding how many `a_i` can have distinct `t - a_i` within [1,n].

Wait, maybe I can fix `p` and see what `t` can be achieved.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the problem in terms of matching.

I have to match each `a_i` with a unique `p_i` such that as many `a_i + p_i` as possible are equal.

Suppose I fix the target sum `t`, then for each `a_i`, `p_i` must be `t - a_i`, and these `p_i` must be distinct and within [1,n].

So, for a given `t`, the number of valid `i` is the number of unique `t - a_i` that are within [1,n].

But since `p` is a permutation, the `p_i` must be a subset of [1,2,...,n], with no duplicates.

Therefore, for a given `t`, the maximum number of elements that can be made equal to `t` is the size of the largest subset of `a` where the values `t - a_i` are distinct and within [1,n].

To maximize this over all `t`, I need to find the `t` that allows the largest such subset.

This seems like the way to go, but it's a bit tricky to implement efficiently, especially since `n` can be up to 2e5 and `a_i` up to 1e9.

I need an efficient way to find the best `t`.

Let me think about how to find the optimal `t`.

One approach is to iterate over all possible `t`, but that's not feasible due to the large range of `a_i`.

Alternatively, I can iterate over the possible `t - a_i` values, but again, `t` can be up to 1e9 + n.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the frequency of `a_i + p_i` for all possible `p_i`.

But that seems too slow.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the array `a`.

Then, I can try to assign the smallest available `p_i` to each `a_i` in sorted order to make `a_i + p_i` equal.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can look into the frequency of `a_i + p_i` for a specific `p`.

But again, `p` is a permutation, so each `p_i` is unique.

I need to maximize the frequency of a particular sum `s` among `a_i + p_i`.

This seems similar to assigning `p_i` to maximize the frequency of `s`.

But how do I choose `s`?

Let me consider that for a fixed `s`, the number of `i` where `p_i = s - a_i` and `p_i` is unique and within [1,n].

So, for each `s`, I can collect all `i` where `s - a_i` is between 1 and n, and then check if these `p_i` values are distinct.

But checking for distinctness for each `s` is too slow for large `n`.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the differences between `a_i` and `a_j`.

If I want `a_i + p_i = a_j + p_j`, then `p_j - p_i = a_i - a_j`.

Since `p` is a permutation, `p_j - p_i` can take values between `-n+1` and `n-1`, excluding zero.

Wait, but `p_i` are distinct, so `p_j - p_i` is non-zero.

This seems like a different way to look at it.

If I fix two indices `i` and `j`, then `p_j - p_i = a_i - a_j`.

So, for `p_j - p_i` to be equal to `a_i - a_j`, and given that `p` is a permutation, I need to ensure that these differences are feasible.

But this seems complicated to handle for large `n`.

Maybe I need to think about the problem in terms of graph theory or something similar, but that might be overkill.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Possible permutations p: [1,2] and [2,1]

Option 1: p = [1,2]

Then a becomes [1+1=2, 2+2=4], so elements are 2 and 4.

Maximum frequency is 1.

Option 2: p = [2,1]

Then a becomes [1+2=3, 2+1=3], so elements are both 3.

Maximum frequency is 2.

So, the answer is 2.

In this case, choosing p such that a_i + p_i are equal for both elements.

Another test case:

n = 4

a = [7,1,4,1]

Possible p: any permutation of [1,2,3,4]

Let's try to choose p to maximize the frequency of a particular sum.

One option: p = [2,3,1,4]

Then a becomes [7+2=9, 1+3=4, 4+1=5, 1+4=5], so elements are [9,4,5,5].

Maximum frequency is 2 for 5.

Is there a better choice of p?

Let's try p = [1,2,3,4]

Then a becomes [7+1=8, 1+2=3, 4+3=7, 1+4=5], so elements are [8,3,7,5], all distinct.

Not better.

Another p: [4,1,2,3]

Then a becomes [7+4=11, 1+1=2, 4+2=6, 1+3=4], which are [11,2,6,4], again all distinct.

Still not better than 2.

So, seems like 2 is the answer for this test case.

Looking at the code provided:

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Reads n

- Reads the array a

- Finds m, the maximum in a

- Computes new[i] = m - a[i] + 1 for each i

- Sorts new

- Collects unique values in new that are between 1 and n inclusive

- Prints the count of these unique values

Wait, is this the right approach?

In the first test case:

a = [1,2], m = 2

new = [2 - 1 + 1 = 2, 2 - 2 + 1 = 1], sorted is [1,2]

Unique values between 1 and 2 are 1 and 2, so count is 2, which matches the answer.

In the second test case:

a = [7,1,4,1], m = 7

new = [7-7+1=1, 7-1+1=7, 7-4+1=4, 7-1+1=7], sorted is [1,4,7,7]

Unique values between 1 and 4 (since n=4) are 1 and 4, count is 2, which matches the answer.

Wait, but in this case, m - a_i + 1 can be greater than n, but in the code, it checks if i <= n and i > 0.

So, in this example, 7 is greater than n=4, so it's excluded, correctly leaving only 1 and 4.

Another test case:

n = 3

a = [103,102,104]

m = 104

new = [104-103+1=2, 104-102+1=3, 104-104+1=1], sorted is [1,2,3]

Unique values between 1 and 3 are 1,2,3, count is 3, which should be the answer.

But is this correct?

Let's verify.

Choose p = [1,2,3]

Then a becomes [103+1=104, 102+2=104, 104+3=107], which has two 104 and one 107, so frequency is 2.

Wait, but the code says 3, but according to this, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different p.

Let's try p = [3,1,2]

Then a becomes [103+3=106, 102+1=103, 104+2=106], which has two 106 and one 103.

Frequency is still 2.

Another p: [2,3,1]

a becomes [103+2=105, 102+3=105, 104+1=105], all three are 105.

Frequency is 3.

So, it's possible to make all three elements equal.

So, the answer should be 3, and the code correctly outputs 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the code would output 3, but in reality, it's possible to make all three equal.

So, in this case, the code is correct.

Another test case:

n = 5

a = [1,101,1,100,1]

m = 101

new = [101-1+1=101, 101-101+1=1, 101-1+1=101, 101-100+1=2, 101-1+1=101]

sorted is [1,2,101,101,101]

Unique values between 1 and 5 are 1 and 2, count is 2.

But is this correct?

Let's see if we can make more than two elements equal.

Choose p = [1,2,3,4,5]

Then a becomes [1+1=2, 101+2=103, 1+3=4, 100+4=104, 1+5=6], all distinct.

Not good.

Choose p = [5,4,3,2,1]

Then a becomes [1+5=6, 101+4=105, 1+3=4, 100+2=102, 1+1=2], all distinct.

Not good.

Another try: p = [2,1,3,4,5]

a becomes [1+2=3, 101+1=102, 1+3=4, 100+4=104, 1+5=6], all distinct.

Not good.

Another try: p = [3,2,1,4,5]

a becomes [1+3=4, 101+2=103, 1+1=2, 100+4=104, 1+5=6], all distinct.

Still not good.

It seems hard to make more than one element equal.

Wait, maybe it's only possible to have at most two elements equal.

For example, choose p = [1,3,2,4,5]

Then a becomes [1+1=2, 101+3=104, 1+2=3, 100+4=104, 1+5=6], so two elements are 104.

Is this the maximum? It seems so.

Hence, the answer should be 2, which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n = 5

a = [1,10,100,1000,1]

m = 1000

new = [1000-1+1=1000, 1000-10+1=991, 1000-100+1=901, 1000-1000+1=1, 1000-1+1=1000]

sorted is [1,901,991,1000,1000]

Unique values between 1 and 5 are only 1, so count is 1.

Is this correct?

Let's see.

Can we make at least two elements equal?

Try p = [1,2,3,4,5]

a becomes [1+1=2, 10+2=12, 100+3=103, 1000+4=1004, 1+5=6], all distinct.

Try p = [5,4,3,2,1]

a becomes [1+5=6, 10+4=14, 100+3=103, 1000+2=1002, 1+1=2], all distinct.

Another try: p = [2,1,3,4,5]

a becomes [1+2=3, 10+1=11, 100+3=103, 1000+4=1004, 1+5=6], all distinct.

Seems like it's impossible to have more than one element equal. So, the answer is indeed 1.

Last test case in the sample input:

n = 3

a = [1000000000, 999999997, 999999999]

m = 1000000000

new = [1000000000 - 1000000000 +1 =1, 1000000000 - 999999997 +1 =4, 1000000000 - 999999999 +1=2]

sorted is [1,2,4]

Unique values between 1 and 3 are 1 and 2, count is 2.

Is this correct?

Let's try to choose p to make two elements equal.

Choose p = [1,2,3]

a becomes [1000000000 +1=1000000001, 999999997 +2=999999999, 999999999 +3=1000000002], which are all distinct.

Choose p = [3,1,2]

a becomes [1000000000 +3=1000000003, 999999997 +1=999999998, 999999999 +2=1000000001], all distinct.

Choose p = [2,3,1]

a becomes [1000000000 +2=1000000002, 999999997 +3=1000000000, 999999999 +1=1000000000], so two elements are 1000000000.

Hence, the answer should be 2, which matches the code's output.

So, in all the sample test cases, the code seems to produce the correct answer.

Now, let's try to understand why this approach works.

The code computes new[i] = m - a[i] +1, where m is the maximum in a.

Then, it collects unique new[i] values that are between 1 and n inclusive and outputs their count.

Why does this work?

Recall that we need to choose a permutation p such that a_i + p_i are equal for as many i as possible.

From earlier reasoning, for a chosen target sum t, p_i = t - a_i must be a permutation of [1,2,...,n], meaning all p_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for t, the number of valid i is the number of unique p_i = t - a_i that are within 1 to n.

The code seems to be finding the number of unique p_i values that are within 1 to n.

But wait, it's taking t = m +1, since new[i] = m - a[i] +1 = (m +1) - a[i].

So, it's choosing t = m +1.

Then, p_i = t - a_i = (m +1) - a_i.

This ensures that for the maximum a_i, p_i = (m +1) - m =1, and for the minimum a_i, p_i = (m +1) - min(a_i), which could be up to m +1 - min(a_i).

But we need p_i to be between 1 and n.

So, by choosing t = m +1, p_i = (m +1) - a_i, which is at least 1 (when a_i = m) and at most m +1 - min(a_i).

If m is large, m +1 - min(a_i) could be larger than n, which is fine, but only p_i between 1 and n are considered.

So, the code is collecting the p_i values that are between 1 and n, and counting the unique ones among them.

But in the third test case, where n=3, a=[103,102,104], m=104, t=105, p_i = 105 - a_i, which gives p_i = 2,3,1, all within 1 to 3, and unique, so count is 3, which matches the optimal answer.

In the fourth test case, n=5, a=[1,101,1,100,1], m=101, t=102, p_i = 102 - a_i, which gives p_i =101,1,101,2,101. Only p_i=1,2 are within 1 to 5 and unique, so count is 2.

This seems consistent.

So, the code chooses t = m +1, computes p_i = t - a_i for each i, collects those p_i that are between 1 and n, and counts the number of unique p_i in this range.

But wait, in the third test case, p_i were 2,3,1, all within 1 to 3, and unique, so count is 3, which matches the optimal.

In the fourth test case, p_i were 101,1,101,2,101. Only 1 and 2 are within 1 to 5, and they are unique, so count is 2, which matches the optimal.

So, it seems that choosing t = m +1 and computing p_i = t - a_i, then counting the unique p_i within 1 to n, gives the correct answer.

Is this always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=1, a=[5], m=5, t=6, p_i=1, which is within 1 to 1, so count is 1, which is correct.

Another example: n=4, a=[1,2,3,4], m=4, t=5, p_i=4,3,2,1, all within 1 to 4 and unique, so count is 4, which should be correct, as we can make all a_i + p_i =5.

Wait, but in this case, a_i + p_i =5 for all i, so frequency is 4, which is correct.

Hence, the code seems to work.

But is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,1,1], m=1, t=2, p_i=1,1,1. But p_i must be unique, which they are not. So, only p_i=1 is within 1 to 3, and it's repeated, but the code would count it only once, so count=1.

But in reality, since p_i must be unique, it's impossible to have all p_i=1. So, in this case, the maximum frequency is 1, which matches the code's output.

Another example: n=3, a=[1,2,3], m=3, t=4, p_i=3,2,1, all within 1 to 3 and unique, so count=3, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, a_i + p_i =4 for all i, so frequency is 3, which is correct.

Another example: n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], m=3, t=4, p_i=3,3,2,1. But p_i=3 is repeated, which is invalid. So, only unique p_i within 1 to 4 are 3,2,1, which are 3 values. So, the code would collect unique p_i=1,2,3, count=3, but in reality, since p_i=3 is repeated, only two elements can have p_i=3 and p_i=2 and p_i=1 for others, but with unique p_i, so maximum frequency is 2.

Wait, in this case, the code outputs 3, but the actual maximum frequency is 2.

So, this seems like a counterexample.

Wait, let's verify.

n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], m=3, t=4, p_i=[3,3,2,1]. But p_i must be unique, so we can't have two p_i=3.

So, we need to assign p_i uniquely.

Let's assign p_i=3,2,1,4.

Then a_i + p_i = 1+3=4, 1+2=3, 2+1=3, 3+4=7. So, elements are 4,3,3,7. Maximum frequency is 2 for 3.

Another assignment: p_i=4,3,2,1.

Then a_i + p_i =1+4=5,1+3=4,2+2=4,3+1=4. Elements are 5,4,4,4. Maximum frequency is 3 for 4.

Wait, this is better, frequency of 4 is 3.

So, in this case, the maximum frequency is 3, which matches the code's output.

Earlier, I thought it was 2, but actually, it's 3.

Hence, no contradiction.

Another example: n=4, a=[1,1,1,1], m=1, t=2, p_i=1,1,1,1. But p_i must be unique, which they are not.

So, we need to assign p_i uniquely.

Assign p_i=1,2,3,4.

Then a_i + p_i =1+1=2,1+2=3,1+3=4,1+4=5, all distinct, frequency=1.

Another assignment: p_i=4,3,2,1.

a_i + p_i=1+4=5,1+3=4,1+2=3,1+1=2, again all distinct.

So, maximum frequency is 1, which matches the code's output.

Because new=[1-1+1=1,1-1+1=1,1-1+1=1,1-1+1=1], sorted=[1,1,1,1], unique values between 1 and 4 are only 1, so count=1.

Seems correct.

Another example: n=2, a=[1,3], m=3, t=4, p_i=3,1.

Then a_i + p_i=4,4, frequency=2.

Another assignment: p_i=2,4.

But p_i must be between 1 and 2, so p_i=1,2.

Wait, n=2, permutation p=[1,2].

Then a_i + p_i=1+1=2,3+2=5, frequency=1.

Wait, but earlier with t=4, p_i=3,1, but p_i=3 is greater than n=2, which is invalid.

So, only p_i within 1 to 2 are allowed.

Hence, in this case, frequency is 1.

But according to the code:

m=3, new=[3-1+1=3,3-3+1=1], sorted=[1,3], unique values between 1 and 2 are 1, count=1, which matches.

Wait, but 3 is greater than n=2, so it's excluded.

Hence, only 1 is included.

So, the code seems correct.

I can't find a counterexample where the code fails.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
