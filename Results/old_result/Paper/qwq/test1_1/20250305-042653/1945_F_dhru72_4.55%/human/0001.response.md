Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Kirill wants to pick mushrooms to make an elixir. Each mushroom has a magic power, and there are n mushrooms in total. The strength of the elixir is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. So, if he picks k mushrooms, the strength is k times the smallest magic power among those k mushrooms.

But there's a catch. There's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic power of the mushrooms with indices p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes zero. He can't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir.

My task is to help Kirill pick mushrooms in such a way that he maximizes the elixir's strength, and among all options that give this maximum strength, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the permutation p. It's a sequence that defines which mushrooms lose their magic power when Kirill picks a certain number of mushrooms.

Let me think about this step by step.

Suppose Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero. So, the mushrooms that could be used in the elixir are those that are picked among the k mushrooms and are not among the first k-1 in the permutation p.

Wait, actually, the problem says that the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes zero, regardless of whether they are picked or not. So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have zero magic power and cannot be used in the elixir, even if they are among the k picked mushrooms.

So, the mushrooms that can be used in the elixir are those that are picked among the k mushrooms, excluding those at positions p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but if a mushroom is picked among the k mushrooms, but its position is among p_1 to p_{k-1}, its magic power becomes zero, so it can't be used. Therefore, the only mushrooms that can be used are those picked among the k mushrooms that are not in positions p_1 to p_{k-1}.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase it.

Let's say Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero. So, among the k mushrooms he picks, some of them might have their magic power zeroed out if their positions are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Therefore, the mushrooms that actually contribute to the elixir are those among the k picked mushrooms that are not in positions p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but if a mushroom is picked and its position is among p_1 to p_{k-1}, its magic power is zero, so it doesn't contribute to the elixir.

So, the elixir is made only from the mushrooms that are picked and whose positions are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms that contribute to the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms whose positions are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me consider that when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero. So, the mushrooms that can be used in the elixir are those that are picked among the remaining n - (k - 1) mushrooms.

Wait, no. Because p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are k-1 distinct positions.

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, k-1 mushrooms have their magic power set to zero, specifically those at positions p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, and the magic power of p_1 to p_{k-1} becomes zero, regardless of whether they are among the picked ones or not.

Wait, but if Kirill picks k mushrooms, and the magic power of p_1 to p_{k-1} becomes zero, then the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms excluding those whose positions are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but what if some of the picked mushrooms are among p_1 to p_{k-1}? Their magic power is zero, so they don't contribute to the elixir.

So, the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms contributing to the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I should look at an example.

Let's take the first example from the input:

n = 3

v = [9, 8, 14]

p = [3, 2, 1]

So, positions are 1, 2, 3.

If Kirill picks k = 1 mushroom, then the mushrooms at positions p_1 = 3 have their magic power set to zero.

So, mushroom 3 has magic power 14, but since k=1, only p_1=3 is zeroed out.

So, if he picks mushroom 1 or 2, mushroom 3 is zeroed out, but since he didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says that he will not use mushrooms with zero magic power in the elixir.

So, if he picks mushroom 1, mushroom 3 is zeroed out, but since he didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't matter.

So, the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms that are not zeroed out.

Wait, but in this case, only mushroom 3 is zeroed out, and he picked mushroom 1, which is not zeroed out, so the elixir strength is 1 * 9 = 9.

Similarly, if he picks mushroom 2, elixir strength is 1 * 8 = 8.

If he picks mushroom 3, mushroom 3 is picked, but mushroom 3 is zeroed out because p_1=3, so the elixir is made from nothing, strength is 0.

So, the maximum strength is 9 with k=1.

But in the sample output, for this case, it's 16 2.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the permutation p.

Wait, the permutation p indicates the order in which the magic powers are zeroed out.

Wait, the problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, in the first example, n=3, p=[3,2,1].

If k=1, then p_1=3 is zeroed out.

If k=2, then p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

If k=3, then p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1 are zeroed out.

So, when k=1, p_1=3 is zeroed out.

When k=2, p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

When k=3, all p_1 to p_3 are zeroed out.

Now, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among them, the ones whose positions are in p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, no. The problem says: "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Then, Kirill will make the elixir using the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, and p_1 to p_{k-1} are specific positions.

So, for k=1, p_1=3 is zeroed out.

For k=2, p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

For k=3, p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1 are zeroed out.

Now, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among them, the ones that are in positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

So, for k=1:

- p_1=3 is zeroed out.

- Kirill picks one mushroom:

- If he picks mushroom 1: mushroom 3 is zeroed out, but he didn't pick mushroom 3, so his elixir is made from mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushroom 2: mushroom 3 is zeroed out, but he picked mushroom 2 with v=8. Strength=1*8=8.

- If he picks mushroom 3: mushroom 3 is zeroed out, so he picks mushroom 3 with v=0. Strength=1*0=0.

So, the maximum strength is 9 with k=1.

But in the sample output, for this case, it's 16 2.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the elixir is made from all picked mushrooms excluding those whose positions are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for k=1:

- p_1=3 is zeroed out.

- If he picks mushroom 1: mushroom 3 is zeroed out, but since he picked only mushroom 1, and mushroom 3 was zeroed out, but he didn't pick mushroom 3, so he uses mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushroom 2: uses mushroom 2 with v=8. Strength=1*8=8.

- If he picks mushroom 3: uses mushroom 3 with v=0. Strength=1*0=0.

So, maximum is 9 with k=1.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests picking k=2 mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let's try k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

- So, mushrooms 2 and 3 have v=0.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 2: mushroom 2 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=2*9=18.

Wait, but mushroom 2 is zeroed out, so v=0, but it's picked, so does he include it in the elixir? The problem says he doesn't use mushrooms with zero magic power.

So, he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, but only mushroom 1 has v=9, mushroom 2 has v=0, so elixir strength is 1*9=9.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 16 2, so perhaps picking mushrooms 1 and 2 gives strength 2*8=16.

Wait, but mushroom 2 has v=0, so how is that possible?

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"The magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0. Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero, and he will not use those in the elixir.

Therefore, the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms that are not in positions p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, in the first example:

For k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 have v=0.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 2: mushroom 2 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3: mushroom 3 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3: both have v=0, so no mushrooms in the elixir. Strength=0.

But according to the sample, it's 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, the strength is 16.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the permutation p.

Wait, in the first test case, p=[3,2,1], which means:

- p_1=3

- p_2=2

- p_3=1

So, for k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 have their magic power set to zero.

- So, mushroom 3 has v=0 and mushroom 2 has v=0.

- If Kirill picks mushrooms 1 and 2: mushroom 2 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3: mushroom 3 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3: both have v=0, so strength=0.

So, the maximum strength is 9 with k=1 or k=2.

But according to the sample, it's 16 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for k=2, the number of mushrooms in the elixir is 2, but only one has non-zero v=9, so strength is 2*9=18.

Wait, but the sample output is 16 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the elixir strength is calculated.

Wait, the problem says: "the strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms."

So, it's the number of mushrooms in the elixir times the minimum magic power among those mushrooms.

But in the above calculation, for k=2, picking mushrooms 1 and 2: only mushroom 1 has v=9, so number of mushrooms in the elixir is 1, minimum magic power is 9, so strength=1*9=9.

But according to the sample, it's 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, strength is 16.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the elixir is made from all picked mushrooms, including those with v=0, but ignoring their v=0 in the calculation.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, he excludes the mushrooms with v=0 from the elixir.

Therefore, in the above case, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2: only mushroom 1 is used, with v=9, so strength=1*9=9.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, strength=16.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of mushrooms in the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that have v=0.

So, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2: one mushroom has v=0, so number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-1=1, minimum magic power is 9, so strength=1*9=9.

But sample output is 16 2, which still doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimum among the non-zero mushrooms in the picked ones.

So, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2: mushroom 1 has v=9, mushroom 2 has v=0, so minimum among non-zero is 9, number of mushrooms is 1 (since only mushroom 1 is used), so strength=1*9=9.

Still, sample output is 16 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the permutation p.

Wait, in the first test case, p=[3,2,1], and v=[9,8,14].

So, for k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 have their magic power set to zero.

- So, mushroom 3 has v=0, mushroom 2 has v=0.

- If Kirill picks mushrooms 1 and 2: mushroom 2 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3: mushroom 3 has v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3: both have v=0, so strength=0.

So, maximum is 9 with k=1 or k=2.

But sample output is 16 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the number of mushrooms in the elixir is k, and the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms that are not zeroed out.

Wait, perhaps the number of mushrooms in the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

- If Kirill picks mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_1=3, p_2=2), so mushroom 2 is zeroed out.

- Therefore, only mushroom 1 is used, with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3:

- mushroom 3 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_1=3), so mushroom 3 is zeroed out.

- Therefore, only mushroom 1 is used, with v=9. Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3:

- mushrooms 2 and 3 are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, so both are zeroed out.

- Therefore, no mushrooms are used. Strength=0.

So, again, maximum is 9 with k=1 or k=2.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, strength=16.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the strength.

Wait, maybe the strength is k times the minimum among the picked mushrooms before zeroing out.

Wait, but the problem says: "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, the zeroing out happens after picking, but before preparing the elixir.

So, Kirill picks k mushrooms, then the magic power of p_1 to p_{k-1} becomes zero, and then he prepares the elixir using the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but in the first test case, for k=2, p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

If he picks mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 is zeroed out, so only mushroom 1 is used with v=9.

- Strength=1*9=9.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests 2*8=16.

Wait, where does 16 come from?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimum among the non-zero mushrooms in the picked ones is 8, and the number of mushrooms is 2.

Wait, but mushroom 2 is zeroed out, so v=0, and he doesn't use it.

So, only mushroom 1 with v=9 is used, so strength=1*9=9.

I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of mushrooms in the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

- If Kirill picks mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_2=2), so it's zeroed out.

- Therefore, number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-1=1, minimum magic power is 9, strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3:

- mushroom 3 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_1=3), so it's zeroed out.

- Therefore, number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-1=1, minimum magic power is 9, strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3:

- mushrooms 2 and 3 are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, so both are zeroed out.

- Therefore, number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-2=0, strength=0.

So, again, maximum is 9 with k=1 or k=2.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, strength=16.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimum among the non-zero mushrooms in the picked ones, multiplied by k.

So, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 is zeroed out, so only mushroom 1 with v=9.

- Strength=2*9=18.

Wait, but that still doesn't match the sample output of 16 2.

Wait, maybe the strength is k times the minimum among all picked mushrooms, including those with v=0.

So, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 has v=0, mushroom 1 has v=9.

- Minimum among picked mushrooms is 0.

- Strength=2*0=0.

But then, that's not matching the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms excluding those with v=0, but the minimum is taken among the original v of the picked mushrooms.

Wait, but that seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimum is taken among the non-zero v of the picked mushrooms.

So, for k=2 picking mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 has v=0, mushroom 1 has v=9.

- Minimum among non-zero v is 9.

- Number of mushrooms in elixir is 1 (since only mushroom 1 is used).

- Strength=1*9=9.

Still, sample output is 16 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of mushrooms in the elixir is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for k=2:

- p_1=3 and p_2=2 are zeroed out.

- If Kirill picks mushrooms 1 and 2:

- mushroom 2 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_2=2), so it's zeroed out.

- Number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-1=1.

- Minimum among the remaining picked mushrooms is 9.

- Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3:

- mushroom 3 is in p_1 to p_{k-1} (p_1=3), so it's zeroed out.

- Number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-1=1.

- Minimum among the remaining picked mushrooms is 9.

- Strength=1*9=9.

- If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3:

- mushrooms 2 and 3 are in p_1 to p_{k-1}, so both are zeroed out.

- Number of mushrooms in elixir is 2-2=0.

- Strength=0.

So, again, maximum is 9 with k=1 or k=2.

But sample output is 16 2, which suggests that for k=2, strength=16.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimum is taken among the original v of the picked mushrooms, before zeroing out.

Wait, but the zeroing out happens before preparing the elixir.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, but the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Therefore, the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for a given k, the strength is the number of picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1} times the minimum v among those picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

To maximize this, Kirill needs to choose which k mushrooms to pick to maximize this strength.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of v.

Then, I can try to pick the top m mushrooms, and see what k would correspond to that.

Wait, maybe that's a way.

Let me try to think about it.

I need to maximize k * min_v, where min_v is the minimum v among the picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

This seems similar to selecting a subset of mushrooms with a certain property.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over possible min_v and find the maximum k such that there are at least k mushrooms with v >= min_v, and among them, at most k-1 are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, that might be a way
