Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square drawn with '1's. I need to figure out which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (where k > 1), and each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, where i is the row number.

- The central '1's are aligned in one column, meaning it's a symmetric triangle, either right-side up or upside down.

- An upside-down triangle is also valid, but rotations by 90 degrees aren't considered triangles here.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that triangles have a pyramid-like shape, with the base having the most '1's and the apex having the fewest.

For a square:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), and each row has k '1's, all aligned at the same starting position from the left edge.

- So, it's a block of '1's forming a square shape.

Given that the grid contains exactly one shape, either a triangle or a square, and that shape contains all the '1's in the grid, I need to determine which one it is.

The constraints are:

- t (number of test cases) is between 1 and 100.

- n (size of the grid) is between 2 and 10.

- Each cell in the grid is either '0' or '1'.

- The shape is larger than size 1.

Okay, so for each test case, I need to read n and then n lines of the grid, which consists of '0's and '1's.

My task is to analyze the pattern of '1's and decide if it forms a square or a triangle.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve this problem.

Let's look at the code step by step.

The function `func` is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases.

First, it reads the number of test cases, `a = int(input())`.

Then, it loops through each test case: `for i in range(a):`.

Inside this loop, it initializes an empty list `k`.

Then, it reads `n = int(input())`, which is the size of the grid.

Next, it reads `n` lines of the grid: `for _ in range(int(input())): b = input() ...`.

Wait, actually, it's `for _ in range(int(input())):`, but since `n` is already read as `int(input())`, this seems redundant. It should probably just be `for _ in range(n):`.

Then, for each row, it checks if '1' is in the row, and if so, appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

After processing all rows, it checks if the first two elements in `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

Hmm, this seems too simplistic. Let's see if this logic holds up.

First, consider what a square looks like in this grid.

A square would have k consecutive rows with exactly k '1's in each row, aligned to the left or right.

Wait, actually, according to the problem, the square is positioned with the '1's at an equal distance from the left edge, meaning they are aligned to the left.

So, in each row of the square, there are k consecutive '1's starting from the same column.

For a triangle, the number of '1's increases or decreases by 2 each row, depending on whether it's right-side up or upside down.

So, for a triangle, the counts of '1's in each row would form a sequence like 1,3,5,... or ...,5,3,1.

Given that, let's see the logic in the code.

It collects the counts of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1', and stores them in `k`.

Then, it checks if the first two elements in `k` are equal. If they are, it concludes it's a square; otherwise, a triangle.

Is this sufficient?

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1:

Input:

3

000

011

011

Output:

SQUARE

In this case, the grid is:

Row 1: 000 (no '1's, so not included in `k`)

Row 2: 011 (2 '1's)

Row 3: 011 (2 '1's)

So, `k = [2, 2]`

Since k[0] == k[1], it's a square.

This makes sense because the '1's form a 2x2 square in the grid.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0000

0000

0100

1110

Output:

TRIANGLE

Here, the grid is:

Row 1: 0000

Row 2: 0000

Row 3: 0100 (1 '1')

Row 4: 1110 (3 '1's)

So, `k = [1, 3]`

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle.

Indeed, this looks like an upside-down triangle with k=2.

Wait, but according to the problem, k > 1, so k=1 shouldn't appear. But in this case, there's a row with 1 '1', which is allowed as part of the triangle.

Another example:

Input:

2

11

11

Output:

SQUARE

Grid:

Row 1: 11 (2 '1's)

Row 2: 11 (2 '1's)

So, `k = [2, 2]`

Correctly identified as a square.

Another example:

Input:

5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Grid:

Row 1: 00111 (3 '1's)

Row 2: 00010 (1 '1')

Row 3 to 5: 0's

So, `k = [3, 1]`

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle.

This makes sense as it's an upside-down triangle with k=2.

Another example:

Input:

10

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

1111111110

0111111100

0011111000

0001110000

0000100000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Grid:

Row 1 to 5: all 0's

Row 6: 1111111110 (9 '1's)

Row 7: 0111111100 (8 '1's)

Row 8: 0011111000 (6 '1's)

Row 9: 0001110000 (3 '1's)

Row 10: 0000100000 (1 '1')

So, `k = [9,8,6,3,1]`

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle.

This seems correct as it's an upside-down triangle.

Last example:

Input:

3

111

111

111

Output:

SQUARE

Grid:

Row 1: 111 (3 '1's)

Row 2: 111 (3 '1's)

Row 3: 111 (3 '1's)

So, `k = [3,3,3]`

Since k[0] == k[1], it's a square.

This is correct as it's a 3x3 square.

Wait, but according to the problem, a square is k rows with k '1's in each row, aligned to the left.

In this case, the '1's are aligned to the left since they span the entire row.

So, it's a valid square.

Now, let's think about potential edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

n=2

Grid:

01

11

Here, `k = [1,2]`

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle.

But according to the problem, a triangle must have rows with 2*i - 1 '1's.

For k=2, rows should have 1 and 3 '1's.

But here, it's 1 and 2 '1's, which doesn't match.

Wait, but the problem says that an upside-down triangle is also valid.

In this case, it's an upside-down triangle with k=2: rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

But the grid has 1 and 2 '1's, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle.

But according to the problem, the grid must contain exactly one triangle or one square, and it's guaranteed that the shape is larger than size 1.

So, in this case, perhaps the shape is a triangle with k=2, rows having 1 and 3 '1's, but the grid has rows with 1 and 2 '1's, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe this grid doesn't correspond to any valid shape, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one valid shape.

Assuming that, then this grid must correspond to either a triangle or a square.

But in this case, the program would identify it as a triangle, which might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the rows with '1's must form a consecutive block.

In the above grid, rows with '1's are rows 1 and 2, with 1 and 2 '1's respectively.

According to the program, since 1 != 2, it's a triangle.

But according to the problem, a triangle with k=2 should have rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

So, this grid doesn't match the triangle definition, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed to be one shape or the other.

Perhaps I need to consider the alignment as well.

Wait, in the triangle definition, the '1's are centered in one column.

In the above grid, the '1's aren't centered; they're aligned to the right.

So, maybe it's not a valid triangle.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed to be one shape or the other.

So, perhaps in this case, it's a square with k=2, having two rows with two '1's each.

But in the grid, one row has one '1', and the other has two '1's.

So, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the square is positioned with the '1's starting from the same column in each row.

In this grid, the '1's in row 1 start at column 2, and in row 2, they start at column 1.

So, not aligned, which violates the square definition.

Therefore, it must be a triangle, even if it doesn't perfectly match the expected counts.

So, the program would correctly identify it as a triangle.

Another edge case:

n=2

Grid:

11

11

Here, `k = [2,2]`

Since k[0] == k[1], it's a square.

This is correct.

Another edge case:

n=3

Grid:

000

010

111

Here, `k = [1,3]`

Since 1 != 3, it's a triangle.

This matches the upside-down triangle with k=2.

Seems correct.

Another edge case:

n=4

Grid:

0000

0110

0110

0000

Here, `k = [2,2]`

Since 2 == 2, it's a square.

But according to the triangle definition, an upside-down triangle with k=2 should have rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

This grid has two rows with 2 '1's each, which doesn't match the triangle definition.

So, correctly identified as a square.

Wait, but according to the problem, a square is k rows with k '1's each, aligned to the left.

In this grid, the '1's are aligned to the center, not the left.

Does this violate the square definition?

According to the problem, the square should have '1's positioned at an equal distance from the left edge, meaning they should start at the same column in each row.

In this grid, the '1's start at column 2 in rows 2 and 3, so they are aligned.

Therefore, it's a valid square.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it as a square.

Another edge case:

n=4

Grid:

0000

0000

1111

1111

Here, `k = [4,4]`

Since 4 == 4, it's a square.

This is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, the square should consist of k consecutive rows with k '1's each.

In this grid, the square is at the bottom two rows.

Does the problem specify that the shape must be contiguous from the top or bottom?

No, just that it's k consecutive rows with k '1's each, aligned to the left.

In this case, the '1's are aligned to the left, starting from row 3.

So, it's a valid square.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it.

Another edge case:

n=3

Grid:

111

010

010

Here, `k = [3,1,1]`

Since 3 != 1, it's a triangle.

But according to the problem, a triangle should have rows with 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in one column.

In this grid, row 1 has 3 '1's, row 2 has 1 '1', row 3 has 1 '1'.

This could be an upside-down triangle with k=2: rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

But here, there are three rows: 3,1,1.

Does this match the triangle definition?

The triangle definition specifies k consecutive rows with 2*i - 1 '1's.

In this case, k=2 would correspond to rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

But here, there are three rows: 3,1,1.

So, it's possible that the top two rows (3,1) form the triangle, and the bottom row has an extra '1', but according to the problem, the shape contains all the '1's in the grid.

So, if there's an extra '1' in the bottom row, does that violate the shape definition?

According to the problem, the grid contains exactly one shape, either a triangle or a square, and that shape contains all the '1's in the grid.

Therefore, in this case, since there's an extra '1' in the bottom row, which isn't part of the triangle, this grid wouldn't satisfy the condition.

But the problem says that the grid contains exactly one shape, so this situation shouldn't occur.

Hence, perhaps this grid isn't possible given the problem constraints.

Assuming that, then in this case, the program would identify it as a triangle because k[0] != k[1].

But according to the problem, all '1's form a single shape, so this grid isn't possible.

Therefore, I don't need to worry about such cases.

Another edge case:

n=2

Grid:

11

01

Here, `k = [2,1]`

Since 2 != 1, it's a triangle.

This could be an upside-down triangle with k=2: rows with 1 and 3 '1's.

But in this grid, row 1 has 2 '1's, row 2 has 1 '1'.

This doesn't match the triangle definition, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed to be one shape or the other.

So, perhaps in this case, it's a triangle with k=2, rows having 1 and 3 '1's, but the grid has 2 and 1 '1's.

Wait, maybe the triangle isn't perfectly formed, but since it's guaranteed to be one shape, I have to trust that.

Given that, the program identifies it as a triangle, which might be correct in the context of the problem.

Another consideration: the problem mentions that for triangles, the '1's are centered in one column, meaning they are symmetric around that central column.

In the grid, this would mean that the '1's in each row are centered around the same column.

For example, in a right-side up triangle, the first row has 1 '1' in the center, the second row has 3 '1's with the center '1' aligned with the previous one, and so on.

For an upside-down triangle, it's the opposite.

The program, however, only looks at the counts of '1's in each row and doesn't check the positions.

Is this sufficient?

In the examples provided, it seems to work because for squares, all rows have the same number of '1's, and for triangles, the rows have different counts.

But is this always the case?

Let's think about a square.

A square has k rows with k '1's each, aligned to the left.

So, in each row, the '1's start from the same column and span k columns.

Therefore, the count of '1's in each row is k.

For a triangle, the counts vary depending on the row.

For a right-side up triangle with k rows, the counts are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 2*k - 1.

For an upside-down triangle, it's the reverse: 2*k - 1, ..., 5, 3, 1.

Therefore, in a triangle, the counts are all distinct in the rows that make up the triangle.

Given that, in the program's approach, if the counts are the same for the first two rows, it's a square; otherwise, it's a triangle.

This seems to hold for the examples.

But is there any case where a square could have varying counts in different rows?

No, because in a square, each row has exactly k '1's.

Similarly, for a triangle, the counts are distinct for each row in the triangle.

Therefore, if the counts in the rows are all the same, it must be a square.

If they vary, it must be a triangle.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

Additionally, the problem states that the grid contains exactly one shape, and that shape contains all the '1's in the grid.

Therefore, I don't need to worry about multiple shapes or '1's outside of the shape.

So, based on this reasoning, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
