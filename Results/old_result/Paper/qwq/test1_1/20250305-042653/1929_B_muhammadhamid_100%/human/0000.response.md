Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n by n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to bottom-right and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the same for anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. But actually, I think that's double-counting because each diagonal is unique, but in the problem, it's stated that there are 4n - 2 diagonals, which includes both main and anti-diagonals separately.

Wait, no. In a square grid, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 2, including both directions. For example, in a 3x3 grid, there are 3 main diagonals and 3 anti-diagonals, totaling 6 diagonals.

So, in this problem, we have to ensure that at least k out of these 4n - 2 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The task is to find the minimum number of cells to color to satisfy this condition.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to minimize the number of colored cells is to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each cell. Since each cell belongs to exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, coloring a single cell can cover two diagonals: one main and one anti.

Therefore, in the best case, each colored cell can cover two diagonals.

But there are some diagonals that might only be covered by a specific set of cells.

I need to consider the overlap between diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of diagonals that need to be covered and how cells can cover them.

Let's consider that each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I color a cell, I cover two diagonals: one main and one anti.

But some diagonals might only have a few cells, and some cells might be shared among multiple diagonals.

I need to find a way to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest cells possible.

Maybe I can think in terms of the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by a certain number of cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate how many cells are needed to cover k diagonals, given that each cell can cover two diagonals.

But I need to be careful because there might be dependencies between the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem as a set cover problem, where each cell is a set covering two diagonals, and I need to cover at least k diagonals.

However, set cover is NP-hard, but maybe in this specific case, there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.

Let me try to find a pattern for small values of n and k.

Let's take n=2.

For n=2, there are 4 cells and 4 main diagonals and 4 anti-diagonals, totaling 8 diagonals.

Wait, no. For n=2, there are 2 main diagonals and 2 anti-diagonals, totaling 4 diagonals.

Wait, no, in a 2x2 grid, there are 2 main diagonals and 2 anti-diagonals, so 4 diagonals in total.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=2, there should be 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals. Wait, is the formula correct?

Wait, no. The problem says 4n - 2 diagonals, but for n=2, that would be 4*2 - 2 = 6, but intuitively, there are 2 main diagonals and 2 anti-diagonals, totaling 4.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some diagonals.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid:

- Main diagonals: one from (1,1) to (2,2), and another from (1,2) to (2,1).

- Anti-diagonals: same as above, or are they different?

Wait, actually, in a 2x2 grid, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right, and anti-diagonals from top-right to bottom-left.

So, for n=2:

- Main diagonals: two diagonals.

- Anti-diagonals: two diagonals.

Total diagonals: 4.

But according to the problem, it's 4n - 2 = 6. So, perhaps there's a different definition of diagonals.

Wait, maybe the problem counts both main and anti-diagonals separately, and also includes shorter diagonals.

Wait, in a grid, diagonals can be of different lengths.

In an n x n grid, there are diagonals of length 1 up to length n.

Wait, but the problem seems to consider only the main diagonals and anti-diagonals, but perhaps it's considering all possible diagonals of different lengths.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the definition of diagonals in the problem.

Looking back at the example, for n=3, there are 10 diagonals.

For n=3:

- Main diagonals: 3 (one with 1 cell, one with 2 cells, one with 3 cells).

- Anti-diagonals: 3 similarly.

- But in total, it's 6, but the problem says 4n - 2 = 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, for n=3:

- Main diagonals: 5 in total (including the shorter ones).

- Anti-diagonals: 5 similarly.

- Total: 10 diagonals.

So, for n=3, there are 10 diagonals.

Similarly, for n=2:

- Main diagonals: 3 (two with one cell each, one with two cells).

- Anti-diagonals: 3 similarly.

- Total: 6 diagonals.

Ah, so the formula 4n - 2 makes sense.

So, in general, for an n x n grid, there are 4n - 2 diagonals, including all possible diagonals in both directions.

Now, the problem is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to cover at least k diagonals by coloring cells, minimizing the number of cells colored.

I need to find a formula or an efficient way to compute this for large n and k, since n can be up to 10^8.

So, brute force is not feasible; I need a mathematical formula.

Let me think about how many diagonals a single cell can cover.

Each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Therefore, coloring a cell covers two diagonals: one main and one anti.

But, some diagonals share cells, so there might be overlaps.

I need to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

Ideally, each colored cell should cover two new diagonals that haven't been covered yet.

But, as I color more cells, it might not always be possible to cover two new diagonals, especially if the cells are on the same diagonals.

I need to find a way to maximize the coverage.

Perhaps I can think in terms of selecting cells that cover the most uncovered diagonals.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

In the greedy approach, at each step, I select the cell that covers the most uncovered diagonals.

But with n up to 10^8, I need something more efficient.

I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

If I color one cell, I cover two diagonals.

If I color a second cell that is not on the same diagonals as the first, I cover two more diagonals, totaling four.

But in reality, it's possible that the second cell is on one of the same diagonals as the first cell, so I might only cover one new diagonal.

Wait, but to maximize the number of diagonals covered, I should choose cells that are not on the same diagonals as already colored cells.

But in practice, this might not always be possible, especially for larger k.

I need to find the minimal number of cells required to cover at least k diagonals.

Alternatively, I can think of it as covering at least k diagonals with the fewest cells possible.

I need to find the minimal c such that c cells cover at least k diagonals.

Given that each cell can cover up to two new diagonals, the minimal c would be ceil(k / 2).

But wait, in some cases, this might not hold, because there might be dependencies.

Wait, in the first test case:

n=3, k=4

According to ceil(k / 2) = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

And in the example, it's possible to cover 4 diagonals with 2 cells.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=3, k=10

ceil(10 / 2) = 5

But the example output is 6, which is more than 5.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

So, perhaps ceil(k / 2) is not always sufficient.

In the third test case, n=3, k=10, and the output is 6, which is more than ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, there must be a different way to calculate the minimal number of cells.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider the total number of diagonals and how they intersect.

In an n x n grid, there are 4n - 2 diagonals.

I need to cover at least k of them.

I need to find the minimal number of cells that cover at least k diagonals.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti.

So, if I color c cells, they can cover up to 2c diagonals, but only if those cells are chosen such that their covered diagonals are distinct.

But in reality, there might be overlaps, meaning that some diagonals are covered by multiple cells.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I need to ensure that the c cells cover at least k distinct diagonals.

In the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals, so c = ceil(k / 2).

But in the third test case, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the example output is 6.

So, perhaps for some values of n and k, ceil(k / 2) is not sufficient.

Maybe there are constraints based on n.

Let me consider n=3, k=10.

Total diagonals: 10.

To cover all 10 diagonals, how many cells are needed?

In the example, it's 6 cells.

But according to ceil(10 / 2) = 5, it should be possible with 5 cells, but apparently not.

So, perhaps for certain n, more cells are needed beyond ceil(k / 2).

Maybe there is a relationship with n.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with c cells is 2c, but only if c <= some value related to n.

Wait, perhaps the number of independent diagonals is limited by n.

For example, in n=3, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered without overlaps might be limited by the grid size.

Wait, in n=3, there are 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals.

But in the example, to cover all 10 diagonals, 6 cells are needed.

Perhaps there is a formula that takes into account the grid size n and the number of diagonals k.

Let me try to find a general formula.

First, note that in an n x n grid:

- Number of main diagonals: 2n - 1

- Number of anti-diagonals: 2n - 1

- Total diagonals: 4n - 2

Each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

I need to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest cells.

I need to find the minimal c such that c cells cover at least k diagonals.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but perhaps there is a pattern or formula for this specific case.

Let me consider that each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, and I need to cover a certain number of main and anti-diagonals.

Suppose I need to cover p main diagonals and q anti-diagonals, where p + q >= k.

But I need to minimize the number of cells, considering that each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

This seems similar to covering rows and columns in a grid with a minimal number of cells.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to hitting rows and columns in a matrix.

In that case, the minimal number of cells needed to cover at least p rows and q columns is max(p, q).

But in this problem, it's about covering diagonals.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of hitting diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the hitting set problem.

But I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the main diagonals and anti-diagonals are separate sets, and each cell covers one from each.

I need to cover at least k diagonals in total, from both sets.

I need to minimize the number of cells used.

This seems similar to covering elements from two sets with pairs, where each pair covers one element from each set.

This is similar to a bipartite graph, where one part is the main diagonals and the other is the anti-diagonals, and cells are edges between them.

In this bipartite graph, each cell connects one main diagonal to one anti-diagonal.

I need to select a subset of these edges (cells) such that at least k diagonals (nodes) are covered.

This is similar to the hitting set problem or set cover problem.

But again, for large n, I need a formula, not an algorithm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I need to cover p main diagonals and q anti-diagonals, with p + q >= k.

Each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, to cover p main diagonals, I need at least p cells.

Similarly, to cover q anti-diagonals, I need at least q cells.

But since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, the total number of cells needed is max(p, q).

But I need to cover p main diagonals and q anti-diagonals such that p + q >= k.

I need to minimize the maximum of p and q.

To minimize max(p, q) under the constraint that p + q >= k.

This occurs when p and q are as equal as possible.

So, if k is even, p = q = k / 2.

If k is odd, p = ceil(k / 2), q = floor(k / 2), or vice versa.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells is ceil(k / 2).

But wait, in the example where n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the example output is 6.

So, this suggests that ceil(k / 2) is not always sufficient.

Therefore, there must be an additional constraint based on n.

Perhaps, for certain n, you cannot cover more than a certain number of diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells.

Looking back at the example, for n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but it's not possible to cover all 10 diagonals with 5 cells.

So, perhaps there is a limit based on n.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with c cells is 2c, but only if c <= n.

Wait, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n.

For example, in n=3, to cover all 10 diagonals, you need 6 cells, as per the example.

Wait, but in n=3, according to the example, to cover all 10 diagonals, you need 6 cells.

But according to ceil(10 / 2) = 5, it's not sufficient.

So, perhaps there is a different formula.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n.

Wait, but in n=3, it's 6, which is more than n.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of diagonals that cannot be covered simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the ceiling of k / 2, but only up to a certain point, after which additional cells are needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

Wait, perhaps when k exceeds a certain threshold based on n, more cells are needed.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Suppose that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is ceil(k / 2), but only up to a certain k.

Beyond that, additional cells are needed.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5 is not sufficient, and 6 cells are needed.

So, perhaps there is a correction factor based on n.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all 4n - 2 diagonals is 2n - 1.

For n=3, 2*3 - 1 = 5, but in the example, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n, but in n=3, it's 6, which is 2n.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of main and anti-diagonals.

Wait, in n=3, there are 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals.

To cover all 10 diagonals, you need to cover all main and all anti-diagonals.

To cover all main diagonals, you need at least the number of main diagonals that are not overlapping.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider the problem as covering rows and columns in a different way.

Wait, maybe I can model the diagonals as rows and anti-diagonals as columns in a bipartite graph, and then find the minimal number of cells (edges) needed to cover at least k nodes (diagonals).

But this seems too abstract.

Let me consider the following approach.

Suppose I fix the number of cells c.

Each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, the total number of main diagonals covered is at least the number of distinct main diagonals covered by these c cells.

Similarly for anti-diagonals.

To maximize the number of diagonals covered, I should choose c cells that cover as many distinct main and anti-diagonals as possible.

Each cell can cover one new main diagonal and one new anti-diagonal.

Therefore, with c cells, I can cover up to c main diagonals and c anti-diagonals.

Therefore, the total number of diagonals covered is up to 2c.

But in reality, it might be less if there are overlaps.

Wait, but in the case where c is small compared to n, I can probably achieve 2c coverage.

But when c approaches n, perhaps overlaps become more frequent.

In the example with n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but it's not sufficient, and 6 cells are needed.

So, perhaps there is an adjustment needed when k is close to the total number of diagonals.

Wait, in that case, maybe I need to consider that some diagonals share cells, and therefore, covering one diagonal might force the coverage of another diagonal.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, to cover a certain diagonal, I have to color a cell that also covers another diagonal.

Therefore, in those cases, the number of cells needed might be higher than ceil(k / 2).

I need to find a general formula that accounts for this.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is ceil(k / 2), but when k exceeds a certain threshold, additional cells are needed.

Perhaps the threshold is when k exceeds the number of cells available.

Wait, but in n=3, there are 9 cells, and k=10, which is more than the number of cells, but that doesn't make sense because k is the number of diagonals to cover, not the cells.

Wait, no, k is the number of diagonals to cover, which can be up to 4n - 2.

In n=3, there are 10 diagonals, and k can be up to 10.

In the example, for k=10, it's 6 cells.

According to ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but it's not sufficient.

So, perhaps when k exceeds 2n - 1, more cells are needed.

Wait, for n=3, 2n - 1 = 5, and for k=10 > 5, it requires 6 cells.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9, which is between 5 and 10, perhaps it requires 5 cells, but in the example, for k=9, the output is 5, which matches ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

Wait, but for k=10, it's 6, which is more than ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

So, perhaps when k > 2n - 1, the number of cells needed is k - (2n - 1 - n) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for k up to 2n - 1, the number of cells is ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n - 1, it's ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n - 1)).

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, 2n - 1 = 5, so k - (2n - 1) = 5, and ceil(10 / 2) = 5, plus 5 additional cells, totaling 10, which is not matching the example output of 6.

So, perhaps that's not the right adjustment.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is:

- ceil(k / 2), if k <= 2n - 1

- ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n - 1)), if k > 2n - 1

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, 2n - 1 = 5, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, and k - (2n - 1) = 5, so total cells = 5 + 5 = 10, which doesn't match the example output of 6.

So, perhaps this is not the right formula.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k / 2) + floor((k - (2n - 1)) / 2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2) = 5

floor((10 - 5) / 2) = floor(5 / 2) = 2

Total cells = 5 + 2 = 7, which still doesn't match the example output of 6.

So, perhaps a different approach.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is:

- ceil(k / 2), if k <= some value based on n

- some other formula when k > that value

I need to find what that value is.

Looking back at the example:

- n=3, k=4, output=2

- n=3, k=3, output=2

- n=3, k=10, output=6

- n=3, k=9, output=5

- n=4, k=7, output=4

- n=7, k=11, output=6

- n=2, k=3, output=2

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

For n=3:

- k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, output=2

- k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, output=2

- k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, output=5

- k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but output=6

So, perhaps when k > some value, an adjustment is needed.

Looking at n=3, total diagonals=10.

For k up to 6, the output is ceil(k / 2).

For k=7, it might be ceil(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, but in n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, output=5.

Wait, 5 < 6, which is ceil(10 / 2)=5, but for k=10, it's 6.

So, perhaps when k > 2n, the number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2) + floor((k - 2n)/2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + floor((10 - 6)/2)=floor(4 / 2)=2, total=7, which is still not matching the example output of 6.

Hmm.

Maybe it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n - 1)) / 2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 - 5)/2)=ceil(5 / 2)=3, total=8, which is still not matching.

This is getting confusing.

Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of diagonals that can be covered with c cells.

With c cells, the maximum number of diagonals covered is 2c, but only if c <= n.

Wait, perhaps in an n x n grid, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with c cells is 2c, but only up to 2n - 1 for main and 2n - 1 for anti-diagonals.

But I need to cover k diagonals in total.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the sum of the minimum of c and (2n - 1) for main and anti-diagonals.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different pattern.

Looking at the examples:

- n=3, k=4, output=2

- n=3, k=3, output=2

- n=3, k=10, output=6

- n=3, k=9, output=5

- n=4, k=7, output=4

- n=7, k=11, output=6

- n=2, k=3, output=2

Looking at n=2, k=3:

According to ceil(3 / 2)=2, and output=2.

n=2, total diagonals=6.

So, for k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, and output=2.

For k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, but in n=2, total diagonals=6.

Wait, but in n=2, to cover k=4 diagonals, would ceil(4 / 2)=2, but is that sufficient?

Wait, in n=2, there are 3 main diagonals and 3 anti-diagonals.

Each cell covers 2 diagonals.

With 2 cells, you can cover up to 4 diagonals if they are distinct.

So, for k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, and it's possible.

But in n=3, for k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but it's not sufficient, and you need 6 cells.

So, perhaps there is an adjustment needed when k > 2n - 1.

Wait, for n=3, 2n - 1 = 5.

For k <=5, ceil(k / 2) seems sufficient.

For k >5, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=3, total=8, which is still not matching the example output of 6.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that for k > 2n -1, the number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1)).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=5, total=10, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=5, total=10, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(5 / 2)=3, total=8, not matching.

This isn't working.

Let me try to find another pattern.

Looking at the examples:

- n=3, k=4, output=2

- n=3, k=3, output=2

- n=3, k=10, output=6

- n=3, k=9, output=5

- n=4, k=7, output=4

- n=7, k=11, output=6

- n=2, k=3, output=2

Looking at n=3:

- For k=1 to 6, output seems to be ceil(k / 2)

- For k=7, it should be 4, but according to ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

- For k=8, it should be 4, but according to ceil(8 / 2)=4, but in the example, for k=9, it's 5.

- For k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, matches.

- For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps for k > 2n -1, the number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2) + 1.

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 +1=6, which matches the example.

Similarly, for k=9:

ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches.

For k=7:

ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

For k=4:

ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For k=3:

ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

For k=2:

ceil(2 / 2)=1, which seems correct.

For k=1:

According to ceil(1 / 2)=1, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- If k > 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2) +1

But in n=3, 2n -1=5.

For k=6, ceil(6 / 2)=3, but according to the pattern, it should be 3.

But in the example, for k=9, it's 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

For k=10, it's 6, which is ceil(10 / 2)+1=6.

Wait, but for k=6, ceil(6 / 2)=3, which should be correct.

But in n=3, total diagonals=10.

So, for k=10, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But for n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=5, total=10, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(5 / 2)=3, total=8, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + floor((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + floor(5 / 2)=2, total=7, not matching.

This is frustrating.

Let me try to find another way.

Perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is:

- ceil(k / 2), unless k > 2n -1, in which case it's ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But in n=3, k=10, that would be 5 +5=10, which is not matching the example output of 6.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + max(0, k - (3n -2)) or something.

Wait, for n=3, 3n -2=7.

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + max(0, 10 -7)=3, total=8, not matching.

This isn't working.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all 4n -2 diagonals is 2n -1.

For n=3, 2n -1=5, but in the example, to cover all 10 diagonals, it's 6 cells.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps in n=3, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all 10 diagonals is 6.

Wait, but according to the example, it's 6.

So, perhaps the formula is ceil(k / 2), but when k > 2n -1, add ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=3, total=8, not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil((k + n -1) / 2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil((10 + 3 -1)/2)=ceil(12 / 2)=6, which matches the example.

For k=9:

ceil((9 + 3 -1)/2)=ceil(11 / 2)=6, but in the example, it's 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil((k + n -1)/2), but for k=9, ceil(11 / 2)=6, but the example output is 5.

Hmm.

This is not consistent.

Wait, maybe it's min(ceil(k / 2), n)

But for n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, min(5,3)=3, which is not matching the example output of 6.

No, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but when k > 2n -1, add ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(5 / 2)=3, total=8, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil(max(0, k - 2n +1)/2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(max(0,10 -6)/2)=ceil(4 / 2)=2, total=7, not matching.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is:

- ceil(k / 2), if k <= 2n -1

- ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2), if k > 2n -1

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(5 / 2)=3, total=8, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil(max(0, k - 2n)/2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil(4 / 2)=2, total=7, not matching.

This isn't working.

Let me look back at the examples again.

Looking at n=3:

- k=4, output=2

- k=3, output=2

- k=10, output=6

- k=9, output=5

Looking at n=4, k=7, output=4

According to ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11, output=6

ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3, output=2

ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, perhaps for n >=2, the formula is ceil(k / 2), except for some specific cases where k is close to 4n -2.

Wait, but in n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an adjustment needed when k is greater than 2n -1.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1=5.

For k >5, the formula is ceil(k / 2) +1.

For k=6, it should be 4, but according to ceil(6 / 2)=3 +1=4.

But in the example, for k=9, it's 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches the adjusted formula.

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 +1=6, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil(k / 2) +1

This seems to match the examples.

For n=3:

- k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2

- k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2

- k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5

- k=10, ceil(10 / 2)+1=6

For n=4, k=7:

ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches the example.

For n=7, k=11:

ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3:

ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil(k / 2) +1

But in n=3, k=9:

ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches the example output of 5.

But according to the earlier condition, for k > 2n -1, which is k >5, it should be ceil(k / 2)+1=6, but the example output is 5 for k=9.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps only when k == 4n -2, we need to add +1.

For n=3, 4n -2=10, and for k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10 / 2)+1=6.

For k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches the example output of 5.

For k=8, ceil(8 / 2)=4, which seems correct.

For k=7, ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches the example output of 4.

For k=6, ceil(6 / 2)=3, but according to the adjusted formula, for k > 2n -1=5, it should be ceil(6 / 2)+1=4, but perhaps in reality, it's 3.

Wait, but in n=3, for k=6, it should be 3 cells.

Wait, but according to the adjusted formula, for k >5, it's ceil(k / 2)+1.

For k=6, ceil(6 / 2)=3 +1=4, but perhaps in reality, it's 3.

But in the example, for k=9, it's 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5, which is without adding +1.

So, perhaps the condition is to add +1 only when k == 4n -2.

For n=3, 4n -2=10, and for k=10, output=6=ceil(10 / 2)+1.

For k=9, it's ceil(9 / 2)=5.

Similarly, for n=4, k=7, ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11, ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is:

- ceil(k / 2), unless k == 4n -2, in which case ceil(k / 2)+1

For n=3, k=10 (4n -2=10), output=6=ceil(10 / 2)+1

For other values, it's ceil(k / 2)

This seems to align with the examples.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed is:

- If k == 1, then 1

- Else, if k == 4n -2, then ceil(k / 2)+1

- Else, ceil(k / 2)

Wait, but in the example, for k=9, which is not equal to 4n -2, it's ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches.

For k=10, which is equal to 4n -2, it's ceil(10 / 2)+1=6, which matches.

Similarly, for n=2, k=3, which is not equal to 4n -2=6, so ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=4, k=7, which is not equal to 4n -2=14, so ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11, which is not equal to 4n -2=26, so ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches.

Therefore, the formula seems to hold.

So, the minimal number of cells needed is:

- If k ==1, then 1

- Else, if k ==4n -2, then ceil(k / 2)+1

- Else, ceil(k / 2)

This seems to be the correct formula based on the examples provided.

Therefore, in the code, this logic should be implemented.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input
