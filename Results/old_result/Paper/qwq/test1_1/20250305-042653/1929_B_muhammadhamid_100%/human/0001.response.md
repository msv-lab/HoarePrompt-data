Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells colored.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonals that run from top-right to bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is n, and the number of anti-diagonals is also n. So, in total, there are 2n diagonals. But wait, the problem says there are 4n - 2 diagonals. That seems off.

Let me think about it. For a grid of size n, the number of diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of diagonals that run from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1. So, in total, there are 4n - 2 diagonals.

Okay, that makes sense. So, for example, if n=3, there are 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals: 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals.

Now, the problem is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color to cover at least k diagonals.

Let me consider small values of n to get an idea.

Take n=2:

- There are 4 cells.

- Number of main diagonals: 3 (one with one cell, two with two cells).

- Number of anti-diagonals: 3.

- Total diagonals: 6.

If k=1, minimal cells: 1 (color one cell, covers one main and one anti-diagonal, so covers 2 diagonals).

Wait, but k is the number of diagonals that must have at least one colored cell.

Wait, for n=2, total diagonals are 4*2 - 2 = 6.

But actually, for n=2, there are 2 main diagonals and 2 anti-diagonals, each consisting of 2 cells.

Wait, no, for n=2, there are 3 main diagonals: one with one cell, two with two cells.

Wait, no, in n=2:

- Main diagonals: one diagonal with two cells (top-left to bottom-right), and diagonals with one cell each.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

In general, for a grid of size n, the number of diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number going from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1, for a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Now, the problem is to cover at least k of these diagonals with the minimal number of colored cells.

I need to find the minimal number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to cover k diagonals with as few cells as possible.

Let me consider that each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell can cover exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti.

Wait, but in reality, each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Therefore, coloring a single cell covers two diagonals.

Wait, but in the problem, diagonals are considered separately, so even if a cell covers two diagonals, they are two different diagonals.

Wait, but in the example given, for n=3 and k=4, the answer is 2.

Let me see: coloring two cells can cover up to four diagonals if each cell covers two unique diagonals.

Wait, but in reality, some diagonals might overlap in their coverage.

I need to maximize the number of unique diagonals covered by each cell.

So, to minimize the number of cells, I should maximize the number of unique diagonals covered by each cell.

Each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I color a cell that covers two diagonals that haven't been covered yet, then that's optimal.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2), because each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

But wait, in the example, for n=3 and k=4, the answer is 2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, the answer is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but in the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6.

But ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps not all cells cover two unique diagonals.

Maybe there are diagonals that can be covered by multiple cells, but some diagonals are shared.

I need to look deeper.

Let me consider the grid.

For n=3:

- Main diagonals: one with 3 cells, two with 2 cells, and two with 1 cell.

- Anti-diagonals similarly.

Each cell lies on exactly one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, in total, there are 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals, totaling 10.

Now, if I color a cell, I cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, coloring one cell covers two diagonals.

But, if I need to cover all 10 diagonals, I need to cover 5 main and 5 anti-diagonals.

If I color cells such that each cell covers a unique main and anti-diagonal, then theoretically, I could cover 2 diagonals per cell.

But, in practice, since there are overlaps, maybe I can't achieve that.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6.

But according to ceil(10/2)=5, but it's 6.

So, perhaps there is a dependency between the diagonals.

Maybe not all diagonals are independent; some may share cells.

I need to consider the structure of the grid.

In a grid, some diagonals intersect at cells, meaning that coloring a cell can cover multiple diagonals, but some diagonals may not intersect with others in a way that allows covering them simultaneously with minimal cells.

I need to find a way to cover k diagonals with minimal cells.

I think I need to consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by a single cell.

In general, each cell can cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two unique diagonals.

But in reality, there might be dependencies.

Wait, perhaps for larger k, it's not possible to cover them with ceil(k/2) cells.

Looking back at the sample input:

- For n=3, k=4, output=2

- For n=3, k=10, output=6

- For n=3, k=9, output=5

- For n=4, k=7, output=4

- For n=7, k=11, output=6

- For n=2, k=3, output=2

Wait, for n=3, k=10 (total diagonals), output=6, which is higher than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there is a different way to calculate this.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total number of main and anti-diagonals separately.

For n=3:

- Main diagonals: 5

- Anti-diagonals: 5

Total diagonals: 10

If I need to cover k=10 diagonals, which is all of them.

Now, each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, to cover all 5 main diagonals, I need at least ceil(5/1)=5 cells.

Similarly, to cover all 5 anti-diagonals, I need at least ceil(5/1)=5 cells.

But since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, perhaps there is an overlap.

Wait, maybe I need to cover both main and anti-diagonals simultaneously.

I need to find a set of cells that cover at least k diagonals, where diagonals include both main and anti-diagonals.

I think I need to model this as a set cover problem, where each cell is a set covering two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), and I need to cover at least k diagonals with minimal cells.

But set cover is NP-hard, and this problem seems to expect an efficient solution.

So, perhaps there is a mathematical formula to compute this.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For n=3, k=4, output=2

- For n=3, k=10, output=6

- For n=3, k=9, output=5

- For n=4, k=7, output=4

- For n=7, k=11, output=6

- For n=2, k=3, output=2

I need to find a pattern or formula that fits these inputs and outputs.

Let me consider that for k up to a certain value, the minimal cells are ceil(k/2), but beyond that, it changes.

For n=3:

- Total diagonals: 10

- For k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, which matches the sample output.

- For k=9, ceil(9/2)=5, which matches the sample output.

- For k=10, it's 6, which is more than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, perhaps there is a threshold where simply ceil(k/2) doesn't hold.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with ceil(k/2) cells.

Wait, perhaps for k up to a certain number, ceil(k/2) is sufficient, but beyond that, I need to cover additional diagonals that can't be covered simultaneously.

I need to think about the maximum number of unique diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

Each new cell can cover up to two new diagonals, provided that these diagonals are not already covered by previous cells.

But there might be constraints where some diagonals can't be covered independently.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of main and anti-diagonals and find a way to cover the required k diagonals with minimal overlap.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the sum of the number of main and anti-diagonals minus n, since the main and anti-diagonals intersect in n cells.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look for another approach.

Suppose I have to cover p main diagonals and q anti-diagonals, such that p + q >= k.

But I need to minimize the number of cells, each cell covering one main and one anti-diagonal.

This seems similar to covering rows and columns in a matrix with minimal number of lines.

In that case, the minimal number of cells needed to cover p rows and q columns is min(p, q) + max(p + q - min(p, q)).

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, in covering p rows and q columns, the minimal number of lines (rows or columns) needed is min(p, q) + max(p + q - min(p, q) - min(p, q)).

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider bipartite matching or something similar.

But perhaps there's a simpler mathematical formula.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For n=3, k=4, output=2

- For n=3, k=10, output=6

- For n=3, k=9, output=5

- For n=4, k=7, output=4

- For n=7, k=11, output=6

- For n=2, k=3, output=2

I need to find a formula that fits these.

Let me consider that the minimal number of cells needed is:

min_ cells = ceil(k / 2), but with some adjustments when k is large.

Wait, for n=3 and k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but adjusted by the total number of diagonals.

Wait, perhaps when k exceeds a certain threshold, I need to add some extra cells.

Alternatively, maybe it's min_ cells = ceil(k / 2), but capped by the total number of main and anti-diagonals.

But that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min_ cells = ceil(k / 2), but with an adjustment for when k is greater than a certain value related to n.

Looking at n=3, k=10, which is the total number of diagonals, and the output is 6.

Similarly, for n=4, k=7, output=4.

Wait, for n=4, total diagonals are 4*4 - 2 = 14.

For k=7, ceil(7/2)=4, which matches the sample output.

For n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to add the ceiling of k/2 and the ceiling of (k - n)/2 or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the formula is min_ cells = ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - 2*(n-1))/2).

Wait, for n=3, k=10:

ceil(10/2) = 5

ceil((10 - 2*(3-1))/2) = ceil((10 - 4)/2) = ceil(6/2)=3

But then min_ cells would be 5 + 3 = 8, which is not matching the sample output of 6.

This isn't working.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for n=3, to cover all 10 diagonals, I need to cover all 5 main and all 5 anti-diagonals.

Each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, to cover all 5 main diagonals, I need at least 5 cells.

Similarly, to cover all 5 anti-diagonals, I need at least 5 cells.

But since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, the minimal number of cells needed is the maximum of the two, which is 5.

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an overlap or some diagonals that cannot be covered simultaneously.

Alternatively, maybe some diagonals can only be covered by specific cells.

I need to consider the structure of the grid.

In a 3x3 grid:

- Main diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal with cells (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,3)

- Diagonal with cells (3,1)

- Anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (3,3)

So, in total, 10 diagonals.

Now, to cover all 10 diagonals, I need to cover all these main and anti-diagonals.

Looking at the main diagonals:

- To cover the main diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), I can choose any of these cells.

- Similarly, for other diagonals.

But some diagonals only have one cell, like (1,3), (3,1), (1,1), (3,3).

So, to cover these single-cell diagonals, I have to color those cells.

In n=3:

- Main diagonals with one cell: (1,3), (3,1)

- Anti-diagonals with one cell: (1,1), (3,3)

So, to cover these four diagonals, I need to color these four cells.

Then, to cover the remaining diagonals, I need to color additional cells.

Wait, in n=3, there are main diagonals with two cells: (1,2),(2,3) and (2,1),(3,2)

Similarly, anti-diagonals with two cells: (1,2),(2,1) and (2,3),(3,2)

So, if I color the four cells (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), I cover four main and four anti-diagonals.

Then, I need to cover one more main and one more anti-diagonal.

So, I need to color two more cells to cover the remaining main and anti-diagonals.

Thus, total cells colored: 6.

This matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is equal to the number of single-cell diagonals plus ceil((k - number of single-cell diagonals)/2).

Wait, in n=3, number of single-cell diagonals: 4 (main:2, anti:2)

Then, for k=10, min_ cells = 4 + ceil((10 - 4)/2) = 4 + 3 = 7, which is not matching the sample output of 6.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's the number of main diagonals with one cell plus the number of anti-diagonals with one cell.

In n=3:

- Main diagonals with one cell: 2

- Anti-diagonals with one cell: 2

Total single-cell diagonals: 4

But as per above, coloring these four cells covers four main and four anti-diagonals.

Then, to cover the remaining main and anti-diagonals, which are 5 - 2 = 3 each, I need to cover 3 main and 3 anti-diagonals with additional cells.

Each additional cell can cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, to cover 3 main and 3 anti-diagonals, I need ceil(3) = 3 cells.

Thus, total cells: 4 + 3 = 7, but sample output is 6.

Still not matching.

Maybe I'm double-counting some diagonals.

Wait, perhaps some diagonals are already covered by the single-cell diagonals.

Let me think again.

In n=3:

- Main diagonals:

- Diagonal with 3 cells: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonals with 2 cells: (1,2), (2,3); (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonals with 1 cell: (1,3), (3,1)

- Anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal with 3 cells: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonals with 2 cells: (1,2), (2,1); (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonals with 1 cell: (1,1), (3,3)

Now, if I color the four cells: (1,3), (3,1), (1,1), (3,3), I cover:

- Main diagonals: (1,3), (3,1), (1,1), (3,3)

- Anti-diagonals: (1,3), (3,1), (1,1), (3,3)

So, I've covered four main diagonals and four anti-diagonals.

Wait, but there are only five main diagonals and five anti-diagonals.

So, I still need to cover one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Which are the diagonals with two cells: (1,2), (2,3) for main diagonals, and (1,2), (2,1) for anti-diagonals.

So, to cover these, I need to color one cell from each of these diagonals.

But, by coloring one cell from the diagonal (1,2), (2,3), I cover one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Similarly, coloring one cell from (1,2), (2,1), I cover another main and anti-diagonal.

Wait, but I only need to cover one more main and one more anti-diagonal.

So, coloring one cell from (1,2), (2,3) covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

Then, coloring one cell from (2,3), (3,2) covers another main and anti-diagonal.

Wait, but I only need to cover one more main and one more anti-diagonal.

So, perhaps coloring one cell from (1,2), (2,3) covers the remaining main and anti-diagonal.

Thus, total cells: 4 (single-cell diagonals) + 2 (for the remaining diagonals) = 6, which matches the sample output.

So, in general, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is equal to the number of single-cell diagonals plus ceil((number of main diagonals - number of single-cell main diagonals)/1) + ceil((number of anti-diagonals - number of single-cell anti-diagonals)/1), but adjusted for overlaps.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Let me think in terms of the number of main and anti-diagonals that need to be covered.

Let p be the number of main diagonals to cover, and q be the number of anti-diagonals to cover, such that p + q >= k.

But I need to minimize the number of cells, each covering one main and one anti-diagonal.

This seems similar to covering rows and columns in a matrix with minimal number of lines.

In that case, the minimal number of cells needed is max(p, q), because each cell can cover one row and one column.

Wait, perhaps in this context, the minimal number of cells needed is max(p, q).

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, p=5 and q=5, so max(p,q)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(p, q) + abs(p - q).

But for p=5, q=5, it would be 5 + 0 = 5, which again doesn't match the sample output of 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some diagonals only have one cell, which must be colored.

So, the number of single-cell diagonals must be colored individually, and then for the remaining diagonals, I can cover them in pairs.

Wait, in n=3:

- Number of single-cell main diagonals: 2

- Number of single-cell anti-diagonals: 2

- Total single-cell diagonals: 4

Then, to cover the remaining main diagonals: 5 - 2 = 3

And remaining anti-diagonals: 5 - 2 = 3

So, total cells needed: 4 (for single-cell diagonals) + ceil(3/1) + ceil(3/1) = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10, which is way more than the sample output of 6.

This approach is not working.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1.

But in the problem, it's stated that there are 4n - 2 diagonals, which matches 2*(2n - 1).

So, total diagonals = 4n - 2.

Now, I need to cover at least k diagonals with minimal cells.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, in general, each cell can cover two unique diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I would need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, there must be a dependency between the diagonals that requires more cells.

Perhaps some diagonals share cells, making it impossible to cover them independently.

In that case, I need to find a way to cover the required diagonals with minimal overlap.

Alternatively, maybe there is a threshold where simply ceil(k / 2) doesn't suffice.

Looking back at the sample input for n=4 and k=7, ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches the sample output.

For n=3 and k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, which matches the sample output.

But for n=3 and k=10, it's 6, which is more than ceil(10 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps when k exceeds a certain value related to n, I need to add extra cells.

Let me see: for n=3, total diagonals=10.

For k=9, output=5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

For k=10, output=6, which is more than ceil(10 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps when k > 2n - 1, I need to add extra cells.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1=5.

But in the sample input, for
