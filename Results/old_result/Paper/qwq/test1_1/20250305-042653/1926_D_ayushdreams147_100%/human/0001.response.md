Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. If two numbers are in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all bit positions from 1 to 31. Essentially, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y should have all bits set to 1 from position 1 to 31. Since we're dealing with 31 bits, the XOR of x and y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1, which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

Wait, actually, no. Let's think carefully. If two numbers x and y have all their bits different from position 1 to 31, then x XOR y should indeed be (1 << 31) - 1, because XORing two different bits results in 1, and same bits result in 0. So, if all bits are different, XOR should be all 1s in those positions.

So, for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Now, I need to find the minimum number of groups such that this condition is satisfied in each group.

This sounds like a graph coloring problem where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if their XOR is not equal to (1 << 31) - 1, meaning they cannot be in the same group. The goal is to find the chromatic number of this graph, which is the minimum number of colors (groups) needed to color the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

However, building such a graph explicitly would be inefficient for large n, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4. So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of the XOR operation here. If I have three numbers a, b, and c in the same group, then:

a XOR b = (1 << 31) - 1

a XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1

b XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1

Wait, if a XOR b = (1 << 31) - 1 and a XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1, then b XOR c = (a XOR b) XOR (a XOR c) = b XOR a XOR a XOR c = c XOR b, which is (1 << 31) - 1 XOR (1 << 31) - 1 = 0. But b XOR c should be (1 << 31) - 1 according to the condition, but here it's 0, which is a contradiction.

This suggests that in any group, there can be at most two numbers, because if there are three, the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let's look back at the problem statement.

It says: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I considered three numbers, and found a contradiction, suggesting that groups can have at most two elements. But that can't be right because the sample inputs have groups with more than two numbers.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, a=[0, 2147483647]. 2147483647 is (1 << 31) - 1, which is all 1's in 31 bits. 0 is all 0's. So, 0 and 2147483647 differ in all 31 bits, so they can be in the same group. Output is 1, meaning only one group is needed.

In the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4]. Let's look at their binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

But we need to consider all 31 bits, but for simplicity, let's consider these.

Pairwise:

1 and 4: 001 and 100 -> differ in all bits.

1 and 3: 001 and 011 -> same in bit positions where both have 1.

4 and 3: 100 and 011 -> differ in all bits.

So, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have matching 1's in the least significant bit.

So, groups:

- Group 1: 1 and 4

- Group 2: 3 and 4

Wait, but 4 is in both groups, but 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group.

Wait, actually, 4 is in both groups, but 1 and 3 are not in the same group.

But in group 1: 1 and 4 differ in all bits.

In group 2: 3 and 4 differ in all bits.

But 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have matching bits.

So, to minimize the number of groups, we need to maximize the number of elements in each group.

But from the above, it seems like each group can have multiple elements, as long as any two elements in the group differ in all bit positions from 1 to 31.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample input.

Looking back:

So, in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4], output=4, meaning each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, n=2, a=[0, 2147483647], output=1, meaning both numbers can be in the same group.

So, in the first test case, why do we need 4 groups? Because some numbers cannot be grouped together due to matching bits in some positions.

Looking at the numbers:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

Comparing:

1 and 4: differ in all bits (positions 1,2,3)

1 and 3: same in bit position 3 (both have 1)

4 and 3: differ in all bits

So, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have the same bit in position 3.

Similarly, if we try to group 1 and 4, and then 3 and 4, but 4 is already in two groups, which is allowed, but we need each number to be in exactly one group.

Wait, no, each number must be in exactly one group. So, 4 can't be in two different groups.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of graph coloring, where numbers are nodes, and edges connect numbers that cannot be in the same group.

So, in the first test case:

- 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group (edge between 1 and 3)

- All others can be in the same group as long as they don't have edges.

Wait, but 4 can be with 1, and 4 can be with 3, but 1 and 3 cannot be together.

So, this forms a graph where 1 and 3 are connected, and 4 is connected to both 1 and 3.

Wait, but according to the condition, if two numbers differ in all bit positions, they can be in the same group.

Wait, no, the condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be equal to (1 << 31) - 1, which is all 1's in 31 bits.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 and 4 have different bits in all positions, so their XOR is 101, which is 5, not equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, (1 << 31) - 1 is 0x7FFFFFFF, which is 32 bits with the 32nd bit being 0.

But in Python, integers can be larger than 32 bits, but we're only considering the last 31 bits.

Wait, the problem says "from bits 1st to 31st bit", indexing from 1 to 31, so we're considering the least significant 31 bits.

So, for two numbers x and y, for all i from 1 to 31, x_2(i) != y_2(i).

This means that for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations differ in all of the last 31 bits.

So, their XOR must be equal to (1 << 31) - 1, which is 0x7FFFFFFF.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 XOR 4 is 5, which is not equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says in the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4], and output=4, meaning each number in its own group.

Wait, but 1 and 4 differ in all bits, as do 3 and 4, but 1 and 3 have the same bit in position 1 (LSB).

So, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group, but 1 and 4 can be in the same group, and 3 and 4 can be in the same group.

But since each number must be in exactly one group, and 4 is in both potential groups, we need to split them.

So, one possible grouping is:

- Group 1: 1 and 4

- Group 2: 3 and 4

But 4 is in both groups, which is not allowed, as each number must be in exactly one group.

So, we need to assign 4 to only one group.

So, if we put 4 in Group 1 with 1, then 3 must go to Group 2, and the second 4 must go to Group 3, but since 4 is duplicate, it should go to Group 1 or Group 2, but Group 1 already has 4 with 1, and Group 2 has 3.

But the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

So, perhaps the condition is stricter than I thought.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 XOR 4 is 5, which is not equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.

So, maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are different, meaning their XOR must be equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.

So, in the first test case, 1 XOR 4 is 5, which is not equal to 0x7FFFFFFF, so they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, in the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group.

Wait, but 1 and 4 have different bits in all positions.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample explanation.

Looking back:

"In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group."

So, for the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4], output=4.

Wait, perhaps in this case, some numbers have the same bits in some positions, so they cannot be grouped together.

Wait, let's look at the binary representations of the numbers in the first test case:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

So, 1 and 4 differ in all bits.

1 and 3 differ in bit position 2.

3 and 4 differ in all bits.

So, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have the same bit in position 1.

Similarly, 4 and 3 can be in the same group, and 4 and 1 can be in the same group.

But since 4 is duplicated, and we cannot have the same number in multiple groups, we need to assign each 4 to a different group.

So, possible grouping:

- Group 1: 1 and 4

- Group 2: 3 and 4

But since there are two 4's, we can assign one 4 to Group 1 with 1, and the other 4 to Group 2 with 3.

But the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Wait, maybe because the two 4's are indistinct, but the problem says "non-negative integers", so duplicates are allowed, and each occurrence is distinct in the list.

Wait, no, in programming terms, even if the values are the same, they are distinct elements in the array.

But in this case, perhaps having two identical numbers requires them to be in separate groups because they have the same bits in all positions.

Wait, but the problem allows non-negative integers, including duplicates.

Wait, if two numbers are identical, they have the same bits in all positions, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, identical numbers must be in different groups.

In the first test case, there are two 4's, so they need to be in different groups.

Additionally, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have matching bits in some positions.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is 4.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, a=[0, 2147483647], output=1.

0 is
