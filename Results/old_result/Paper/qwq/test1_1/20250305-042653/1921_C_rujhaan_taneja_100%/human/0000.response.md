Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the start, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time just for being on. Additionally, he can choose to turn the phone off and on again, which costs b units of charge each time he does that.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone running out of charge. The phone starts at moment 0, and he can turn it on and off at any moments, including the same moment he sends a message.

First, I need to understand the charge consumption mechanics.

1. **Phone On:** For every unit of time the phone is on, it loses a units of charge.

2. **Turning Off and On:** Each time he turns the phone off and then on again, it costs b units of charge. This is an additional cost separate from the charge lost while the phone is on.

Also, it's important to note that turning the phone on and off is instantaneous, meaning he can do it at the same moment as sending a message.

The constraint is that the phone's charge must be greater than zero at the moment a message is sent.

Given that, I need to find a strategy for when to turn the phone on and off to minimize charge consumption and ensure that there's enough charge to send all messages.

Let me think about this step by step.

**Initial Thoughts:**

- If Stepan keeps the phone on the entire time from moment 0 to the last message, the charge consumed would be a * m_n, where m_n is the time of the last message. If f >= a * m_n, he can send all messages without turning the phone off. But this might not be the most efficient way.

- Alternatively, he can turn the phone off between sending messages to save on the continuous charge drain, but each time he does this, there's a b unit cost for turning it off and on again.

So, there's a trade-off between keeping the phone on longer, incurring a * time charge, or turning it off and on, incurring b units each time.

I need to find the optimal way to manage the phone's on and off states to minimize the total charge used, and check if that total is less than or equal to the initial charge f.

**Approach:**

To minimize charge consumption, Stepan should aim to keep the phone off as much as possible, but he needs to turn it on to send messages. The challenge is to minimize the time the phone is on and the number of times he turns it off and on.

One way to model this is to consider the intervals between message sending moments and decide whether to keep the phone on during those intervals or turn it off and on again before the next message.

Let's consider the moments m1, m2, ..., mn.

- At m1, he needs to have the phone on to send the first message.

- Between m1 and m2, he can choose to keep the phone on, in which case the charge consumed is a * (m2 - m1).

- Or, he can turn the phone off immediately after m1 and turn it on at m2, incurring a cost of b for turning it off and on, plus a * (m2 - m1) if he keeps it on from m2 onwards.

Wait, no. If he turns the phone off after m1 and turns it on at m2, the cost is b (for turning it off and on again), plus a * (m2 - m1) if he keeps it on from m2 to m3, and so on.

Actually, turning the phone off and on again at each message might not be optimal because each transition costs b units, which could be more or less than keeping it on for the interval.

I need a better way to model this.

**Optimal Strategy:**

I recall that in similar problems, the optimal strategy often involves keeping the phone on for multiple message intervals if the charge consumed is less than the cost of turning it off and on again.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose Stepan keeps the phone on from mi to mj (where j > i), the charge consumed for this period is a * (mj - mi).

If he chooses to turn the phone off after mi and turn it on at mj, the charge consumed is b (for turning it off and on) + a * (mj - mi).

So, it's better to keep the phone on from mi to mj if a * (mj - mi) < b, because that way he saves b - a*(mj - mi) units of charge.

Conversely, it's better to turn the phone off after mi and turn it on at mj if b < a * (mj - mi), because turning it off and on costs less than keeping it on for the interval.

Wait, but turning it off and on costs b units, plus a * (mj - mi) to keep it on from mj to mj, but since he's turning it on at mj, he needs to consider the charge for sending the message at mj.

I need to be careful here.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that between any two messages mi and mi+1, the charge consumed if the phone is kept on is a * (mi+1 - mi).

If he turns the phone off after mi and turns it on at mi+1, the charge consumed is b (for turning it off and on) + a * (mi+1 - mi).

Wait, no. When he turns the phone off after mi and turns it on at mi+1, the charge consumed is b (for turning it off and on), plus a * (mi+1 - mi) if he keeps it on from mi+1 to mi+1 (i.e., just for sending the message at mi+1).

But actually, at mi+1, he needs to have the phone on to send the message, so he has to bear the a * (mi+1 - mi) charge if he keeps it on from mi to mi+1, or b + a * (mi+1 - mi) if he turns it off at mi and on at mi+1.

Therefore, it's cheaper to keep the phone on from mi to mi+1 if a * (mi+1 - mi) < b, because keeping it on costs less than turning it off and on again.

Similarly, it's better to turn it off and on if b < a * (mi+1 - mi), because turning it off and on costs less.

If a * (mi+1 - mi) == b, it's indifferent.

So, the optimal strategy is to group messages into batches where the interval between consecutive messages in the batch is small enough that keeping the phone on is cheaper than turning it off and on.

Specifically, keep the phone on from mi to mj if a * (mj - mi) < b, and otherwise turn it off between batches.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of greedy merging of intervals.

Let me consider the messages as points on a timeline, and try to group them into sequences where keeping the phone on is cheaper than turning it off and on between each message.

So, I can iterate through the messages and decide whether to keep the phone on to the next message or to turn it off and on again at the next message.

I can maintain a current charge level and see if I can afford the next operation.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate the total minimal charge required for the optimal strategy.

Let me try to formalize this.

**Total Charge Calculation:**

To find the minimal charge required, I can consider the phone starting at moment 0 with f units of charge.

I need to send messages at m1, m2, ..., mn.

Between m0=0 and m1, if the phone is kept on, it consumes a * m1 units of charge.

If the phone is turned off at some point before m1 and turned on at m1, it consumes b units for turning it off and on, plus a * (m1 - t) where t is the time when it's turned on.

But since turning on is instantaneous, and he needs to send the message at m1, he can turn it on at m1, incurring b units, and then send the message, consuming a * (m1 - t), but t = m1, so a * 0 = 0.

Wait, no.

Actually, since the phone loses a units per unit time it is on, and turning on is instantaneous, at m1, turning it on costs b units, and then sending the message at m1 costs a * (m1 - t), but t = m1, so a * 0 = 0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me think differently.

At moment 0, the phone is on, with f units of charge.

At moment m1, he needs to send a message, so the phone must be on at m1.

The charge at m1 is f - a * m1.

He can choose to turn the phone off after m1 and turn it on again at m2, incurring an additional b units.

Alternatively, he can keep the phone on from m1 to m2, consuming a * (m2 - m1) units.

I need to decide for each interval whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each message, I decide whether to keep the phone on from the previous message or to turn it off and on again.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) time.

Let me see if I can find a way to calculate the minimal charge required in O(n) time.

Let me consider the charge required for each message, considering the previous decisions.

At m1:

- If the phone was kept on from 0 to m1: charge consumed = a * m1

- If the phone was turned off at some t < m1 and turned on at m1: charge consumed = b + a * (m1 - t)

But since t = m1, a * (m1 - t) = 0, so total charge is b.

So, the minimal charge to send m1 is min(a * m1, b).

Wait, but in the first case, he keeps the phone on from 0 to m1, consuming a * m1.

In the second case, he turns it off at some t < m1 and turns it on at m1, consuming b.

But actually, since the phone starts at moment 0 and is on, to turn it off and on at m1 would consume b units, plus a * m1 to keep it on from m1 to m1 (which is 0), so total b units.

So, minimal charge for m1 is min(a * m1, b).

Now, for m2:

- If the phone was kept on from m1 to m2: charge consumed = a * (m2 - m1)

- If the phone was turned off after m1 and turned on at m2: charge consumed = b + a * (m2 - m1)

Wait, but similar to m1, if he turns it off after m1 and turns it on at m2, the charge consumed is b (for turning it off and on) plus a * (m2 - m1) to keep it on from m2 to m2, which is 0, so total b.

So, the minimal charge to go from m1 to m2 is min(a * (m2 - m1), b).

Similarly, for each consecutive pair mi and mi+1, the minimal charge to go from mi to mi+1 is min(a * (mi+1 - mi), b).

Then, the total minimal charge is the sum over all i from 1 to n of min(a * (mi - previous), b), where previous is m(i-1).

Wait, but for m1, previous is 0.

So, total minimal charge is sum from i=1 to n of min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b), where m0 = 0.

Is that correct?

Let me check with the first test case:

Test case 1:

1 3 1 5

3

So, n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m1=3

Total minimal charge = min(a * m1, b) = min(1*3, 5) = 3

Since f=3 >= 3, should output Yes.

But in the explanation, it says NO.

Wait, that's contradictory.

Wait, in the explanation, it says that with f=3, a=1, b=5, m1=3.

If he keeps the phone on from 0 to 3: charge consumed = 1*3 = 3, which is equal to f, but at moment 3, charge is 0, which is <=0, so cannot send the message.

If he turns it off at some t < 3 and turns it on at 3: charge consumed = 5, which is > f=3, so not possible.

Hence, it should be NO.

But according to my earlier formula, sum of min(a*(m1 - 0), b) = min(3,5) =3 <=3, so Yes.

But according to the explanation, it's NO.

So, my formula is incorrect.

What's the issue here?

The problem is that when the phone's charge drops to 0 at the moment of sending a message, it's invalid.

So, in the first case, if he keeps the phone on from 0 to 3, at moment 3, charge is f - a*3 = 0, which is <=0, so cannot send the message.

Hence, it should be NO.

But according to my formula, it's sum of min(a*(m1 - m0), b) = min(3,5) =3 <= f=3, so Yes.

So, my formula doesn't account for the fact that at the moment of sending the message, the charge must be >0.

Hence, I need to adjust the formula to ensure that at each message sending moment, the charge is strictly positive.

So, perhaps for each message, I need to ensure that the charge is at least a small positive amount before sending the message.

Wait, more precisely, at the moment of sending the message, the charge should be >0.

In the case where he keeps the phone on from mi-1 to mi, the charge at mi is f - a*(mi - m(i-1)), but he needs to have strictly positive charge at mi to send the message.

So, actually, the charge just before sending the message at mi is f - a*(mi - m(i-1)), and to send the message, it must be >0.

Similarly, if he turns the phone off after mi-1 and turns it on at mi, the charge at mi is f - cost to turn it off and on - a*(mi - m(i-1)), but again, it must be >0.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that after all operations, the charge is still >0 at the moment of sending the message.

This complicates things.

Maybe I need to track the charge step by step.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that to send a message at mi, the phone must be on at that moment, and the charge must be >0.

Between messages, the phone can be on or off, depending on the strategy.

I need to find a strategy where the total charge consumed is minimized, and the charge at each message sending moment is >0.

This sounds like a cumulative charge consumption problem, where I need to ensure that at each message, the remaining charge is greater than 0.

I can calculate the cumulative charge consumed up to each message and ensure that just before sending the message, the charge is at least a small positive value.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total minimal charge required using the earlier formula, but adjust it to ensure that at each message, the charge is >0.

So, for each message mi, calculate the charge consumed up to mi, and ensure that after that consumption, the charge is still >0.

Wait, but this might be tricky.

Let me consider the cumulative charge consumed up to each message, based on the optimal strategy.

I can iterate through the messages, keeping track of the charge consumed so far, and ensure that before sending each message, the remaining charge is >0.

But I need to find the minimal charge required for the entire sequence.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define the total minimal charge required as the sum over all i from 1 to n of min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b), where m0 = 0.

But as seen in the first test case, this doesn't account for the charge being exactly 0 at the moment of sending the message.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to ensure that the charge is strictly positive at the moment of sending the message.

One way to do this is to consider that for each message, the charge must be at least a small positive epsilon just before sending the message.

But in practice, since charge is continuous and we're dealing with discrete moments, I need to ensure that after consuming the charge up to mi, the remaining charge is >0.

In other words, f - total_consumed_up_to_mi > 0.

Wait, but in the first test case, f=3, total_consumed_up_to_m1=3, so f - total_consumed_up_to_m1 = 0, which is not >0.

Hence, it should be NO.

So, perhaps the correct total minimal charge required is sum over all i from 1 to n of min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b) + a * epsilon, but that's not practical.

Instead, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to include an additional a * delta for each message to ensure that the charge is >0 at the moment of sending.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each message, the charge must be strictly positive at the moment of sending.

So, for each message mi, the charge just before sending the message is f - consumed_up_to_mi.

To ensure that the charge is >0 at mi, we need f - consumed_up_to_mi >0, i.e., consumed_up_to_mi < f.

But this is for each message, not just the total.

So, I need to ensure that at each message, the cumulative consumed charge is less than f.

Hence, the total minimal charge required should be less than f.

But in the first test case, total minimal charge is 3, which is equal to f=3, but since the charge at m1 is 0, which is not >0, it should be NO.

Hence, perhaps the total minimal charge required should be strictly less than f.

Wait, but that's not accurate either, because in some cases, total minimal charge equal to f might still allow for positive charge at the moment of sending the last message.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the cumulative charge consumed up to each message and ensure that at each message, the remaining charge is >0.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm:

1. Initialize total_consumed = 0

2. For each message mi (i from 1 to n):

a. Calculate the minimal charge to reach mi from m(i-1):

i. Option 1: keep the phone on from m(i-1) to mi -> a * (mi - m(i-1))

ii. Option 2: turn the phone off after m(i-1) and turn it on at mi -> b

iii. Choose the minimum of these two: min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b)

b. Add this minimal charge to total_consumed

c. Check if f - total_consumed > 0

i. If not, output NO

3. If all messages pass this check, output YES

But in the first test case, total_consumed = min(1*3, 5) =3

f - total_consumed = 3 - 3 =0, which is not >0, so NO

In the third test case:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

m: 1 2 3 4 5

total_consumed = min(1*(1-0),2) =1

total_consumed += min(1*(2-1),2) =1

total_consumed += min(1*(3-2),2) =1

total_consumed += min(1*(4-3),2) =1

total_consumed += min(1*(5-4),2) =1

total_consumed =5

f - total_consumed =10 -5=5>0, so YES

But according to the sample output, it's YES.

Another test case:

n=1, f=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

m:1000000000

total_consumed = min(1000000000*(1000000000 -0), 1000000000)

which is 1000000000

f - total_consumed =1000000000 -1000000000=0, which is not >0, so NO

Sample output is NO.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the condition should be that the total minimal charge required is strictly less than f.

Wait, but in the third test case, total minimal charge is 5, f=10, 10 -5=5>0, which is OK.

In the first test case, total minimal charge is 3, f=3, 3-3=0, which is not >0, so NO.

Seems correct.

Hence, the algorithm is to calculate the sum of min(a*(mi - m(i-1)), b) for all i from 1 to n, and check if this sum is strictly less than f.

Wait, but in the third test case, sum is 5, f=10, 10 -5=5>0, which is OK.

In the first test case, sum is 3, f=3, 3 -3=0, which is not >0, so NO.

Seems correct.

Hence, the condition should be sum < f.

But in the problem statement, it says "the charge level drops to 0 (becomes <=0)", so at any moment, if charge <=0, it's invalid.

Hence, to ensure that at each message sending moment, charge >0, we need f - total_consumed >0, i.e., total_consumed < f.

Hence, the condition is sum < f.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum=3, f=3, sum < f is false, so NO.

In the third test case, sum=5, f=10, sum <10, so YES.

Seems correct.

Hence, the program should calculate sum over all i from 1 to n of min(a*(mi - m(i-1)), b), and if sum < f, output YES, else NO.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

test_cases = int(input())

for i in range(test_cases):

feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

n = feat[0]

f = feat[1]

a = feat[2]

b = feat[-1]

arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

array2 = []

for i in range(0, n):

if i == 0:

if arr[0] < b / a:

array2.append(arr[0] * a)

elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:

array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)

if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

Let's see what this program is doing.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, f, a, b, and the array of message moments.

Then, it initializes an empty list array2.

Then, for each message from i=0 to n-1:

- If i==0:

- If arr[0] < b / a, append arr[0] * a to array2.

- Else, if arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a, append (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a to array2.

Then, it sums array2 and adds (n - len(array2)) * b, and checks if this is less than f.

If yes, prints 'Yes', else 'No'.

Wait, this seems similar to my earlier approach, but with a condition involving b / a.

I need to understand why it's checking if arr[0] < b / a.

Let's think about b / a.

b / a can be interpreted as the time for which the charge consumed by keeping the phone on equals b.

In other words, a * t = b => t = b / a.

So, if the time between mi and m(i-1) is less than b / a, it's cheaper to keep the phone on than to turn it off and on.

Hence, in the program, it's checking if the time difference is less than b / a, and if so, it adds a * (time difference) to array2, else it considers adding b.

Then, it sums array2 and adds (n - len(array2)) * b.

Wait, but in the loop, it only appends to array2 when the time difference is less than b / a.

Hence, array2 contains the a * (time difference) for intervals where it's cheaper to keep the phone on, and for the remaining intervals, it assumes turning off and on, adding b for each such interval.

Wait, but in the code, it's sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b.

But is this correct?

Let's see.

In the first iteration, for i=0:

- If arr[0] < b / a, append arr[0] * a to array2.

For i >=1:

- If arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a, append (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a to array2.

Then, it sums array2 and adds (n - len(array2)) * b.

This seems to be summing the charge for keeping the phone on for intervals where it's cheaper, and adding b for the other intervals.

But wait, in the total minimal charge, it should be sum over all i of min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b).

But in this code, it's summing a * (mi - m(i-1)) for intervals where mi - m(i-1) < b / a, and adding b for the remaining intervals.

This is equivalent to summing min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b) for all i.

Because:

- If mi - m(i-1) < b / a, then a * (mi - m(i-1)) < b, so min is a * (mi - m(i-1))

- Else, min is b.

Hence, the code is correctly calculating the sum of min(a * (mi - m(i-1)), b) for all i from 1 to n.

Then, it checks if this sum < f.

If yes, print 'Yes', else 'No'.

Which aligns with my earlier conclusion.

Hence, this program should be correct.

Let's verify with the sample input.

Sample Input:

6

1 3 1 5

Sample Output:

YES

Let's take the first test case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m:3

sum = min(1*3, 5) =3

3 < 3 ? No, so output 'No'

Correct.

Third test case:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

m:1 2 3 4 5

sum = min(1*1,2) + min(1*1,2) + min(1*1,2) + min(1*1,2) + min(1*1,2) =1+1+1+1+1=5

5 <10, so 'Yes'

Correct.

Fourth test case:

n=1, f=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

m:1000000000

sum = min(1000000000*1000000000, 1000000000) =1000000000

1000000000 <1000000000? No, so 'No'

Correct.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But in the problem statement, it mentions that in the third test case, it's possible to send all messages with f=10, which aligns with the program's output.

Also, in the first test case, it's not possible, again aligning with the program.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
