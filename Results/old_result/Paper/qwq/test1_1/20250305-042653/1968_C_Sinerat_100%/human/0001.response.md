Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a, given x. And there can be multiple possible a arrays, but I just need to find any one that satisfies the conditions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

a_3 % a_2 = 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3.

a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output:

a = [2, 5, 11]

Check:

5 % 2 = 1, matches x_2.

11 % 5 = 1, matches x_3.

Good.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such an array a given x.

Let me think about the relationship between a_i and a_{i-1}.

We have x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

This means that a_i is equal to k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >= 0.

But since a_i can be at most 10^9, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, I need to choose k such that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

But to make things simple, maybe I can choose the smallest possible a_i for each step.

Let's consider setting a_{i-1} as small as possible, but still satisfying the constraints.

Wait, but a_{i-1} is used to compute a_i, and a_{i-1} depends on a_{i-2}, and so on.

Maybe I should start from a_1 and build up the array.

Let me try to choose a_1 arbitrarily, within the constraints, and then compute subsequent a_i based on x_i and a_{i-1}.

But a_1 has no a_0, so it's independent, as long as it's between 1 and 10^9.

Looking back at the examples, a_1 is chosen as 3 in the first example, 2 in the second.

Is there a pattern in how a_1 is chosen?

Wait, maybe a_1 can be set to x_2 + 1, since a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

If a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2, and I choose k = 1, then a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Then a_2 % a_1 = (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2, which matches.

Similarly, for a_3 = k * a_2 + x_3.

If I choose k = 1 again, a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

Then a_3 % a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) % a_2 = x_3.

This seems to work.

So, a general approach could be:

1. Set a_1 to some value, say x_2 + 1, as long as it's within 1 to 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This should satisfy x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

Let me check this with the first example.

Set a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Then a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

Wait, but in the example, a_3 is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the example chose different values.

In the first test case, a = [3,5,4,9].

Wait, according to my approach, a_1 = 3, a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5, a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9, a_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But in the example, a_3 is 4, not 9, and a_4 is 9.

Hmm, so my approach doesn't match the example.

But the example still satisfies the conditions.

So, maybe there are multiple solutions, and my approach is just one way.

But in the first test case, a_3 is 4, which is less than a_2=5, and 4 % 5 =4, which matches x_3=4.

Similarly, a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4, and 9%4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, it's possible to have a_i less than a_{i-1} as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

In my approach, I set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, which guarantees a_i > a_{i-1} if x_i >0, but it's not necessary for a_i to be greater than a_{i-1}.

So, perhaps there are multiple possibilities, and in some cases, a_i can be less than a_{i-1}.

But to make things simple, maybe sticking to a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is a safe choice, as it always satisfies the condition, and a_i won't be too large.

Given that n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, a_i could be up to around 500*500=250,000, which is well within 10^9.

But in the first test case, the example chose a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, but it still works because 4 % 5 =4.

So, it's allowed, but maybe setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is easier to handle.

Let me see if there are any constraints where this approach might fail.

Suppose x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, in the modulo operation, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which implies that a_i >= x_i, and a_i < a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, no, actually, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i means that a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >=0.

So, a_i could be x_i (when k=0), or x_i + a_{i-1}, or x_i + 2*a_{i-1}, and so on.

But to keep a_i within 10^9, I should choose the smallest possible a_i, which would be a_{i-1} + x_i, assuming x_i < a_{i-1}.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i could be x_i itself, since x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}, but wait, that might not match x_i.

Wait, no, if a_i = x_i, then a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}, which needs to be equal to x_i.

But x_i >= a_{i-1}, so x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}, which is less than a_{i-1}.

But we need x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which is only possible if x_i < a_{i-1}.

Therefore, to have x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be x_i + m*a_{i-1} for some integer m >=1, such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But to keep a_i as small as possible, I can set a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}, but only if x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then setting a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} would make a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, because (x_i + a_{i-1}) % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1} + a_{i-1} % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1} + 0 = x_i % a_{i-1}.

But since x_i >= a_{i-1}, x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}, which is less than a_{i-1}.

Wait, but we need a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}, which should equal x_i.

But x_i - a_{i-1} != x_i unless a_{i-1} ==0, which is not possible since a_{i-1} >=1.

This seems confusing.

Let me think differently.

If x_i < a_{i-1}, then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i ensures a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be greater than x_i, and a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, a_i could be x_i + m*a_{i-1}, for some integer m >=1.

In this case, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

To keep a_i as small as possible, I can set m=1, so a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}.

But in this case, a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}, and x_i >= a_{i-1}, so a_i >= 2*a_{i-1}.

This should still be fine as long as a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

Let me check with an example where x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Suppose a_{i-1} =2, x_i=3.

Then a_i =3 +2=5, and 5%2=1, which is not equal to x_i=3.

Wait, but 3 >=2, so according to earlier logic, a_i =3 +2=5, but 5%2=1 !=3.

This is a problem.

Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Let me think again.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But since x_i >= a_{i-1}, and a_i % a_{i-1} is always less than a_{i-1}, this is impossible unless a_{i-1} divides a_i - x_i.

Wait, no, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i means that a_i - x_i is divisible by a_{i-1}.

So, a_i - x_i must be a multiple of a_{i-1}.

Therefore, a_i = x_i + k*a_{i-1}, for some integer k >=0.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}, so to have a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, we need x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the earlier example, when x_i >= a_{i-1}, setting a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} gives a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, but in the case where x_i >= a_{i-1}, this doesn't hold.

Wait, in the earlier example with a_{i-1}=2, x_i=3, setting a_i=5, but 5%2=1 !=3.

So, my approach fails here.

What's the issue?

Let's see:

We have a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i - a_{i-1}.

But we need a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, unless x_i < a_{i-1}, this doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a_{i-1} > x_i.

But in the problem statement, it's allowed that x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the modulo operation, a_i % a_{i-1} is always less than a_{i-1}.

So, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then it's impossible to have a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, because x_i >= a_{i-1}, but a_i % a_{i-1} < a_{i-1}.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, no, the problem says x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

So, x_i must be less than a_{i-1}.

But in the input, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so if x_i >= a_{i-1}, it's a problem.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so as long as a_{i-1} > x_i, it's fine.

But in the earlier example where a_{i-1}=2 and x_i=3, x_i > a_{i-1}, which would make it impossible to satisfy a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, perhaps in such cases, I need to choose a_{i-1} such that a_{i-1} > x_i.

But a_{i-1} is determined by previous steps.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I need to set a_1 to be larger than any x_i.

Since a_1 is independent, I can choose it to be larger than the maximum x_i.

Given that x_i <=500, I can set a_1 to be, say, 1000, which is greater than 500.

Then, for each subsequent a_i, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This way, a_i > a_{i-1}, and a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, since (a_{i-1} + x_i) % a_{i-1} = x_i.

This should work as long as a_{i-1} > x_i.

Wait, in this approach, a_{i-1} > x_i because a_{i-1} was set to a_{i-2} + x_{i-2}, and so on, starting from a_1=1000, which is greater than any x_i.

So, as long as a_1 > max(x_i), and each a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, then a_i > a_{i-1} > x_i, and a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

This seems consistent.

Let me test this with the first test case.

Set a_1=1000.

Then a_2=1000 +2=1002.

a_3=1002 +4=1006.

a_4=1006 +1=1007.

Now, check:

a_2 % a_1 =1002 %1000=2, which matches x_2=2.

a_3 % a_2=1006%1002=4, matches x_3=4.

a_4 % a_3=1007%1006=1, matches x_4=1.

Perfect.

Another test case:

n=3

x=[1,1]

Set a_1=1000.

a_2=1000+1=1001.

a_3=1001+1=1002.

Check:

1001%1000=1, matches x_2=1.

1002%1001=1, matches x_3=1.

Good.

Another test case:

n=6

x=[4,2,5,1,2]

Set a_1=1000.

a_2=1000+4=1004.

a_3=1004+2=1006.

a_4=1006+5=1011.

a_5=1011+1=1012.

a_6=1012+2=1014.

Check:

1004%1000=4.

1006%1004=2.

1011%1006=5.

1012%1011=1.

1014%1012=2.

All match.

Seems solid.

Now, what if x_i=500 and a_{i-1}=500? Wait, according to the problem, 1 <= x_i <=500, and 1 <= a_i <=10^9.

But if a_{i-1}=500 and x_i=500, then a_i % a_{i-1} =500, but 500%500=0, which is not equal to 500.

This is a problem.

Wait, but according to modulo definition, any number modulo a_{i-1} is in the range [0, a_{i-1}-1].

So, if x_i = a_{i-1}, then there's no a_i that satisfies a_i % a_{i-1} = a_{i-1}, because a_i % a_{i-1} can never be equal to a_{i-1}.

Wait, but 0 % a_{i-1} =0, 1 % a_{i-1}=1, ..., (a_{i-1}-1) % a_{i-1}=a_{i-1}-1, and a_{i-1} % a_{i-1}=0.

So, x_i cannot be equal to a_{i-1}, because a_i % a_{i-1} cannot be a_{i-1}.

But in the problem constraints, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but in the approach where a_1=1000, and a_i=a_{i-1} + x_i, then a_{i-1} > x_i, since a_1=1000 and x_i <=500.

Wait, but if x_i=500 and a_{i-1}=1000, then a_i=1000+500=1500, and 1500%1000=500, which matches x_i=500.

Wait, but earlier I thought that a_i % a_{i-1} cannot be equal to a_{i-1}, but in this case, it is.

Wait, no, 1500 %1000=500, which is correct.

Wait, but according to modulo definition, c % d is in [0, d-1], but 1500 %1000=500, which is less than 1000, so it's valid.

Wait, but in general, c % d = c - floor(c/d)*d, which can be equal to d if c is a multiple of d, but in this case, 1500 %1000=500, not 0.

Wait, no, 1500 /1000=1.5, floor is 1, so 1500 -1*1000=500.

Similarly, 1000%1000=0.

So, in this approach, as long as a_{i-1} > x_i, which is true because a_1=1000 and x_i <=500, then a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i, and a_i % a_{i-1}=x_i.

This works.

But what if in some step, x_i = a_{i-1}? Wait, in this approach, a_{i-1}=1000, x_i=500, which is less than a_{i-1}, so it's fine.

But suppose x_i=1000, but in the problem constraints, x_i <=500, so it's impossible for x_i to be equal to a_{i-1} in this approach.

Therefore, this approach seems safe.

Let me check the sample input and output.

First test case:

n=4

x=[2,4,1]

Output:

3 5 4 9

As I saw earlier, this works.

But according to my approach, setting a_1=1000, a_2=1002, a_3=1006, a_4=1007.

Both are correct, but the example chose smaller numbers.

So, it's allowed to have larger numbers, as long as they are within 10^9.

So, my approach is valid.

Another test case:

n=2

x=[500]

Set a_1=1000

a_2=1000+500=1500

Check: 1500%1000=500, which matches x_2=500.

Good.

Another test case:

n=3

x=[1,5]

Set a_1=1000

a_2=1000+1=1001

a_3=1001+5=1006

Check:

1001%1000=1, matches x_2=1.

1006%1001=5, matches x_3=5.

Perfect.

So, in conclusion, setting a_1 to a value greater than any x_i, say 1000, and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n, satisfies the condition x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <=n.

This approach ensures that a_i > a_{i-1} > x_i, and thus a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Given that x_i <=500 and a_1=1000, this works.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
