Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a, given x. And there can be multiple possible a arrays, but I just need to find any one that satisfies the conditions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

a_3 % a_2 = 4 % 5 = 4, matches x_3.

a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, matches x_4.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output:

a = [2, 5, 11]

Check:

5 % 2 = 1, matches x_2.

11 % 5 = 1, matches x_3.

Good.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such an array a given x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I have x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} for i from 2 to n.

I need to choose a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that this holds, and each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

One way to think about this is to choose a_1 arbitrarily (within the constraints), and then choose each a_i based on a_{i-1} and x_i.

But I need to make sure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Let me recall that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i means that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

So, a_i can be expressed in terms of a_{i-1} and x_i.

This seems like a recursive relationship.

So, perhaps I can start with a_1, and then compute a_2 based on a_1 and x_2, then a_3 based on a_2 and x_3, and so on.

The question is, how to choose a_1?

Well, a_1 can be any value between 1 and 10^9, but it might affect the values of subsequent a_i.

I need to ensure that for each i, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Given that, perhaps choosing a_1 to be greater than x_2 would make things easier.

Wait, no. Let's see.

If a_1 > x_2, then a_2 can be a_1 + x_2, and a_2 % a_1 would be x_2, because (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2.

Similarly, a_3 can be a_2 + x_3, and a_3 % a_2 = x_3, and so on.

Wait, does that work?

Let's test it with the first example.

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

Choose a_1 = 3 (which is greater than x_2 = 2)

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

Then a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9

Wait, but in the example, a_3 is 4, not 9.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't matching the example.

Wait, in the example, a_3 is 4, and a_2 is 5, so 4 % 5 = 4, which is x_3 = 4.

If I choose a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 % 5 = 4, which also matches.

But the example chose a_3 = 4.

So, it seems there can be multiple possibilities.

But to make it simple, perhaps choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is a safe choice.

Let me see.

In the first test case:

a_1 = 3

a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9

a_4 = 9 + 1 = 10

But in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Wait, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe choosing a_i to be a multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i.

Wait, from a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, I can choose k=1, which gives a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

That seems to be what I did earlier.

But in the example, they chose a_4 = 9, which is not a_3 + x_4 = 4 + 1 = 5.

Wait, 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4.

So, it's possible to choose a_i differently.

But to make it simple, perhaps choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is a safe choice.

Let me check if this always works.

Suppose a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Then a_i % a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}.

Wait, that's not necessarily equal to x_i, unless a_{i-1} > x_i.

If a_{i-1} > x_i, then x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

If a_{i-1} <= x_i, then x_i % a_{i-1} is x_i - a_{i-1} * floor(x_i / a_{i-1}).

But I want a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, to make sure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, I need a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

To make it simple, I can choose k=1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, provided that a_{i-1} > x_i.

But in the first test case, a_1 = 3, x_2 = 2, so a_2 = 5, and 5 % 3 = 2, which is correct.

Then a_2 = 5, x_3 = 4, a_3 = 9, and 9 % 5 = 4, correct.

Then a_3 = 9, x_4 = 1, a_4 = 10, and 10 % 9 = 1, correct.

But in the example, they chose a_4 = 9, which also satisfies 9 % 4 = 1.

So, multiple possibilities.

But choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work as long as a_{i-1} > x_i.

But what if a_{i-1} <= x_i?

Let me consider that.

Suppose a_{i-1} <= x_i.

Then, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i.

I need to choose k such that a_i is minimized or something.

But the problem allows any a_i within the range, so perhaps choosing k=1 still works.

Wait, if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i would give a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}, which is x_i - a_{i-1} since x_i >= a_{i-1}.

But x_i - a_{i-1} is not equal to x_i, unless a_{i-1} divides x_i.

So, this approach might not work if a_{i-1} <= x_i.

Let me try an example.

Suppose n=3

x=[3,2]

Choose a_1=2

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 2 + 3 = 5

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 2 = 1, but x_2=3, which doesn't match.

So, this approach fails here.

Hmm.

Alternative approach needed.

Let me think differently.

I need a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Which means a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

So, a_i can be expressed in terms of a_{i-1} and x_i.

To make sure that a_i is as small as possible, I can choose k=1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But as seen earlier, this doesn't always work.

So, perhaps I need to choose a_1 arbitrarily, and then choose a_i accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can choose a_1 to be greater than all x_i.

But a_1 can be at most 10^9, and x_i can be up to 500, so choosing a_1 = 10^9 would make a_1 > x_2, a_2 > x_3, and so on.

Let me try that.

Choose a_1 = 1000 (which is less than 10^9).

Then, for each i from 2 to n, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

Let's test this with the first example.

n=4

x=[2,4,1]

a_1=1000

a_2=1000 + 2=1002

a_3=1002 + 4=1006

a_4=1006 + 1=1007

Now check:

a_2 % a_1 =1002 % 1000=2, matches x_2=2

a_3 % a_2=1006 % 1002=4, matches x_3=4

a_4 % a_3=1007 % 1006=1, matches x_4=1

Perfect.

Another test case:

n=3

x=[1,1]

a_1=1000

a_2=1000 +1=1001

a_3=1001 +1=1002

Check:

1001 % 1000=1, matches x_2=1

1002 % 1001=1, matches x_3=1

Good.

Another test case:

n=6

x=[4,2,5,1,2]

a_1=1000

a_2=1000+4=1004

a_3=1004+2=1006

a_4=1006+5=1011

a_5=1011+1=1012

a_6=1012+2=1014

Check:

1004 % 1000=4

1006 % 1004=2

1011 % 1006=5

1012 % 1011=1

1014 % 1012=2

All match.

Seems to work.

Another test case:

n=2

x=[500]

a_1=1000

a_2=1000+500=1500

Check:

1500 % 1000=500, matches x_2=500

Good.

Last test case:

n=3

x=[1,5]

a_1=1000

a_2=1000+1=1001

a_3=1001+5=1006

Check:

1001 % 1000=1, matches x_2=1

1006 % 1001=5, matches x_3=5

Perfect.

So, choosing a_1 to be a large number, say 1000, and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} for i from 2 to n seems to work.

This way, since a_{i-1} > x_{i-1} (because a_{i-1} starts at 1000 and x_i <=500), a_i % a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}, which is what we want.

Therefore, this approach should be correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

x = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = [0] * n

a[0] = 1000

for i in range(1, n):

a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

print(*a)

Yes, it chooses a_1=1000, and then for each subsequent a_i, it sets a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

Which is exactly the approach I just verified.

Therefore, this program should correctly solve the problem.

Hence, the correctness is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to construct an array \( a \) based on the given array \( x \) such that each element \( x_i \) is equal to \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We choose \( a_1 = 1000 \), which is within the constraints \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
   
2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (from \( i = 2 \) to \( n \)), we set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).
   - This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \), satisfying the problem's condition.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Choice of \( a_1 \)**:
   - By choosing \( a_1 = 1000 \), we ensure it is larger than any \( x_i \) (since \( x_i \leq 500 \)), which is crucial for the modulo operation to work as expected.
   
2. **Building Subsequent Elements**:
   - For each \( a_i \), we set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \). This guarantees that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \), fulfilling the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The approach runs in \( O(n) \) time per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

This method ensures correctness by adhering to the problem's requirements and constraints, providing a straightforward and efficient solution.
