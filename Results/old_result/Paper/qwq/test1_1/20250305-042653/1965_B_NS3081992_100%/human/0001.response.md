Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The constraints say that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9. Also, the number of test cases is up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^7, which seems manageable.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Example 1:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

- No subsequence sums to 2.

- For v=1, the subsequence [1] sums to 1.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1.

- For v=2 to 6, there are subsequences summing to each.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- All subsequences sum to values from 1 to 7, none sum to 8.

- For v=1 to 7, there are subsequences summing to each.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- No subsequence sums to 3.

- For v=1 to 9, except 3, there are subsequences summing to each.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- No subsequence sums to 7.

- For v=1 to 10, except 7, there are subsequences summing to each.

From these examples, it seems that the sequence can vary depending on n and k. Sometimes it's better to have all 1s, sometimes have specific numbers to cover the required sums.

I need to find a general approach to construct such a sequence.

Let me think about the properties required.

First, the sequence should be able to sum to all values from 1 to n, except for k.

This sounds related to the concept of subset sums. In general, to achieve all subset sums up to a certain value, one might think of using powers of 2, but here there's a restriction for one particular sum, k.

I recall that with a set of powers of 2, you can make any sum up to the total sum of the set. For example, [1,2,4,8] can make any sum from 1 to 15. But in this problem, I need to exclude one particular sum, k, while including all others up to n.

So, maybe starting with a set that can make all sums up to n, and then modifying it so that k cannot be achieved.

One way to ensure that a particular sum k cannot be achieved is to remove some elements that can form k, or add elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can.

But this seems tricky. Let's think differently.

Another approach could be to include elements that cover all sums except k. For example, if I include elements that can cover all sums up to n except k, that would satisfy the condition.

But how to ensure that?

Let me consider the case where k is not present in the sequence itself. That is, k is not one of the elements in the sequence. But that alone doesn't guarantee that no subsequence sums to k.

I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can look at the problem from the perspective of generating functions or inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, perhaps I can use the idea of a minimal set that covers all sums except k.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Start with an empty sequence.

- Iterate through each v from 1 to n, excluding k, and add the smallest possible number that allows me to reach v without being able to reach k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can sum to all values from 1 to n, except k.

This means that the subset sum spectrum of the sequence is exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that m <= 25 and each a_i can be up to 1e9, it's feasible to have relatively large numbers in the sequence.

Wait, but in the examples, sequences have smaller numbers.

I need to make sure that the sequence elements are non-negative integers, which they are.

Let me consider the case where k = 1.

If k = 1, then I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, but can sum to all v from 2 to n.

In this case, I can choose a sequence where all elements are >= 2. For example, [2,3,4,...], which can sum to any v >= 2.

Similarly, if k = n, then I need a sequence that can sum to all v from 1 to n-1, but not to n.

In this case, perhaps having a sequence that can sum up to n-1, and not including elements that can reach n.

But this is still vague.

I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider the standard way to achieve all subset sums up to a certain value.

If I have a sequence that is [1,2,4,8,16,...], then the subset sums can achieve any value up to the sum of the sequence.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can achieve any sum from 1 to 15.

Now, if I want to exclude one particular sum, say k=7, I need to modify this sequence so that no subsequence sums to 7, but can still sum to all other values from 1 to 15, except 7.

One way to do this is to remove 7 from the possible sums. But since 7 is 1+2+4, which are all present in the sequence, I need to remove at least one of these elements to prevent 7 from being formed.

But if I remove 4, then I can't form sums that require 4, like 4,5,6,7,8,... which is not desirable.

Alternatively, maybe I can add an element that makes some sums unreachable.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the fact that m <= 25. This is a key constraint.

Given that m <= 25, and each a_i can be up to 1e9, perhaps there is a way to construct a sequence with a small number of elements that can cover all sums except one specific k.

One idea is to use a combination of small numbers to cover the smaller sums and larger numbers to cover the larger sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But this is still not concrete.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to s, except for k.

I need to choose the sequence such that s >= n.

But I need to make sure that for all v from 1 to n, except k, there is a subsequence that sums to v.

So s must be at least n.

Also, there should be no subsequence that sums to k.

Given that, I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of sums that can be formed with a small number of elements, while excluding one specific sum.

This sounds related to the concept of a minimal generating set for the sums, excluding one particular sum.

I recall that with coins of certain denominations, you can make certain amounts, and there are ways to choose denominations to cover certain amounts.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider building the sequence step by step.

Start with an empty sequence.

Iterate through v from 1 to n, excluding k.

For each v, if there is no subset of the current sequence that sums to v, add a new element to the sequence that allows me to reach v, without enabling any subset to sum to k.

This sounds similar to a greedy algorithm for creating a set of numbers to cover certain sums.

But I need to ensure that k is never achievable.

This could be tricky.

Let me think about the inclusion of each element carefully.

Suppose I have current sequence S.

I need to add elements to S such that for each v in {1,...,n} \ {k}, there exists a subset of S that sums to v.

Also, no subset of S sums to k.

One way to approach this is to start with a sequence that can sum to all values from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the possibility of summing to k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can start with a sequence that can sum to all values up to s >= n, and then adjust it so that k cannot be formed.

But I need to make sure that all other sums can still be formed.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a sequence that can sum to all values except k, by carefully choosing the elements.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I have elements that are powers of 2, I can form any sum up to the total sum of the sequence.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can form any sum from 1 to 15.

If I want to exclude, say, 7, I need to prevent any subset from summing to 7.

But in this case, since 7 is 1+2+4, which are all present, it's impossible to remove 7 without removing one of 1,2,4.

But if I remove any of them, I can't form other sums that require that element.

This seems problematic.

Perhaps I need to include different elements that aren't just powers of 2.

For example, include elements that can cover the required sums in a different way.

Let me consider including multiple 1's.

If I have multiple 1's, I can form sums by choosing different combinations of 1's along with other elements.

But since 1's are additive, it might not help in excluding a particular sum like k.

Wait, in the third example, for n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form all sums from 1 to 7, and none sum to 8.

This works because the maximum sum is 7.

But in this case, m=7, which is less than 25, so it's acceptable.

But in general, having m=25, each being 1, would allow sums up to 25.

But if k is within 1 to 25, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, while being able to sum to all other values up to n.

Wait, but m can be up to 25, and n can be up to 1e6, so having m=25 with all 1's would only allow sums up to 25, which is insufficient for n up to 1e6.

Therefore, I need to include larger elements to cover higher sums.

So, using only 1's isn't sufficient for larger n.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider splitting the sum range into parts and covering them with different elements.

For example, use small elements to cover small sums and larger elements to cover larger sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that with a set of elements where each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements, the subset sums are all unique.

For example, [1,2,4,8,...], where each element is twice the previous one.

In this case, each sum corresponds to a unique combination of elements.

But in this problem, since k cannot be formed, I need to modify this approach.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude k by omitting one specific element.

But in the powers of 2 sequence, omitting one element would prevent forming sums that require that element.

But in the problem, I need to exclude only one specific sum, k, while being able to form all others.

This seems contradictory to simply omitting an element.

I need a different idea.

Let me consider the fact that the sequence can have at most 25 elements.

Given that m <= 25, and n can be up to 1e6, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range of sums.

One way to cover a large range with few elements is to use exponential growth in the element values.

For example, choosing elements like 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^24, which is over 16 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 1e6.

But as before, this allows forming any sum up to the total sum of the sequence, which is 2^25 - 1.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, how can I modify this sequence to prevent any subset from summing to k, while still being able to form all other sums up to n.

One idea is to remove an element that is necessary to form k.

For example, if k can be expressed as the sum of some elements, removing one of those elements would prevent forming k.

But this might also prevent forming other sums that require that element.

To mitigate this, perhaps I can add different elements to compensate.

This seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can form all sums except k.

This means that the subset sum spectrum is all numbers from 1 to n except k.

I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that m is small (<=25), and n can be large (up to 1e6), I need to maximize the coverage with few elements.

An idea comes to mind: use a combination of small elements to cover small sums and large elements to cover large sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a sequence that can form all sums up to some s >= n, except k.

- To exclude k, I can ensure that there's no subset that sums to k by making sure that the elements are such that their combinations cannot reach k.

- One way to do this is to have the sequence cover all sums up to n, except for k, by carefully choosing the elements.

But this is still too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let S be the sequence of elements.

Let T be the set of all possible subset sums of S.

We need T to contain all v from 1 to n, except k.

Also, T should not contain k.

Given that, I need to find S with |S| <= 25.

Given the constraints, it's guaranteed that such a sequence exists.

I need to find a systematic way to construct S.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Identify the critical sum, k, that must not be achievable.

2. Construct a sequence that can achieve all sums from 1 to n, except k.

3. Ensure that the sequence has at most 25 elements.

To achieve this, perhaps I can:

- Start with a base sequence that can achieve all sums up to n.

- Modify the sequence to exclude the possibility of summing to k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a sequence that can achieve all sums up to s, and I remove an element that is necessary to achieve k, then k cannot be achieved.

But this might also prevent achieving other sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can add an element that makes some sums unreachable.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about the problem in terms of generating functions.

Each element in the sequence corresponds to a term in the generating function.

The generating function for the sequence is the product of (1 + x^a) for each a in the sequence.

I need this generating function to have coefficients of x^v for v from 1 to n, except for v=k, which should have coefficient 0.

This is equivalent to:

- The generating function should have x^v for all v from 1 to n, except v=k.

- So, the generating function should be equal to (sum from v=1 to n of x^v) - x^k.

But I need to find a product of (1 + x^{a_i}) that equals this sum.

This seems too abstract to handle directly.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

- If I have a sequence that can achieve all sums up to s, and I add a new element b, then the new sums that can be achieved are the old sums and the old sums plus b.

- So, to exclude k, I need to choose b in such a way that no combination of the existing sums and the existing sums plus b equals k.

This sounds like avoiding certain sums when adding new elements.

This could be a way to build the sequence step by step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let S be the current sequence.

- Let T be the set of subset sums of S.

- I need to add a new element a to S such that:

- T union (T + a) covers as many new sums as possible, excluding k.

- Ensure that k is not in T union (T + a).

This seems promising.

I can start with S empty, T={0}, and iteratively add elements a such that:

- The new sums T + a include as many v from 1 to n, except k, as possible.

- Ensure that k is not included in T union (T + a).

This is similar to building a minimal set to cover the required sums, excluding k.

I need to prioritize adding elements that cover the most uncovered sums without including k.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize:

- S = []

- T = {0}

- Uncovered = {v for v in 1 to n if v != k}

While Uncovered is not empty:

- Find the element a that covers the most sums in Uncovered without including k.

- Add a to S.

- Update T = T union (T + a)

- Update Uncovered = Uncovered minus (T minus {k})

But this could be inefficient for large n, up to 1e6.

I need a smarter way to choose a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can limit the number of elements to 25 and find a way to cover all required sums.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence where the elements are chosen such that their subset sums cover all numbers up to n, except for k.

I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 1e6, and m <=25, I need to choose elements that can combine to cover a large range.

One way to cover a large range is to choose elements that are powers of 2, as they can cover all sums up to the total sum of the sequence.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can modify the sequence of powers of 2 to exclude k.

Wait, in the standard powers of 2 sequence, each sum is unique.

So, if I remove one element from the powers of 2 sequence, some sums become unavailable.

But I need to remove sums only for k, while keeping others.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I have a sequence where the subset sums can generate all numbers from 1 to s, except k.

I need to find such a sequence with m <=25.

I need to maximize s, which should be at least n.

Given that, perhaps I can find a sequence that can cover sums up to 2^m -1, excluding k.

But I need to adjust for k.

Wait, perhaps I can use m elements to cover sums up to s, and ensure that k is not among them.

But I need a systematic way to choose the m elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with m=25.

- Choose m elements such that their subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to s, except k.

- Ensure that s >=n.

But how to choose the elements?

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix m=25.

I need to choose 25 non-negative integers a1,a2,...,a25 such that:

- No subset sums to k.

- For every v from 1 to n, v !=k, there exists a subset that sums to v.

Given that n can be up to 1e6, and m=25, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range.

One way to cover a large range is to choose elements that are powers of 2, but as discussed earlier, that allows all sums up to the total sum, which includes k.

So, I need to modify this approach.

An idea comes to mind: choose elements that are powers of 2, but adjust one of them to exclude k.

For example, replace one power of 2 with a different number that prevents k from being formed, but still allows other sums.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have the standard powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,16,...,2^24].

Their subset sums can generate any number from 1 to 2^25 -1.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can replace one of these powers with a different number that prevents k from being formed.

For example, if k is 7, and 7=1+2+4, then by replacing 4 with another number, say 3, the subset sums change.

But in this case, [1,2,3,8,16,...] can still form 7 as 2+3+2, but 2 is repeated, which is not allowed in subset sums.

Wait, subset sums consider unique subsets, so [2,3] sums to 5, but not to 7.

Wait, no, [1,2,3] sums to 6, not 7.

This is getting confusing.

Perhaps this isn't the right way.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence where the subset sums cover all numbers except k.

I need to find such a sequence with m <=25.

Given that, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of possible subset sums is 2^m -1 (excluding the empty set).

So, with m=25, I can have up to 2^25 -1 sums.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k, while including all others up to n.

This seems manageable, given that n <=1e6 and 2^25 is over 33 million.

But how to construct such a sequence?

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with m=25 elements.

- Choose elements such that their subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n, except k.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

An idea: choose m elements such that their subset sums can generate all numbers modulo some value, excluding k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k and n.

I need to choose m elements such that:

- For every v from 1 to n, v !=k, there exists a subset that sums to v.

- No subset sums to k.

Given that m <=25, and n <=1e6, perhaps I can choose elements that cover the required sums efficiently.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the smallest possible elements to cover the smallest sums.

- Gradually include larger elements to cover larger sums.

- Ensure that k cannot be formed at any step.

This sounds similar to a greedy algorithm.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize:

- S = []

- T = {0}

- Uncovered = {v for v in 1 to n if v !=k}

While Uncovered is not empty and |S| <25:

- Find the smallest uncovered v.

- Choose the smallest possible a such that v can be included in T union (T + a), without including k.

- Add a to S.

- Update T = T union (T + a)

- Update Uncovered = Uncovered minus (T minus {k})

But this might not work, as choosing the smallest a might not cover enough sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose a to cover as many uncovered sums as possible without including k.

This sounds like a maximum coverage problem, which is NP-hard, but since m is small (25), it might be feasible.

But implementing such an algorithm within time constraints is challenging, especially since t can be up to 1000 and n up to 1e6.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Use a combination of small numbers to cover the small sums and large numbers to cover the large sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

- For example, use several 1's to cover small sums, and then include larger numbers to cover higher sums, skipping k.

But I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This is still tricky.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k is small, I can include elements that cover sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

- To cover sums up to k-1, I can use small elements like 1's.

- To cover sums from k+1 to n, I can include larger elements.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

For example, if k=3, I can include two 1's to cover 1,2, but not 3.

But in this case, [1,1,2] can sum to 3 as 1+1+1=3.

Wait, but 1+1+1=3, which is k.

So, I need to prevent this.

Perhaps I can limit the number of 1's.

In this case, using two 1's allows sums 1 and 2, and then include a 2 to get 3, but that would allow 1+2=3, which is k.

So, I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, include a 3, but that directly allows summing to k.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k and n.

I need to choose m elements such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n, except k.

I need to find such a sequence with m <=25.

Given that, perhaps I can look for a minimal set that covers all required sums except k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the sequence that can sum to all values from 1 to n, except k.

- This can be achieved by including elements that cover the differences between the required sums.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be used here.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that the sequence can cover all sums except k.

This means that the subset sum spectrum is all v from 1 to n except k.

I need to find such a sequence with m <=25.

Given that, perhaps I can use the fact that the subset sums form a specific set, and find elements that correspond to that set.

But this is still too abstract.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Represent the required subset sums as a set T = {1,2,...,n} - {k}.

- Find a sequence S with |S| <=25 such that the subset sums of S are exactly T.

This is equivalent to finding S such that the subset sum spectrum is T.

This seems like an inverse subset sum problem, which is not straightforward.

I need to find a way to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider the following idea:

- If I have a sequence that can generate all sums up to n, and I modify it to exclude k, perhaps by adjusting one of the elements.

- For example, if k is small, I can include elements that cover sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

- To cover sums up to k-1, I can use small elements like 1's.

- To cover sums from k+1 to n, I can include larger elements.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This seems similar to the idea of including elements that allow sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n, without allowing k.

But I need a systematic way to choose the elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k is 1, then I can choose elements all >=2, and their subset sums will cover all v from 2 to n.

- Similarly, if k is n, I can choose elements that can sum to all v from 1 to n-1.

- For general k, I need to choose elements that can sum to all v from 1 to n except k.

This seems straightforward for k=1 or k=n, but for general k, it's more complicated.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=4, k=3.

I need a sequence whose subset sums are {1,2,4}.

One possible sequence is [1,2,4].

But this allows summing to 3 as 1+2=3, which is k.

So, I need to prevent that.

Therefore, I need to choose elements such that no subset sums to 3.

One way is to choose [1,4].

- Subset sums: 1,4,1+4=5 (which is greater than n=4, so it's acceptable).

- This covers v=1 and v=4.

- For v=2, I need to add another element.

- If I add 2, then subset sums are 1,2,4,1+2=3 (which is k), 1+4=5, 2+4=6, 1+2+4=7.

- This includes k=3.

- So, I need to avoid having subsets that sum to 3.

- Perhaps I can choose [1,4] and another element that doesn't allow summing to 3.

- If I choose [1,4], I can't form 2.

- So, I need to add an element to form 2, but not 3.

- If I add 2, then 1+2=3, which is k.

- So, I can't add 2.

- Alternatively, I can choose [1,4, something else].

- If I choose [1,4,5], then subset sums are 1,4,5,1+4=5,1+5=6,4+5=9,1+4+5=10.

- But I can't form 2.

- So, I need to add an element to form 2.

- If I add 2, then 1+2=3, which is k.

- So, that's not allowed.

- Perhaps I can add 3, but then 3 is k, which is not allowed.

- Wait, the problem allows a_i to be non-negative integers, including 0.

- If I include 0, it doesn't add to the sum, so it's effectively ignored in subset sums.

- So, including 0 doesn't help in forming new sums.

- Therefore, I need to choose positive integers.

- But in this case, I can't form 2 without including 2, which leads to forming 3 with 1+2.

- So, in this example, it seems impossible to find such a sequence.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose elements differently.

Let me consider [1,4].

- Subset sums: 1,4,5.

- Need to form 2.

- If I add another 1, then subset sums include 1,1,4,1+1=2,1+4=5,1+4=5,1+1+4=6.

- But 1+1+2=4, but 2 is already included.

- Wait, this is getting confusing.

- If I have [1,1,4], then subset sums are:

- 1,1,4,1+1=2,1+4=5,1+4=5,1+1+4=6.

- So, sums are 1,2,4,5,6.

- But k=3 is not included.

- So, this works for n=4, k=3.

- Sequence: [1,1,4].

- Subset sums: 1,2,4,5,6.

- No subset sums to 3.

- For v=1,2,4: subsets [1], [1,1], [4].

- For v=5: [1,4], for v=6: [1,1,4].

- But in this case, sums beyond n=4 are allowed, as per the problem.

So, in this example, [1,1,4] is a valid sequence.

This suggests that using multiple 1's can help cover smaller sums without allowing the sum k, if k is larger than the number of 1's.

But in general, for larger n and k, this approach may not suffice.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=5, k=3.

I need a sequence where subset sums are {1,2,4,5}.

One possible sequence is [1,2,5].

- Subset sums: 1,2,5,1+2=3,1+5=6,2+5=7,1+2+5=8.

- But 1+2=3, which is k.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Alternatively, [1,4,5].

- Subset sums:1,4,5,1+4=5,1+5=6,4+5=9,1+4+5=10.

- Can't form 2.

- So, need to add an element to form 2.

- If I add 2, then 1+2=3, which is k.

- So, can't add 2.

- If I add 3, which is k, it's not allowed.

- Wait, perhaps [1,4].

- Subset sums:1,4,5.

- Can't form 2.

- So, need another element.

- If I add another 1, then subset sums:1,1,4,1+1=2,1+4=5,1+4=5,1+1+4=6.

- So, sums are 1,2,4,5,6.

- No subset sums to 3.

- This works for n=5, k=3.

- Sequence: [1,1,4].

- Subset sums:1,2,4,5,6.

- No subset sums to 3.

So, in this case, [1,1,4] works.

Similarly, for n=4, k=3, [1,1,4] also works.

This suggests that using multiple 1's along with larger elements can cover the required sums without allowing k.

But for larger n, using only 1's would require too many elements, which is not feasible since m <=25.

Therefore, I need a way to cover larger sums with fewer elements.

Perhaps I can use a combination of small elements to cover small sums and larger elements to cover larger sums.

For example, use several 1's to cover sums up to some value, and then include larger elements to cover higher sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Determine how many 1's to include to cover sums up to some value without allowing k.

- Then, include larger elements to cover the remaining sums up to n.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me think about the number of 1's to include.

If I include t 1's, then I can form sums from 1 to t.

But if t >=k, then I can form k as the sum of some number of 1's.

So, to prevent forming k, I need to have t <k.

But then, I can't form sums from t+1 to k-1 with only 1's.

Wait, no, with t 1's, I can form sums from 1 to t.

If t <k, then I can't form k with just 1's.

But I might be able to form k with 1's plus some other elements.

So, I need to be careful with the other elements I include.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I include t 1's, with t <k.

Then, I need to include other elements to cover sums from t+1 to n, excluding k.

Let me choose t = k-1.

Then, with t=k-1 1's, I can form sums from 1 to k-1.

Now, to cover sums from k to n, excluding k, I need to include elements that allow forming sums from k to n, but not k itself.

Wait, but with t=k-1 1's, I can form sums up to k-1.

To form sums beyond k-1, I need to include larger elements.

Suppose I include an element a >k-1.

Then, with t 1's and a, I can form sums from k to k-1 + a.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

If a >k, then k cannot be formed, since the smallest sum including a is a, which is greater than k.

In this case, the subset sums would be:

- Sums from 1 to k-1 (from the 1's).

- Sums from a to a + (k-1) (from a plus some 1's).

- And so on, for larger elements.

In this way, if a >k, then k cannot be formed, since the smallest sum including a is a >k, and the sums without a are up to k-1.

Therefore, k is not achievable.

This seems promising.

So, in this approach:

- Include t =k-1 1's, which allow sums from 1 to k-1.

- Include elements greater than k, to cover sums from k+1 to n.

- Since a >k, the smallest sum including a is a >k, so k cannot be formed.

- This way, the subset sums are {1,2,...,k-1} union {a, a+1, ..., a + (k-1)}, etc.

- To cover sums from k+1 to n, I can choose a =k+1.

- Then, with t 1's and a=k+1, I can form sums from k+1 to k-1 + (k+1) = 2k -1 +1.

- If 2k -1 +1 >=n, then this covers up to n.

- But if n is larger, I may need to include more elements.

Wait, let's see.

With t=k-1 1's and a=k+1, the subset sums are:

- Sums from 1 to k-1 (from the 1's).

- Sums from k+1 to k-1 + (k+1) = 2k.

- If n <=2k, this might cover up to n, depending on k.

- But if n >2k, I need to include more elements to cover sums up to n.

- Also, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

- In this setup, since a=k+1 >k, and t=k-1, the sums are up to 2k-1, which may or may not be sufficient for n.

- If n >2k-1, I need to include additional elements.

- To cover higher sums, I can include another element b >k, say b=2k+1.

- Then, sums including b would be b, b+1, b+2, ..., b + (k-1).

- This would cover sums from 2k+1 to 2k + (k-1) = 3k.

- And so on.

This seems like a way to cover higher sums without including k.

But I need to make sure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are covered.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=10, k=3.

- t =k-1=2 1's.

- Include a=k+1=4.

- Subset sums:

- From 1's: 1,2.

- From 4:4,1+4=5,2+4=6.

- So, sums:1,2,4,5,6.

- Need to cover 7,8,9,10.

- Include another element b=7.

- Then, subset sums:

- 7,1+7=8,2+7=9,4+7=11,5+7=12,6+7=13.

- So, sums:1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

- Missing 10.

- So, need to include another element to cover 10.

- Include c=1
