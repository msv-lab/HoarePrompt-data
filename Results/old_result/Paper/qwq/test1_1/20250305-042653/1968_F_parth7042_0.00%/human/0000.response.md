Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. So, for a given range [l, r], I need to check if the subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way to handle XOR problems is to use prefix sums, but for XOR, it's called a prefix XOR. I can compute the prefix XOR array where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.

So, if I have the prefix XOR array, the XOR of any subarray from l to r can be found by prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Now, for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, I need to be able to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value. Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as X = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If X is zero, that means the subarray XOR is zero. In this case, I can split the subarray into any number of parts, and each part will have XOR zero because the total XOR is zero. So, in this case, the answer is "YES."

If X is not zero, then I need to find at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR up to that point is equal to X, and the remaining subarray also has XOR equal to X.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r with XOR X. I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has XOR equal to some value Y, and all Y's are equal.

But since XOR is associative and commutative, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR of the subarray should be equal to Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times). If k is even, then Y XOR Y ... XOR Y is 0. If k is odd, it's Y.

Wait, no. XOR of k copies of Y is Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for the total XOR of the subarray to be equal to Y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But in our case, the total XOR X should be equal to Y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But we need to have k > 1, so k can be 2, 3, 4, etc.

If k is 2, then X should be 0.

If k is 3, then X should be Y XOR Y XOR Y = Y.

But Y is the XOR of each part, which is Y.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let's say the XOR of the entire subarray is X.

If I can find at least one index i in the subarray such that the XOR from l to i is equal to the XOR from i+1 to r, and both are equal to X/k, but since XOR isn't about addition, this might not work.

Wait, XOR isn't about sums, it's about bitwise operations.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the example given.

In the first test case, the array is [1,1,2,3,0], and one of the queries is [1,5], which is the entire array.

They show a split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and the XOR of each part is 1, 1, and 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, so all parts have XOR 1.

So, in this case, k=3, and X=1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, which matches Y=1.

But according to my earlier thought, if k=3 (which is odd), then X should be Y.

Here, X=1 and Y=1, which matches.

In another query, [2,4]: [1,2,3]

X=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0

So, since X=0, and k=2, it's possible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

For example, [1,2] and [3], where 1 XOR 2=3, and 3=3.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3=0, which matches X=0.

So, in this case, k=2, X=0, which matches X=0 when k is even.

Wait, but in the explanation, they say it's possible to split [1,2,3] into [1,2],[3], with XOR 3 and 3, which are equal.

So, in this case, Y=3, and X=0, which is Y XOR Y = 0, which matches.

So, it seems that when k is even, X should be 0, and when k is odd, X should be Y.

Wait, but in the first case, k=3 (odd), X=Y=1.

In the second case, k=2 (even), X=0.

So, perhaps the condition is that for the subarray to be interesting, the total XOR X should be 0 if k is even, and X if k is odd.

But k is greater than 1.

Wait, but in the first case, k=3, X=1, which matches X=Y.

In the second case, k=2, X=0, which matches X=0.

So, perhaps the condition is that X can be divided into k parts where each part has XOR Y, and X = Y if k is odd, and X=0 if k is even.

But in the first case, X=Y when k is odd.

Wait, but in the first case, X=1, Y=1, k=3.

In the second case, X=0, Y=3, k=2.

Wait, but Y=3, and k=2, X=0, which is Y XOR Y=0.

So, it seems that X is equal to Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times).

Which is, if k is even, X=0, and if k is odd, X=Y.

So, the condition is:

- If k is even, X must be 0.

- If k is odd, X must be Y.

But Y is the XOR of each part.

But in the second case, Y=3, and X=0, which matches X=Y XOR Y=0.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k, the number of parts.

Then, for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR X must satisfy:

- If k is even, X must be 0.

- If k is odd, X must be Y.

But Y is the XOR of each part.

But I don't know Y in advance.

Wait, but in the first case, k=3, X=1, and Y=1.

In the second case, k=2, X=0, Y=3.

Wait, but Y is not determined independently; it's determined by the split.

So, perhaps I need to find if there exists a Y such that X equals Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

But k is not given; I need to find if there exists a k>1 that satisfies this condition.

Wait, no, in the problem, k is part of the condition; it's not given in the query.

I need to check if there exists a k>1 such that the subarray can be split into k consecutive parts with equal XOR.

So, I need to check if there exists k>1 where the subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR.

Given that, I need to find a way to check, for a given subarray [l,r], if it's possible to split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to handle this somehow.

Let's analyze the code step by step.

First, it reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, then splits it into a list called `data`.

Then, it iterates through each test case.

For each test case, it reads n (number of elements) and q (number of queries).

It initializes an array `a` of size n+1, with a[0]=0.

It also initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` of size n+1, with pf[0]=0.

Then, it creates a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs.

It populates `a`, `pf`, and `mp` accordingly.

Then, for each query [l,r], it computes X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], which is the XOR of the subarray [l,r].

If X == 0, it directly appends "YES" because, as discussed earlier, if the total XOR is zero, it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If X != 0, it checks if there are indices in the subarray [l,r] where the prefix XOR equals pf[r], and pf[l-1] appears before r.

It uses bisect to find positions in the lists from the map `mp`.

Specifically, it looks for positions in mp[pf[r]] that are >=l and <=r, and positions in mp[pf[l-1]] that are <=r and >=l.

If such positions exist, it appends "YES"; else, "NO".

Finally, it appends an empty string after each test case's results.

Wait, but in the code, it's `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `v2 = mp.get(pf[l-1], [])`.

Then, it uses bisect to find positions in v1 that are >=l and in v2 that are <=r.

If such positions exist within the subarray range [l,r], it considers it "YES"; else, "NO".

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about what this is checking.

Given X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], which is the XOR of the subarray [l,r].

If X == 0, it's "YES" because it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If X != 0, it needs to check if there is at least one split point where the XOR of the parts is equal.

The code checks if there is an index i in [l,r] such that pf[i] == pf[r], and pf[j] == pf[l-1] for some j <= r.

Wait, I'm not sure if this correctly captures the condition for the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.

Maybe I need to think about the properties of XOR and how splits work.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r], I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR Y.

So, for each part, the XOR is Y, and the total XOR is Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y.

As we discussed earlier, if k is even, X=0; if k is odd, X=Y.

But in the code, it's not explicitly checking for k being even or odd.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to look at it.

Suppose I fix Y, the XOR of each part.

Then, I need to split the subarray into parts where each part has XOR Y.

This is similar to finding splits where the cumulative XOR up to the split point is a multiple of Y in some way.

But XOR doesn't work exactly like addition.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the prefix XOR.

If I have the prefix XOR array, then the XOR of a subarray [i,j] is pf[j] XOR pf[i-1].

So, if I want to split [l,r] into k parts, each with XOR Y, then the cumulative XOR up to each split point should be equal to Y, 2Y, 3Y, etc., but since it's XOR, adding Y multiple times alternates the total XOR.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the differences in the prefix XOR.

Let me look for resources or standard algorithms for splitting an array based on XOR conditions.

After some research, I recall that for splitting an array into parts with equal XOR, it's related to finding points where the prefix XOR matches a certain value.

Specifically, for the subarray [l,r], if I can find at least one split point i (l <= i < r) such that the XOR from l to i is equal to the XOR from i+1 to r.

But in this problem, I need the XOR of each part to be equal, not necessarily equal to a specific value.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the total XOR X must be Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for a given [l,r], with X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], I need to check if there exists a k >= 2 such that:

- If k is even, X == 0

- If k is odd, X == Y

But Y is the XOR of each part, which is equal to X if k is odd.

Wait, but k is not given; I need to find if such a k exists.

Actually, since k can be any integer greater than 1, I need to check if the subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible split points and check if the XOR of the first part equals the XOR of the remaining subarray.

But this seems inefficient for the given constraints.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to handle this efficiently using prefix XOR and maps.

Let me consider an example to see if the code works.

Take the first test case:

n=5, q=5

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Compute pf:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 0 XOR 1 = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

pf[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

pf[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

pf[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

mp:

0: [0,2]

1: [1,4,5]

2: [3]

Now, for query [1,5]:

l=1, r=5

X = pf[5] XOR pf[1-1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

Check if X==0: no

Then, v1 = mp[pf[r]] = mp[1] = [1,4,5]

v2 = mp[pf[l-1]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, l=1) = 0 (v1[0]=1 >=1)

it2 = bisect_left(v2, r=5) -1 = bisect_left([0,2],5)-1 = 2-1=1 (v2[1]=2 <=5)

Check if v1[it1]=1 <=5 and v2[it2]=2 >=1: yes

So, "YES"

Which matches the example.

Another query: [2,4]

l=2, r=4

X = pf[4] XOR pf[1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

Since X==0, "YES"

Next query: [3,5]

l=3, r=5

X = pf[5] XOR pf[2] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

Check v1=mp[1]=[1,4,5]

v2=mp[0]=[0,2]

it1=bisect_left([1,4,5],1)=0 (v1[0]=1 <=5)

it2=bisect_left([0,2],4)-1=1 (v2[1]=2 >=1)

So, "YES"

But according to the explanation, the answer should be "NO" for this query.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the problem's note, it says for queries 3,4,5, the subarrays are not interesting.

But according to the code, for [3,5], it would output "YES", but according to the explanation, it should be "NO".

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's check the subarray [3,5]: [2,3,0]

Can it be split into at least two parts with equal XOR?

Possible splits:

- [2],[3,0]: XOR: 2 and 3 XOR 0=3, which are not equal.

- [2,3],[0]: XOR: 2 XOR 3=1 and 0, not equal.

- [2],[3],[0]: XOR: 2,3,0, not equal.

So, no way to split into parts with equal XOR, should be "NO".

But according to the code, it would output "YES" because X=1, and there are positions in mp[1] and mp[0] within the range.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the conditions.

Perhaps the code's logic is not sufficient to ensure that the splits result in equal XOR parts.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the implementation.

Let me think of another approach.

One standard way to find if a subarray has a certain property is to use the prefix XOR and check for occurrences.

In this problem, for a subarray [l,r], we need to check if it's possible to split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Let's denote Y as the XOR of each part.

Then, for the total XOR X of [l,r], we have:

- If k is even, X = 0

- If k is odd, X = Y

But Y must be equal to the XOR of each part.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through possible split points and check if the XOR up to the split point equals the XOR of the remaining subarray.

But that seems too slow for the constraints.

An optimized approach would be to precompute the prefix XOR and then use a hash map to find occurrences of certain values.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be trying to find if there are positions in the subarray [l,r] where the prefix XOR equals pf[r] and pf[l-1], which might not directly correspond to the condition needed for equal XOR parts.

Perhaps a better way is to iterate through the subarray and keep track of the prefix XOR, and check if it reaches pf[r] multiple times within the subarray.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r], with XOR X.

If X == 0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Otherwise, it's only possible if there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point equals X.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists a split point i in [l,r) such that the XOR from l to i equals X, and the XOR from i+1 to r equals X.

But since X is the total XOR, that would mean X XOR X = 0, which only holds if X=0.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, then the prefix XOR up to each split point should be Y, 2Y, 3Y, etc.

But with XOR, it's not linear like addition.

XOR is its own inverse, so it's tricky.

After some thought, I recall that for XOR, the condition for splits with equal XOR is more complex.

I need to find if there are split points where the XOR up to that point is equal to a specific value.

In this case, since Y is the same for all parts, I need to find if there are multiple points where the prefix XOR matches Y, 2Y, 3Y, etc.

But since XOR is not additive, this is not straightforward.

After some research, I found that a standard approach for splitting an array into parts with equal XOR is to iterate through the array and keep track of the prefix XOR.

When the prefix XOR equals Y, it's a potential split point.

But since Y is not known in advance, it's challenging.

Wait, in this problem, Y is determined by the total XOR X and the number of parts k.

Given that, it's complex to handle directly.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be checking if there are positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR equals pf[r] and pf[l-1], which might not directly correspond to equal XOR parts.

Given that, and considering the example where [3,5] should be "NO" but the code outputs "YES", I conclude that the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
