Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n cities on a number line, each with a unique coordinate in ascending order. I need to handle m queries, where each query asks for the minimum coins required to travel from one city to another, given specific travel options.

First, understanding the travel options:

1. I can travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates, which is |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. Or, I can travel to the closest city to x, paying just 1 coin.

The problem also mentions that for each city, there's a unique closest city, so no ambiguity there.

Given that the cities are on a number line and their coordinates are strictly increasing, that simplifies things. The closest city to any city i would be either i-1 or i+1, depending on which is nearer.

Wait, no. Since the coordinates are strictly increasing, and each city has a unique closest city, the closest city for city i would be either i-1 or i+1, but not both at the same distance.

For example, in the sample input:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

- City 1 (0) closest is city 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) closest is city 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) closest is city 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) closest is city 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) closest is city 4 (15)

So, for city 3, both city 2 and city 4 are equidistant, but according to the problem, this doesn't happen because it's guaranteed that each city has a unique closest city. So, in this case, maybe the input is such that no two cities are equidistant to a third.

Given that, I need to find the minimum coins to travel from city x to city y.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Direct travel from x to y, paying |a_x - a_y| coins.

Option 2: Travel to the closest city of x, paying 1 coin, and then continue from there.

But since I can choose to go directly or go step by step to the closest cities, I need to find the optimal path.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with costs equal to the differences in coordinates.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, that would be too slow if I try to run Dijkstra for each query separately.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I can precompute some distances or find a way to compute the minimum cost quickly for each query.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted in increasing order, maybe I can use some properties of the number line to optimize the travel.

Wait, let's consider that traveling to the closest city costs only 1 coin, which is cheaper than traveling directly to a faraway city.

So, it might be beneficial to move step by step towards the target city by always moving to the closest city, which would cost 1 coin per step.

But, directly traveling to the target might be cheaper if the distance is small.

So, I need to compare the direct travel cost with the cost of moving to the closest cities step by step.

Wait, but moving to the closest city might not always lead me directly to the target.

In the first sample query, going from city 1 to city 4:

- City 1's closest is city 2 (cost 1)

- City 2's closest is city 3 (cost 1)

- City 3's closest is city 4 (cost 1)

Total cost: 3 coins

Alternatively, directly from city 1 to city 4: |20 - 0| = 20 coins, which is worse.

Another option: from city 1 to city 2 (cost 8), then to city 3 (cost 4), then to city 4 (cost 3). Total: 8 + 4 + 3 = 15 coins, which is worse than 3.

So, step by step to closest cities is better.

Another query: from city 1 to city 5.

- Option 1: Step by step:

City 1 to city 2 (1 coin)

City 2 to city 3 (1 coin)

City 3 to city 4 (1 coin)

City 4 to city 5 (1 coin)

Total: 4 coins

But in the sample output, it's 8 coins.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, sample output for query 1 to 4 is 3, and for 1 to 5 is 8.

So, perhaps step by step is not always the optimal.

Wait, maybe a combination of step by step and direct jumps.

Wait, in the explanation for the first two queries:

- For 1 to 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 3 coins.

- For 1 to 5: Use the same path as 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 3 coins, then 4 to 5 costing 5 coins (since |20-15|=5), total 8 coins.

But in the sample output, it's 8 for 1 to 5.

Wait, but according to the note, they travel from 1 to 4 via closest cities (cost 3), then from 4 to 5 directly (cost 5), total 8.

But why not travel directly from 1 to 5, which would cost |20-0|=20, which is worse than 8.

So, combining step by step and direct jumps can be optimal.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph, with cost 1, and moving directly to any city with cost equal to the distance.

I need to find the shortest path in this graph from x to y.

But with n and m up to 1e5, running Dijkstra for each query is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the cities are on a number line, and the closest city for each is either the previous or next one.

So, the graph is essentially a tree, specifically a line graph, where each city is connected to its neighbors.

Wait, but in the problem, each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with costs equal to their differences.

But that's a fully connected graph, which is too dense.

I need to find a way to optimize the shortest path calculation.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city repeatedly is similar to moving towards the target in small steps, but it might be inefficient compared to jumping directly.

I need to find a way to balance between the small steps of cost 1 and the big jumps with cost equal to the distance.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimal cost by considering the direct jump or the sum of costs moving step by step.

But step by step seems too slow for large n and m.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The solution seems to precompute some values and then use prefix sums to answer the queries efficiently.

Let's try to understand the reference solution.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Read n, the number of cities.

- Read the list of city coordinates, ensuring they are in ascending order.

- Define a function func_1 that seems to compute something related to moving forward to the closest city.

- Compute forward_cities by calling func_1 on the original list of cities.

- Reverse the list of cities and compute backward_cities by calling func_1 again.

- Compute prefix sums for forward_cities and backward_cities.

- Read m, the number of queries.

- For each query, read cities a and b, and compute the answer based on the prefix sums.

Wait, I need to understand what func_1 does.

Looking at func_1:

- It takes the list of cities and n.

- It initializes a list prog_cities of size n-1.

- For each city i from 0 to n-2:

- back is set to a very small number if i > 0, else -99999999.

- forward is set to the next city if i < n-1, else 99999999.

- It checks if the distance to forward is less than to back, and sets prog_cities[i] to 1 if so, else to the distance to forward.

Wait, this seems to be determining whether moving to the next city is closer than moving to the previous one, and recording that in prog_cities.

Then, it computes prefix sums for forward and backward directions.

In the main part, for each query, it checks if a < b, and if so, computes the difference in prefix sums for the forward direction, else for the backward direction.

I think what's happening is that it's precomputing the cost of moving from city i to city i+1 if it's the closest, and summing these costs in prefix sums.

Then, for each query, it sums up the costs of moving from a to b via the closest cities.

But I need to verify if this is indeed calculating the minimal cost as required.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Queries:

1. 1 to 4: output 3

2. 1 to 5: output 8

3. 3 to 4: output 1

4. 3 to 2: output 4

5. 5 to 1: output 14

Let's see how the reference solution would compute these.

Assuming n=5, cities=[0,8,12,15,20]

Compute forward_cities:

For city 1 (0):

back = -99999999, forward = 8

|8-0|=8 < |0 - (-99999999)|=99999999 => forward is closer, set prog_cities[0]=1

For city 2 (8):

back=0, forward=12

|12-8|=4 < |8-0|=8 => forward is closer, set prog_cities[1]=1

For city 3 (12):

back=8, forward=15

|15-12|=3 < |12-8|=4 => forward is closer, set prog_cities[2]=1

For city 4 (15):

back=12, forward=20

|20-15|=5 < |15-12|=3 => back is closer, set prog_cities[3]=5 (distance to forward)

Wait, but prog_cities is of size n-1=4, indices 0 to 3.

So, for i=0 to 3:

i=0: city 1, prog_cities[0]=1

i=1: city 2, prog_cities[1]=1

i=2: city 3, prog_cities[2]=1

i=3: city 4, prog_cities[3]=5

Then, prefix_sum_f = [0,1,2,3,8]

Similarly, reversing the cities: [20,15,12,8,0]

Compute backward_cities:

For city 5 (20):

back=15, forward=12

|15-20|=5 < |20-12|=8 => back is closer, set prog_cities[0]=5

For city 4 (15):

back=12, forward=8

|12-15|=3 < |15-8|=7 => back is closer, set prog_cities[1]=3

For city 3 (12):

back=8, forward=0

|8-12|=4 < |12-0|=12 => back is closer, set prog_cities[2]=4

For city 2 (8):

back=0, forward=15

|0-8|=8 < |8-15|=7 => forward is closer, set prog_cities[3]=1

Then, prefix_sum_b = [0,5,8,12,13]

Wait, let's compute prefix_sum_f and prefix_sum_b properly.

forward_cities = [1,1,1,5]

prefix_sum_f = [0,1,2,3,8]

backward_cities = [5,3,4,1]

prefix_sum_b = [0,5,8,12,13]

Then, for query 1 to 4 (a=1, b=4), since a < b, print prefix_sum_f[b-1] - prefix_sum_f[a-1] = 8 - 0 = 8

But in the sample output, it's 3, not 8. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the indices are off.

Wait, in the reference solution, for a < b, it's using pref_sum_f[b-1] - pref_sum_f[a-1]

In the sample, a=1, b=4, so pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[0] = 8 - 0 = 8, but sample output is 3.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Similarly, for a=3, b=4, pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[2] = 8 - 2 = 6, but sample output is 1.

This suggests that the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I misread how the prefix sums are being used.

Alternatively, maybe the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the prog_cities should be set differently.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(cities, n):

prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)

for i in range(n - 1):

back = -99999999

forward = 99999999

if i > 0:

back = cities[i - 1]

if i < n - 1:

forward = cities[i + 1]

if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):

prog_cities[i] = 1

else:

prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])

return prog_cities

Wait, in the case where forward is closer than back, set prog_cities[i]=1, else set it to the distance to forward.

But in the sample input, for city 4 (15), back=12, forward=20.

|20-15|=5 < |15-12|=3 is false, since 5 > 3, so it should set prog_cities[3]=abs(20-15)=5, which matches what I had earlier.

But according to the sample, the cost from 1 to 4 should be 3, but according to this, it's 8.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the prog_cities should be set based on the actual closest city, not just comparing forward and back.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's given that for each city, the closest city is unique, so no ties.

Hence, for each city, we can determine if its closest city is the forward one or the backward one.

In that case, perhaps prog_cities should be set to 1 if moving to the closest city, and to the distance if not.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the minimal cost to move from one city to another via the closest cities.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost to go from a to b is the shortest path in this graph.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city repeatedly will lead me to the target in a certain number of steps, and compare that to the direct jump.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum of:

- |a_x - a_y| (direct jump)

- the number of steps to move from x to y via closest cities

But moving via closest cities might not be straightforward, as closest cities can be in either direction.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to its immediate neighbors with cost equal to the difference.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated.

Given the time constraints, I think the reference solution might be incorrect, as it doesn't match the sample output.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
