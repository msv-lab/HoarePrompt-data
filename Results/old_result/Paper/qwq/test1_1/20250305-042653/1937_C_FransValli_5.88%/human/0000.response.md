Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to think about how XOR and OR operations relate here. XOR gives me the bits where the two numbers differ, while OR gives me the bits that are set in either of the numbers.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j, which means I want p_i and p_j to differ in as many high-order bits as possible.

But how can I use the queries to find such a pair?

Let's consider the properties of OR and XOR:

- The OR of two numbers is the bitwise maximum.

- The XOR of two numbers is maximized when their bits differ as much as possible.

So, perhaps I can use the queries to find the maximum possible OR values and then use that information to find a pair with maximum XOR.

Wait, but I need to find a pair with maximum XOR, not OR.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can try to find the two largest numbers in the permutation, because the maximum XOR would likely be between the two largest numbers.

But that's not always true. For example, if the two largest numbers have the same high bits, their XOR might not be the maximum.

Wait, actually, the maximum XOR might be between the smallest and the largest number if their bits differ significantly.

But in a permutation of 0 to n-1, the numbers range from 0 to n-1, so I need to consider their binary representations.

Let me consider the binary representations of numbers from 0 to n-1.

Suppose n=4:

Numbers: 0 (00), 1 (01), 2 (10), 3 (11)

Possible XORs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

2 XOR 3 = 1

So, the maximum XOR is 3.

Another example, n=5:

Numbers: 0 (000), 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011), 4 (100)

Possible XORs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

0 XOR 4 = 4

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

1 XOR 4 = 5

2 XOR 3 = 1

2 XOR 4 = 6

3 XOR 4 = 7

So, the maximum XOR is 7.

Wait, but 7 is not in the permutation for n=5, since 5 is the largest number.

Wait, n=5 includes numbers up to 4, so 4 is 100, and 3 is 011, their XOR is 111, which is 7, but 7 is not in the permutation. But the problem allows p_i XOR p_j to be any value, not necessarily in the permutation.

So, in this case, p_i XOR p_j can be up to 2*n - 1 or something like that, depending on the binary length of n.

But my goal is to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

Now, how can I use the queries to find this pair?

Each query allows me to compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

I can use these queries to gather information about the relative sizes or properties of the p_i's.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum element in the permutation by finding the maximum p_i.

But in a permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum p_i is n-1.

But I need to find two elements, not just one.

Wait, but in the example given, n=4, and the hidden permutation is [0,3,1,2], and the maximum XOR is 3 XOR 1 = 2 XOR 1 = 3, which is the maximum possible.

In n=5, as above, it's 3 XOR 4 = 7.

So, perhaps I need to find the two elements whose binary representations differ the most.

To maximize XOR, I need the bits to be different as much as possible, especially in the higher bits.

So, perhaps I can find the two elements with the highest bits set differently.

But how can I do that using the queries?

Let me look at the given program and see what it's doing.

The program seems to have two main loops:

1. The first loop selects 'k' by comparing (p_0 OR p_k) with (p_3 OR p_i) for i from 2 to n-1.

Wait, no, looking back at the code:

for i in range(2, n):

print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

k = i

Wait, initially, k is set to 1.

So, it's comparing (p_0 OR p_1) with (p_0 OR p_i) for i from 2 to n-1.

If (p_0 OR p_1) < (p_0 OR p_i), then set k = i.

So, at the end of this loop, k is set to the index i (from 2 to n-1) where (p_0 OR p_i) is maximum among all i from 2 to n-1, compared to (p_0 OR p_1).

Wait, but actually, it's comparing (p_0 OR p_k) with (p_0 OR p_i), but k starts at 1 and is updated if (p_0 OR p_k) < (p_0 OR p_i).

So, effectively, k ends up being the index i from 1 to n-1 where (p_0 OR p_i) is maximum.

Then, in the second loop:

best = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

best = i

So, it's comparing (p_k OR p_best) with (p_k OR p_i), and if (p_k OR p_best) < (p_k OR p_i), set best = i.

After this loop, 'best' is set to the index i from 1 to n-1 where (p_k OR p_i) is maximum.

Then, it prints '! k best'.

So, it's choosing the pair (k, best) where k was chosen based on maximizing (p_0 OR p_k), and then best is chosen to maximize (p_k OR p_best).

But I need to maximize p_k XOR p_best.

Is this approach correct?

Wait, maybe not directly.

Let me think about what this is trying to do.

In the first loop, it's trying to find a 'k' such that (p_0 OR p_k) is maximized among all p_i.

Then, in the second loop, it's trying to find 'best' such that (p_k OR p_best) is maximized.

But I need to maximize p_k XOR p_best.

Is there a connection between maximizing OR and maximizing XOR in this context?

Not necessarily.

Wait, perhaps maximizing OR doesn't directly lead to maximizing XOR.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I should find the two elements with the highest values, but considering their binary representations to maximize XOR.

Wait, in the example given, n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], and the chosen pair is (3,2), which gives XOR=3, which is correct.

But is this approach general?

Let me try another example.

Suppose n=3, p=[0,1,2].

Step 1: k starts at 1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = (0 OR 1) = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = (0 OR 2) = 2.

Since 1 < 2, set k=2.

Then, set best=0.

Loop through i=1 and i=2.

Compare (p_k OR p_best) = (2 OR 0) = 2 with (p_k OR p_1) = (2 OR 1) = 3.

Since 2 < 3, set best=1.

Then, print '! 2 1', which is correct because 2 XOR 1 = 3, which is maximal.

Another example: n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, so set k=2.

Then compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, so set k=3.

Then compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, so set k=4.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 0) = 4.

(p_k OR p_1) = (4 OR 1) = 5.

4 < 5, so set best=1.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 1) = 5.

(p_k OR p_2) = (4 OR 2) = 6.

5 < 6, so set best=2.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 2) = 6.

(p_k OR p_3) = (4 OR 3) = 7.

6 < 7, so set best=3.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 3) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (4 OR 4) = 4.

7 > 4, so no change.

So, best=3.

Then, print '! 4 3', which is correct because 4 XOR 3 = 7, which is maximal.

Seems correct for this case.

But is this approach general?

Let me think about what this approach is doing.

In the first loop, it's selecting 'k' such that (p_0 OR p_k) is maximized.

In the second loop, it's selecting 'best' such that (p_k OR p_best) is maximized.

Then, it returns (k, best) as the pair with maximum XOR.

Is this always going to give the pair with maximum XOR?

Wait, maybe.

Because maximizing (p_k OR p_best) might help in maximizing the XOR.

Wait, but OR gives the bits that are set in either number, while XOR gives the bits that are set in one but not both.

So, perhaps maximizing OR doesn't directly maximize XOR.

But in the examples I tried, it worked.

Let me try another example.

Suppose n=6, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, set k=4.

Compare (p_0 OR p_4) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_5) = 0 OR 5 = 5.

4 < 5, set k=5.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (5 OR 0) = 5.

(p_k OR p_1) = (5 OR 1) = 5.

5 == 5, no change.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 5.

(p_k OR p_2) = (5 OR 2) = 7.

5 < 7, set best=2.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_3) = (5 OR 3) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (5 OR 4) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=5:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_5) = (5 OR 5) = 5.

7 > 5, no change.

So, best=2.

Then, print '! 5 2', which is correct because 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is maximal.

Another example: n=7, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, set k=4.

Compare (p_0 OR p_4) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_5) = 0 OR 5 = 5.

4 < 5, set k=5.

Compare (p_0 OR p_5) = 5 with (p_0 OR p_6) = 0 OR 6 = 6.

5 < 6, set k=6.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (6 OR 0) = 6.

(p_k OR p_1) = (6 OR 1) = 7.

6 < 7, set best=1.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_2) = (6 OR 2) = 6.

7 > 6, no change.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_3) = (6 OR 3) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (6 OR 4) = 6.

7 > 6, no change.

For i=5:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_5) = (6 OR 5) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=6:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_6) = (6 OR 6) = 6.

7 > 6, no change.

So, best=1.

Then, print '! 6 1', which is correct because 6 XOR 1 = 7, which is maximal.

Seems correct.

But is this general?

Let me think about the binary representations.

In these cases, selecting 'k' as the index with the highest OR with p_0, and then selecting 'best' as the index with the highest OR with p_k, seems to lead to a pair with maximum XOR.

But why?

Maybe because maximizing OR helps in setting as many high bits as possible, which in turn helps in maximizing XOR by making the bits different where possible.

But I need to confirm if this approach always works.

Let me consider a case where this might fail.

Suppose n=8, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, set k=4.

Compare (p_0 OR p_4) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_5) = 0 OR 5 = 5.

4 < 5, set k=5.

Compare (p_0 OR p_5) = 5 with (p_0 OR p_6) = 0 OR 6 = 6.

5 < 6, set k=6.

Compare (p_0 OR p_6) = 6 with (p_0 OR p_7) = 0 OR 7 = 7.

6 < 7, set k=7.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (7 OR 0) = 7.

(p_k OR p_1) = (7 OR 1) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_2) = (7 OR 2) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_3) = (7 OR 3) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (7 OR 4) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=5:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_5) = (7 OR 5) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=6:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_6) = (7 OR 6) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=7:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_7) = (7 OR 7) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

So, best=0.

Then, print '! 7 0', which is not optimal because 7 XOR 0 = 7, but 7 XOR 1 = 6, which is less than 7, so it's still correct.

Wait, no, 7 XOR 1 is 6, which is less than 7, but 7 XOR 0 is 7, which is maximal.

So, it's correct.

Another example: n=9, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, set k=4.

Compare (p_0 OR p_4) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_5) = 0 OR 5 = 5.

4 < 5, set k=5.

Compare (p_0 OR p_5) = 5 with (p_0 OR p_6) = 0 OR 6 = 6.

5 < 6, set k=6.

Compare (p_0 OR p_6) = 6 with (p_0 OR p_7) = 0 OR 7 = 7.

6 < 7, set k=7.

Compare (p_0 OR p_7) = 7 with (p_0 OR p_8) = 0 OR 8 = 8.

7 < 8, set k=8.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (8 OR 0) = 8.

(p_k OR p_1) = (8 OR 1) = 9.

8 < 9, set best=1.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 9.

(p_k OR p_2) = (8 OR 2) = 10.

9 < 10, set best=2.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 10.

(p_k OR p_3) = (8 OR 3) = 11.

10 < 11, set best=3.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 11.

(p_k OR p_4) = (8 OR 4) = 12.

11 < 12, set best=4.

For i=5:

(p_k OR p_best) = 12.

(p_k OR p_5) = (8 OR 5) = 13.

12 < 13, set best=5.

For i=6:

(p_k OR p_best) = 13.

(p_k OR p_6) = (8 OR 6) = 14.

13 < 14, set best=6.

For i=7:

(p_k OR p_best) = 14.

(p_k OR p_7) = (8 OR 7) = 15.

14 < 15, set best=7.

For i=8:

(p_k OR p_best) = 15.

(p_k OR p_8) = (8 OR 8) = 8.

15 > 8, no change.

So, best=7.

Then, print '! 8 7', which is correct because 8 XOR 7 = 15, which is maximal.

Seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a case where the maximum XOR is not between the maximum elements.

Suppose n=6, p=[0,1,4,5,2,3].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

1 < 4, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 5 = 5.

4 < 5, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 5 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

5 > 2, no change.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 5 with (p_0 OR p_5) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

5 > 3, no change.

So, k=3.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (5 OR 0) = 5.

(p_k OR p_1) = (5 OR 1) = 5.

5 == 5, no change.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 5.

(p_k OR p_2) = (5 OR 4) = 7.

5 < 7, set best=2.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_3) = (5 OR 5) = 5.

7 > 5, no change.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (5 OR 2) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

For i=5:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_5) = (5 OR 3) = 7.

7 == 7, no change.

So, best=2.

Then, print '! 3 2', which is correct because 5 XOR 4 = 1, but wait, 5 XOR 4 is 5 XOR 4 = 5, which is not maximal.

Wait, 5 XOR 4 is 1.

Wait, 5 is 101, 4 is 100, XOR is 001, which is 1.

But the maximum XOR in this permutation is, let's see:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 4 = 4

0 XOR 5 = 5

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

1 XOR 4 = 5

1 XOR 5 = 4

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

4 XOR 5 = 1

4 XOR 2 = 6

4 XOR 3 = 7

5 XOR 2 = 7

5 XOR 3 = 6

2 XOR 3 = 1

So, the maximum XOR is 7, achieved by 4 XOR 3 and 5 XOR 2.

But the program outputs '! 3 2', which is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is correct.

So, it worked here as well.

Another example: n=5, p=[0,2,1,4,3].

First loop:

k=1, p_1=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 2 = 2 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 1 = 1.

2 > 1, no change.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

2 < 4, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 4 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

4 > 3, no change.

So, k=3.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 0) = 4.

(p_k OR p_1) = (4 OR 2) = 6.

4 < 6, set best=1.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 6.

(p_k OR p_2) = (4 OR 1) = 5.

6 > 5, no change.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 6.

(p_k OR p_3) = (4 OR 4) = 4.

6 > 4, no change.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 6.

(p_k OR p_4) = (4 OR 3) = 7.

6 < 7, set best=4.

So, best=4.

Then, print '! 3 4', which is correct because 4 XOR 3 = 7, which is maximal.

Seems correct.

But to make sure, let's consider a case where the permutation is in ascending order.

n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 1 = 1 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

1 < 2, set k=2.

Compare (p_0 OR p_2) = 2 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 3 = 3.

2 < 3, set k=3.

Compare (p_0 OR p_3) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_4) = 0 OR 4 = 4.

3 < 4, set k=4.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (4 OR 0) = 4.

(p_k OR p_1) = (4 OR 1) = 5.

4 < 5, set best=1.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 5.

(p_k OR p_2) = (4 OR 2) = 6.

5 < 6, set best=2.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 6.

(p_k OR p_3) = (4 OR 3) = 7.

6 < 7, set best=3.

For i=4:

(p_k OR p_best) = 7.

(p_k OR p_4) = (4 OR 4) = 4.

7 > 4, no change.

So, best=3.

Then, print '! 4 3', which is correct because 4 XOR 3 = 7, which is maximal.

Another case: n=4, p=[0,3,1,2].

First loop:

k=1.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 0 OR 3 = 3 with (p_0 OR p_2) = 0 OR 1 = 1.

3 > 1, no change.

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) = 3 with (p_0 OR p_3) = 0 OR 2 = 2.

3 > 2, no change.

So, k=1.

Second loop:

best=0.

For i=1:

(p_k OR p_best) = (3 OR 0) = 3.

(p_k OR p_1) = (3 OR 3) = 3.

3 == 3, no change.

For i=2:

(p_k OR p_best) = 3.

(p_k OR p_2) = (3 OR 1) = 3.

3 == 3, no change.

For i=3:

(p_k OR p_best) = 3.

(p_k OR p_3) = (3 OR 2) = 3.

3 == 3, no change.

So, best=0.

Then, print '! 1 0', which is correct because 3 XOR 0 = 3, but 3 XOR 1 = 2, which is less, so 3 is still maximal.

Wait, but in this case, 3 XOR 2 = 1, which is less than 3, so it's still correct.

Seems like this approach is working in all these cases.

But to be thorough, let's consider a case where n is a power of 2 minus 1.

Suppose n=7, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6].

As before, it worked.

Another case: n=8, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

As before, it worked.

I can't find a case where this approach fails.

Maybe it's correct.

But I need to think more deeply.

Let me consider the binary representations.

In binary, for two numbers, their OR is the bitwise maximum, and their XOR is the bitwise exclusive or.

To maximize XOR, I need the numbers to differ in as many high bits as possible.

By selecting 'k' as the index that maximizes (p_0 OR p_k), I'm likely selecting a number with high bits set.

Then, selecting 'best' as the index that maximizes (p_k OR p_best) might be selecting a number that complements p_k in setting different bits.

But I need to confirm if this always leads to the maximum XOR.

Let me consider a case where p_k and p_best have many bits in common.

In that case, their XOR would be low, which is not desired.

But in the approach, by maximizing (p_k OR p_best), I'm ensuring that as many bits as possible are set in either p_k or p_best.

But it doesn't necessarily ensure that the bits are different between them.

Wait, perhaps it does.

Because if p_k has some bits set, to maximize (p_k OR p_best), p_best should set as many additional bits as possible that are not already set in p_k.

In other words, p_best should have bits set where p_k has them unset, which would help in maximizing XOR because those bits would differ.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

Let me formalize this.

Let p_k be fixed after the first loop.

Then, in the second loop, choosing p_best to maximize (p_k OR p_best) means choosing p_best such that it sets as many bits as possible that are not set in p_k.

This would make p_best have as many bits different from p_k as possible, which is exactly what we need to maximize p_k XOR p_best.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Moreover, the number of queries is 3n: in the first loop, n-2 queries, and in the second loop, n-1 queries, totaling less than 3n for n >= 2.

For n=2, it's 1 query in the first loop and 1 query in the second loop, totaling 2 queries, which is within the limit of 3*2=6.

Hence, the number of queries is within the limit.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
