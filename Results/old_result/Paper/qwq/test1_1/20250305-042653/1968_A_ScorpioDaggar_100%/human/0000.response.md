Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, I get the maximum possible value. And I have to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. GCD, or greatest common divisor, is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, as you mentioned.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to find y < x that makes this sum as large as possible.

Let me think about how gcd(x, y) behaves. If y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is y itself because y divides x perfectly. So, in that case, gcd(x, y) + y would be y + y = 2y.

If y is not a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is less than y. So, gcd(x, y) + y would be less than 2y.

Wait a minute, but y is less than x, so the maximum y can be is x-1.

So, if I choose y = x - 1, then gcd(x, x-1) is... well, consecutive integers are coprime, meaning their gcd is 1. So, gcd(x, x-1) = 1, and thus gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x.

But, if y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) = y, so gcd(x, y) + y = 2y.

So, which one is larger? If y is a divisor of x, then 2y versus x.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose x = 10.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5.

So, for y = 5, gcd(10,5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10.

For y = x -1 = 9, gcd(10,9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10.

So, both give the same value.

Another example, x = 7.

Divisors of 7 are 1.

y = 1: gcd(7,1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

y = 6: gcd(7,6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7.

So, y = 6 gives a larger value.

Another one, x = 21.

Divisors: 1,3,7,21. But y < x, so y can be 1,3,7.

y=7: gcd(21,7)+7=7+7=14.

y=20: gcd(21,20)+20=1+20=21.

So again, y=20 gives a higher value.

Wait, in this case, y=x-1 seems to give the maximum.

But in the first example, y being a divisor also gave the same maximum.

So, is there a pattern here?

Let me consider y = x -1.

gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers, and they share no common divisors other than 1.

Therefore, gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x.

Now, if y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x,y) + y = 2y.

So, to maximize, I need to see which is larger: 2y (when y divides x) or x.

If 2y > x, then choosing y as a divisor is better.

Otherwise, choosing y = x -1 gives gcd + y = x.

Wait, but in the examples above, when y = x -1, gcd + y = x.

And when y is a divisor, gcd + y = 2y.

So, I need to compare 2y and x.

If 2y > x, then choose y as a divisor.

Else, choose y = x -1.

Wait, but in the example where x=10, 2y = 10 when y=5, which is equal to x=10.

And y=x-1 also gives gcd + y =10.

So, both are equal.

In x=7, 2y=2*1=2, which is less than x=7.

So, choosing y=x-1=6 gives gcd + y=7, which is better.

In x=21, 2y=2*3=6, which is less than x=21.

So, choosing y=x-1=20 gives gcd + y=21, which is better.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose y = x -1 always, because gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = x, which seems to be a good value.

But wait, is there a case where choosing y as a divisor gives a higher value?

Let me see.

Suppose x=4.

Divisors of 4 are 1,2.

So, y=2: gcd(4,2)+2=2+2=4.

y=3: gcd(4,3)+3=1+3=4.

So, same.

Another example, x=6.

Divisors:1,2,3.

y=3: gcd(6,3)+3=3+3=6.

y=5: gcd(6,5)+5=1+5=6.

Again, same.

Another one, x=8.

Divisors:1,2,4.

y=4: gcd(8,4)+4=4+4=8.

y=7: gcd(8,7)+7=1+7=8.

Same again.

Hmm, so in all these cases, choosing y=x-1 gives gcd + y = x, which is the same as choosing y as the largest divisor less than x when 2y equals x.

But is there a case where choosing y as a divisor gives a higher value than y=x-1?

Let me think.

Suppose x=9.

Divisors:1,3.

y=3: gcd(9,3)+3=3+3=6.

y=8: gcd(9,8)+8=1+8=9.

So, y=8 is better.

Another one, x=12.

Divisors:1,2,3,4,6.

y=6: gcd(12,6)+6=6+6=12.

y=11: gcd(12,11)+11=1+11=12.

Same.

Another one, x=15.

Divisors:1,3,5.

y=5: gcd(15,5)+5=5+5=10.

y=14: gcd(15,14)+14=1+14=15.

So, y=14 is better.

It seems that choosing y=x-1 always gives gcd + y = x, while choosing y as a divisor gives 2y, which is often less than x.

Therefore, the maximum possible value of gcd(x,y) + y is x, achieved by setting y = x -1.

And the problem allows any y that satisfies the condition, so choosing y = x -1 is always a safe choice.

So, in the program, it seems like it's iterating through all possible y from 1 to x-1, calculating gcd(x,y) + y, and keeping track of the y that gives the maximum value.

That seems correct.

But, is there a more efficient way?

Well, since x is up to 1000 and t is up to 1000, iterating through all y for each x should be acceptable in terms of performance.

But, if we want to optimize, we could directly set y = x -1, since it always gives gcd + y = x, which seems to be the maximum.

But let's check if there's any x where choosing y = x -1 is not optimal.

From the examples above, I don't see such a case.

Wait, suppose x=2.

y can only be 1.

gcd(2,1)+1=1+1=2.

y=1 is the only option, and it's acceptable.

Another case, x=3.

y=1: gcd(3,1)+1=1+1=2.

y=2: gcd(3,2)+2=1+2=3.

So, y=2 is better.

So, y=x-1=2 gives gcd + y=3, which is better than y=1.

So, y=x-1 seems always to be a safe choice.

Therefore, the program can be simplified to just output y = x -1 for each x.

But in the given program, it's iterating through all possible y and finding the maximum.

That should also work correctly.

Let me look at the program code.

It reads the number of test cases, n, and then for each test case, reads x.

Then, it initializes max to -1 and argmax_y to -1.

Then, it loops through y from 1 to x-1.

For each y, it calculates gcd(x,y) + y.

If this value is greater than the current max, it updates max and sets argmax_y to y.

Finally, it prints argmax_y.

This seems correct.

It's checking all possible y and selecting the one that gives the maximum gcd(x,y) + y.

As we've seen, y = x -1 often gives the maximum value of x.

So, this should work.

But, there might be a more efficient way.

Wait, in the problem constraints, x can be up to 1000 and t up to 1000.

So, iterating up to 1000 times for each test case would be acceptable, as 1000*1000=10^6 operations, which is fine.

But, if we want to optimize, we can directly set y = x -1, since it seems to always give the maximum value.

But, according to the problem, any y that satisfies the condition is acceptable.

So, choosing y = x -1 should be acceptable.

But, to be thorough, let's confirm if there's any x where y = x -1 is not the best choice.

From the earlier examples, I don't see such a case.

Another example: x=100.

Divisors:1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50.

y=50: gcd(100,50)+50=50+50=100.

y=99: gcd(100,99)+99=1+99=100.

Same.

Another one: x=1000.

y=500: gcd(1000,500)+500=500+500=1000.

y=999: gcd(1000,999)+999=1+999=1000.

Again, same.

So, seems consistent.

Hence, the program is correct in its approach.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized.

## Approach
1. **Understanding GCD Behavior**:
   - If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \text{GCD}(x, y) = y \), making the sum \( 2y \).
   - If \( y \) is not a divisor of \( x \), \( \text{GCD}(x, y) \) is less than \( y \), making the sum less than \( 2y \).
   - Notably, for \( y = x - 1 \), \( \text{GCD}(x, x-1) = 1 \) (since consecutive integers are coprime), making the sum \( x \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - By choosing \( y = x - 1 \), the sum is always \( x \).
   - For divisors \( y \), the sum is \( 2y \). To check if \( 2y \) can be greater than \( x \), consider:
     - If \( 2y > x \), choosing \( y \) as a divisor would be better.
     - Otherwise, choosing \( y = x - 1 \) gives the sum \( x \), which appears to be the maximum achievable sum.

3. **General Strategy**:
   - Iterate through all possible \( y \) from 1 to \( x-1 \), compute \( \text{GCD}(x, y) + y \), and select the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum.

## Solution Code
```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(t):
        x = int(data[1 + i])
        max_sum = -1
        argmax_y = -1
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_sum = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                argmax_y = y
        print(argmax_y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation
- **Input Handling**: Read the input values for the number of test cases and the values of \( x \) for each test case.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, read the value of \( x \).
- **Find Maximum Sum**:
  - Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding \( y \).
  - Iterate through each possible \( y \) from 1 to \( x-1 \):
    - Calculate \( \text{GCD}(x, y) + y \).
    - Update the maximum sum and the corresponding \( y \) if the current sum is greater.
- **Output the Result**: Print the \( y \) value that gives the maximum sum for each test case.

This approach ensures that we find the correct \( y \) for each \( x \) that maximizes the sum \( \text{GCD}(x, y) + y \).
