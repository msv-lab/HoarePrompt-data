Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists given the constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The constraints say that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9. Also, the number of test cases can be up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^7, which seems manageable.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Example 1:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

- No subsequence sums to 2 (since the only subsequence is [1], which sums to 1).

- For v=1 (since v=2 is k and should be excluded), there is a subsequence [1] that sums to 1.

Seems correct.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1, since all elements are at least 2.

- For v=2 to 6, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

For example:

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [6]

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- No subsequence sums to 8, since the maximum sum is 7.

- For v=1 to 7, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- No subsequence sums to 3.

- For v=1 to 9, excluding 3, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- No subsequence sums to 7.

- For v=1 to 10, excluding 7, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

From these examples, I can see that the sequence provided satisfies the conditions for each test case.

Now, I need to generalize this to any n and k.

I need to find a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:

- There is no subsequence that sums to k.

- For every v from 1 to n, except k, there is a subsequence that sums to v.

First, I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable, and that k is not achievable.

One way to approach this is to start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

A standard way to generate all sums from 1 to some value is to use powers of 2, since with powers of 2, you can represent any number uniquely in binary.

For example, [1, 2, 4, 8, ...] can generate any sum up to the sum of the sequence.

But in this problem, we might need to exclude k, so I need to adjust the sequence accordingly.

Let me think about the properties required.

First, the sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

I need to make sure that k cannot be achieved, but all other sums can be achieved.

Another approach is to include elements that naturally exclude k from being achievable.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate sums from 1 to n.

- Modify the sequence to ensure that k cannot be achieved.

But how?

One possible way is to remove or replace elements that contribute to the sum k.

But this might be tricky, as removing an element could affect multiple sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can include elements in such a way that k is the only sum that cannot be achieved.

Wait a minute, in the third example, n=8, k=8, and the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can generate all sums from 1 to 7, and not 8.

Similarly, in the second example, n=6, k=1, and the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot generate 1, but can generate all sums from 2 to 6.

So, in cases where k=1, I can have a sequence starting from 2 up to n.

But k can be any value from 1 to n, so I need a general approach.

Let me consider the case where k is not 1.

If k is not 1, perhaps I can include 1 in the sequence, and then adjust for k.

Wait, but in the first example, k=2, and the sequence is [1], which cannot generate 2.

But in that case, since the only subsequence is [1], which sums to 1, 2 cannot be achieved, which is what we want.

In the fourth example, k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can generate all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, perhaps including 1s can help in generating many sums, but excluding specific ones.

But including multiple 1s can make it difficult to exclude a particular sum.

Wait, in the third example, with k=8 and sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], it can generate all sums from 1 to 7, and not 8.

So, using multiple 1s can help in generating sums up to the sum of the sequence, but not beyond.

But in that case, if k is greater than the sum of the sequence, then k cannot be achieved, which is what happened in the third example.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6, k=1, sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot generate 1, and can generate sums from 2 to 6.

Similarly, in the first example, n=2, k=2, sequence is [1], which cannot generate 2.

In the fourth example, n=9, k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1], which cannot generate 3.

So, perhaps a general strategy is:

- If k=1, then the sequence can start from 2 up to n.

- If k is greater than the sum of the sequence, then k cannot be achieved.

But I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, can be achieved, and that k cannot be achieved.

Wait, but in the third example, k=8, and the sum of the sequence is 7, so 8 cannot be achieved.

Similarly, in the second example, k=1, and the smallest element is 2, so 1 cannot be achieved.

In the first example, k=2, and the only element is 1, so 2 cannot be achieved.

In the fourth example, k=3, and the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which cannot generate 3.

So, perhaps the strategy is to include elements such that the sum of any subsequence does not equal k, while being able to generate all other sums from 1 to n.

But how to ensure that?

One approach could be to include elements that are powers of 2, up to a certain point, and then adjust for k.

Wait, but powers of 2 can generate any sum uniquely, up to the sum of the sequence.

But in this problem, I need to exclude k from being achievable, while including all other sums.

So, maybe I can exclude the element that would allow the sum k to be achieved.

But that might not always be sufficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

This sounds similar to generating all subsets sums, except excluding one particular sum.

This is a bit tricky because subsets sums can overlap in complex ways.

Another idea: Maybe I can find a minimal set of numbers that covers all sums from 1 to n except k.

But minimality might not be necessary, as the problem allows up to 25 elements.

Wait, the problem allows up to 25 elements in the sequence, which is a small number, so I need to find an efficient way to represent the sums.

I recall that with a sequence of distinct powers of 2, I can represent any sum uniquely.

But in this problem, I need to exclude k, so perhaps I need to modify the sequence to make k unachievable.

Wait, in the fourth example, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can generate sums like:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [4,1]

- 6: [4,1,1]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [7,1]

- 9: [7,1,1]

But it cannot generate 3.

So, even though 1+1+1=3, but in this sequence, there are only two 1s, so the maximum sum involving 1s is 2.

Wait, no, the sequence has two 1s, so 1+1=2, and 4+1=5, 4+1+1=5, wait, but 1+1+4=6, and 7 can be used to make higher sums.

Wait, but 3 is not achievable in this sequence.

Wait, 1+1+1=3, but there are only two 1s in the sequence, so 3 cannot be achieved.

Wait, the sequence has two 1s, so the maximum sum involving 1s is 2.

Wait, but in the fourth example, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which has two 1s.

So, sums involving 1s:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

Higher sums can be achieved by adding 4 and 7.

So, 3 cannot be achieved because to get 3, I would need three 1s, but there are only two 1s.

Hence, 3 is excluded, which is what we want in this test case.

So, perhaps a strategy is to include multiple instances of certain numbers to allow more combinations, but restrict the number of copies to prevent certain sums from being achieved.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think of another approach.

I recall that in the subset sum problem, if I have a set of numbers, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, where m is the number of elements.

Each subset has a unique sum, provided that the elements are distinct and positive.

But in this problem, elements can be zero or duplicate.

Wait, the problem allows non-negative integers, which includes zero.

But including zero doesn't help in achieving any sum, since it doesn't contribute to the sum.

So, perhaps it's better to avoid including zero.

Now, to maximize the number of achievable sums, I need to have a sequence where the subsets can generate many different sums.

But I need to exclude k from being achievable.

One way to ensure that k is not achievable is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

But at the same time, all other sums from 1 to n, except k, should be achievable.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, modify the sequence to make k unachievable.

But how?

One idea is to remove an element that is necessary to achieve k, but ensure that all other sums can still be achieved.

But this might not always be possible, especially if k can be achieved in multiple ways.

Another idea is to include elements in such a way that all sums are covered except k.

This seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where the sums of its subsets cover all integers from 1 to n, except for one specific value k.

This sounds similar to a complete set minus one element.

But in subset sum terms, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the binary representations.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion principles can help here.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider the maximum number of elements allowed, which is 25.

Given that m <= 25, and each a_i can be up to 10^9, it suggests that the sequence can be relatively small but with large elements.

I need to find a sequence of at most 25 elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except for k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t can be up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, it's important to find an efficient way to construct the sequence.

Let me consider using powers of 2, since they can generate all sums up to the sum of the sequence.

For example, [1,2,4,8,16,...] can generate any sum up to the sum of the sequence.

But in this problem, I need to exclude k from being achievable.

So, perhaps I can exclude the element that would allow the sum k to be achieved.

Wait, but k could be a sum of multiple elements, not necessarily a single element.

So, excluding one element might not be sufficient to prevent k from being achievable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I adjust it so that k cannot be achieved.

One way to do this is to remove an element that is necessary for achieving k, but ensure that all other sums can still be achieved.

But this might not always be possible, especially if k can be achieved in multiple ways.

Another idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that allow generating all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, modify the sequence to make k unachievable, while keeping the ability to achieve all other sums.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the case where k is not a power of 2.

Suppose I have powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

For example, for n=10, the powers of 2 are [1,2,4,8].

This can generate all sums from 1 to 15, but I only need up to 10.

Now, if k is, say, 3, I need to modify the sequence so that 3 cannot be achieved.

But in the original sequence [1,2,4,8], 3 can be achieved as 1+2.

So, to prevent 3 from being achieved, I can remove 2, but then I cannot achieve 2 or 3.

But I need to achieve all other sums except k.

So, removing 2 would prevent achieving 2 and 3, which is not desirable.

Alternatively, I can replace 2 with another number that doesn't allow 3 to be achieved.

For example, replace 2 with 4.

Wait, 4 is already in the sequence.

Wait, maybe replace 2 with 3.

But then the sequence is [1,3,4,8], which can generate:

- 1: [1]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1,4]

- 7: [3,4]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1,8]

- 11: [3,8]

- 12: [4,8]

- 15: [1,4,8]

But it cannot generate 2, for example.

So, in this case, k=3 is achievable, which is not what I want.

Wait, I need to make k unachievable.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be achieved is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This is similar to the minimal subset with forbidden sum, which is a known problem.

I recall that in such problems, one can use a greedy approach to select elements that do not allow the forbidden sum to be achieved.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider building the sequence step by step.

Start with an empty sequence.

Add elements one by one, ensuring that k cannot be achieved at any step, while being able to achieve all other sums up to n.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence a1, a2, ..., am.

I need to ensure that the subset sum equal to k does not exist, but for every v != k, there exists a subset summing to v.

This sounds like the sequence should cover all sums except k.

I need to find such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that m <= 25, and n can be up to 10^6, I need to find a way to cover a large range of sums with a small number of elements, excluding only k.

This seems challenging.

Wait, perhaps I can use a combination of small and large elements to cover the required sums.

For example, include small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover higher sums.

But I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

- To exclude k, I can ensure that there is no subset of elements that sums to k.

One way to do this is to include elements such that any subset summing to k is impossible due to the absence of certain elements.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements required to generate all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

Given that m <= 25, I need to find a way to cover the sums efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m elements, I can generate up to 2^m - 1 distinct sums.

But in this problem, I need to cover n-1 sums (all from 1 to n except k).

Given that m <= 25, 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way more than n=10^6.

But n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, so I need an efficient way to construct the sequence.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, adjust the set to exclude the sum k.

To generate all sums from 1 to n, using the minimal number of elements, I can use the greedy algorithm, choosing the largest possible element at each step.

This is similar to the coin change problem, where I want to cover all amounts from 1 to n with the fewest number of coin denominations.

In the standard coin change problem, using denominations that are powers of 2 is efficient.

But in this problem, I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can use powers of 2 up to a certain point and then adjust for k.

Wait, but k could be any value between 1 and n.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n.

Then, I need to ensure that k is not among the achievable sums.

But since s can be larger than n, I can include sums beyond n, but I only care about sums from 1 to n.

Wait, but the problem requires that for all v from 1 to n, except k, there is a subsequence that sums to v.

So, I need to cover v from 1 to n, excluding k.

One idea is to construct a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

But how?

Let me consider the standard way to generate all sums from 1 to n using binary representation.

If I take the sequence of powers of 2, up to the largest power less than or equal to n, I can generate all sums from 1 to n.

For example, if n=10, the sequence [1,2,4,8] can generate all sums from 1 to 15.

But I need to exclude k=7, for instance.

So, I need to modify this sequence so that 7 cannot be achieved, but all other sums from 1 to 10, except 7, can be achieved.

One way to do this is to remove an element that is necessary to achieve k.

For k=7, in the sequence [1,2,4,8], 7 is achieved by 1+2+4.

So, if I remove any of 1,2, or 4, 7 cannot be achieved.

But removing 1 would prevent achieving 1, which is not allowed.

Similarly, removing 2 would prevent achieving 2, and removing 4 would prevent achieving 4.

None of these is desirable, as I need to achieve all sums except k.

So, removing an element isn't a good approach.

Another idea is to replace one of the elements involved in the sum k with another value.

For example, replace 4 with something else.

Suppose I replace 4 with 5.

Then, the sequence becomes [1,2,5,8].

Now, let's see what sums can be achieved:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 4: [5-1], but since we can't have negative elements, this isn't possible.

Wait, but I'm only allowing addition, not subtraction.

So, 4 cannot be achieved in this sequence.

But in this case, k=7 can be achieved as 2+5.

Wait, but I need to prevent k=7 from being achievable.

Wait, in this new sequence [1,2,5,8], sums are:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [1+5]

- 7: [2+5]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 10: [2+8]

So, in this sequence, 7 can still be achieved.

So, replacing 4 with 5 doesn't help in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different replacement.

Suppose I replace 4 with 6.

Then, the sequence is [1,2,6,8].

Possible sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 6: [6]

- 7: [1+6]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 10: [2+8]

- 11: [2+6+3], wait, no, 2+6=8, 1+6=7, etc.

Wait, in this sequence, 4 cannot be achieved, and 7 can be achieved as 1+6.

But in this case, I need to achieve all sums from 1 to 10 except k=7.

Wait, but in this sequence, 7 is achievable, which is not what I want.

So, I need to prevent 7 from being achievable.

Let me try replacing 4 with a different number.

Suppose I replace 4 with 7.

Then, the sequence is [1,2,7,8].

Possible sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 10: [2+8]

- 1+7=8 (already have 8)

- 2+7=9 (already have 9)

- 1+2+7=10 (already have 10)

So, in this sequence, 7 is achievable, which is not what I want.

Wait, but the problem says to exclude k from being achievable.

So, in this case, k=7 should not be achievable.

But in this sequence, it is achievable.

So, I need to adjust the sequence to make 7 unachievable.

Let me try replacing 4 with 5 again.

Sequence: [1,2,5,8]

Possible sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [1+5]

- 7: [2+5]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 10: [2+8]

So, 7 is still achievable.

Wait, perhaps I need to replace 4 with a number that doesn't allow 7 to be achieved.

Suppose I replace 4 with 3.

Sequence: [1,2,3,8]

Possible sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [1+3]

- 5: [2+3]

- 6: [1+2+3]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 10: [2+8]

In this sequence, 7 cannot be achieved.

So, in this case, for n=10 and k=7, the sequence [1,2,3,8] works.

This matches the fifth example, where n=10, k=7, and the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which is the same as [1,2,3,8].

So, in this case, by replacing 4 with 3, 7 becomes unachievable.

This seems promising.

So, perhaps a general strategy is:

- Start with the sequence of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

- Identify the subset that sums to k.

- Replace one of the elements in that subset with a different value that prevents k from being achievable, but allows other sums to be achieved.

In the above example, for k=7, which is 1+2+4, I replaced 4 with 3, which allowed other sums to be achieved but made 7 unachievable.

This seems like a possible approach.

Let me try another example to see if this strategy works.

Take n=9, k=3.

From the fourth example, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that with two 1s, 3 cannot be achieved because 1+1+1=3, but there are only two 1s.

Wait, but in this sequence, 1+1=2, and 1+4=5, etc., but 3 cannot be achieved.

So, in this case, by including two 1s and a 4 and a 7, 3 cannot be achieved.

But in terms of my earlier strategy, starting with powers of 2: [1,2,4,8], which can generate all sums up to 15.

To exclude k=3, which is 1+2, I need to adjust the sequence.

If I replace 2 with 3, the sequence becomes [1,3,4,8].

Possible sums:

- 1: [1]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1+4]

- 7: [3+4]

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1+8]

- 11: [3+8]

- 12: [4+8]

- 15: [1+4+8]

Here, 2 cannot be achieved, and 3 can be achieved.

But in this case, k=3 needs to be unachievable.

So, replacing 2 with 3 makes 3 achievable, which is not desired.

Wait, but in the fourth example, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which cannot achieve 3.

So, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Let me consider that in the fourth example, with [7,1,4,1], the sums are:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1+1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1+4]

- 6: [1+1+4]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [1+7]

- 9: [1+1+7]

- And 3 is not achievable.

So, by including two 1s and 4 and 7, 3 cannot be achieved.

This suggests that having multiple instances of smaller numbers can help in generating more sums, but excluding specific sums by limiting the number of smaller elements.

This seems a bit tricky to generalize.

Let me think differently.

I recall that in coding theory, there are concepts of covering codes and forbidden sums, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of generating functions.

The generating function for the sequence is the product of (1 + x^a_i) for each a_i in the sequence.

I need this generating function to have coefficients for x^v for v from 1 to n, except for x^k, which should have coefficient 0.

But manipulating generating functions directly might not be practical for this problem.

Given the time constraints, I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider the following heuristic:

- Start with the sequence of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

- If the sum k can be achieved with this sequence, replace one of the elements involved in the sum with a different value that prevents k from being achievable, but allows other sums to be achieved.

In the earlier example with n=10, k=7, replacing 4 with 3 worked.

Let me try another example.

Take n=5, k=3.

Start with [1,2,4].

This can generate sums: 1,2,3(1+2),4,5(1+4),6(2+4),7(1+2+4).

I need to exclude 3.

So, replace 2 with 3.

Sequence: [1,3,4].

Possible sums: 1,3,4,5(1+4),7(3+4),8(1+3+4).

Here, 2 cannot be achieved, and 3 can be achieved.

But I need to exclude 3.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, replace 1 with 0.

Sequence: [0,2,4].

Possible sums: 0,2,4,6(2+4).

But then 1 cannot be achieved, which is not desired.

Alternatively, remove 1.

Sequence: [2,4].

Possible sums: 2,4,6.

Here, 1,3,5 cannot be achieved.

But I only need to exclude 3, and allow 1,2,4,5.

So, in this case, adding a 1 back in would allow 1,2(2),3(1+2),4(4),5(1+4).

But then 3 is achievable again.

Wait, perhaps including 1 and 4, and replacing 2 with something else.

Suppose sequence: [1,4,5].

Possible sums: 1,4,5,1+4=5,1+5=6,4+5=9,1+4+5=10.

Here, 2,3 cannot be achieved.

But in this case, for n=5, k=3, this would allow achieving 1,2,4,5, but 2 is not achievable.

So, I need to adjust further.

Perhaps include two 1s and a 4.

Sequence: [1,1,4].

Possible sums: 1,2(1+1),4,5(1+4),6(1+1+4).

Here, 3 cannot be achieved.

This matches the earlier example where multiple 1s are used to generate more sums but exclude specific sums by limiting the number of 1s.

So, perhaps a general strategy is:

- Include enough 1s to generate sums up to a certain point, and larger elements to cover higher sums.

- The number of 1s should be such that the sum k cannot be achieved.

But determining the exact number of 1s and the larger elements needed is tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

I recall that with a sequence containing powers of 2, I can represent any number uniquely.

But I need to exclude k.

Perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Wait, but that might not prevent k from being achievable, as k could be a sum of multiple elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Given that m can be up to 25, and n can be up to 10^6, I need a way to cover a large range of sums with a small number of elements.

One way to cover a large range is to include elements that are powers of 2, as they can generate all sums up to the sum of the sequence.

But I need to exclude k.

Let me consider that the sum of the first m powers of 2 is 2^{m+1} - 1.

For m=25, the sum is over 33 million, which is way more than n=10^6.

But I need to cover only up to n=10^6, excluding k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums up to n, excluding k, by carefully choosing the elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the sequence containing the smallest elements that can cover all sums up to n, excluding k.

- Use a greedy algorithm to select elements that cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing k to be achieved.

This sounds promising, but I need to formalize it.

Let me try to implement this idea step by step.

Initialize an empty sequence a.

Initialize a set of required sums S = {1,2,...,n} - {k}.

While S is not empty:

- Find the smallest sum s in S.

- Add s to the sequence a.

- Remove all sums in S that can be achieved by adding s to any existing sum in a.

But this might not work, because adding s to a would allow all sums that can be achieved by combining s with existing elements in a, which could be more than just s itself.

Wait, perhaps I need to use a different approach.

Let me consider that with a sequence a, the set of achievable sums is the power set sum of a.

I need this set to include all v from 1 to n except k.

This seems too broad.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

- Start with an empty sequence a.

- Initialize a set of achievable sums as empty.

- While the set of achievable sums does not include all v from 1 to n except k:

- Choose the smallest sum s that is not yet achievable, and s != k.

- Add s to the sequence a.

- Update the set of achievable sums by including s and all sums that can be achieved by adding s to existing achievable sums.

This is similar to building a minimal set of generators for the required sums.

But I need to ensure that k is not achievable in this process.

Let me try this with n=5, k=3.

Initialize a = [], achievable sums = empty set.

Required sums: {1,2,4,5}.

Smallest sum not achievable: 1.

Add 1 to a, a = [1], achievable sums = {1}.

Next smallest sum not achievable: 2.

Add 2 to a, a = [1,2], achievable sums = {1,2,3}.

Wait, but 3 is k and should not be achievable.

So, in this step, adding 2 allows achieving 3 (1+2), which is k.

To prevent this, I need to avoid adding 2.

Instead, add the next smallest sum not yet achievable, which is 4.

Add 4 to a, a = [1,4], achievable sums = {1,4,5(1+4)}.

Now, achievable sums are {1,4,5}.

Next smallest sum not achievable: 2.

Add 2 to a, a = [1,4,2], achievable sums = {1,2,3(1+2),4,5(1+4),6(2+4)}.

But 3 is k and should not be achievable.

So, this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should avoid adding sums that would allow k to be achieved.

In this step, when considering adding 2 to a, I see that 1+2=3=k, which should not be achievable.

Therefore, I should not add 2.

Instead, add the next smallest sum not achievable and not leading to k.

In this case, add 4.

a = [1,4], achievable sums = {1,4,5}.

Next smallest sum not achievable: 2.

But adding 2 would allow 1+2=3=k.

So, skip 2.

Next is 3, but 3 is k and should not be achievable.

Next is 6 (2+4), but 2 is not yet in a.

Wait, in this approach, it's getting complicated.

Perhaps this greedy approach isn't working.

Let me think differently.

I recall that in the subset sum problem, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, which for m=25 is 33,554,432, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

So, it's feasible to find such a sequence.

But I need a systematic way to construct it.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can generate up to 2^m -1 distinct positive sums.

Given that m can be up to 25, 2^25 -1 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n=10^6.

So, it's definitely possible.

But I need to ensure that k is not among the achievable sums.

One way to do this is to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This is similar to constructing a set with no subset sum equal to a forbidden value.

I recall that in coding theory, there are concepts like sum-free sets or sets with forbidden sums.

But I need a practical way to construct such a set.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, modify the sequence to make k unachievable.

But as seen earlier, this is tricky.

An alternative approach is to include elements that naturally exclude k from being achievable.

For example, if k is not a sum of any subset, due to the way the elements are chosen.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are all greater than k, then no subset can sum to k.

But in this case, I won't be able to achieve sums less than the smallest element in the sequence.

Unless I include smaller elements as well.

Wait, in the second example, n=6, k=1, sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot achieve 1, but can achieve all other sums from 2 to 6.

This matches the requirement.

So, in this case, since k=1, and all elements are greater than 1, k cannot be achieved, and all other sums can be achieved by including the appropriate elements.

Similarly, in the third example, n=8, k=8, sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can achieve all sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

So, in this case, by limiting the sum of the sequence to be less than k, k cannot be achieved.

This seems like a possible strategy.

So, generalizing:

- If k=1, then choose elements all greater than 1, e.g., starting from 2 up to n.

- If k > 1, then include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

In the case where k > 1, I need to ensure that k cannot be achieved, but all other sums can be.

This is still tricky.

Let me consider that if I include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, I need to carefully choose which elements to include.

One way is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can have duplicates.

In the third example, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], seven 1's, which can generate sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

Similarly, in the fourth example, [7,1,4,1], which can generate sums up to 9, excluding 3.

So, perhaps including multiple instances of small elements can help in generating many sums, while excluding specific sums by limiting the number of small elements.

But determining the exact number of each element
