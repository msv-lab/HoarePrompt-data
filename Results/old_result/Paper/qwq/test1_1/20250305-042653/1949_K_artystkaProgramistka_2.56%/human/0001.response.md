Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given n positive integers, and three positive integers n_a, n_b, and n_c that add up to n. I need to split these n integers into three groups with sizes n_a, n_b, and n_c respectively. Then, I have to check if the sums of these groups can form the sides of a triangle with positive area. If it's possible, I need to output one way to do this splitting; otherwise, just output "NO".

First, I need to understand what it means for three lengths to form a triangle with positive area. I recall that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if s_a, s_b, and s_c are the sums of the three groups, then s_a + s_b > s_c, s_a + s_c > s_b, and s_b + s_c > s_a must all hold true.

Now, the problem is to determine if such a splitting is possible and, if so, to provide one such splitting.

Looking at the given code, it seems like there's a main function that reads input and calls another function, func_2, to handle each test case. The output is collected in a list and printed at the end.

In func_2, the numbers are sorted in reverse order, which means from largest to smallest. Then, there are three groups: group_a, group_b, and group_c, each starting empty, and their sums sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c starting at zero.

There's a function called distribute_number that seems to place the numbers into one of the three groups based on some conditions.

Let's look at the distribute_number function. It appears to place the number into the group that has the smallest sum among the groups that haven't reached their size limit yet. This makes sense intuitively because we want to balance the sums across the groups.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if the group hasn't reached its size limit or if it has reached its limit but has the smallest sum among the other groups. That seems like a way to balance the sums.

After distributing all numbers, it checks if the sums satisfy the triangle inequality. If they do, it returns 'YES' along with the groups; otherwise, 'NO'.

Looking back at the example in the problem statement, in the first test case, n=6, na=2, nb=2, nc=2, and all x_i=1. So, sum_a=2, sum_b=2, sum_c=2, which satisfies the triangle inequality since 2+2>2, etc.

In the second test case, n=5, na=3, nb=1, nc=1, all x_i=1. So, sum_a=3, sum_b=1, sum_c=1. But 1 + 1 is not greater than 3, so it's 'NO', which matches the output.

In the third test case, n=6, na=2, nb=2, nc=2, x=[1,1,1,1,1,3]. Let's see:

If we sort in reverse: [3,1,1,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 3 goes to group_a (sum_a=3)

- 1 goes to group_b (sum_b=1)

- 1 goes to group_c (sum_c=1)

- 1 goes to group_a (sum_a=4)

- 1 goes to group_b (sum_b=2)

- 1 goes to group_c (sum_c=2)

So, sum_a=4, sum_b=2, sum_c=2. Now, 2 + 2 > 4? No, 4 >= 4, so it's 'NO', which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, n=8, na=1, nb=2, nc=5, x=[16,1,1,1,1,1,1,12].

Sort reverse: [16,12,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 16 to group_a (sum_a=16)

- 12 to group_b (sum_b=12)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=1)

- 1 to group_a (sum_a=17)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=13)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=2)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=3)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=4)

So, sum_a=17, sum_b=13, sum_c=4. Check: 17 + 13 > 4, 17 + 4 > 13, 13 + 4 > 17. Yes, 30>4, 21>13, 17>13. So, 'YES', which matches the output.

Seems like the logic is working based on the examples.

But I need to think about whether this approach is always correct. Is there a case where this method fails?

Let me think of a scenario where the largest numbers are forced into one group, making the sums unbalanced.

Suppose n=6, na=1, nb=2, nc=3, x=[10,1,1,1,1,1]. Sort reverse: [10,1,1,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 10 to group_a (sum_a=10)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=1)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=1)

- 1 to group_a (sum_a=11)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=2)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=2)

So, sum_a=11, sum_b=2, sum_c=2. Check: 11 + 2 > 2, 11 + 2 > 2, but 2 + 2 not > 11. So, 'NO', which is correct.

Another test case: n=7, na=2, nb=2, nc=3, x=[5,4,3,2,2,2,1].

Sort reverse: [5,4,3,2,2,2,1]

Distribute:

- 5 to group_a (sum_a=5)

- 4 to group_b (sum_b=4)

- 3 to group_c (sum_c=3)

- 2 to group_a (sum_a=7)

- 2 to group_b (sum_b=6)

- 2 to group_c (sum_c=5)

- 1 to group_a (sum_a=8)

Wait, but group_a already has 2 numbers (5 and 2), so na=2, so the third 2 should go to group_b or group_c.

Wait, in the code, it's appending to group_a only if group_a hasn't reached its size limit or if it has reached its limit but has the smallest sum among the other groups.

Wait, in this case, group_a can only have 2 numbers, so the third 2 should go to group_b or group_c based on their sums.

Assuming group_b has sum_b=4 and group_c has sum_c=3, so group_c has the smaller sum, so 2 goes to group_c (sum_c=5).

Then, 1 goes to group_b (sum_b=5).

So, group_a=[5,2], sum_a=7; group_b=[4,1], sum_b=5; group_c=[3,2], sum_c=5.

Check: 7 + 5 > 5, 7 + 5 > 5, 5 + 5 > 7. Yes, so 'YES'.

Seems correct.

But let's think of a case where this approach might fail.

Suppose n=5, na=1, nb=1, nc=3, x=[10,1,1,1,1]. Sort reverse: [10,1,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 10 to group_a (sum_a=10)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=1)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=1)

- 1 to group_b (but group_b already has 1, and na=1 is full), so to group_c (sum_c=2)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=3)

So, group_a=[10], sum_a=10; group_b=[1], sum_b=1; group_c=[1,1,1], sum_c=3.

Check: 10 + 1 > 3, 10 + 3 > 1, but 1 + 3 not > 10. So, 'NO'.

Is there a better way to split?

If group_a=[10], group_b=[1,1], sum_b=2; group_c=[1,1], sum_c=2.

Then, check: 10 + 2 > 2, 10 + 2 > 2, 2 + 2 > 10? No, 4 > 10 is false. Still 'NO'.

Alternatively, group_a=[10], group_b=[1,1,1], sum_b=3; group_c=[1], sum_c=1.

But group_b size is 3, which is more than nb=1, which is invalid.

So, no, 'NO' is correct.

Another test case: n=6, na=2, nb=2, nc=2, x=[3,2,2,1,1,1].

Sort reverse: [3,2,2,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 3 to group_a (sum_a=3)

- 2 to group_b (sum_b=2)

- 2 to group_c (sum_c=2)

- 1 to group_a (sum_a=4)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=3)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=3)

Check: 4 + 3 > 3, 4 + 3 > 3, 3 + 3 > 4. Yes, so 'YES'.

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if the groups are assigned differently? For example, group_a=[3,1], sum_a=4; group_b=[2,1], sum_b=3; group_c=[2,1], sum_c=3.

Same as above.

Is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think of a case where the sums are close, and the distribution causes one sum to be too large.

Suppose n=7, na=2, nb=2, nc=3, x=[5,4,3,2,2,2,1].

Sort reverse: [5,4,3,2,2,2,1]

Distribute:

- 5 to group_a (sum_a=5)

- 4 to group_b (sum_b=4)

- 3 to group_c (sum_c=3)

- 2 to group_a (sum_a=7)

- 2 to group_b (sum_b=6)

- 2 to group_c (sum_c=5)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=6)

Wait, but in this case, group_a=[5,2], sum_a=7; group_b=[4,2], sum_b=6; group_c=[3,2,1], sum_c=6.

Check: 7 + 6 > 6, 7 + 6 > 6, 6 + 6 > 7. Yes, so 'YES'.

Is there a better distribution? If I try to balance the sums more evenly.

Alternative distribution: group_a=[5,1], sum_a=6; group_b=[4,2], sum_b=6; group_c=[3,2,2], sum_c=7.

Check: 6 + 6 > 7, 6 + 7 > 6, 6 + 7 > 6. Yes, same result.

So, the approach seems to work.

But what if n_a, n_b, n_c are different?

Let's try n=9, na=1, nb=2, nc=6, x=[10,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Sort reverse: [10,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Distribute:

- 10 to group_a (sum_a=10)

- 2 to group_b (sum_b=2)

- 2 to group_c (sum_c=2)

- 1 to group_b (sum_b=3)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=3)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=4)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=5)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=6)

- 1 to group_c (sum_c=7)

So, group_a=[10], sum_a=10; group_b=[2,1], sum_b=3; group_c=[2,1,1,1,1,1], sum_c=7.

Check: 10 + 3 > 7, 10 + 7 > 3, 3 + 7 > 10. Yes, 13>7, 17>3, 10>10. Wait, 3 + 7 is 10, which is not greater than 10. So, it's 'NO'.

Is there a better way to distribute?

If group_a=[10], group_b=[2,1,1], sum_b=4; group_c=[2,1,1,1,1], sum_c=6.

But group_b size is 3, which is more than nb=2, invalid.

Alternatively, group_a=[10], group_b=[2,1], sum_b=3; group_c=[2,1,1,1,1,1], sum_c=7.

Same as before.

So, 'NO' is correct.

Seems like the approach is working.

I think the given code is correct based on these observations and test cases.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
