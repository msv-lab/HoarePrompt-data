Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vasya has an array `a` and he wants to add a permutation `p` to it, where `p` is a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n. After adding the permutation to the array, he wants to find out the maximum number of elements that become equal to the same number.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just a sequence containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

So, for a given array `a`, I need to choose a permutation `p` such that when I add p_i to a_i for each i, the resulting array has the maximum number of elements that are equal to some value. I need to find out what that maximum number is.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I can choose any permutation `p`, I have flexibility in how much I add to each element of `a`. The goal is to make as many elements as possible equal to the same value.

One idea is to sort the array `a` and then try to make the elements equal to some target value by choosing appropriate p_i's. But I need to ensure that each p_i is a unique number from 1 to n, since it's a permutation.

Let's consider that each a_i is increased by some p_i, and I want as many a_i + p_i as possible to be equal to some value, say `target`. So, for each a_i, I need to choose p_i such that a_i + p_i = target, which means p_i = target - a_i.

But p_i has to be a unique integer between 1 and n. So, for each a_i, the p_i = target - a_i must be an integer between 1 and n, and all p_i's must be distinct.

This seems tricky because I need to choose a `target` such that as many p_i = target - a_i as possible are distinct integers between 1 and n.

Alternatively, I can look at it differently. Since p is a permutation of 1 to n, the set of p_i's is exactly {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, just in some order.

So, if I fix a target, then p_i = target - a_i, and these p_i's must be a permutation of 1 to n.

But this seems too restrictive, because for a fixed target, not all a_i's can have p_i = target - a_i being distinct integers between 1 and n, unless the a_i's are specifically arranged.

Maybe instead of fixing the target, I can think in terms of the differences between the elements of a and the permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I should consider sorting the array a and then pairing the smallest a_i with the smallest p_i, and so on.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps in maximizing the number of equal elements after addition.

Let me try to think about the possible values of a_i + p_i. Since p_i ranges from 1 to n, a_i + p_i ranges from a_i + 1 to a_i + n.

Different a_i's have different ranges for a_i + p_i.

I need to find a value that lies in as many of these ranges as possible.

In other words, I need to find a value `x` such that x is in the range [a_i + 1, a_i + n] for as many i as possible.

This sounds like finding the value `x` that is covered by the maximum number of intervals, where each interval is [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

This is a classic problem in interval scheduling, and it can be solved by sorting the start and end points of the intervals and then iterating through them.

So, let's think about it step by step.

First, for each a_i, the possible values after adding p_i are a_i + 1, a_i + 2, ..., a_i + n.

So, for each a_i, there is an interval of possible sums: [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

I need to find a value `x` that lies in as many of these intervals as possible.

To find the maximum number of overlapping intervals, I can collect all the start points (a_i + 1) and end points (a_i + n + 1, since the interval ends at a_i + n), and then use a sweep line approach.

Here's how it works:

- Create a list of events: for each a_i, add an event at a_i + 1 (start of interval) and at a_i + n + 1 (end of interval).

- Sort all these events.

- Iterate through the sorted events, keeping track of the current number of active intervals.

- Keep track of the maximum number of active intervals at any point.

This will give me the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any single point, which corresponds to the maximum number of elements that can be made equal to the same value after adding the permutation.

Wait, but in this case, there's a constraint that the p_i's must be a permutation, meaning they are all distinct and cover 1 to n.

Does the sweep line approach account for that?

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each p_i is unique and between 1 and n.

So, for each a_i, p_i is assigned a unique number from 1 to n.

I need to assign p_i's such that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

But since p_i's are distinct, a_i + p_i being equal would require that different a_i's plus different p_i's equal the same value.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can look at the differences between the a_i's and the target.

Let me try to think in terms of the target value.

Suppose I choose a target value t.

Then, for each a_i, I need p_i = t - a_i.

But p_i must be unique and from 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the number of a_i's for which t - a_i is between 1 and n, and all t - a_i are distinct, is the number of a_i's that can reach t.

So, for each t, I can count how many a_i's satisfy 1 <= t - a_i <= n, and that all t - a_i are distinct.

But checking distinctness for each t seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider sorting the array a.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order: a[1] <= a[2] <= ... <= a[n].

Now, I need to assign p_i's such that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

Since p_i's are a permutation of 1 to n, let's consider assigning the smallest p_i to the smallest a_i to make their sums as equal as possible.

Wait, but that might not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that minimizes the variation in a_i + p_i.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the difference between a_i and p_i.

If I want a_i + p_i to be equal for as many i as possible, then I need a_i + p_i = t for as many i as possible.

So, p_i = t - a_i.

Since p_i must be unique and from 1 to n, t - a_i must be unique and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the number of a_i's for which t - a_i is unique and within 1 to n is the number of a_i's that can reach t.

To maximize this, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_i are unique and within 1 to n.

But iterating over all possible t seems inefficient.

Is there a better way?

Wait, maybe I can look at the frequency of t - a_i.

But t can be any integer, since a_i can be up to 1e9.

This seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the a_i's in ascending order and sort the p_i's in ascending order, which would be 1, 2, 3, ..., n.

Then, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 2, ..., a[n] + n.

Alternatively, I could sort p_i's in descending order: n, n-1, ..., 1.

Then, a[1] + n, a[2] + n-1, ..., a[n] + 1.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the differences between a_i and p_i.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me try to think about the problem again.

I need to maximize the number of elements in a that, after adding a unique p_i from 1 to n, are equal to some value t.

So, for as many a_i as possible, a_i + p_i = t, which implies p_i = t - a_i.

Given that p_i must be unique and from 1 to n, t - a_i must be unique and within 1 to n.

So, for a fixed t, the number of a_i's for which t - a_i is unique and within 1 to n is the number of a_i's that can reach t.

But t can be any integer, so I need to find the t that maximizes this count.

This seems similar to finding the mode in a histogram where the bins are the possible t values.

But with n up to 2e5, iterating over all possible t is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible t.

The minimal t would be a_i + 1 for the smallest a_i.

The maximal t would be a_i + n for the largest a_i.

So, t can range from min(a) + 1 to max(a) + n.

Within this range, I need to find the t that allows the most a_i's to have t - a_i within 1 to n, with all t - a_i being unique.

This still seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem from the perspective of matching a_i's to p_i's.

I need to pair each a_i with a unique p_i such that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to some common value t.

This sounds like trying to minimize the spread of a_i + p_i.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign the p_i's in a way that minimizes the variance of a_i + p_i.

But I need to maximize the number of elements that are exactly equal to t, not just minimize the spread.

I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think about a small example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Possible permutations p: [1,2] and [2,1]

Option 1: p = [1,2]

a becomes [1+1=2, 2+2=4]

Maximum frequency of any number: 1 (numbers 2 and 4 appear once each)

Option 2: p = [2,1]

a becomes [1+2=3, 2+1=3]

Maximum frequency: 2 (number 3 appears twice)

So, the answer is 2.

In this case, choosing p such that a_i + p_i are equal for both elements.

Another test case:

n = 4

a = [7,1,4,1]

Possible p: any permutation of [1,2,3,4]

One optimal p is [2,3,1,4]

a becomes [7+2=9, 1+3=4, 4+1=5, 1+4=5]

Numbers: 9,4,5,5

Maximum frequency: 2 (number 5 appears twice)

Another possible p: [1,4,2,3]

a becomes [7+1=8, 1+4=5, 4+2=6, 1+3=4]

Numbers: 8,5,6,4

All unique, frequency 1

So, choosing p wisely can increase the frequency.

From these examples, it seems that by carefully choosing p, I can make some a_i + p_i equal.

But how to maximize this in general?

Let me consider sorting the array a.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order: a[1] <= a[2] <= ... <= a[n]

And assign p_i's in some order.

If I assign p_i's in ascending order, i.e., p[1]=1, p[2]=2, ..., p[n]=n

Then a[1]+1, a[2]+2, ..., a[n]+n

Or assign p_i's in descending order: p[1]=n, p[2]=n-1, ..., p[n]=1

Then a[1]+n, a[2]+n-1, ..., a[n]+1

In the first test case, with a=[1,2], assigning p=[2,1] gives a[1]+2=3 and a[2]+1=3, which matches.

In the second test case, a=[1,1,4,7], assigning p=[2,3,1,4] gives [3,4,5,11], which has two 5's.

Wait, but in the second test case, the output is 2, meaning the best we can do is make two elements equal.

Is there a way to make three elements equal?

Let's see:

a = [1,1,4,7], n=4

Possible p permutations: any of the 24 permutations of [1,2,3,4]

Let's try to make three elements equal.

Suppose I choose p such that three a_i + p_i are equal to some t.

Then, p_i = t - a_i, and these p_i's must be distinct and within 1 to 4.

So, for three a_i's, t - a_i must be distinct and within 1 to 4.

Let's see:

a = [1,1,4,7]

Suppose I choose t=5.

Then p_i's would be:

For a=1: p=5-1=4

For a=1: p=5-1=4 (but p must be unique, so this doesn't work)

For a=4: p=5-4=1

For a=7: p=5-7=-2 (invalid, as p must be >=1)

So, t=5 doesn't work.

Another t, say t=6.

p_i's:

a=1: p=5

But p must be between 1 and 4, so invalid.

t=4.

p_i's:

a=1: p=3

a=1: p=3 (duplicate, invalid)

a=4: p=0 (invalid)

a=7: p=-3 (invalid)

t=3.

p_i's:

a=1: p=2

a=1: p=2 (duplicate, invalid)

a=4: p=-1 (invalid)

a=7: p=-4 (invalid)

t=7.

p_i's:

a=1: p=6 (invalid)

a=1: p=6 (invalid)

a=4: p=3

a=7: p=0 (invalid)

So, no way to make three elements equal.

Hence, the maximum is indeed 2.

From this, I can see that for the second test case, making three elements equal is impossible due to constraints on p_i's.

So, back to the general problem.

I need to find the maximum number of a_i's for which a_i + p_i = t, with p_i's being a permutation of 1 to n.

This means that for those a_i's, p_i = t - a_i, and all these p_i's must be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the number of a_i's where t - a_i is unique and within 1 to n is the number of a_i's that can reach t.

To maximize this, I need to find the t that allows the most a_i's to reach it with unique p_i's.

But iterating over all possible t is not feasible because a_i can be up to 1e9.

I need a smarter way.

An optimization: since p_i's are from 1 to n, for each a_i, the possible t is from a_i + 1 to a_i + n.

So, t can range from min(a_i) + 1 to max(a_i) + n.

Within this range, I need to find the t that is covered by the maximum number of intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

This is exactly the problem of finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

To solve this efficiently, I can use a sweep line algorithm.

Here's how it works:

- Collect all the start points (a_i + 1) and end points (a_i + n + 1) for each a_i.

- For each a_i, create two events: (a_i + 1, 'start') and (a_i + n + 1, 'end').

- Sort all these events by their time.

- Iterate through the sorted events, keeping a counter of active intervals.

- When encountering a 'start' event, increment the counter.

- When encountering an 'end' event, decrement the counter.

- Keep track of the maximum counter value during this process.

This maximum counter value will be the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point, which corresponds to the maximum number of a_i's that can have a_i + p_i equal to that t.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the p_i's are unique for the a_i's that reach t.

In the sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals gives the maximum number of a_i's that can reach the same t with unique p_i's, because each a_i contributes a distinct p_i within its interval.

Is that correct?

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me think carefully.

If I have multiple a_i's with the same value, their intervals would overlap completely, but their p_i's must still be unique.

However, since p_i's must be unique, even if multiple a_i's have the same value, they need different p_i's to reach the same t.

But in the sweep line approach, overlapping intervals just indicate that t is within a_i + 1 to a_i + n for those a_i's.

But it doesn't guarantee that the p_i's are unique for each a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me consider that for each a_i, p_i can be any unique number from 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the p_i's required are t - a_i, and they must all be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, I need to select a subset of a_i's such that t - a_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

This sounds like selecting a subset of a_i's where t - a_i are unique and within bounds.

This is equivalent to selecting a subset of a_i's where a_i + p_i = t, and p_i's are unique.

To maximize the size of this subset, I need to maximize the number of a_i's for which t - a_i are unique and within 1 to n.

But since t can be any integer, I need to find the t that allows the most such a_i's.

This seems similar to finding the t that minimizes the number of collisions in t - a_i.

But again, iterating over all possible t is not feasible.

An optimization: since p_i's are from 1 to n, and t - a_i must be unique and within 1 to n, I can think of t - a_i as a mapping from a_i to p_i.

So, for each a_i, p_i = t - a_i, and p_i must be unique.

This is equivalent to assigning p_i's such that t - a_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

But I need to maximize the number of a_i's that can satisfy this for a given t.

An alternative approach: sort the a_i's and try to assign p_i's in a way that maximizes the number of a_i + p_i that are equal.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that minimizes the differences.

Let me try to sort the a_i's and consider assigning p_i's in a specific order.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order and assign p in ascending order.

Then a[1] + p[1], a[2] + p[2], ..., a[n] + p[n], where p is sorted ascendingly as [1,2,3,...,n].

Then, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 2, ..., a[n] + n.

Alternatively, sort a descendingly and assign p ascendingly.

But I need to make as many a_i + p_i equal as possible.

Wait, maybe I can sort a and p in opposite orders and see if that helps.

For example, sort a in ascending order and p in descending order: p = [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then a[1] + n, a[2] + (n-1), ..., a[n] + 1.

This might help in making the sums more similar if a is sorted in ascending order and p in descending order.

This is similar to the rearrangement inequality, which states that the sum of a_i * b_i is maximized when both sequences are ordered in the same order and minimized when ordered in opposite orders.

But in this problem, I'm not summing a_i * p_i, but a_i + p_i.

Wait, a_i + p_i is just a linear function, so maybe similar principles apply.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the difference between the maximum and minimum a_i + p_i.

If I sort a in ascending order and p in descending order, then a[1] + p[1] = a[1] + n, a[2] + p[2] = a[2] + (n-1), ..., a[n] + p[n] = a[n] + 1.

In this case, the differences between a_i + p_i might be minimized compared to other assignments.

But I need to maximize the number of equal a_i + p_i.

Perhaps I need to find a way to minimize the variance of a_i + p_i.

But I'm not sure how to do that directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix t and try to find how many a_i's can have a_i + p_i = t.

This requires p_i = t - a_i, and p_i must be unique and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the number of a_i's where t - a_i is within 1 to n, and all t - a_i are distinct.

To maximize this, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_i as possible are unique and within 1 to n.

But with a_i's possibly repeating, I need to handle duplicates carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and then try to assign p_i's in a way that t - a_i are unique and within bounds.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me think about the sweep line approach again.

If I use the sweep line to find the t with the maximum number of overlapping intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n], that should give me the t that can be reached by the most a_i's with p_i's being unique.

Because each a_i contributes an interval [a_i + 1, a_i + n], and the overlapping count tells me how many a_i's can reach that t with unique p_i's.

Wait, why does overlapping count ensure uniqueness of p_i's?

Actually, it doesn't directly ensure uniqueness, because multiple a_i's can have the same p_i = t - a_i.

To ensure uniqueness, I need to make sure that for the a_i's that reach t, their p_i's are distinct.

So, perhaps the sweep line approach overcounts in some cases.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust it.

Let me consider that for each a_i, the possible p_i's are from 1 to n, and p_i = t - a_i.

So, for each a_i, t - a_i must be within 1 to n, and all t - a_i must be distinct.

This sounds like assigning distinct p_i's to a_i's such that a_i + p_i = t.

But I need to maximize the number of such assignments.

This seems similar to matching in graph theory, where a_i's are on one side and p_i's on the other, and edges exist when a_i + p_i = t.

But with n up to 2e5, building a graph is not feasible.

I need a better way.

An alternative idea: sort the a_i's and try to assign p_i's in a way that minimizes the differences in a_i + p_i.

For example, sort a in ascending order and p in descending order, as I thought earlier.

Then, a[1] + n, a[2] + (n-1), ..., a[n] + 1.

This way, the sums are as close as possible.

Then, count the frequency of the resulting sums and find the maximum frequency.

But this might not always give the optimal answer.

Let me check with the first test case.

n=2, a=[1,2]

Sort a: [1,2]

Assign p descending: [2,1]

Then, 1+2=3, 2+1=3

Frequency: 2

Which is the correct answer.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[7,1,4,1]

Sort a: [1,1,4,7]

Assign p descending: [4,3,2,1]

Then, 1+4=5, 1+3=4, 4+2=6, 7+1=8

Frequency: all unique, frequency=1

But in the example, with p=[2,3,1,4], we get frequencies with two 5's.

So, in this case, assigning p descending doesn't give the optimal answer.

So, perhaps sorting a in ascending order and p in descending order doesn't always give the optimal answer.

Is there a better way to assign p_i's to maximize the frequency?

Wait, perhaps I should sort a and assign p_i's in a way that makes a_i + p_i as close as possible to a certain target.

But I still need to choose the target wisely.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look back at the sweep line approach.

In the sweep line approach, by finding the t with the maximum number of overlapping intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n], I can find the t that can be reached by the most a_i's with unique p_i's.

To implement this, I can collect all the start points (a_i + 1) and end points (a_i + n + 1), sort them, and keep a counter of active intervals.

The maximum counter value will be the answer.

Wait, but does this ensure that the p_i's are unique?

In other words, if t is in the interval [a_i + 1, a_i + n] for multiple a_i's, does that guarantee that t - a_i are unique for those a_i's?

No, it doesn't necessarily guarantee uniqueness.

For example, consider a=[1,1], n=2.

Intervals:

For a=1: [2,3]

For a=1: [2,3]

t=2: p_i=1 for both a_i=1, but p_i must be unique.

So, even though t=2 is in both intervals, p_i=1 is repeated, which is invalid.

So, the sweep line approach overcounts in this case.

Hence, I need to adjust my approach.

An alternative idea: sort the a_i's and try to assign p_i's in a way that minimizes the differences in a_i + p_i, ensuring that p_i's are unique.

This sounds similar to assigning p_i's to a_i's to minimize the variance of a_i + p_i.

But I need to maximize the frequency of the most common sum.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that as many a_i + p_i as possible are equal to the same t.

To do this, I can sort the a_i's and try to find a t that minimizes the number of unique p_i's required.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me consider that for the a_i's to have a_i + p_i = t, p_i = t - a_i.

To have p_i's unique, t - a_i must be unique, meaning that for the a_i's chosen, t - a_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a given set of a_i's, t must be such that t - a_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

To maximize the size of this set, I need to select a subset of a_i's where t - a_i are all distinct and within bounds.

This is equivalent to selecting a subset of a_i's where t - a_i are unique and within 1 to n.

Given that t can be any integer, I need to find the t that allows the largest such subset.

To optimize this, I can iterate over t in the range [min(a_i) + 1, max(a_i) + n], and for each t, count how many a_i's satisfy 1 <= t - a_i <= n.

But since n can be up to 2e5, and t can range up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

An optimization: since t can range from min(a) + 1 to max(a) + n, which can still be large, but the number of a_i's is up to 2e5, perhaps I can iterate over a_i's and see for each a_i, the possible t's that can be reached.

But that seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and then use a sliding window approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t and try to find how many a_i's satisfy 1 <= t - a_i <= n, and t - a_i are unique.

But ensuring uniqueness is tricky.

An alternative idea: since p_i's must be unique, I can think of assigning p_i's to a_i's in a way that maximizes the number of a_i + p_i that are equal.

This sounds like trying to maximize the frequency of a particular sum.

To do this efficiently, I can sort the a_i's and try to assign p_i's in a specific order to make as many sums equal as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that minimizes the differences in a_i + p_i.

For example, sort a in ascending order and p in descending order, as I thought earlier.

Then, a[1] + p[1], a[2] + p[2], ..., a[n] + p[n], where p is sorted descendingly.

This might minimize the spread of the sums.

But in the second test case, it didn't give the optimal answer.

So, maybe this isn't the best approach.

Let me consider another strategy.

Suppose I sort the a_i's in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, the smallest possible p_i is 1, and the largest is n.

So, the smallest possible a_i + p_i is a_i + 1, and the largest is a_i + n.

I need to choose p_i's such that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

An idea: choose p_i's such that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to the average of all a_i's plus the average of p_i's.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the median of the a_i's.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix t and try to see how many a_i's can have a_i + p_i = t.

This requires p_i = t - a_i, and p_i must be unique and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, I can collect all a_i's where t - a_i is between 1 and n, and then see how many unique p_i's can be assigned.

But checking for each t is too slow.

An optimization: since t can range from min(a) + 1 to max(a) + n, I can iterate over t in that range and keep track of the p_i's that are used.

But with n up to 2e5, this might still be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each a_i, t can be from a_i + 1 to a_i + n.

So, for each a_i, there is a range of possible t's.

The problem reduces to finding the t that is in the maximum number of these ranges, with the condition that for each a_i, t - a_i is unique.

But ensuring uniqueness is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can ignore the uniqueness for now and just find the t that is in the maximum number of ranges, and then check if uniqueness can be satisfied.

In the sweep line approach, I can find the t that is in the most number of ranges.

Then, for that t, I can check if t - a_i are unique for the a_i's that cover t.

If they are unique, then that's the answer.

If not, I need to find the next best t.

But with n up to 2e5, iterating over possible t's is still too slow.

I need a smarter way.

An alternative idea: sort the a_i's and then try to assign p_i's in a way that as many a_i + p_i as possible are equal to the same t.

To do this, I can sort the a_i's and try to find the t that minimizes the number of unique p_i's required.

Wait, perhaps I can find the t that is the median of the possible sums.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for the a_i's sorted, I can assign p_i's in a way that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to a certain t.

But I need to maximize the frequency of a particular t.

Wait, perhaps I can group the a_i's into groups where a_i + p_i can be equal to the same t.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to maximize the number of a_i's for which a_i + p_i = t, with p_i's being unique and from 1 to n.

This is equivalent to selecting a subset of a_i's where t - a_i are unique and within 1 to n, and maximizing the size of this subset.

To maximize this subset, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_i as possible are distinct and within bounds.

But with a_i's possibly repeating, I need to handle duplicates carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can group the a_i's by their value and then assign p_i's accordingly.

For example, for duplicate a_i's, t - a_i must be unique for each a_i.

So, for duplicate a_i's, I need different p_i's for them.

Hence, for k duplicate a_i's, I need k distinct p_i's assigned to them.

So, the maximum number of duplicate a_i's is limited by the number of unique p_i's available.

But I need to maximize the total number of a_i's that can have a_i + p_i = t for some t.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the a_i's in ascending order.

Then, assign p_i's in a way that a_i + p_i are as close as possible.

One way to do this is to assign the smallest p_i to the largest a_i, so that a_large + 1 is close to a_small + n.

Wait, perhaps assigning p_i's in descending order as I thought earlier.

But in the second test case, it didn't give the optimal answer.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign p_i's based on the density of a_i's.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in the first test case, assigning p=[2,1] to a=[1,2] gives [3,3], which is optimal.

In the second test case, assigning p=[2,3,1,4] to a=[1,1,4,7] gives [3,4,5,11], which has two 5's.

But another assignment p=[3,2,4,1] gives [4,3,8,8], which also has two 8's.

So, it's possible to have two equal sums with different assignments.

Hence, the maximum frequency is 2.

In the third test case, a=[103,102,104], assigning p=[2,3,1] gives [105,105,105], which has frequency 3.

So, in this case, it's possible to make all three elements equal.

Wait, but in the second test case, it was not possible to make three elements equal.

What's the difference?

In the third test case, a=[103,102,104], assigning p=[2,3,1] gives [105,105,105].

Is there a pattern here?

Let me see.

a = [103,102,104]

Sort a: [102,103,104]

Assign p descending: [3,2,1]

Then, 102+3=105, 103+2=105, 104+1=105.

So, all sums are 105.

This works.

In the second test case, a=[1,1,4,7]

Sort a: [1,1,4,7]

Assign p descending: [4,3,2,1]

Then, 1+4=5, 1+3=4, 4+2=6, 7+1=8

All sums are unique.

But with p=[2,3,1,4], sums are [3,4,5,11], which have two 5's.

So, assigning p in a different order can give a better frequency.

Hence, assigning p in descending order doesn't always give the optimal answer.

So, perhaps sorting a in ascending order and p in descending order isn't the way to go.

An alternative idea: sort a in ascending order and p in ascending order.

Then, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 2, ..., a[n] + n.

In the third test case, a=[102,103,104], p=[1,2,3], sums are [103,105,107], frequencies are all 1.

Which is worse than assigning p descending.

So, assigning p descending seems better in some cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign p_i's based on the differences between a_i's.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the sweep line approach.

Even though it overcounts in some cases, perhaps it can be adjusted.

In the sweep line approach, I collect all start and end events, sort them, and find the maximum overlapping count.

In the earlier example where a=[1,1], n=2, t=2 is in both intervals, but p_i=1 for both, which is invalid.

Hence, the sweep line approach overcounts in such cases.

To fix this, perhaps I need to consider only the maximum overlapping count where the number of overlapping intervals is less than or equal to the number of unique p_i's available.

But I'm not sure.

An alternative idea: since p_i's must be unique, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that minimizes collisions in a_i + p_i.

But I need to maximize the frequency of the most common sum.

Wait, maybe I can sort the a_i's and then assign p_i's in a way that as many a_i + p_i as possible are equal to the same t.

To do this, I can sort the a_i's and then try to find t that minimizes the number of p_i's needed.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me consider that for a given t, the number of a_i's that can have a_i + p_i = t is equal to the number of a_i's where t - a_i is unique and within 1 to n.

So, for each t, I need to count the number of a_i's where t - a_i is unique and within bounds.

To maximize this count, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_i as possible are distinct and within bounds.

But with a_i's up to 1e9 and n up to 2e5, iterating over all possible t is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

An optimization: since p_i's are from 1 to n, and a_i's can be up to 1e9, but n is up to 2e5, perhaps I can iterate over the a_i's and see which t's are possible.

But I need to find a way to group the a_i's such that t - a_i are unique and within bounds.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and then try to assign p_i's in a specific order to maximize the frequency of a_i + p_i.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider that for a given t, the p_i's required are t - a_i.

So, for a set of a_i's, the p_i's needed are t - a_i for each a_i.

These p_i's must be unique and within 1 to n.

Hence, for a given t, the number of a_i's that can have a_i + p_i = t is equal to the number of a_i's where t - a_i is unique and within 1 to n.

To maximize this, I
