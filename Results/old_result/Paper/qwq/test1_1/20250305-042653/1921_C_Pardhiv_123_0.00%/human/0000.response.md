Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the beginning, at moment 0, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time that it's on. Also, he can turn the phone off and on again, but each time he does that, it costs b units of charge.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any moment.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. There are multiple test cases, up to 10,000, and for each test case, n can be up to 200,000, with the sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 200,000. The values of f, a, and b can be up to 10^9, which is a billion. The moments m_i can be up to 10^9 as well.

So, efficiency is key here because with n up to 200,000 per test case and t up to 10,000, but with the sum of n across all test cases being 200,000, it's manageable as long as the solution is O(n).

Let's think about the problem.

Stepan needs to send messages at moments m1 to mn. Between sending messages, he can choose to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again at any moment.

If he keeps the phone on between two messages, the charge will decrease by a units per unit of time. So, between m_{i-1} and m_i, the charge will decrease by a * (m_i - m_{i-1}).

Alternatively, he can turn the phone off between m_{i-1} and m_i, and then turn it on at m_i. This would cost b units of charge each time he does this.

He needs to choose, for each interval between messages, whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again, in such a way that the charge never drops to zero or below at the moment he needs to send a message.

At moment 0, the phone is on, and it starts with f units of charge.

Let's consider the charge at each message sending moment.

At moment m1, the charge would be f - a * m1 if he keeps the phone on the entire time up to m1. But he could also choose to turn the phone off at some point and turn it on again at m1.

Wait, but the problem says that turning the phone on and off is instantaneous, so he can do it at any moment, including at the same moment as sending a message.

But to simplify, perhaps it's better to consider that between each pair of consecutive messages, he has the option to either keep the phone on or turn it off and on again at the next message.

Let's think about the charge just before sending each message.

At moment 0, charge is f.

At moment m1, if he keeps the phone on, charge is f - a * m1.

If he turns the phone off at some point and turns it on at m1, charge is f - b.

He needs to have enough charge to send the message at m1, which means the charge just before sending the message should be greater than 0.

Wait, but the problem says that if the charge level drops to 0 or below, it's impossible to send the message.

So, he needs to ensure that just before sending each message, the charge is greater than 0.

After sending the message, the charge remains the same, unless he chooses to turn the phone off and on again, which would cost an additional b.

Wait, no. Turning the phone off and on again costs b each time he does it, and it's instantaneous.

Wait, actually, the problem says that turning off and on consumes b units of energy each time, and this action is instantaneous.

So, each time he turns it off and then turns it on again, it costs b units.

But he can choose when to do this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as, between each pair of consecutive messages, he can choose to either keep the phone on, in which case the charge decreases by a * (m_{i} - m_{i-1}), or turn the phone off and on again at the next message, costing b.

Then, for each interval between messages, he chooses the option that minimizes the charge consumption.

But, he also has to ensure that at the moment of sending each message, the charge is greater than 0.

Wait, but the way the problem is described, it seems that turning the phone off and on again is an action that costs b units each time, and it's instantaneous.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the charge just before sending each message.

Let's consider the charge just before sending the first message at m1.

If he keeps the phone on from moment 0 to m1, the charge will be f - a * m1.

Alternatively, if he turns the phone off at some moment and turns it on at m1, the charge will be f - b.

He needs to choose the option that results in the highest possible charge before sending the message, to ensure it's greater than 0.

Wait, but he might not have enough charge for one option, but enough for the other.

So, for each message, he needs to choose whether to keep the phone on from the previous message to this one or to turn it off and on again at this message.

He should choose the option that results in the maximum remaining charge before sending the message.

Wait, but he needs to minimize the charge consumption to ensure he can send all messages.

Actually, to maximize the remaining charge.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the messages and, for each interval between consecutive messages, subtract the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from the current charge.

Wait, that seems promising.

Let's see.

Start with charge f at moment 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

- If i > 1, decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again between m_{i-1} and m_i.

- If he keeps it on, charge decreases by a * (m_i - m_{i-1}).

- If he turns it off and on, charge decreases by b.

- He should choose the option that minimizes the charge consumption.

- So, subtract min(a * (m_i - m_{i-1}), b) from the charge.

- Then, at moment m_i, send the message, which doesn't consume any charge, but he needs to have positive charge before sending it.

Wait, but the problem says that if the charge drops to 0 or below, he cannot send the message.

So, after subtracting the charge for keeping the phone on or turning it off and on, the charge should be greater than 0.

Therefore, after each such subtraction, check if the charge is greater than 0.

If at any point the charge is less than or equal to 0, then it's impossible to send all messages.

Otherwise, if after processing all messages the charge is still positive, then it's possible.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to just subtract min(a * (m_i - m_{i-1}), b) for each i from 1 to n, and then check if the final charge is greater than 0.

Is this correct?

Wait, let's see.

In the code:

for i in range(1, len(ls)):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

Then, if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

But, according to the reasoning above, this seems almost correct, but there's a subtle issue.

The issue is that the charge should be greater than 0 just before sending each message.

So, after subtracting the charge for each interval, the charge should be greater than 0 before sending the message.

Therefore, the check should be that after each subtraction, f > 0.

But in the code, it subtracts for all intervals first and then checks if f > 0 at the end.

This might not be sufficient because it's possible that after some intermediate subtraction, f becomes <= 0, but then later subtractions are smaller, making f positive again at the end.

But, if at any intermediate step f <= 0, it's already invalid, because he can't send the message at that point.

So, the correct approach should be to iterate through the messages from the first to the last, and for each interval between consecutive messages, subtract the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from the current charge, and after each subtraction, check if f > 0.

If at any point f <= 0, then output 'NO' immediately.

If after all subtractions f > 0, then output 'YES'.

But in the provided code, it only checks f at the end, after all subtractions.

This might not be sufficient, as explained.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example test cases, it seems to produce the correct output.

Let's look at the first test case:

1 3 1 5

3

According to the explanation, it should output 'NO'.

In the code:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

ls=[3]

for i in range(1,1): # no loop, since len(ls)=1

So, f remains 3, which is >0, so it would print 'YES', but according to the problem, it should be 'NO'.

Ah, wait, perhaps the loop should start from i=1 to n-1, but in the code, it's range(1, len(ls)), which is i from 1 to n-1.

But n=1, so no loop, f remains 3, which is >0, so 'YES', but should be 'NO'.

Wait, perhaps the loop should be from i=1 to n, but in the code, it's from i=1 to len(ls)-1, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in Python, range(1, len(ls)) is from i=1 to i=len(ls)-1.

But in this case, n=1, len(ls)=1, so no loop, f remains 3, 'YES', but should be 'NO'.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, it should be 'NO', but the code would output 'YES', which is wrong.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that in the first test case, if he keeps the phone on until m=3, the charge would be 3 - 1*3 = 0, which is <=0, so cannot send the message.

Alternatively, if he turns the phone off and on at m=3, charge would be 3 - 5 = -2, which is also <=0.

Therefore, it's impossible, should be 'NO'.

But the code, as written, would not check the charge after each interval, but only at the end, which is insufficient.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

What is the correct approach?

We need to ensure that after each subtraction (for each interval), the charge is still greater than 0.

So, we should iterate through the messages from the first to the last, and for each interval between consecutive messages, subtract the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from the current charge, and after each subtraction, check if f > 0.

If at any point f <= 0, output 'NO' immediately.

If after all subtractions f > 0, output 'YES'.

Therefore, the provided code is missing the check after each subtraction.

It only checks the final f, which is not sufficient.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example test cases, it seems to produce the correct output, but in reality, it's coincidental.

In the first test case, n=1, m=[3], so no loop, f=3 >0, 'YES', but should be 'NO'.

Wait, perhaps the loop should start from i=1 to n, but in Python, range(1, len(ls)) is i from 1 to len(ls)-1, which for n=1 is no loop.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
