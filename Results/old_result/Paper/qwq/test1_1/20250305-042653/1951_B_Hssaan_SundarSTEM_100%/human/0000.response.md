Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here.

We have n cows, each with a unique rating, and they're participating in a coding tournament. The tournament is structured in a specific way: it starts with a match between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the cow in the next position and the winner of the previous match. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow in the lineup, or I can choose not to do anything.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve, given that I can perform at most one swap.

First, I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins my cow gets without any swaps. Then, I need to consider the effect of swapping my cow with another cow to see if that increases the number of wins.

Let's think about the tournament structure. It's like a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the next cow in line and the current winner.

In the initial setup, the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner then faces cow 3, and so on, until all cows have participated.

If I don't swap, I can just simulate this process and count how many times my cow wins.

But I have the option to swap my cow with another cow in the lineup. This could potentially change the sequence of matches and give my cow more opportunities to win.

I need to find the best position to place my cow to maximize its wins.

Wait, but swapping my cow with another cow means I'm changing my cow's position in the lineup, and consequently, changing the position of the other cow as well.

I need to consider the impact of this swap on the tournament's progression.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote the initial positions of the cows as pos_1, pos_2, ..., pos_n.

My cow is at position k.

I can choose to swap pos_k with pos_i for any i between 1 and n, inclusive.

After the swap, the new positions are pos'_1, pos'_2, ..., pos'_n.

Then, the tournament proceeds as before: match between pos'_1 and pos'_2, then the winner faces pos'_3, and so on.

I need to count how many times my cow wins in this new setup and find the maximum over all possible swaps (including choosing not to swap).

Now, to make this efficient, considering that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Brute-force simulation for each test case won't work due to time constraints.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament proceeds in a way similar to a linked list: each new match is between the next cow in line and the current winner.

The key is that my cow can keep winning as long as it keeps facing cows with lower ratings.

So, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that it can face in sequence.

But because the tournament is structured in a specific order, I need to consider the sequence in which cows are matched.

If I place my cow in a certain position, I need to see how many cows with lower ratings are after it in the lineup, and that it can defeat in sequence.

Wait, but it's not exactly that, because the matches are not just against the immediate next cow, but against the winner of the previous match.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to simulate the tournament step-by-step for a small example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=6, k=1

ratings: 12,10,14,11,8,3

Initially, cow 1 (rating 12) vs cow 2 (rating 10). Cow 1 wins.

Then, cow 1 (rating 12) vs cow 3 (rating 14). Cow 3 wins.

Then, cow 3 (rating 14) vs cow 4 (rating 11). Cow 3 wins.

Then, cow 3 (rating 14) vs cow 5 (rating 8). Cow 3 wins.

Then, cow 3 (rating 14) vs cow 6 (rating 3). Cow 3 wins.

So, cow 1 wins only once.

But if we swap cow 1 and cow 3:

ratings: 14,10,12,11,8,3

First match: cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

Then, cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 1 wins.

Then, cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 1 wins.

Then, cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 1 wins.

Then, cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 1 wins.

So, cow 1 wins 5 times.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow 1 wins once.

But in this swap, cow 1 wins 5 times.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, no. The problem says that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow 1 wins once.

But in the swap I just did, cow 1 wins 5 times.

But according to the problem, it's not optimal to swap cow 1 and cow 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Looking back at the problem, in the first test case, it says:

"it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

* Initially, a' = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3].

* Your cow plays against the cow in position 2 (rating 10) and wins. a' = [12, 14, 11, 8, 3].

* Your cow plays against the cow in position 3 (rating 14) and loses.

So, in total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it's optimal to swap your cow to position 3.

Wait, in the first test case, swapping cow 1 and cow 3 leads to cow 1 winning 5 times, but the problem says that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow 1 wins once.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, no, the problem says that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow 1 wins once.

But if I swap cow 1 and cow 3, cow 1 wins 5 times.

But according to the problem, the maximum number of wins is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tournament structure.

Wait, let's read the problem again.

"The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2.

Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1.

In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match."

So, in the first match, position 1 vs position 2.

Then, the winner vs position 3.

Then, the winner vs position 4, and so on.

So, in the first test case, without swapping:

Match 1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10). Pos1 wins.

Match 2: pos1 (12) vs pos3 (14). Pos3 wins.

Match 3: pos3 (14) vs pos4 (11). Pos3 wins.

Match 4: pos3 (14) vs pos5 (8). Pos3 wins.

Match 5: pos3 (14) vs pos6 (3). Pos3 wins.

So, cow 1 wins only once.

If I swap cow1 and cow3:

New lineup: [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Match 1: pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10). Pos1 wins.

Match 2: pos1 (14) vs pos3 (12). Pos1 wins.

Match 3: pos1 (14) vs pos4 (11). Pos1 wins.

Match 4: pos1 (14) vs pos5 (8). Pos1 wins.

Match 5: pos1 (14) vs pos6 (3). Pos1 wins.

So, cow1 wins 5 times.

But according to the problem, in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow1 wins once.

But in this swap, cow1 wins 5 times, which is better.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which cow is mine.

Wait, in the first test case, n=6, k=1.

So, my cow is cow1.

So, in the swap, I can swap cow1 with any other cow, including itself (i.e., do nothing).

So, in the first test case, the problem says it's optimal to do nothing and cow1 wins once.

But in the swap I did, swapping cow1 and cow3, cow1 wins 5 times.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after swapping, my cow is now in position 3, and I need to track cow k, not necessarily position 1.

Wait, no, in the swap, I swap the positions of my cow and another cow.

So, if I swap cow1 and cow3, my cow, which is now in position 3, starts with rating 12.

Then, the tournament proceeds:

Match1: pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10). Pos1 wins.

Match2: pos1 (14) vs pos3 (12). Pos1 wins.

Match3: pos1 (14) vs pos4 (11). Pos1 wins.

Match4: pos1 (14) vs pos5 (8). Pos1 wins.

Match5: pos1 (14) vs pos6 (3). Pos1 wins.

So, my cow, now in position 3, with rating 12, never gets to play because pos1 (rating 14) keeps winning all matches.

So, my cow doesn't win any matches in this swap.

Wait, perhaps I need to correctly identify which cow is mine after the swap.

Wait, in the swap, I swap the positions of my cow and another cow.

So, if I swap cow1 and cow3, my cow, which was cow1, is now in position 3 with rating 12.

The tournament proceeds as above, and my cow never gets to play because pos1 keeps winning.

Hence, my cow wins 0 matches in this swap.

So, perhaps the initial thought was incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing and cow1 wins once.

If I swap cow1 and cow3, cow1 wins 0 matches.

So, indeed, doing nothing is better.

Wait, but in the problem's explanation, they do nothing and cow1 wins once.

If I swap cow1 and cow3, cow1 wins 0 matches.

Hence, the maximum is 1.

Okay, I see my mistake now.

So, in the swap, I have to correctly identify which cow is mine after the swap.

In the swap, my cow moves to the new position, and I need to track it there.

Hence, in the swap, my cow might not get to play as many matches as I thought.

I need a better approach to calculate the number of wins for my cow in both scenarios: doing nothing and swapping with another cow.

Let me think differently.

First, consider not swapping.

Simulate the tournament and count how many times my cow wins.

Then, consider swapping my cow with another cow.

After the swap, simulate the tournament again and count how many times my cow wins.

Choose the maximum over all possible swaps, including doing nothing.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I need a way to compute the number of wins for my cow in both scenarios without simulating the entire tournament each time.

Let me think about the tournament process.

The tournament is essentially a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

The current winner starts as the winner of the first match.

Each match is deterministic based on the ratings: the higher-rated cow wins.

I need to find a way to determine how many cows my cow can defeat in sequence, considering its position in the lineup.

If I place my cow in a certain position, I need to see how many cows after it have lower ratings, and that it can defeat in sequence, without encountering a cow that has a higher rating than it.

Wait, but it's not just about the cows after it, because the matches are against the winner of the previous match.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the initial setup and the effect of swapping.

Let me consider two scenarios:

1. Not swapping: simulate the tournament and count my cow's wins.

2. Swapping my cow with another cow: simulate the tournament again and count my cow's wins in its new position.

I need to find an efficient way to compute these.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

First, consider not swapping.

In the initial setup, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match1: pos1 vs pos2. Winner proceeds.

- Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3.

- Match3: winner of match2 vs pos4.

- And so on, until all cows have participated.

My cow is at position k.

I need to see how many matches it can win in this sequence.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with another cow at position p, then my cow is now at position p, and the tournament proceeds accordingly.

I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow in any possible position.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to find a way to compute the number of wins for my cow in its initial position without swapping.

In the initial setup, my cow is at position k.

I need to see when it gets to play and how many it can win.

But the tournament progresses from position 1 onwards, so my cow has to reach the point where it faces the winner up to position k-1.

So, in the initial setup, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match1: pos1 vs pos2. Winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3. Winner is the one with higher rating.

- ...

- Match k-1: winner of match k-2 vs posk. Winner is the one with higher rating.

- ...

- Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs posn. Winner is the one with higher rating.

So, my cow, at position k, plays in match k-1 against the winner of the previous matches.

If my cow wins that match, it proceeds to play against pos(k+1), and so on.

But actually, after winning match k-1, my cow becomes the new winner and proceeds to face the next cows.

So, to compute how many wins my cow can achieve without swapping, I need to:

- Find the winner up to match k-2.

- See if my cow (posk) can defeat that winner.

- If yes, it wins match k-1 and then faces pos(k+1), and so on.

- Count how many such wins it can achieve.

This seems a bit involved.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with another cow at position p, then my cow is now at position p, and the tournament proceeds accordingly.

I need to compute the same for this new position.

This seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the tournament is essentially a process where the current winner faces the next cow in line, and the higher-rated cow wins.

So, the tournament can be seen as the highest-rated cow among the first i cows wins the first i matches.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that the winner of the first m matches is the highest-rated cow among the first m cows.

So, for example, the winner of match1 is the higher of pos1 and pos2.

The winner of match2 is the higher of that winner and pos3, which is the highest among pos1, pos2, pos3.

And so on.

So, the winner of the first m matches is the maximum rating among the first m cows.

Now, if my cow is at position k, and the winner up to match k-1 is lower than my cow's rating, then my cow wins match k-1.

Then, it becomes the new winner and faces pos(k+1), and so on.

So, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than my cow, provided that the winner up to match k-1 is lower than my cow's rating.

Wait, but I need to consider that the winner up to match k-1 is the maximum of the first k-1 cows.

So, for my cow to win match k-1, its rating must be higher than the maximum of the first k-1 cows.

If it is, then it wins match k-1 and becomes the new winner, facing pos(k+1).

Then, it can keep winning as long as its rating is higher than the ratings of the subsequent cows.

So, the number of wins is:

- If a_k > max(a1 to a_{k-1}), then the number of cows after k with ratings lower than a_k.

- Else, 0.

Because if a_k is not higher than the maximum of the first k-1 cows, it loses match k-1 and doesn't get to play further.

Wait, but in the example, n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3].

max(a1 to a0) is undefined, but since k=1, pos1 plays pos2.

a1=12 > a2=10, so wins once, then faces a3=14, loses.

So, wins once.

According to my formula, a1 > max(a1 to a0) is trivially true (since there are no previous cows), so it can win against all subsequent cows with lower ratings.

But in reality, it only wins once because it loses to a3=14.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think again.

If my cow is at position k, the winner up to match k-1 is the maximum of the first k-1 cows.

If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, it wins match k-1 and becomes the new winner.

Then, it can keep winning against all subsequent cows until it encounters one with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is:

- If a_k > max(a1 to a_{k-1}), then 1 (for winning match k-1) plus the number of subsequent cows (from k+1 to n) with ratings lower than a_k, until the first cow with rating higher than a_k.

- Else, 0.

In the first example:

k=1, a1=12, max(a1 to a0)=0 (or undefined, but since there are no previous cows, we can consider it as a1 is automatically higher).

So, it can win against all subsequent cows with lower ratings.

But in reality, it only wins once because it loses to a3=14.

Wait, but according to the tournament structure, after winning match1 (a1 vs a2), it faces a3.

If a1 > a3, it wins, else it loses.

In this case, a1=12 < a3=14, so it loses.

Hence, it wins only once.

So, the number of wins is 1.

According to my formula, it should be 1 + number of subsequent cows with lower ratings before encountering a higher one.

Here, after k=1, the subsequent cows are 2,3,4,5,6.

But since it loses to a3, it doesn't get to face a4, a5, a6.

Hence, wins only once.

So, my formula seems correct.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

My cow is at position 5, a5=12.

max(a1 to a4)=max(7,2,727,10)=727.

Since 12 < 727, it doesn't win match4 (which is winner of match3 vs a5).

Hence, wins 0 matches if not swapping.

But in the problem, it's optimal to swap cow5 to position3.

After swapping, a=[7,2,12,10,727,13]

Now, my cow is at position3, a3=12.

max(a1 to a2)=max(7,2)=7 < 12, so it wins match2 (pos3 vs winner of match1).

Then, it becomes the new winner and faces pos4=10.

Since 12 > 10, wins match3.

Then, faces pos5=727.

Since 12 < 727, loses match4.

Hence, wins 2 matches.

So, the maximum is 2.

Hence, my formula seems to hold.

So, in general, for each possible position p where I can place my cow, the number of wins is:

- If a_p > max(a1 to a_{p-1}), then 1 (for winning match p-1) plus the number of subsequent cows (from p+1 to n) with ratings lower than a_p, until the first cow with rating higher than a_p.

- Else, 0.

And I need to maximize this over all possible positions p, including p=k (i.e., not swapping).

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to precompute:

1. The maximum rating for each prefix of the array.

2. For each position p, find the number of subsequent cows with ratings lower than a_p until the first cow with rating higher than a_p.

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4 with sum of n up to 1e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let's see.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, k, a[].

- Identify my cow's rating: a[k-1].

- Option1: not swapping. p=k.

- Option2: swap with any other position p.

I need to consider all possible p from 1 to n.

But considering that n is up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, I need to compute this efficiently.

Let me precompute for each position p, the number of wins if my cow is placed at p.

Then, for each test case, I can compute the maximum over all p.

But to do this efficiently, I need a way to compute the number of wins for any p quickly.

Let's precompute the maximum prefix for each p.

max_prefix[p] = max(a[0 to p-1])

Then, for each p, if a_p > max_prefix[p], then my cow can win match p-1.

Then, the number of wins is 1 (for match p-1) plus the number of subsequent cows with ratings lower than a_p until the first cow with rating higher than a_p.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute for each p, the next greater element in the array a[p+1 to n].

Let's say next_greater[p] = the position of the first cow after p with rating > a_p.

Then, the number of wins for p is 1 (for match p-1) + (next_greater[p] - p - 1), provided that a_p > max_prefix[p].

Else, 0.

Hence, for each p, wins[p] = 1 + (next_greater[p] - p - 1) if a_p > max_prefix[p], else 0.

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

Now, to compute max_prefix[p], I can just keep a running maximum.

To compute next_greater[p], I can use a stack to find the next greater element for each p.

This can be done in O(n) time per test case.

Hence, this should be efficient enough.

Let's outline the steps:

For each test case:

1. Read n, k, a[].

2. Compute max_prefix[p] for p from 1 to n.

   - Initialize max_val = a[0]

   - For p from 1 to n:

       - max_prefix[p] = max_val

       - if p < k:

           - max_val = max(max_val, a[p])

       - else if p > k:

           - max_val = max(max_val, a[p])

       - Note: when p == k, we skip because we might swap p with k.

       - But actually, we need to consider a_p as the cow at position p, which could be our cow or another cow.

       - Wait, no. We need to consider that a_p is the rating at position p, and our cow is at position k.

       - But in the swap, we can choose to place our cow at any position p.

       - So, for each p, a_p is the rating at position p.

       - Our cow's rating is a[k-1].

       - When we swap, our cow is at position p with rating a[k-1], and the original a_p is at position k.

       - Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

       - Actually, in the swap, I'm swapping the positions of my cow and another cow.

       - So, if I swap my cow from position k to position p, then:

           - The rating at position p becomes a[k-1]

           - The rating at position k becomes a[p-1]

       - Hence, for each possible p, the new a_p is a[k-1], and the new a_k is a[p-1].

       - But this seems complicated to handle for all p.

       - Maybe I need to consider two cases:

           - Not swapping: p = k, with a[k-1]

           - Swapping with some p: p != k, with a[k-1] at position p, and a[p-1] at position k.

       - This seems too involved.

       - Perhaps I need to think differently.

       - Maybe consider that in the swap, I'm placing my cow at position p with rating a[k-1], and the original a_p is moved to position k.

       - But this seems messy.

       - Let me consider that in the swap, I choose to place my cow at position p, so a_p becomes a[k-1], and a[k-1] becomes whatever was at position p.

       - But I need to compute the number of wins for my cow, which is now at position p with rating a[k-1].

       - So, for each p, I need to consider a_p = a[k-1], and the rest of the array remains the same.

       - Wait, no. If I swap my cow from k to p, then position p has a[k-1], and position k has a[p].

       - But this seems too complicated to handle for each p.

       - Maybe I need to fix the rating of my cow and see where to place it optimally.

       - Let me try to think in terms of placing my cow at position p with rating a[k-1], and adjust the array accordingly.

       - But this seems too time-consuming.

       - Perhaps I need to consider that my cow's rating is fixed, and I can choose its position.

       - So, for each possible position p, set a_p = a[k-1], and compute the number of wins.

       - But I need to adjust for the fact that a[k-1] is now at p, and the original a_p is moved to k.

       - This seems too involved.

       - Maybe I need to consider that in the swap, I can choose to place my cow at any position p with its rating a[k-1], and the original a_p is moved to position k.

       - Then, for computing the number of wins for my cow, which is now at position p, I need to compute how many matches it can win starting from match p-1.

       - This seems too complicated.

       - Let me try to think differently.

       - Let me consider that I can choose to place my cow at any position p, with its rating a[k-1], and the rest of the cows remain in their positions.

       - Then, for each p, compute the number of wins for my cow at position p.

       - This is similar to choosing to place my cow at p and ignoring the swap of the other cow.

       - But this might not be accurate, because in reality, when I swap my cow with another cow, I'm also moving another cow to my original position.

       - However, since the problem allows me to choose to swap with any other cow or do nothing, and I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow, perhaps I can consider that I can place my cow at any position p, with its rating a[k-1], and compute the number of wins accordingly.

       - This might be an over-simplification, but it could work.

       - So, for each p, set a_p = a[k-1], and compute the number of wins for my cow at position p.

       - Then, take the maximum over all p.

       - But I need to make sure that this doesn't affect the other positions in a way that invalidates the computation.

       - Let's try this approach.

       - So, for each p, set a_p = a[k-1], and compute the number of wins for my cow at position p.

       - To compute the number of wins:

           - If a_p > max(a1 to a_{p-1}), then it wins match p-1.

           - Then, it becomes the new winner and can keep winning against subsequent cows until it encounters one with a higher rating.

       - So, for each p, compute:

           - If a_p > max_prefix[p], then wins = 1 + (next_greater[p] - p - 1)

           - Else, wins = 0

       - Then, the answer is the maximum wins over all p.

       - Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to precompute max_prefix and next_greater for each p.

       - max_prefix[p] can be computed in O(n).

       - next_greater[p] can be computed using a stack in O(n).

       - Then, for each p, compute wins[p] as above.

       - Finally, take the maximum wins[p] over all p.

       - This should be efficient enough.

       - Now, let's see how to handle the swap correctly.

       - In reality, when I swap my cow with another cow, I'm moving my cow to position p and moving the original cow at position p to position k.

       - But in this approach, I'm setting a_p = a[k-1], which effectively places my cow at position p, and ignoring the effect on position k.

       - This might not be entirely correct, because the original a_p is moved to position k, which could affect the tournament if k is after p.

       - However, since I'm only interested in the number of wins for my cow at position p, and not concerned with the rest of the tournament beyond that, this approximation might suffice.

       - Moreover, in the problem, it's allowed to swap with any other cow or do nothing, so considering placing my cow at any position p with its rating a[k-1] seems acceptable.

       - Therefore, I'll proceed with this approach.

       - So, for each test case, I'll compute max_prefix[p] and next_greater[p] for all p.

       - Then, for each p, compute wins[p] as described.

       - Finally, take the maximum wins[p] over all p.

       - This should give me the correct answer.

       - Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

       - Given that sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, and t up to 1e4, but sum of n is 1e5, this should be acceptable.

       - Now, let's think about implementing next_greater[p].

       - I can use a stack to compute the next greater element for each p in O(n) time.

       - Then, for each p, if a_p > max_prefix[p], wins[p] = 1 + (next_greater[p] - p - 1)

       - Else, wins[p] = 0

       - Finally, answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

       - Let's verify this with the first test case.

       - n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

       - max_prefix[p]:

           - p=1: max(a[0 to 0]) = 12

           - p=2: max(a[0 to 1]) = 12

           - p=3: max(a[0 to 2]) = 14

           - p=4: max(a[0 to 3]) = 14

           - p=5: max(a[0 to 4]) = 14

           - p=6: max(a[0 to 5]) = 14

       - next_greater[p]:

           - p=1: next greater is p=3 (14 > 12), so next_greater[1] = 3

           - p=2: next greater is p=3 (14 > 10)

           - p=3: next greater is p=4 (14 > 11)

           - p=4: next greater is p=5 (14 > 11)

           - p=5: next greater is p=6 (8 < 3, but 3 < 8, wait no)

           - Wait, next_greater[p] is the position of the first cow after p with rating > a_p

           - p=1: a1=12, next greater is p=3 (14 > 12)

           - p=2: a2=10, next greater is p=3 (14 > 10)

           - p=3: a3=14, next greater is p=4 (14 > 11)

           - p=4: a4=11, next greater is p=5 (11 > 8)

           - p=5: a5=8, next greater is p=6 (8 > 3)

           - p=6: a6=3, no next greater

       - So, next_greater[p]:

           - p1:3

           - p2:3

           - p3:4

           - p4:5

           - p5:6

           - p6:n+1=7

       - For each p, if a_p > max_prefix[p], then wins[p] = 1 + (next_greater[p] - p -1)

           - p1: a1=12 > max_prefix[1]=12? no, so wins=0

           - Wait, according to the problem, in the first test case, not swapping gives cow1 winning once.

           - But according to this, p1: a1=12 > max_prefix[1]=12? no, so wins=0

           - But in reality, cow1 wins once.

           - So, there's a mistake in the formula.

           - Wait, perhaps it should be a_p >= max_prefix[p], but in the problem, it's strictly greater.

           - Wait, in the problem, all a_i are distinct, so strictly greater is fine.

           - But in p1: a1=12 > max_prefix[1]=12? no, so wins=0

           - But in reality, cow1 wins once.

           - So, perhaps I need to handle p=1 differently.

           - For p=1, max_prefix[1]=a1, so a_p > max_prefix[p] is false.

           - Hence, wins=0, but in reality, cow1 wins once.

           - So, my formula is incorrect for p=1.

           - Wait, perhaps for p=1, it's a special case.

           - In p=1, the match is against p2.

           - If a1 > a2, then it wins once.

           - Then, faces p3.

           - If a1 > a3, wins again, and so on.

           - So, for p=1, wins = number of cows with lower ratings than a1.

           - But in my formula, for p=1, a_p > max_prefix[p] is false, so wins=0.

           - Hence, I need to adjust the formula for p=1.

           - Perhaps, for p=1, wins = number of cows with lower ratings than a1.

           - For p >1, wins = 1 + (next_greater[p] - p -1) if a_p > max_prefix[p]

           - Wait, but in p=1, max_prefix[p]=a1, so a_p > max_prefix[p] is false.

           - So, perhaps I need to set max_prefix[p] = max(a1 to a_{p-1})

           - For p=1, max_prefix[1] = 0 or undefined.

           - So, perhaps set max_prefix[1] = -infinity or 0.

           - Then, a_p > max_prefix[p] for p=1 would be true.

           - Then, wins[p1] =1 + (next_greater[1] -1 -1) =1 + (3-1-1)=1

           - Which matches the first test case.

           - In reality, cow1 wins once.

           - So, perhaps set max_prefix[1] = -infinity.

           - Then, a_p > -infinity is always true, so wins[p1] =1 + (next_greater[1] -1 -1)=1 + (3-1-1)=1

           - Which matches.

           - For p=2: a2=10 > max_prefix[2]=12? no, wins=0

           - For p=3: a3=14 > max_prefix[3]=14? no, wins=0

           - For p=4: a4=11 > max_prefix[4]=14? no, wins=0

           - For p=5: a5=8 > max_prefix[5]=14? no, wins=0

           - For p=6: a6=3 > max_prefix[6]=14? no, wins=0

           - So, the maximum is wins[p1]=1, which matches the first test case.

           - Now, let's check the second test case.

           - n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

           - Set a_p = a[k-1]=12 for any p.

           - Compute max_prefix[p]:

               - p1: max(a[0 to 0])=7

               - p2: max(a[0 to 1])=7

               - p3: max(a[0 to 2])=727

               - p4: max(a[0 to 3])=727

               - p5: max(a[0 to 4])=727

               - p6: max(a[0 to 5])=727

           - next_greater[p]:

               - p1: a1=12, next greater is p3=727 -> position
