Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n books, each with a certain number of pages, and she wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles. Then, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile and wants to maximize the total number of pages she reads.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. She has to divide the books into two piles, both non-empty, and then from each pile, she reads the book with the highest page count. My goal is to help her maximize the sum of the pages of these two books.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to select two books, one from each pile, such that their page counts are as high as possible. Since she reads the highest in each pile, it makes sense to choose the two books with the highest page counts, one for each pile.

Wait, but if I put the two highest books in separate piles, their sum would be maximized. Is that correct? Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

4

2 3 3 1

So, n=4, and the books have pages 2, 3, 3, 1.

If I put the two books with 3 pages in separate piles, say pile 1 has the first book with 2 pages and the second book with 3 pages, and pile 2 has the third book with 3 pages and the fourth with 1 page. Then, the highest in pile 1 is 3, and in pile 2 is 3, sum is 6.

But in the example, it says the output is 4, which is 3 + 1. That's different from what I thought.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

So, she reads the book with the highest page count in each pile.

In my previous example, if I put books with pages 2 and 3 in one pile, and books with pages 3 and 1 in another pile, she reads 3 from the first pile and 3 from the second pile, totaling 6, but the example says 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose which book to read carefully.

Looking back at the note for the second test case:

"In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, a_3 is 3 and a_4 is 1. So, she reads 3 and 1, sum is 4.

But why not read 3 and 3, sum is 6?

Ah, I see. The confusion is about the book numbers versus their page counts.

In the problem, the books are numbered from 1 to n, and a_i is the number of pages in the i-th book.

So, in the second test case, the books are:

Book 1: 2 pages

Book 2: 3 pages

Book 3: 3 pages

Book 4: 1 page

In the note, it says:

"Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, but book 3 has 3 pages, and book 4 has 1 page. So, why is it reading a_3 and a_4? Shouldn't it be reading the highest in each pile?

Wait, perhaps "the book with the highest number" refers to the book with the highest page count, not the highest book number.

But in the note, it says "the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile". But book 4 has only 1 page, which is less than book 1's 2 pages.

This is confusing. Maybe I misread it.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

Wait, maybe "highest number" refers to the book's number, not the page count.

But that would be unusual. Probably, it's a translation issue.

Looking back, perhaps it's a mistranslation, and it should be "the book with the highest page count in each pile."

Assuming that, I need to maximize the sum of the highest page counts from two piles.

Given that, in the second test case, if she puts books 2 and 3 (both with 3 pages) in one pile and books 1 and 4 (2 and 1 pages) in another pile, then the highest in the first pile is 3 and in the second pile is 2, sum is 5.

But in the note, it says she reads a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

This suggests that maybe the highest number refers to the book's number, not the page count.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Why would she read the book with the highest number (book number), not the highest page count?

Let me check the problem statement again.

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

I think there might be a confusion in the wording.

Perhaps it's "the book with the highest number of pages in each pile."

Assuming that, I need to maximize the sum of the highest page counts in two piles.

Given that, in the second test case, if she puts books 2 and 3 (both 3 pages) in one pile and books 1 and 4 (2 and 1 pages) in another pile, she reads 3 (from pile 1) and 2 (from pile 2), sum is 5.

But in the example, the output is 4.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the piles must be non-empty, and there are different ways to split the books.

Let's try another approach.

Suppose I sort the array of page counts in descending order.

So, for the second test case: 3, 3, 2, 1

If I put the first book (3 pages) in one pile and the rest (3, 2, 1) in another pile, then the highest in the first pile is 3, and in the second pile is 3, sum is 6.

But the example shows 4.

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that the piles must be contiguous or something, but no, it's a general division into two non-empty piles.

I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the book numbers are significant, and she reads the book with the highest number (meaning the book with the largest a_i) in each pile.

But that still doesn't align with the example.

Alternatively, perhaps "the highest number" refers to the book's identifier, not its page count.

But that doesn't make sense in the context of maximizing pages read.

I think there's confusion in the problem statement.

Let me look at another test case to get more clarity.

Take the first test case:

2

1 1

Output: 2

So, two books, each with 1 page. Only one way to divide: one book in each pile. Sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

That matches the output.

Third test case:

5

2 2 3 2 2

Output: 5

So, n=5, pages: 2,2,3,2,2

If I put the book with 3 pages in one pile and the rest in another pile, sum is 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the output.

Fourth test case:

2

10 3

Output: 13

So, two books, 10 and 3. Only one way to divide: each in separate piles. Sum is 10 + 3 = 13.

Fifth test case:

3

1 2 3

Output: 5

So, n=3, pages:1,2,3.

Possible divisions:

- Pile1: book1 (1), Pile2: books2 and3 (2 and3). Reads 1 + 3 = 4.

- Pile1: book2 (2), Pile2: books1 and3 (1 and3). Reads 2 + 3 = 5.

- Pile1: book3 (3), Pile2: books1 and2 (1 and2). Reads 3 + 2 = 5.

So, maximum is 5, which matches the example.

From these observations, it seems that the problem is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest page count from each pile, aiming to maximize the sum of these two.

Given that, the strategy should be to identify the two highest page counts, provided they are in different piles.

In the second test case, pages are 2,3,3,1. The two highest are both 3. So, by placing them in separate piles, sum is 3 + 3 = 6, but the example shows 4.

Wait, but in the note, it shows a different division leading to 4, but according to this logic, 6 should be possible.

There's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Looking back, the note says:

"Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, a_3 is 3 and a_4 is 1. So, sum is 4.

But why not put book2 (3) and book1 (2) in one pile, and book3 (3) and book4 (1) in another pile? Then, read 3 and 3, sum is 6.

Or put book2 (3) in one pile, and books1,3,4 (2,3,1) in another pile. Read 3 and 3, sum is 6.

Unless, perhaps, there's a restriction on how the books are divided based on their indices, but the problem doesn't mention any such restriction.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to consider that the books are divided into two consecutive groups.

But the problem says "divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles."

No mention of continuity.

Given that, the maximum should be the sum of the two highest page counts, provided they are in different piles.

In the second test case, there are two books with 3 pages. So, by placing each in separate piles, sum is 3 + 3 = 6.

But the example shows 4, which is different.

This suggests that perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe there's a constraint that the piles must be contiguous in the original ordering.

But the problem doesn't specify that.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should consider that the piles can be any partition, and aim to maximize the sum of the two highest page counts from different piles.

Hence, the strategy is to sort the array in descending order and pick the two highest values.

Wait, but in the second test case, that would be 3 + 3 = 6, but the example shows 4.

Unless there is a constraint that the two books must not be adjacent in the original list or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the piles must be consecutive in the original ordering.

If that's the case, then in the second test case:

Options:

- Pile1: book1 (2), Pile2: books2,3,4 (3,3,1). Read 2 + 3 = 5.

- Pile1: books1,2 (2,3), Pile2: books3,4 (3,1). Read 3 + 3 = 6.

- Pile1: books1,2,3 (2,3,3), Pile2: book4 (1). Read 3 + 1 = 4.

The example seems to correspond to the last option.

But according to this, the maximum is 6, but the example shows 4.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the problem has a constraint that the piles must be contiguous subarrays.

But the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding which book is read from each pile.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should look at the provided program and see what it does.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])

So, for each test case, it reads n, reads the list of a_i, then computes the maximum of the first n-1 elements plus the last element.

In the second test case, nums = [2,3,3,1]

max(nums[:-1]) = max([2,3,3]) = 3

nums[-1] = 1

Sum = 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the example.

But as per my earlier reasoning, it should be possible to get 6.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

But according to the example, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

Assuming "highest number" refers to the highest page count in each pile, then the program seems to be choosing the highest from all but the last pile and adding the last one, which may not always give the maximum sum.

In the second test case, by choosing max([2,3,3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, but it's possible to get higher sums.

Hence, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the example matches the output of the program.

Maybe the program is correct, and my earlier reasoning was flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct because it ensures that the two piles are non-empty, and by choosing the maximum of the first n-1 books and adding the last book, it achieves the maximum sum.

Wait, but in the second test case, it's getting 4, whereas I thought it could be 6.

This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different interpretation.

Let me consider that "the book with the highest number" refers to the book with the highest index, not the highest page count.

If that's the case, then in each pile, she reads the book with the highest index.

In the second test case, if she puts books 1 and 2 in one pile (books with pages 2 and 3), and books 3 and 4 in another pile (books with pages 3 and 1), then she reads book2 (3 pages) from the first pile and book4 (1 page) from the second pile, sum is 4.

This matches the example.

So, perhaps "the book with the highest number" refers to the book with the highest index in each pile.

If that's the case, then the program seems to be incorrect, because it's adding the last element (highest index) to the maximum of the first n-1 elements, which may not correspond to the correct piles.

Wait, but in the second test case, according to this interpretation, if you have piles as books1 and books2,3,4, then she reads book2 (highest index in first pile) and book4 (highest index in second pile), sum is 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the example.

Alternatively, if you have piles as books1,2 and books3,4, she reads book2 and book4, sum is 3 + 1 = 4.

Or piles as books1,2,3 and book4, she reads book3 and book4, sum is 3 + 1 = 4.

So, in all cases, sum is 4.

But according to my earlier wrong assumption, I thought she reads the highest page count in each pile, which would allow sums up to 6.

But if she reads the book with the highest index in each pile, then sum is always 4 in this test case.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the highest-indexed book in each pile; instead, it's choosing the maximum of the first n-1 books and adding the last book.

In this interpretation, the program is incorrect because it's not selecting the books with the highest indices in their respective piles.

For instance, in the second test case, if we have piles as books1,2 and books3,4, the highest-indexed books are book2 and book4, which are a_2=3 and a_4=1, sum=4.

But the program does max([2,3,3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, which coincides.

But in the third test case:

5

2 2 3 2 2

According to the problem, output is 5.

If piles are books1,2,3,4 and book5, she reads book4 and book5, sum=2+2=4.

But the output is 5, which suggests that piles are books1,2,3 and books4,5. She reads book3 and book5, sum=3+2=5.

But according to the program, max([2,2,3,2]) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5, which matches.

In the fourth test case:

2

10 3

Piles: books1 and book2. She reads book1 and book2, which are 10 and 3, sum=13.

According to the program: max([10]) + 3 = 10 + 3 =13, which matches.

Fifth test case:

3

1 2 3

Piles: books1,2 and book3. She reads book2 and book3, sum=2+3=5.

According to the program: max([1,2]) + 3 = 2 + 3 =5, which matches.

So, in these cases, the program seems to be correct.

But in the second test case, as per the initial confusion, it also matches.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, according to the problem, output is 4, and the program also outputs 4.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

But earlier, I thought that if "the book with the highest number in each pile" refers to the book with the highest index in each pile, then the program is correct.

But according to the problem statement, it's "the book with the highest number in each pile", which could be ambiguous.

If it's the book with the highest index, then the program seems to be correct.

But perhaps "highest number" refers to the highest page count.

In that case, the program is incorrect, as in the second test case, it's possible to get a higher sum by choosing two books with the highest page counts in different piles.

But according to the example, output is 4, which suggests that it's not considering the highest page counts, but rather the highest-indexed books in their piles.

Hence, perhaps the problem intends for "the book with the highest number in each pile" to mean the book with the highest index in each pile.

In that case, the program is correct, because it's choosing the highest-indexed book (last book) and the highest of the first n-1 books.

Hence, Correctness: True.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps "the book with the highest number in each pile" refers to the book with the highest page count in each pile.

In that case, the program is incorrect, because it doesn't ensure that the two highest page counts are in different piles.

But in the examples provided, it seems to coincide.

In the second test case, even though the two highest page counts are 3 and 3, and they can be in different piles, the program still manages to select one 3 and the last book, which is 1, summing to 4.

But according to the example, output is 4, which might suggest that it's acceptable, but in reality, if "highest number" means highest page count, then choosing two 3's would be better, summing to 6.

But the example shows 4, which is inconsistent.

Hence, perhaps "the book with the highest number in each pile" refers to the book with the highest index in each pile.

In that case, the program is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to choose the highest page count in each pile, but with the piles being contiguous subsequences.

In that case, the program might not be correct.

But given the examples, it seems to work.

Hence, perhaps the problem is to choose the highest page count in each pile, with piles being any partition into two non-empty piles.

In that case, the program is incorrect because it doesn't always choose the two highest page counts in different piles.

But in the examples provided, it coincides.

Hence, perhaps the problem is to choose the highest-indexed book in each pile.

In that case, the program is correct.

Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, I'll assume that "the book with the highest number in each pile" refers to the book with the highest index in each pile, and thus the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
