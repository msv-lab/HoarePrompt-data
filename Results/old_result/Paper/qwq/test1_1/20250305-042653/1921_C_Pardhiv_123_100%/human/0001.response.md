Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the beginning, at moment 0, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time that it's on. Also, he can turn the phone off and on again, but each time he does that, it costs b units of charge.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any moment when he needs to send a message.

First, I need to understand how the charge changes over time. The phone loses charge at a rate of a units per unit time when it's on. So, if the phone is on from time t1 to t2, it will lose a*(t2 - t1) units of charge during that period.

Additionally, each time he turns the phone off and then back on, it costs b units of charge. This seems like a one-time cost for turning it off and on again, regardless of the time between.

I need to find a strategy for when to keep the phone on and when to turn it off to minimize the charge consumption, ensuring that there's enough charge to send all the messages.

Let's think about the intervals between the messages. Since the messages are at moments m1, m2, ..., mn, and m_i < m_{i+1}, the time between messages is m_{i+1} - m_i.

One approach is to consider the charge remaining just before each message is sent. If the phone is kept on continuously from the previous message to the current one, the charge will decrease by a*(m_i - m_{i-1}) between messages.

Alternatively, Stepan can choose to turn the phone off at some points and turn it back on before sending the next message. Each time he does this, he incurs a cost of b units of charge.

So, for each interval between messages, Stepan has to decide whether to keep the phone on or to turn it off and on again, paying the b cost.

The key is to choose for each interval whether it's better to pay the a*(m_i - m_{i-1}) cost for keeping the phone on or the fixed b cost for turning it off and on.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm where, for each interval, we choose the option that minimizes the charge consumption.

Let me formalize this.

Letâ€™s denote the charge remaining just before sending the i-th message as f_i.

Initialize f_0 = f.

For each i from 1 to n:

f_i = f_{i-1} - min(a * (m_i - m_{i-1}), b)

If at any point f_i <= 0, then it's impossible to send all messages, and the answer is "NO". Otherwise, if f_n > 0 after all deductions, the answer is "YES".

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the phone loses a units of charge per unit time it is on, and that turning it off and on consumes b units of charge each time.

So, if Stepan chooses to keep the phone on between m_{i-1} and m_i, the charge loss is a*(m_i - m_{i-1}).

If he chooses to turn the phone off at m_{i-1} and turn it on at m_i, the charge loss is b.

He can choose the option that costs less charge for each interval.

So, for each interval, the charge consumed is min(a*(m_i - m_{i-1}), b).

Then, total charge consumed is the sum of these min values for all intervals.

If the initial charge f is greater than or equal to this total consumption, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

Wait, but the charge is consumed over time, so it's not just a total sum; we have to ensure that at each step, after consuming the charge, the remaining charge is positive before sending each message.

But in this approach, if we subtract the min value for each interval from the current charge, and check if it ever goes below or equal to zero, that should ensure that at each message sending moment, there's enough charge left.

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m=3

So, intervals are from 0 to 3.

Option 1: keep the phone on from 0 to 3, charge consumed: 1*3=3

So, f after sending the message: 3 - 3 = 0

But the problem says that if the charge is <=0, it's impossible to send the message.

So, in this case, it's "NO".

Option 2: turn off at 0 and on at 3, charge consumed: 5

f after turning on: 3 - 5 = -2, which is less than 0, so still "NO".

Hence, the answer is "NO", which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

m=1 2 3 4 5

So, intervals are:

0 to 1: min(1*1, 2) = 1, f=10-1=9

1 to 2: min(1*1, 2)=1, f=9-1=8

2 to 3: min(1*1, 2)=1, f=8-1=7

3 to 4: min(1*1, 2)=1, f=7-1=6

4 to 5: min(1*1, 2)=1, f=6-1=5

After sending the last message, f=5>0, so "YES".

Another way, if he chooses to turn off and on at some points, but it wouldn't be optimal since b=2 is greater than a*(m_i - m_{i-1})=1.

Hence, the minimal charge consumption is achieved by keeping the phone on during intervals where a*(m_i - m_{i-1}) < b, and turning it off and on otherwise.

In the fifth test case:

n=3, f=11, a=9, b=6

m=6 8 10

Intervals:

0 to 6: min(9*6, 6)=6, f=11-6=5

6 to 8: min(9*2,6)=6, f=5-6=-1 <=0, so "NO"

Hence, it's "NO".

Seems consistent.

So, the algorithm is:

- For each interval between m_{i-1} and m_i (with m_0=0), calculate the charge consumption as min(a*(m_i - m_{i-1}), b).

- Subtract this value from the current charge.

- If at any step the charge becomes <=0, output "NO". Otherwise, if after all messages, charge >0, output "YES".

This seems correct based on the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

while t > 0:

(n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))

ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

t -= 1

Wait, there's a mistake here.

After the loop where it subtracts the min values from f, it checks if f > 0 and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

But according to the problem, it should print "YES" if f > 0 after all deductions, otherwise "NO".

However, in the first test case, it should print "NO", which it does correctly.

In the third test case, it should print "YES", which it does.

In the fifth test case, it should print "NO", which it does.

So, seems correct.

But wait, in the second test case:

n=7, f=21, a=1, b=3

m=4 6 10 13 17 20 26

Intervals:

0 to 4: min(1*4,3)=3, f=21-3=18

4 to 6: min(1*2,3)=2, f=18-2=16

6 to 10: min(1*4,3)=3, f=16-3=13

10 to 13: min(1*3,3)=3, f=13-3=10

13 to 17: min(1*4,3)=3, f=10-3=7

17 to 20: min(1*3,3)=3, f=7-3=4

20 to 26: min(1*6,3)=3, f=4-3=1

After all deductions, f=1>0, so "YES".

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for the fourth test case:

n=1, f=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

m=1000000000

Intervals:

0 to 1000000000: min(1000000000*1000000000, 1000000000)=1000000000

f=1000000000 - 1000000000=0

Since f=0, which is not greater than 0, output "NO".

Which matches the sample output.

And for the sixth test case, it's "YES".

So, based on this analysis, the program seems correct.

But I need to make sure that there are no edge cases where this approach fails.

Consider n=2, f=5, a=2, b=3

m=1 3

Intervals:

0 to 1: min(2*1,3)=2, f=5-2=3

1 to 3: min(2*2,3)=3, f=3-3=0

f=0 after all deductions, which is not greater than 0, so "NO".

But if we choose to keep the phone on from 0 to 3, the charge consumed would be 2*3=6, which is more than f=5, so not possible.

Alternatively, turn off at 1 and turn on at 3, consuming b=3, total consumption=2(from 0 to1)+3=5, f=5-5=0, still "NO".

Hence, it's correct.

Another edge case: n=0, f=anything, a=anything, b=anything.

But n=0 is not possible since n >=1 according to constraints.

Wait, no, n >=1 is not specified, but in constraints, n >=1.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, n >=1 is not specified, but in constraints, n >=1.

Wait, looking back, constraints say 1 <= n <= 2e5.

So, n >=1.

Hence, no need to handle n=0.

Another edge case: n=1, m1=0.

Wait, m_i >=1 as per sample inputs.

Wait, in the problem statement, m_i >=1.

Wait, no, in the first sample, m1=3, which is >=1.

Wait, the problem says 1 <= m_i <=1e9, and m_i < m_{i+1}.

Hence, m_i starts from at least 1.

Hence, the interval from 0 to m1 is at least 1 unit of time.

Hence, no issue.

Another consideration: when m_i - m_{i-1} is such that a*(m_i - m_{i-1}) < b, it's better to keep the phone on; otherwise, it's better to turn it off and on.

But in the program, it always chooses the min of the two, which is correct.

Hence, I think the program is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Stepan can send all his messages without his phone running out of charge, given the constraints of charge consumption and the option to turn the phone off and on.

### Approach
1. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time it is on.
   - Turning the phone off and on again consumes `b` units of charge each time.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - For each interval between messages (including the initial interval from moment 0 to the first message), Stepan has two choices:
     - Keep the phone on throughout the interval, consuming `a * (m_i - m_{i-1})` units of charge.
     - Turn the phone off and on at the start of the interval, consuming `b` units of charge.
   - We choose the option that consumes less charge for each interval.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize the remaining charge `f`.
   - For each interval, calculate the charge consumed as the minimum between `a * (m_i - m_{i-1})` and `b`.
   - Subtract this charge from the remaining charge `f`.
   - If at any point `f` becomes zero or negative, it is impossible to send all messages ("NO"). Otherwise, it is possible ("YES").

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f -= min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
            if f <= 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        t -= 1

# To use this function, uncomment the following line:
# func()
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `n` (number of messages), `f` (initial charge), `a` (charge consumption per unit time), and `b` (charge consumption for turning off and on).
  - Read the list of message moments and prepend 0 to handle the interval from moment 0 to the first message.

- **Charge Deduction**:
  - For each interval between consecutive messages (including the initial interval), calculate the minimum charge consumption between keeping the phone on or turning it off and on.
  - Subtract this minimum charge from the current charge `f`.
  - If `f` becomes zero or negative at any step, print "NO" immediately.

- **Output**:
  - If all intervals are processed without `f` becoming zero or negative, print "YES".

This approach ensures that we are always making the optimal choice for each interval, minimizing charge consumption and efficiently determining if it is possible to send all messages.
