Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in late and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do this, he can bribe people ahead of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j < i, swap with the person at position j, and he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i (excluding j and i), he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

Kirill can do this operation any number of times, and he wants to spend as little as possible to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations and costs involved. Kirill starts at position n+1, and he wants to reach position m or better.

Let me think about how he can move forward in the queue. Each swap operation allows him to jump from position i to position j, where j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position <= m.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the shortest path from n+1 to any node <= m.

But with n up to 200,000, a standard shortest path algorithm would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the queue positions from 1 to n+1.

Kirill starts at n+1 and wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

I need to model the possible swaps and their costs.

Let me try to think of a way to compute the minimum cost to reach position i for each i from 1 to n+1.

I can define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

Initially, dp[n+1] = 0, since he's already there.

For each position i from n down to 1, I can consider swapping to positions j < i.

But this seems too slow for n=200,000.

I need a better way.

Maybe I can think about the cumulative costs as Kirill moves from n+1 to some position <=m.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the cost to move directly from n+1 to some position j <=m, and compute the minimal cost among all possible j from 1 to m.

But how do I compute the cost for a direct swap from n+1 to j?

Wait, no, he can perform multiple swaps, not just one.

I need to model the sequence of swaps.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a way to optimize the swaps.

Maybe I can consider the cost to move from position i to position j < i.

The cost is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, that's the cost for one swap from i to j.

But Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

I need to find a sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, but n is too large for a standard DP approach.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the positions in reverse order.

Suppose I consider positions from n+1 down to 1, and keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Wait, perhaps I can use prefix sums or something similar for the b_k values.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where p <= m.

To get from n+1 to p, he can perform a series of swaps.

Each swap from i to j < i costs a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost path from n+1 to p for all p from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among those.

But again, this seems too slow for large n.

I need a better approach.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are possible swaps with their costs.

Then, find the shortest path from n+1 to any node <=m.

But with n=200,000, building such a graph is impractical.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimal cost.

Let me consider that Kirill can swap to any position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find a sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

Perhaps I can think of it as moving left in the queue, one step or multiple steps at a time, with specific costs.

Wait, maybe I can model this with prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, the sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

This might help in optimizing the calculations.

But I still need a way to model the sequence of swaps efficiently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps in such a way that he moves from n+1 to some position j, then from j to some position k < j, and so on, until he reaches a position <=m.

I need to minimize the total cost of these swaps.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can consider that the minimal cost to reach position p is the minimal cost of all possible sequences of swaps that end at p.

But computing this directly is not feasible for large n.

I need to find a pattern or a way to compute this incrementally.

Let me consider that for each position p from 1 to m, the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost among all possible last swaps that land on p.

In other words, to reach p, Kirill could have swapped from some position i > p to p, paying a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1.

Wait, no. The swap is from i to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, to reach p, Kirill could have swapped from some i > p to p, paying a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1.

So, the cost to reach p directly from i is a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1.

But Kirill can reach p from any i > p.

So, the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal over all i > p of (minimal cost to reach i) + a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1.

But this is still not straightforward to compute efficiently.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost to reach any position i > p, plus the cost to swap from i to p.

So, dp[p] = min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1)

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need to optimize this.

Maybe I can find a way to compute dp[p] efficiently using some kind of sliding window or prefix sums.

Let me think about rearranging the terms.

dp[p] = min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1)

This can be written as:

dp[p] = a_p + min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1)

Now, sum of b_k from k=p+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[p]

Assuming prefix_b[0] = 0 and prefix_b[k] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k.

Wait, I need to define prefix_b properly.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum from k=p+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[p]

So,

dp[p] = a_p + min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[p])

Now, prefix_b[p] is constant for a given p, so

dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Let me denote temp = min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Then,

dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + temp

Now, temp depends on i from p+1 to n+1.

I need to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can compute temp for p from n down to 1.

In other words, maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimal dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from p+1 to n+1.

I can iterate from p = n down to 1, and keep updating this minimal value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize temp = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

Because for p = n, temp = min over i from n+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

Then, for p = n-1, temp = min(temp, dp[n] + prefix_b[n-1])

And so on, down to p = 1.

So, I can iterate p from n down to 1, and maintain a running minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from p+1 to n+1.

Yes, this seems feasible.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute prefix_b[i] for i from 1 to n.

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i]

2. Initialize dp[n+1] = 0, since Kirill starts there.

3. Initialize temp = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

4. For p from n down to 1:

a. dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + temp

b. temp = min(temp, dp[p] + prefix_b[p-1])

Wait, let's verify this.

From earlier:

dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, in the loop, I need to compute dp[p] using the current temp, which is the min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Then, update temp to be the min of current temp and dp[p] + prefix_b[p-1], which will be used for the next p.

Wait, no.

Wait, when p decreases, temp should consider i from p+1 to n+1.

So, temp should be min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, when p decreases, we need to include dp[p+1] + prefix_b[p] in the min.

Wait, perhaps I need to initialize temp with dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

Then, for p from n down to 1:

dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + temp

temp = min(temp, dp[p] + prefix_b[p-1])

Is this correct?

Let's check for p = n:

temp = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

dp[n] = a_n - prefix_b[n] + temp = a_n - prefix_b[n] + dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n] = a_n + dp[n+1]

Then, temp = min(temp, dp[n] + prefix_b[n-1]) = min(dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n], a_n + dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n-1])

Now, for p = n-1:

dp[n-1] = a_{n-1} - prefix_b[n-1] + temp

Where temp is the min of (dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n], a_n + dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n-1])

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using a segment tree or some other data structure to efficiently compute the min over a range.

But that might be too slow for n=200,000.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal cost to reach p is a_p plus the minimal (dp[i] + sum from p+1 to i-1 for i from p+1 to n+1)

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the minimal dp[i] + sum from p+1 to i-1 for i from p+1 to n+1.

But this seems similar to what I was trying before.

Let me consider that sum from p+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[p]

So, dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + min over i from p+1 to n+1 of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

This seems like a standard way to compute minimal costs in dynamic programming with prefix sums.

I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 200,000, I need an O(n) solution.

Let me try to implement the approach I outlined earlier.

Initialize prefix_b[0] = 0

For i from 1 to n:

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i]

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Initialize temp = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

For p from n down to 1:

dp[p] = a_p - prefix_b[p] + temp

temp = min(temp, dp[p] + prefix_b[p-1])

Then, the minimal cost to reach any position <=m is the minimal dp[p] for p from 1 to m.

Wait, but dp[p] represents the minimal cost to reach position p.

So, the answer should be the minimal dp[p] for p from 1 to m.

Yes.

Let me verify this with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

2 1

2 3

1 1

Let's take the first test case:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4+3=7

prefix_b[3] = 7+8=15

prefix_b[4] = 15+5=20

Initialize dp[5] = 0

temp = dp[5] + prefix_b[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

Now, p=4:

dp[4] = a[4] - prefix_b[4] + temp = 9 - 20 + 20 = 9

temp = min(temp, dp[4] + prefix_b[3]) = min(20, 9 + 15) = min(20,24) =20

p=3:

dp[3] = 6 - 15 + 20 = 11

temp = min(20, 11 + 7) = min(20,18) =18

p=2:

dp[2] =3 -7 +18=14

temp = min(18,14+4)=min(18,18)=18

p=1:

dp[1]=7 -0 +18=25

temp = min(18,25+0)=18

Now, the minimal dp[p] for p=1 and p=2 is min(25,14)=14, which matches the first sample output.

Okay, this seems correct.

Let me check the second sample input.

6 2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=0

prefix_b[1]=5

prefix_b[2]=5+8=13

prefix_b[3]=13+8=21

prefix_b[4]=21+1=22

prefix_b[5]=22+4=26

prefix_b[6]=26+1=27

dp[7]=0

temp=0+27=27

p=6:

dp[6]=3 -27 +27=3

temp=min(27,3+26)=min(27,29)=27

p=5:

dp[5]=8 -26 +27=9

temp=min(27,9+22)=min(27,31)=27

p=4:

dp[4]=1 -22 +27=6

temp=min(27,6+21)=min(27,27)=27

p=3:

dp[3]=7 -21 +27=13

temp=min(27,13+13)=min(27,26)=26

p=2:

dp[2]=9 -13 +26=22

temp=min(26,22+5)=min(26,27)=26

p=1:

dp[1]=6 -0 +26=32

Minimal dp[p] for p=1 and p=2 is min(32,22)=22, matching the second sample output.

Seems correct.

Let me check the third sample.

7 7

a=[7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b=[9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=0

prefix_b[1]=9

prefix_b[2]=9+1=10

prefix_b[3]=10+10=20

prefix_b[4]=20+7=27

prefix_b[5]=27+1=28

prefix_b[6]=28+4=32

prefix_b[7]=32+9=41

dp[8]=0

temp=0+41=41

p=7:

dp[7]=9 -41 +41=9

temp=min(41,9+32)=min(41,41)=41

p=6:

dp[6]=5 -32 +41=14

temp=min(41,14+28)=min(41,42)=41

p=5:

dp[5]=6 -28 +41=19

temp=min(41,19+20)=min(41,39)=39

p=4:

dp[4]=2 -20 +39=19

temp=min(39,19+10)=min(39,29)=29

p=3:

dp[3]=9 -10 +29=28

temp=min(29,28+7)=min(29,35)=29

p=2:

dp[2]=2 -7 +29=24

temp=min(29,24+1)=min(29,25)=25

p=1:

dp[1]=7 -0 +25=32

Minimal dp[p] for p=1 to 7 is min(32,24,28,19,19,14,9)=9, matching the sample output.

Good.

Last sample:

2 1

a=[2,3]

b=[1,1]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=0

prefix_b[1]=1

prefix_b[2]=1+1=2

dp[3]=0

temp=0+2=2

p=2:

dp[2]=3 -2 +2=3

temp=min(2,3+1)=min(2,4)=2

p=1:

dp[1]=2 -0 +2=4

Minimal dp[p] for p=1 is 4, but the sample output is 3.

Wait, this doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, the sample output is 3, but according to this, it should be min(dp[1], dp[2]) = min(4,3)=3.

Okay, that matches.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

x = int(input())

custos = []

for i in range(x):

custo = 0

num_fila = 0

max_p = 0

a_values = []

b_values = []

nf = input().split()

num_fila = int(nf[0])

max_p = int(nf[1])

a = input().split()

b = input().split()

for y in a:

a_values.append(int(y))

for y in b:

b_values.append(int(y))

for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):

if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:

custo += a_values[y]

else:

custo += b_values[y]

for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):

if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:

custo += b_values[y]

if y == 1:

custo += a_values[0]

break

else:

custo += a_values[y]

break

custos.append(custo)

for c in custos:

print(c)



Wait, this doesn't seem to match the logic I described.

In my approach, I computed prefix sums for b_values, and then used dynamic programming to compute dp[p] for p from n down to 1.

But in this code, it's doing something different.

Let's analyze what this code is doing.

It processes t test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n and m.

- Reads a_values and b_values.

- Initializes custo = 0.

Then, it loops from num_fila -1 (which is n-1) down to max_p -1.

For each y in this range, it checks if a[y] < b[y]:

custo += a[y]

else:

custo += b[y]

Then, it loops from max_p -1 down to 0.

For each y in this range:

if a[y-1] + b[y] <= a[y]:

custo += b[y]

if y ==1:

custo += a[0]

break

else:

custo += a[y]

break

Finally, it appends custo to custos and prints each custo for each test case.

This seems different from my approach.

Let me check if this code produces correct outputs for the sample inputs.

First test case:

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

Loop y from 3 down to 2:

y=3:

a[3]=9, b[3]=5

9 >=5, so custo +=5 -> custo=5

y=2:

a[2]=6, b[2]=8

6 <8, so custo +=6 -> custo=11

Then, loop y from 1 down to 0:

y=1:

a[0]=7, b[1]=3

7 +3 =10 <= 3? No, so custo +=3 -> custo=14

y=0:

Since y==1, custo +=a[0]=7 -> custo=21

But according to my earlier calculation, dp[2]=14 and dp[1]=25, so minimal is 14.

But this code outputs 21, which doesn't match the sample output of 14.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

The first loop is from n-1 down to m-1.

For n=4, m=2, y from 3 down to 1.

y=3:

a[3]=9, b[3]=5

9 >=5: custo +=5 -> custo=5

y=2:

a[2]=6, b[2]=8

6 <8: custo +=6 -> custo=11

y=1:

a[1]=3, b[1]=3

3 <3: False, so custo +=3 -> custo=14

Then, second loop from m-1 down to 0:

m=2, so max_p-1=1 down to 0:

y=1:

a[0]=7, b[1]=3

7 +3 =10 <= 3? No, so custo += b[1]=3 -> custo=17

y=0:

Since y==1, custo += a[0]=7 -> custo=24

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, dp[2]=14, dp[1]=25, minimal is 14.

But this code is giving 24, which still doesn't match the sample output of 14.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the indices.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed.

So, a=[7,3,6,9], a[0]=7, a[1]=3, a[2]=6, a[3]=9

b=[4,3,8,5], b[0]=4, b[1]=3, b[2]=8, b[3]=5

First loop: y from n-1=3 down to m-1=1

y=3:

a[3]=9, b[3]=5

9 >=5: custo +=5 -> custo=5

y=2:

a[2]=6, b[2]=8

6 <8: custo +=6 -> custo=11

y=1:

a[1]=3, b[1]=3

3 <3: False, so custo +=3 -> custo=14

Second loop: y from m-1=1 down to 0:

y=1:

a[y-1]=a[0]=7, b[y]=b[1]=3

7 +3 =10 <= 3? No, so custo += b[1]=3 -> custo=17

if y==1: custo += a[0]=7 -> custo=24

Then, print 24, which doesn't match the sample output of 14.

Wait, perhaps the code is different.

Looking back at the code:

for y in range(num_fila -1, max_p -1, -1):

if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:

custo += a_values[y]

else:

custo += b_values[y]

Then,

for y in range(max_p -1, 0, -1):

if a_values[y-1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:

custo += b_values[y]

if y ==1:

custo += a_values[0]

break

else:

custo += a_values[y]

break

In the second loop, there's a break statement after adding custo += b_values[y] if the condition is true, or adding custo += a_values[y] and breaking otherwise.

So, in the first test case:

After the first loop, custo=14

Then, second loop:

y=1:

a[0]+b[1]=7+3=10 <= a[1]=3? No, so custo += b[1]=3 -> custo=17

Since y==1, custo += a[0]=7 -> custo=24

But sample output is 14.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the code.

Wait, in the second loop, there's a break after adding a[0], but in the sample input, it's giving 14, which matches dp[2]=14.

Maybe the code is doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the code is only considering certain paths and not computing the minimal cost correctly.

Given that it doesn't match the sample input, it's likely incorrect.

But in the earlier analysis, my approach seems correct and matches the sample inputs.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
