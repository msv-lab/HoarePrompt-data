Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, right? So, if he cuts parallel to the width (a), he'll get two rectangles of size (a/2) by b, assuming a is even. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the height (b), he'll get two rectangles of size a by (b/2), again assuming b is even.

Wait, but the problem says "cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides." So, a and b are integers, and the cuts should result in integer dimensions. That means a and b have to be even for the cuts to be possible, right? No, wait, if a is even, he can cut it into two parts of a/2 by b each. Similarly for b.

But the problem allows cutting only if the resulting rectangles have integer sides. So, if a is odd, he can't cut it into two equal parts with integer sides, because a/2 would not be an integer. Similarly for b.

But actually, he can cut it into two parts, not necessarily equal. For example, if a is 3, he can cut it into 1 and 2. But wait, the problem says "cut into two rectangles with integer sides," which I think implies that the cut is straight and parallel to one side, so the parts are equal in that dimension.

Wait, the problem says: "cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle."

So, if he cuts parallel to the width (a), he'll get two rectangles of size (c) by b, where c is less than a, and c is an integer. Similarly, cutting parallel to the height (b) would give two rectangles of size a by d, where d is less than b and an integer.

But the way the problem is phrased, it seems like he's making one cut, resulting in two rectangles, both with integer sides.

But in the example, for 2x6, it's cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which are then rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.

So, the cut is such that both resulting rectangles have integer sides.

I need to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

Then, from these two pieces, see if they can be arranged (possibly rotated) to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

Also, remember that two rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

So, for example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, these two 2x3 rectangles can be arranged side by side to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6, since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6.

Another way to arrange them would be to stack them, forming a 2x6 rectangle again, which is the same as the original.

But since we're allowed to rotate and move the pieces, we consider the possible unique rectangle formations.

In the problem statement, it says that for 2x6, you can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

For 2x1, it says you can't form another rectangle because cutting it results in two 1x1 squares, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as 2x1.

So, in this case, you can't get a different rectangle.

I need to generalize this for any a and b.

Let's think about the possible cuts:

1. Cut parallel to the width (a):

- Choose a position c (1 <= c < a), and get two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Both c and a - c must be positive integers.

2. Cut parallel to the height (b):

- Choose a position d (1 <= d < b), and get two rectangles: a x d and a x (b - d).

- Both d and b - d must be positive integers.

Then, from these two pieces, see if they can be arranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

Also, remember that rotating the pieces is allowed.

I need to check for each possible cut whether the two resulting pieces can be used to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

But checking all possible cuts seems inefficient, especially since a and b can be up to 10^9.

There must be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical relationship.

Looking back at the example:

- For 2x6:

- Cut into two 2x3 rectangles.

- Arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

- For 2x1:

- Cut into two 1x1 rectangles.

- Arrange them to form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- For 3x2:

- Cut into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, this isn't possible.

Wait, but the problem states that the cuts result in integer sides, so a and b must be divisible by the cut positions.

Wait, no, the cuts are made such that the resulting rectangles have integer sides, so the cut positions must be integers.

Wait, a and b are already integers, and cuts are parallel to the sides, so c and d in the cuts must be integers as well.

Wait, but in the 3x2 example, if a=3 and b=2, can he cut it?

If he cuts parallel to a, he can choose c=1 or c=2.

- c=1: two rectangles 1x2 and 2x2.

- Can these be arranged to form a new rectangle?

- Arrange them side by side: 1x2 and 2x2 don't directly form a rectangle, unless rotated.

- If rotate the 1x2 to 2x1, then you have a 2x1 and a 2x2.

- These can be arranged to form a 2x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

- Wait, but 2x3 is the same as 3x2 under rotation.

- So, in this case, it's considered the same.

- Wait, but the sample input says for 3 2, the answer is "Yes".

- So, there must be another way to cut and arrange.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps cutting differently.

If a=3, b=2.

Cut parallel to b:

- Choose d=1: two rectangles 3x1 and 3x1.

- From these, arrange them side by side to form a 3x2, which is the same as original.

- Or stack them to form a 6x1, which is different from the original 3x2.

- So, in this case, 6x1 is different from 3x2, since 6x1 rotated is 1x6, which is not the same as 3x2.

- So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, the answer is "Yes".

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3x2 can be cut into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but sides must be integers, so that's invalid.

Wait, no, cuts must result in integer sides, so only integer cuts are allowed.

So, for a=3, b=2:

- Possible cuts:

- Parallel to a: c=1 or c=2.

- c=1: two rectangles 1x2 and 2x2.

- c=2: two rectangles 2x2 and 1x2 (same as above).

- Parallel to b: d=1.

- d=1: two rectangles 3x1 and 3x1.

So, from these pieces:

- From 1x2 and 2x2:

- Arrange them side by side: 1x2 and 2x2 don't form a rectangle directly.

- Rotate 1x2 to 2x1, then have 2x1 and 2x2, which can be arranged to form a 2x3 rectangle.

- But 2x3 is the same as 3x2 under rotation, so it's considered the same.

- From 3x1 and 3x1:

- Arrange them side by side to form a 3x2, which is the same as original.

- Or stack them to form a 6x1, which is different from 3x2.

- So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, "Yes".

Wait, but in the earlier thought process, I concluded that 2x3 is the same as 3x2, so it's not different.

But according to the sample input, for 3 2, the answer is "Yes", meaning he can form a different rectangle.

So, perhaps 6x1 is considered different from 3x2.

Because 6x1 rotated is 1x6, which is not the same as 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, "Yes".

Okay, so I need to consider all possible ways of arranging and rotating the pieces to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rotations by 90 degrees result in the same rectangle.

Now, to generalize this.

Given a rectangle a x b, I need to check if there exists a cut that results in two smaller rectangles, which can be arranged (possibly rotated) to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one under rotation.

First, I need to consider all possible cuts:

1. Cutting parallel to a:

- For each c from 1 to a-1, cut into c x b and (a - c) x b.

2. Cutting parallel to b:

- For each d from 1 to b-1, cut into a x d and a x (b - d).

Then, for each pair of resulting rectangles, check if they can be arranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one under rotation.

But checking for all possible c and d is not feasible for large a and b.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the area.

The total area is a * b.

After cutting and rearranging, the total area remains the same.

So, the new rectangle must have area a * b.

So, possible dimensions of the new rectangle are pairs (h, w) such that h * w = a * b, and h <= w without loss of generality.

But, two rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

So, for example, h x w and w x h are considered the same.

Hence, I need to consider unique pairs (h, w) where h <= w.

Now, the original rectangle is a x b.

If I can form a new rectangle with dimensions different from a x b (or b x a), then the answer is "Yes".

Otherwise, "No".

So, I need to check if there exists a way to arrange the two pieces to form a rectangle with h * w = a * b, and (h, w) != (a, b) and (h, w) != (b, a).

Now, given that I have two pieces, each with integer dimensions, and I can rotate them, I need to see if their combination can form such a rectangle.

Let me denote the two pieces as R1 and R2, with dimensions h1 x w1 and h2 x w2, respectively.

After rotation, their dimensions can be h1 x w1 or w1 x h1, similarly for R2.

Now, to form a new rectangle, I can arrange them either side by side or one above the other.

Case 1: Arranging side by side.

- Total height: max(h1, h2)

- Total width: w1 + w2

Case 2: Arranging one above the other.

- Total height: h1 + h2

- Total width: max(w1, w2)

In both cases, the total area is h1 * w1 + h2 * w2 = a * b.

But since h1 * w1 + h2 * w2 = a * b, and h1, h2, w1, w2 are integers, I need to see if there's a way to arrange them such that the resulting rectangle has dimensions different from a x b or b x a.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the possible cuts again.

If I cut parallel to a, into c x b and (a - c) x b.

Similarly, cutting parallel to b, into a x d and a x (b - d).

Now, for each pair of resulting rectangles, see if they can be arranged to form a new rectangle different from the original one.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the least common multiple or something related to the dimensions.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible perimeters or something else.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the possible new dimensions.

Let me consider that the new rectangle has dimensions h x w, where h * w = a * b, and h <= w.

If h != a and h != b, then it's a different rectangle.

So, I need to check if there's a way to arrange the two pieces to form such a rectangle.

Now, to form h x w, I need to have h as the height and w as the width.

Given that I have two pieces, each with integer dimensions, and I can rotate them, I need to see if their combination can match h x w.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the way I arrange the two pieces.

Case 1: Arranging side by side.

- Then, the total height is the maximum height of the two pieces, and the total width is the sum of their widths.

Case 2: Arranging one above the other.

- Then, the total width is the maximum width of the two pieces, and the total height is the sum of their heights.

In both cases, I need to ensure that the resulting rectangle has dimensions h x w, where h * w = a * b, and (h, w) != (a, b) and (h, w) != (b, a).

This still seems too broad.

Maybe I can look for a condition that makes it possible to form a different rectangle.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1 1: Cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, so "No".

- 2 1: Can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original, so "No".

- 2 6: Can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x3, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

- 3 2: As discussed, can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 6x1, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

- 2 2: Can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x4 or 2x2. 2x2 is the same as original, but 1x4 is different, so "Yes".

- 2 4: Can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x2 (same as 2x4) or 2x4, which is the same as original, or 1x8, if arranged differently? Wait, not sure.

Wait, for 2x4:

- Cut parallel to a (a=2):

- c=1: two 1x4 rectangles.

- Arrange side by side: 1x8.

- Arrange one above the other: 2x4.

- So, 1x8 is different from 2x4, so "Yes".

- Cut parallel to b (b=4):

- d=1: two 2x1 and 2x3.

- Arrange side by side: max height is 2, total width is 1 + 3 = 4 -> 2x4, same as original.

- Arrange one above the other: total height is 2 + 2 = 4, total width is max(1,3)=3 -> 4x3, which is different from 2x4, so "Yes".

So, in this case, "Yes".

- 6 3:

- Cut parallel to a (a=6):

- c=1: two 1x3 and 5x3.

- Arrange side by side: max height is 3, total width is 1 + 5 = 6 -> 3x6, same as original.

- Arrange one above the other: total height is 1 + 5 = 6, total width is max(3,3)=3 -> 6x3, same as original.

- c=2: two 2x3 and 4x3.

- Arrange side by side: max height is 3, total width is 2 + 4 = 6 -> 3x6, same as original.

- Arrange one above the other: total height is 2 + 4 = 6, total width is max(3,3)=3 -> 6x3, same as original.

- c=3: two 3x3 and 3x3.

- Arrange side by side: max height is 3, total width is 3 + 3 = 6 -> 3x6, same as original.

- Arrange one above the other: total height is 3 + 3 = 6, total width is max(3,3)=3 -> 6x3, same as original.

- Cut parallel to b (b=3):

- d=1: two 6x1 and 6x2.

- Arrange side by side: max height is 1, total width is 6 + 6 = 12 -> 1x12, which is different from 6x3.

- Arrange one above the other: total height is 6 + 6 = 12, total width is max(1,2)=2 -> 12x2, which is different from 6x3.

- So, in this case, "No" is given, but it seems like it's possible to form different rectangles.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 6 3, the output is "No".

But according to my reasoning, it seems possible to form 1x12 or 12x2, which are different from 6x3.

Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the pieces must be used entirely, without overlapping.

Also, perhaps the problem considers that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original one, not just being a rotation.

Wait, no, the problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.

So, in the case of 6x3 and 3x6, they are considered the same.

Similarly, 1x12 and 12x1 are considered the same.

Now, 1x12 and 6x3 are different because 1 != 3 and 12 != 6.

Hence, they are different rectangles.

But in the sample input, for 6 3, the answer is "No", which contradicts my earlier thought.

So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me check again.

If I cut the 6x3 rectangle parallel to b (height), d=1:

- Two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

Now, arranging them side by side: max height is 1, total width is 6 + 6 = 12 -> 1x12.

- But 1x12 is different from 6x3, so it should be "Yes".

Wait, but the sample input says "No".

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original rectangle's dimensions.

That is, not only that h != a or h != b, but also w != a and w != b.

In the case of 6x3:

- Original dimensions: 6 and 3.

- Possible new rectangle: 1x12.

- Here, 1 != 6 and 1 != 3, and 12 != 6 and 12 != 3, so it's different.

- Another possible new rectangle: 12x1, which is the same as 1x12.

- So, it should be "Yes".

But the sample input says "No".

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem is that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original rectangle's dimensions.

That is, neither h nor w should be equal to a or b.

In the case of 6x3:

- Possible new rectangle: 1x12.

-
