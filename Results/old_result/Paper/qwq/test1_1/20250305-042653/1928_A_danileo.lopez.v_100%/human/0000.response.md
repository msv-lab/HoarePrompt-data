Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. I need to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

First, I need to understand what it means to cut the rectangle. He can either cut parallel to the length or parallel to the width. So, if he cuts parallel to the length, he's dividing the width into two parts, and vice versa.

Let's consider an example. Take a 2x6 rectangle. If he cuts parallel to the length (let's say dividing the width), he could get two 2x3 rectangles. Then, from these two 2x3 rectangles, he can arrange them differently to form a new rectangle. For instance, placing them side by side to make a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

Another example is a 2x1 rectangle. If he cuts it into two 1x1 squares, then trying to arrange them differently, he can only make a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original 2x1 rectangle. So, in this case, he can't form a new distinct rectangle.

Okay, so the goal is to see if, after cutting, the two pieces can be rearranged to form a rectangle that isn't equivalent to the original one under rotation.

Let me think about the conditions under which this is possible.

First, for the cut:

- If he cuts parallel to the length (a), he divides the width (b) into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b.

- Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the width (b), he divides the length (a) into two parts, a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a.

Then, from these two pieces, he tries to form a new rectangle.

Given that the pieces can be rotated and moved, the new rectangle's dimensions will be determined by the combined dimensions of the two pieces.

Wait, but since the pieces are rectangles themselves, and they can be rotated, the new rectangle's dimensions will be the sum of their sides in some configuration.

But, to make a rectangle from two smaller rectangles, I need to consider how they are arranged.

Assuming he places them side by side, either along their lengths or widths.

Let's consider the possible configurations:

1. If he cuts parallel to the length (dividing width b into b1 and b2):

- Then the two pieces are a x b1 and a x b2.

- To form a new rectangle, he can place them side by side along the length:

- Either put them lengthwise, making a rectangle of length a and width (b1 + b2), which is the same as the original.

- Or put them widthwise, making a rectangle of length (b1 + b2) and width a, which is again the same as the original.

- Or, rotate one or both pieces.

Wait, but since they are both a x b1 and a x b2, rotating them would make them b1 x a and b2 x a.

If he places them side by side along the a side, he gets a rectangle of length (b1 + b2) x a, which is the same as the original.

If he places them along the b1 and b2 sides, he gets a rectangle of length max(b1, b2) x (a + a), which is max(b1, b2) x 2a.

But, for this to be a valid rectangle, b1 and b2 need to be such that max(b1, b2) x 2a is different from the original a x b.

But, since b1 + b2 = b, then max(b1, b2) x 2a could be different from a x b.

Wait, but if he cuts the width into b1 and b2, and then arranges them to form a rectangle of dimensions max(b1, b2) x 2a, then for this to be different from the original, max(b1, b2) x 2a should not be equal to a x b.

But, is this a valid configuration? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps, instead of thinking about the arrangements, I should think in terms of area and dimensions.

The original rectangle has area a * b.

After cutting into two smaller rectangles, the total area remains the same: a * b.

If Bob rearranges these two pieces to form a new rectangle, its area must still be a * b.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions such that its area is a * b, but its side lengths are different from the original rectangle's side lengths.

Wait, but considering rotations, if he forms a rectangle that is b x a, it's considered the same as a x b.

So, the new rectangle must have side lengths different from both a x b and b x a.

Hence, I need to check if it's possible to form a rectangle with area a * b, but with side lengths different from a and b.

Wait, but the side lengths would be determined by how he arranges the two pieces.

Let me consider that he has two rectangles, say c x d and e x f, with c * d + e * f = a * b.

But in this problem, since he's making one cut, the two pieces will have dimensions such that one dimension remains the same, and the other is divided.

So, if he cuts parallel to the length, he gets two rectangles of size a x b1 and a x b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the width, he gets two rectangles of size a1 x b and a2 x b, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, he can rotate these pieces, so the dimensions become b1 x a and b2 x a, or a x b1 and a x b2, depending on rotations.

Then, to form a new rectangle, he needs to arrange these two pieces side by side.

The possible ways to arrange them are:

1. Place them side by side along their a sides:

- This would give a new rectangle of size a x (b1 + b2), which is the same as the original a x b.

2. Place them side by side along their b1 and b2 sides:

- This would give a new rectangle of size (a + a) x b1 or b2, but that doesn't make sense because b1 and b2 are parts of b.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after cutting and rotating, he can arrange the two pieces in different configurations to form a new rectangle.

Given that, perhaps the key is to see if the original rectangle can be partitioned in such a way that the two pieces can be rearranged into a rectangle with different side lengths.

Let me consider the total area is a * b.

If he cuts the rectangle into two pieces, say p1 and p2, with areas a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a * b.

Then, to form a new rectangle, he needs to arrange p1 and p2 such that their combined shape forms a rectangle with area a * b, but with different side lengths from the original.

But, since p1 and p2 are both rectangles themselves, and can be rotated, the new rectangle's dimensions would be determined by the way they are arranged.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me look back at the examples provided.

In the first example, with a 2x6 rectangle:

- He cuts it into two 2x3 rectangles.

- Then, he can arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- Note that 4x3 is not the same as 2x6, and also not the same as 3x4, since rotations are considered the same.

In the second example, with a 2x1 rectangle:

- He cuts it into two 1x1 squares.

- Then, he can arrange them to form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original under rotation.

- Hence, no new rectangle is formed.

So, in the first case, he could form a new rectangle, and in the second case, he couldn't.

Looking for a pattern here.

Another example in the note: from a 3x2 rectangle, he can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles, and then arrange them to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Similarly, from a 2x2 square, he can cut it into two 1x2 rectangles and arrange them to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different.

From a 2x4 rectangle, he can do something to form a new rectangle, but I need to see what.

Wait, in the output, for 2x4, it's "Yes", meaning he can form a new rectangle.

And for 6x3, it's "No".

Wait, 6x3 is the same as 3x6, which might be why it's "No".

Wait, but 6x3 is the same as 3x6 under rotation.

Wait, but in the output, it's "No", so perhaps in that case, he can't form a new rectangle.

Wait, but earlier in the example, with 2x6, he could form a 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

Similarly, with 6x3, maybe he can't form a new rectangle that's different from 6x3 or 3x6.

Wait, but in the output, it's "No", so perhaps in that case, he can't.

Wait, but in the given output, for 6x3, it's "No".

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "obtain another rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time."

So, "Yes" means he can obtain another rectangle different from the original (considering rotations), and "No" means he can't.

Looking back at the examples:

- 1x1: "No"

- 2x1: "No"

- 2x6: "Yes"

- 3x2: "Yes"

- 2x2: "Yes"

- 2x4: "Yes"

- 6x3: "No"

So, I need to find a general condition based on a and b to decide "Yes" or "No".

Let me look for a pattern in these examples.

First, observe that for "Yes" cases:

- 2x6: cut into two 2x3, then arrange to form 4x3.

- 3x2: cut into two 3x1, then arrange to form 1x6.

- 2x2: cut into two 1x2, then arrange to form 1x4.

- 2x4: perhaps cut into two 2x2, then arrange to form 4x2, which is the same as 2x4, so maybe that's not the way.

Wait, for 2x4:

- If he cuts parallel to the length: cut the width into two parts.

- Say, cut the width of 4 into 2 and 2, so two 2x2 rectangles.

- Then, arranging them side by side along the length: 2x4, same as original.

- Arranging them along the width: 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 under rotation.

- So, seems like "No", but the output is "Yes", so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to cut.

- Instead of cutting the width into two equal parts, cut it differently.

- Say, cut the width of 4 into 1 and 3, so two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x3.

- Then, arranging them:

- Place 2x1 and 2x3 side by side along the length: 2x4, same as original.

- Place them along the width: 1+3=4 in one direction, and 2 in the other: 4x2, same as original.

- Or, rotate them.

- Rotate 2x1 to 1x2, and 2x3 to 3x2.

- Then, placing them side by side along the 1x2 and 3x2:

- If placed side by side along the 2 side: total length 1 + 3 = 4, width 2: 4x2, same as original.

- If placed side by side along the 1 and 3 sides: length max(1,3)=3, width 2+2=4: 3x4, which is different from 2x4.

Wait, but in the output, it's "Yes", meaning he can form a new rectangle different from the original.

So, in this case, from 2x4, by cutting into 2x1 and 2x3, then rotating them to 1x2 and 3x2, and arranging them to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, for 6x3:

- If he cuts parallel to the length:

- Cut the width of 3 into, say, 1 and 2: two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2.

- Then, arranging them:

- Side by side along the length: 6x3, same as original.

- Side by side along the width: 1+2=3 in one direction, and 6 in the other: 3x6, same as original.

- Rotating them: 6x1 becomes 1x6, and 6x2 becomes 2x6.

- Arranging them:

- Place 1x6 and 2x6 side by side along the 6 side: 1+2=3 in one direction, and 6 in the other: 3x6, same as original.

- Place them along the 1 and 2 sides: length max(1,2)=2, width 6+6=12: 2x12.

- But 2x12 is different from 6x3, so why is the output "No"?

Wait, but according to the problem, 6x3 should be "No", but according to this, he can form a 2x12 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps 2x12 is considered the same as 6x3 under some condition, but 2x12 and 6x3 are not the same, even considering rotations.

Wait, 2x12 and 6x3 are different because 2 and 12 are not proportional to 6 and 3.

Wait, 2:12 is 1:6, while 3:6 is 1:2, which are different ratios.

So, they are different rectangles.

But in the output, for 6x3, it's "No", meaning he can't form a new rectangle.

But according to this, he can form a 2x12 rectangle.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me check again.

If he has a 6x3 rectangle:

- Cuts parallel to the length, dividing the width into 1 and 2: two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2.

- Rotates them to 1x6 and 2x6.

- Arranges them side by side along the length: 1+2=3 x 6, which is 3x6, same as original.

- Arranges them along the width: max(1,2)=2 x 12, which is 2x12.

- 2x12 is different from 6x3.

But in the output, it's "No", so perhaps in the problem's context, 2x12 is considered the same as 6x3 under some condition, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe because 2x12 can be divided into 2x6 and 2x6, but that's not directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only rectangles where both sides are integers, and certain constraints based on the original dimensions.

I need to find a general condition.

Looking back at the examples:

- "Yes" when at least one of the dimensions is even.

- Wait, in 2x6: both even.

- 3x2: one even.

- 2x2: both even.

- 2x4: both even.

- 2x1: one even, but "No".

- 1x1: both odd, "No".

- 6x3: one even, but "No" according to output.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, for 2x1, it's "No", which matches the output.

But for 6x3, according to my earlier thought, it should be "Yes", but the output is "No".

So, perhaps my condition is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's about whether both dimensions are even or not.

Wait, in 2x6, both even: "Yes".

In 3x2, one even: "Yes".

In 2x2, both even: "Yes".

In 2x4, both even: "Yes".

In 6x3, one even: "No".

In 2x1, one even: "No".

In 1x1, both odd: "No".

So, it seems that if at least one dimension is even, it's "Yes", except in cases like 2x1 and 6x3, where one is even and the other is odd, but "No".

Wait, but in 3x2, one is even, one is odd: "Yes".

In 2x2, both even: "Yes".

In 2x4, both even: "Yes".

In 2x6, both even: "Yes".

In 6x3, one even, one odd: "No".

In 2x1, one even, one odd: "No".

In 1x1, both odd: "No".

So, perhaps the condition is that if both dimensions are odd, then "No", and if at least one is even, then "Yes", except in cases where one is even and the other is odd, and some specific conditions.

Wait, but in 3x2, one even, one odd: "Yes".

In 2x1, one even, one odd: "No".

In 6x3, one even, one odd: "No".

Wait, inconsistency here.

So, perhaps it's not just about the parity of the dimensions.

Let me think differently.

Maybe it's about whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions is 1 or greater than 1.

In 2x6: GCD is 2, "Yes".

In 3x2: GCD is 1, "Yes".

In 2x2: GCD is 2, "Yes".

In 2x4: GCD is 2, "Yes".

In 6x3: GCD is 3, "No".

In 2x1: GCD is 1, "No".

In 1x1: GCD is 1, "No".

So, when GCD is 1, it's "No" only if both dimensions are 1 or if it's 2x1, but not consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the area is even or odd.

In 2x6: area 12, even: "Yes".

In 3x2: area 6, even: "Yes".

In 2x2: area 4, even: "Yes".

In 2x4: area 8, even: "Yes".

In 6x3: area 18, even, but "No".

In 2x1: area 2, even: "No".

In 1x1: area 1, odd: "No".

So, even area doesn't guarantee "Yes".

Hence, that's not the condition.

Wait, maybe it's about whether the rectangle can be tiled into smaller rectangles in a way that allows forming a new rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a rectangle with different side lengths.

Given that, perhaps the condition is whether the original rectangle has at least one side that is divisible by 2.

Wait, but in 2x1, 2 is divisible by 2, but the output is "No".

Similarly, in 6x3, 6 is divisible by 2, but output is "No".

Wait, perhaps it's about whether both sides are divisible by 2.

In 2x6: both are divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 3x2: only one is divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 2x2: both are divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 2x4: both are divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 6x3: one is divisible by 2: "No".

In 2x1: one is divisible by 2: "No".

In 1x1: neither is divisible by 2: "No".

Wait, but in 3x2, one is divisible by 2, and it's "Yes".

While in 6x3, one is divisible by 2, and it's "No".

So, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the smaller dimension divides the larger one.

In 2x6: 2 divides 6: "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 divides 3? No, but output is "Yes".

Wait, no, 3 divides 2? No.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the rectangle can be cut into two equal parts.

Wait, but in 2x6, cutting into two 2x3: "Yes".

In 3x2, cutting into two 3x1: "Yes".

In 2x2, cutting into two 1x2: "Yes".

In 2x4, cutting into two 2x2: "Yes".

In 6x3, cutting into two 3x3: but 3x3 can't be arranged to form a new rectangle different from 6x3.

Wait, 3x3 arranged side by side: 3x6, same as original.

Or, placed one above the other: 6x3, same as original.

So, in this case, "No".

In 2x1, cutting into two 1x1: arranging them side by side: 1x2, same as original.

So, "No".

In 1x1, can't be cut: "No".

Hence, perhaps the condition is that after cutting into two parts, the two parts can be arranged to form a rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one under rotation.

In other words, the new rectangle's dimensions are not equal to the original dimensions or their rotation.

So, to generalize, perhaps it's about whether the original rectangle can be partitioned into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different side lengths.

Given that, perhaps the condition is that at least one of the sides is even, and the rectangle is not a square with odd sides.

Wait, but in 2x1, one side is even, but it's "No".

Wait, maybe it's that both sides are even, or one side is even and greater than 2.

But in 2x1, one side is even, but it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's that the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and their combined dimensions can form a new rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one.

Given that, perhaps the condition is that the original rectangle is not a square with side length 1, and at least one side is greater than 1 and even.

Wait, but in 3x2, one side is even, and it's "Yes".

In 2x1, one side is even, but it's "No".

So, perhaps it's that at least one side is even and the other side is greater than 1.

In 3x2: one side even (2), other side greater than 1 (3): "Yes".

In 2x1: one side even (2), other side 1: "No".

In 6x3: one side even (6), other side greater than 1 (3): "No".

Wait, inconsistency again.

So, perhaps it's that at least one side is even and the other side is not a multiple of the first side.

Wait, in 2x6: 2 is even, 6 is a multiple of 2, "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 2: "Yes".

In 2x1: 2 is even, 1 is not a multiple of 2: "No".

In 6x3: 6 is even, 3 is a multiple of 6: wait, 3 is a multiple of 6? No, 6 is a multiple of 3.

Wait, perhaps it's that at least one side is even and the other side is not a multiple of it.

In 2x6: 2 is even, 6 is a multiple of 2: "Yes".

Wait, no, in this case, it's "Yes", but according to this condition, it should be "No" if one side is a multiple of the other.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite: at least one side is even and the other side is a multiple of it.

Wait, in 2x6: 2 is even, 6 is a multiple of 2: "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 2: "Yes".

Wait, no, in 3x2, it's "Yes", but according to this condition, it should be "Yes" only if the other side is a multiple.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the condition is that the product of the two sides is even, and the sides are not both odd.

But in 2x1, product is 2, even, but output is "No".

In 6x3, product is 18, even, but output is "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the rectangle can be tiled into smaller rectangles in a way that allows rearrangement into a different rectangle.

In other words, whether the rectangle can be partitioned into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different configuration.

Given that, perhaps the key is that the original rectangle has at least one side that is divisible by 2, and the other side is not 1.

In 2x6: 2 is even, and 6 >1: "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 is even, and 3 >1: "Yes".

In 2x2: both even: "Yes".

In 2x4: both even: "Yes".

In 6x3: 6 is even, but 3 >1: "No".

Wait, but in the output, it's "No".

So, perhaps in addition, the side that is even must be greater than 2.

But in 2x1, 2 >1, but "No".

Wait, perhaps it's that the even side must be greater than 2, and the other side is greater than 1.

In 2x6: 2 >1, 6 >1: "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 >1, 3 >1: "Yes".

In 2x1: 2 >1, but 1 <=1: "No".

In 6x3: 6 >1, 3 >1: "No".

Wait, still inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that the even side is not divisible by the odd side.

In 2x6: 2 is even, but 2 is divisible by 1 (not applicable here).

Wait, no.

In 2x6: 6 is divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 3x2: 3 is not divisible by 2: "Yes".

In 2x1: 1 is not divisible by 2: "No".

In 6x3: 6 is divisible by 3: "No".

So, perhaps it's that at least one side is even, and that side is not divisible by the other side.

In 2x6: 2 is even, and 2 is not divisible by 6: "Yes".

Wait, 2 is divisible by 6? No, 6 is divisible by 2.

Wait, 2 divides 6, but 6 divided by 2 is 3, which is integer.

Wait, perhaps it's that the even side does not divide the other side.

In 2x6: 2 divides 6: "Yes".

Wait, but in the output, it's "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 does not divide 3: "Yes".

In 2x1: 2 divides 1? No, 1 divided by 2 is 0.5: "No".

In 6x3: 6 divides 3? No, 3 divided by 6 is 0.5: "No".

So, perhaps it's that at least one side is even, and that side does not divide the other side.

Wait, but in 2x6, 2 is even, and 2 divides 6, but output is "Yes".

Wait, maybe it's that at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it.

Wait, in 2x6: 2 is even, and 6 is a multiple of 2: "Yes".

Wait, no, in the earlier thought, it's "Yes" only if the even side does not divide the other side.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse it.

Wait, perhaps it's that at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it.

In 2x6: 2 is even, 6 is a multiple of 2: "Yes".

In 3x2: 2 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 2: "Yes".

In 2x1: 2 is even, 1 is not a multiple of 2: "No".

In 6x3: 6 is even, 3 is a multiple of 6: "No".

Wait, but 3 is not a multiple of 6, 6 is a multiple of 3.

Wait, perhaps it's that at least one side is even, and the other side is not a multiple of it.

Wait, in 6x3: 6 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 6: "No".

Wait, but according to this condition, it should be "Yes" if at least one side is even and the other side is not a multiple of it.

But in 6x3, 6 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 6, but output is "No".

So, this condition doesn't hold.

I'm getting confused here.

Maybe I need to look for a mathematical relationship between a and b.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two pieces have dimensions that allow forming a new rectangle with different side lengths.

Suppose he cuts the rectangle into two parts with dimensions p x q and r x s.

Then, to form a new rectangle, he needs to arrange these two pieces such that their combined area forms a rectangle with different side lengths.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach: think in terms of possible cuts and arrangements.

If he cuts parallel to the length, dividing the width into b1 and b2, then the two pieces are a x b1 and a x b2.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the width, dividing the length into a1 and a2, the two pieces are a1 x b and a2 x b.

Then, he can rotate these pieces, so a x b1 can become b1 x a, and a1 x b can become b x a1.

Now, to form a new rectangle, he needs to arrange these two pieces side by side.

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

1. Placing them side by side along their a sides:

- This would give a new rectangle of a x (b1 + b2), which is the same as a x b, which is the original.

- Similarly, if he places them along the b sides, he gets (a1 + a2) x b, which is a x b, same as original.

2. Placing them along different sides:

- For example, place one piece with dimension a x b1 and the other a x b2 side by side along their b1 and b2 sides.

- This would give a new rectangle of (a + a) x max(b1, b2), which is 2a x max(b1, b2).

- For this to be different from the original, 2a x max(b1, b2) should not be equal to a x b or b x a.

- So, 2a x max(b1, b2) != a x b and 2a x max(b1, b2) != b x a.

- Since b1 + b2 = b, and max(b1, b2) >= b/2.

- So, 2a x max(b1, b2) >= a x b.

- If max(b1, b2) > b/2, then 2a x max(b1, b2) > a x b.

- Hence, it's different from a x b, so it's a new rectangle.

- But, in the case where b1 = b2 = b/2, then 2a x (b/2) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- So, in this case, it's not a new rectangle.

- Therefore, if b is even, and b1 = b2 = b/2, then it's not a new rectangle.

- Otherwise, if b1 != b2, then it's a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the example with 2x6, cutting into 2x3 and 2x3, arranging them side by side along the a side gives 2x6, same as original.

Arranging them along the b side gives 4x3, which is different.

So, in this case, it's a "Yes".

Hence, even if b1 =
