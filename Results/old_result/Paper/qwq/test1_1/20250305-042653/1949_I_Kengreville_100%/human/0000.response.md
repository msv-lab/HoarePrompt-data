Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the problem is about disks in a plane. Each disk has a center with integer coordinates and a positive integer radius. The disks don't overlap in area, but they can be tangent to each other. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of these disks in such a way that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

2. No two disks overlap in area.

3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And the new radii can be any positive real numbers, but the centers stay fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. So, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. If they don't overlap in area, it means the distance between their centers is at least the sum of their radii, so they are either tangent or separated.

Now, the problem allows changing the radii, but tangent disks must remain tangent. That means if two disks were tangent before, their new radii must still satisfy that the sum of their new radii equals the distance between their centers.

Moreover, no two disks should overlap after changing the radii, meaning that for any two disks that weren't tangent before, the sum of their new radii should be less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

And, of course, the sum of all radii should strictly decrease.

This seems like a constraints problem where I have to adjust variables (radii) subject to certain conditions.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, let's consider the constraints:

- For tangent disks i and j: r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij}, where d_{ij} is the distance between centers of i and j.

- For non-tangent disks i and j: r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij}.

And we want to minimize the sum of r_i'.

Wait, actually, we just need to make the sum strictly less than the original sum, but it's not necessarily a minimization problem.

But perhaps I can think of it as: is there a feasible solution where the sum of r_i' is less than the sum of r_i, while satisfying the constraints?

Let me see.

First, I need to identify which disks are tangent to each other. I can calculate the distance between each pair of disks and see if it equals (r_i + r_j)^2.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems they are doing exactly that:

for j in range(n):

dx = x[i] - x[j]

dy = y[i] - y[j]

if (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:

This checks if disks i and j are tangent.

So, the code is building some kind of graph where disks are nodes, and tangent relationships are edges.

Then, it's performing a DFS on this graph, assigning coefficients to each node and checking some conditions.

I need to understand what this DFS is doing.

It seems like it's trying to assign coefficients to the nodes such that adjacent nodes have opposite coefficients.

This is similar to checking if the graph is bipartite.

In a bipartite graph, nodes can be divided into two sets where no two nodes in the same set are adjacent.

Here, assigning coefficients 1 and -1 seems like a way to color the graph in two colors.

So, coef[j] = -coef[i]

And checking bipartite = bipartite and coef[j] == -coef[i]

Wait, but in the code, it's checking coef[j] == -coef[i] when encountering a already visited node.

This is to ensure that the graph is bipartite.

If the graph is not bipartite, bipartite is set to False.

Also, it's accumulating tot += coef[i] for each node.

Then, after DFS, it checks if bipartite and tot != 0, and sets ok = ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)

Finally, if ok is True, it prints 'YES', else 'NO'

So, it seems like the code is checking if the tangent graph is bipartite and if the sum of coefficients is not zero.

But I need to understand why this relates to the problem.

Let me think about the properties required.

We need to adjust radii such that:

- Tangent disks remain tangent: r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij} for tangent pairs.

- Non-tangent disks don't overlap: r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij} for non-tangent pairs.

- Sum of r_i' < sum of r_i.

I recall that in such problems, it's useful to consider the differences in radii.

Wait, perhaps considering adjusting radii by some factor.

But that might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the system of equations for tangent pairs and inequalities for non-tangent pairs.

This seems complex.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose there are no tangent disks. Then, I can just decrease all radii proportionally, say by a factor of (1 - epsilon), where epsilon is a small positive number. This would strictly decrease the sum of radii, and since the disks weren't overlapping before, they won't overlap after scaling.

But in this problem, disks can be tangent, and I need to maintain tangency.

So, in that case, I cannot just scale all radii uniformly, because that would break the tangency condition.

Wait, if two disks are tangent, and I scale both radii by the same factor, then r_i' + r_j' = factor * (r_i + r_j) = factor * d_{ij}, which is less than d_{ij} if factor < 1. So, they would no longer be tangent.

Therefore, for tangent disks, I cannot scale their radii uniformly; I need to adjust them in such a way that their sum remains equal to d_{ij}.

So, for each tangent pair, I have the constraint r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij}.

For non-tangent pairs, I have r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij}.

And I want sum r_i' < sum r_i.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the tangent constraints as equalities and the non-tangent ones as inequalities.

So, perhaps I can set up a system of equations and inequalities and see if there's a solution where the sum decreases.

This seems like a linear programming problem, but maybe there's a smarter way to handle it given the constraints.

Let me consider the tangent graph: nodes are disks, edges are tangent relationships.

If this graph is a tree, then maybe I can set the radii accordingly.

But the code is checking for bipartiteness, so perhaps that's the key.

In a bipartite graph, I can divide the nodes into two sets such that no two nodes in the same set are adjacent.

So, perhaps I can adjust the radii by increasing radii in one set and decreasing in the other, while maintaining the tangent conditions.

Wait, but I need to decrease the sum of radii, so maybe decreasing radii in one set and adjusting the other set accordingly.

But I need to ensure that non-tangent disks don't overlap.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the code.

It's performing a DFS on the tangent graph, assigning coefficients 1 and -1 to nodes, checking if the graph is bipartite.

Then, it's accumulating tot += coef[i], which is either +1 or -1 for each node.

Finally, it checks if the graph is bipartite and tot != 0.

If any connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero tot, then ok is True, and it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, 'NO'.

I need to understand why this works.

Let me consider what tot represents.

If the graph is bipartite, I can divide nodes into two sets, say A and B.

Then, tot is the difference between the number of nodes in A and B.

If tot != 0, it means that one set has more nodes than the other.

Now, perhaps the idea is to increase radii in one set and decrease in the other, while maintaining the tangent conditions.

But I need to ensure that the sum decreases.

Wait, if I have more nodes in set A, and I decrease their radii, while increasing the radii in set B, but in such a way that the sum still decreases.

But I also need to satisfy the non-tangent constraints: r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij} for non-tangent pairs.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

From the explanation, it's possible to decrease the radii of the first and third disk by 0.5 and increase the second disk's radius by 0.5, resulting in a decrease of the total sum by 0.5.

So, in this case, it's adjusting radii in such a way that for tangent pairs, the sum remains equal to the distance.

Wait, but in this example, which disks are tangent?

Looking at the positions:

Disk 1: (0,2), r=1

Disk 2: (0,0), r=1

Distance between 1 and 2: sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2, which equals r1 + r2 = 2, so they are tangent.

Disk 3: (4,-3), r=4

Distance from 1 to 3: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (-3-2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41), which is approximately 6.403, while r1 + r3 = 5, so not tangent.

Distance from 2 to 3: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5, which equals r2 + r3 = 1 + 4 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 4: (11,0), r=3

Distance from 1 to 4: sqrt((11-0)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18, r1 + r4 = 4

Distance from 2 to 4: sqrt((11-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11, r2 + r4 = 4

Distance from 3 to 4: sqrt((11-4)^2 + (0 - (-3))^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.615, r3 + r4 = 7

So, only disks 1-2 and 2-3 are tangent.

So, the tangent graph has edges between 1-2 and 2-3.

This is a path of length 2, which is bipartite.

In this case, tot would be the difference between the number of nodes in set A and B.

If we assign set A to nodes 1 and 3, and set B to node 2, then tot = 1 (for 1) -1 (for 2) +1 (for 3) = 1, which is non-zero.

Hence, ok is True, and it prints 'YES', which matches the sample output.

Now, consider the second sample input:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

From the explanation, it's impossible to change radii as desired.

Let's see the tangent relationships.

Disk 1: (2,2), r=2

Disk 2: (7,2), r=3

Distance: sqrt((7-2)^2 + (2-2)^2) = 5, which equals r1 + r2 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 3: (7,7), r=2

Distance from 2 to 3: sqrt((7-7)^2 + (7-2)^2) = 5, which equals r2 + r3 = 5, so tangent.

Disk 4: (2,7), r=3

Distance from 1 to 4: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (7-2)^2) = 5, which equals r1 + r4 = 5, so tangent.

Distance from 3 to 4: sqrt((2-7)^2 + (7-7)^2) = 5, which equals r3 + r4 = 5, so tangent.

So, the tangent graph is a cycle: 1-2-3-4-1.

This is a cycle of length 4, which is bipartite.

If we assign set A to nodes 1 and 3, and set B to nodes 2 and 4, then tot = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0.

Hence, bipartite is True, but tot = 0, so ok remains False.

Therefore, it prints 'NO', which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if bipartite and tot != 0.

In this case, bipartite is True, but tot == 0, so ok remains False.

Hence, 'NO'.

Now, let's consider another example.

Suppose we have three disks forming a triangle, all tangent to each other.

So, disk 1 tangent to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1.

This forms a cycle of length 3, which is not bipartite.

In this case, the DFS would set bipartite to False.

Hence, ok would be False, and it would print 'NO'.

Is this correct?

In such a case, it's impossible to adjust radii to decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.

Because the system of equations is too rigid.

So, perhaps the code is correct in this regard.

Now, let's consider a tree structure.

For example, a line of disks tangent in sequence: 1-2-3-4.

This is a tree, which is bipartite.

Assign set A to 1 and 3, set B to 2 and 4.

tot = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0.

So, ok remains False.

Wait, but in the first sample, tot was 1, and it was 'YES'.

In the second sample, tot was 0, and it was 'NO'.

So, perhaps having tot != 0 is necessary for 'YES'.

Wait, but in the first sample, tot was 1, and it was 'YES'.

In the second sample, tot was 0, and it was 'NO'.

So, it seems that if any connected component has tot != 0 and is bipartite, then 'YES', else 'NO'.

But why?

Let me think in terms of adjusting radii.

Suppose the tangent graph is bipartite, and in a connected component, the difference in the number of nodes in the two sets is non-zero.

Then, I can increase radii in one set and decrease in the other, while maintaining the tangent conditions, and achieve a decrease in the sum.

How?

Let's say set A has more nodes than set B.

Then, I can decrease the radii of set A disks by some epsilon, and increase the radii of set B disks by epsilon, while maintaining the tangent conditions.

Since set A has more nodes, the total sum would decrease.

Wait, but in the tangent constraints, if I decrease r_i in set A and increase r_j in set B, I need to ensure that r_i' + r_j' remains equal to d_{ij}.

If I decrease r_i by epsilon and increase r_j by epsilon, then r_i' + r_j' = (r_i - epsilon) + (r_j + epsilon) = r_i + r_j = d_{ij}, so the tangent condition is maintained.

And if set A has more nodes than set B, then the total sum would decrease.

Sum r_i' = sum_{A} (r_i - epsilon) + sum_{B} (r_j + epsilon) = sum r_i + (|B| - |A|) * epsilon

If |A| > |B|, then |B| - |A| < 0, so sum r_i' = sum r_i + negative value, which is less than sum r_i.

Hence, the sum decreases.

Similarly, if |B| > |A|, I can choose to decrease radii in set B and increase in set A, achieving the same effect.

Therefore, if the connected component is bipartite and |A| != |B|, then it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

Otherwise, if |A| == |B|, then sum r_i' = sum r_i, which does not strictly decrease the sum.

Hence, in that case, it's not possible.

Also, if the graph is not bipartite, then it's not possible to assign coefficients in this way without violating the tangent constraints.

Therefore, the code's approach seems correct.

It checks for each connected component if it's bipartite and if |A| != |B|.

If any component satisfies these conditions, then it's possible to decrease the sum, so it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, 'NO'.

This makes sense based on the reasoning above.

Hence, I believe the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
