Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the problem is about disks in a plane. Each disk has its center at integer coordinates and has a positive integer radius. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent to each other.

2. I need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of these disks in such a way that:

   a. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent after the change.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area after the change.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And the new radii can be any positive real numbers, not necessarily integers, and the centers stay fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. So, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.

Now, the problem allows me to change the radii, but I have to maintain tangency where it existed before. That means if two disks were tangent, after changing the radii, they should still be tangent. Also, no two disks should overlap in a way that their intersection has positive area; they can still be tangent, though.

Additionally, I need to make sure that the sum of all radii decreases.

Okay, so how can I approach this?

I think graph theory might be useful here. I can model the disks as nodes in a graph, and connect two nodes with an edge if their disks are tangent.

Given that, the problem transforms into: Can I adjust the radii (which correspond to some kind of weights on the nodes) such that the constraints of tangency are maintained, no overlaps occur, and the total sum of radii decreases.

Wait, but in graph terms, maintaining tangency means that for edges (i,j), the sum of radii r_i + r_j should equal the distance between centers d_i_j.

And for no overlapping, for non-adjacent nodes, r_i + r_j should be less than or equal to d_i_j.

But the problem allows for non-adjacent nodes to have r_i + r_j less than or equal to d_i_j, which means they don't overlap.

So, the challenge is to find a set of radii that satisfy all these constraints and also have a strictly smaller sum.

I need to see if there's a way to adjust the radii while keeping the tangencies and avoiding overlaps, and decreasing the total sum.

Hmm.

Maybe I can think of the current radii as one possible solution, and see if there's another solution where the sum is smaller.

But how?

Let me consider the constraints more carefully.

For tangent disks (i,j):

r_i + r_j = d_i_j

For non-tangent disks (i,j):

r_i + r_j <= d_i_j

And all r_i > 0.

I need to find another set of r_i's that satisfy all these constraints, with sum(r_i) < current sum(r_i).

Is this possible?

Well, it depends on the structure of the graph.

If the graph is such that there are multiple connected components, maybe I can adjust the radii in one component without affecting others.

But more interesting is when there are cycles in the graph.

Wait, let's consider that.

If there's a cycle in the graph, meaning a sequence of disks where each is tangent to the next, and the last is tangent to the first, then there might be some dependencies that allow or prevent me from decreasing the sum.

Let me think about a simple cycle of three disks, forming a triangle.

Suppose I have three disks A, B, and C, each tangent to the other two.

So, r_A + r_B = d_AB

r_B + r_C = d_BC

r_C + r_A = d_CA

These are three equations with three variables.

I can solve for r_A, r_B, and r_C.

Specifically, adding all three equations:

2(r_A + r_B + r_C) = d_AB + d_BC + d_CA

So, r_A + r_B + r_C = (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2

This is the minimal sum of radii that satisfies the tangency conditions.

If the current sum of radii is larger than this, then I can adjust the radii to this minimal sum, thus decreasing the total sum.

But if the current sum is already equal to this minimal sum, then I cannot decrease it further without violating the tangency conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the minimal sum is achieved when the disks are tangent but do not overlap more than that.

So, in this scenario, if the current radii are already at this minimal sum, then I cannot decrease the sum further without violating the tangency or causing overlaps.

But if the current radii sum is larger than this minimal sum, then I can adjust the radii to achieve this smaller sum.

So, for a triangle (cycle of length 3), it's possible to decrease the sum if the current sum is larger than the minimal sum.

Now, what if there are cycles of even length?

Wait, in graph theory, bipartite graphs are graphs without odd-length cycles.

So, if the graph is bipartite, it has no odd-length cycles.

In such a case, maybe the minimal sum is achievable, and any adjustment would either keep the sum the same or increase it.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider the graph where nodes are disks, and edges represent tangency.

Then, the constraints are:

For each edge (i,j): r_i + r_j = d_i_j

For non-edges (i,j): r_i + r_j <= d_i_j

I need to find if there's a solution to these inequalities with sum(r_i) < current sum(r_i).

I can think of the equalities as forming a system of linear equations.

The inequalities are constraints that must be satisfied.

So, first, solving the system of equations given by the tangencies.

Then, ensuring that the inequalities hold.

Finally, checking if the sum can be decreased.

Let me consider the system of equations from the tangencies.

This is a system of linear equations in the variables r_i.

I can represent it as A * r = b, where A is a matrix based on the graph's structure, r is the vector of radii, and b is based on the distances d_i_j.

The solution space of this system is affine.

I need to find if there exists a point in this affine space where the inequalities hold and the sum is strictly less than the current sum.

This seems complex.

Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider the graph's structure.

If the graph is a tree, meaning it's connected without cycles, then the system of equations has a unique solution up to scaling.

Wait, actually, for a tree, the system would have a unique solution for the radii, given one radius is fixed.

But in this problem, all radii are positive, and the distances are fixed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the graph's structure in terms of its cycles.

Specifically, its cycles correspond to constraints that must be satisfied.

In particular, for cycles of odd length, there might be dependencies that allow adjusting the radii.

Wait, perhaps considering the graph's bipartiteness is key here.

I recall that in bipartite graphs, certain properties hold that might be useful here.

Let me consider that.

Suppose the graph is bipartite.

Then, it has no odd-length cycles.

In such a case, maybe the minimal sum of radii is achievable, and any adjustment would not allow decreasing the sum further without violating the tangency or overlap conditions.

On the other hand, if the graph has an odd-length cycle, perhaps there is some flexibility to adjust the radii and decrease the sum.

Wait, going back to the earlier example with a triangle (cycle of length 3), which is not bipartite, I saw that it's possible to adjust the radii to achieve a smaller sum if the current sum is larger than the minimal sum.

Similarly, for a bipartite graph, maybe the sum is already at its minimal, and cannot be decreased without violating the constraints.

Is that the case?

Let me test this idea.

Consider a bipartite graph, say a square (cycle of length 4).

Letâ€™s label the nodes A, B, C, D, connected in a cycle.

So, A is connected to B and D, B is connected to A and C, C is connected to B and D, D is connected to A and C.

The constraints are:

r_A + r_B = d_AB

r_B + r_C = d_BC

r_C + r_D = d_CD

r_D + r_A = d_DA

I need to solve this system.

Let me add equations 1 and 3:

r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = d_AB + d_CD

Similarly, add equations 2 and 4:

r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = d_BC + d_DA

Therefore, d_AB + d_CD = d_BC + d_DA

This is a necessary condition for the system to have a solution.

Assuming this condition holds, then the system has solutions.

Now, can I adjust the radii to decrease the sum?

Let's see.

From equation 1: r_B = d_AB - r_A

From equation 4: r_D = d_DA - r_A

From equation 2: r_C = d_BC - r_B = d_BC - (d_AB - r_A) = d_BC - d_AB + r_A

From equation 3: r_C = d_CD - r_D = d_CD - (d_DA - r_A) = d_CD - d_DA + r_A

Therefore, d_BC - d_AB + r_A = d_CD - d_DA + r_A

Which simplifies to d_BC - d_AB = d_CD - d_DA

Which is the same as d_AB + d_CD = d_BC + d_DA, which is the condition we already have.

So, the system is consistent, and I can express all radii in terms of r_A.

For example:

r_B = d_AB - r_A

r_D = d_DA - r_A

r_C = d_BC - r_B = d_BC - (d_AB - r_A) = d_BC - d_AB + r_A

Now, to ensure that all radii are positive, I need:

r_A > 0

r_B = d_AB - r_A > 0 => r_A < d_AB

r_D = d_DA - r_A > 0 => r_A < d_DA

r_C = d_BC - d_AB + r_A > 0 => r_A > d_AB - d_BC

So, r_A must satisfy:

max(0, d_AB - d_BC) < r_A < min(d_AB, d_DA)

Assuming that d_AB - d_BC < d_AB and d_DA, which should hold if the distances make sense.

Now, the sum of radii is:

r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = r_A + (d_AB - r_A) + (d_BC - d_AB + r_A) + (d_DA - r_A) = d_AB - r_A + d_BC - d_AB + r_A + d_DA - r_A + r_A = d_BC + d_DA - r_A

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, let's recalculate:

r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = r_A + (d_AB - r_A) + (d_BC - d_AB + r_A) + (d_DA - r_A)

= r_A + d_AB - r_A + d_BC - d_AB + r_A + d_DA - r_A

= (r_A - r_A) + d_AB - d_AB + d_BC + d_DA + r_A - r_A

= d_BC + d_DA

So, the sum is d_BC + d_DA, which is constant, assuming the distances are fixed.

Therefore, in this case, the sum of radii is fixed by the distances, and I cannot adjust the radii to decrease the sum; it's already at its minimal possible value.

This suggests that in bipartite graphs, the sum of radii is fixed, and I cannot decrease it further without violating the constraints.

On the other hand, in non-bipartite graphs (like the triangle), I can adjust the radii to achieve a smaller sum, as I saw earlier.

Therefore, it seems that if the graph is bipartite, I cannot decrease the sum of radii without violating the constraints, whereas if it's not bipartite, I can.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Take a cycle of length 3 (triangle).

As before, r_A + r_B = d_AB

r_B + r_C = d_BC

r_C + r_A = d_CA

Adding all three: 2(r_A + r_B + r_C) = d_AB + d_BC + d_CA

So, r_A + r_B + r_C = (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2

This is the minimal sum of radii that satisfies the tangency conditions.

If the current sum is larger than this, I can adjust the radii to achieve this smaller sum.

So, in this case, the sum is not fixed; it can be adjusted down to this minimal value.

Therefore, in non-bipartite graphs, there is flexibility to adjust the radii and decrease the sum, provided that the current sum is larger than the minimal sum.

In bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed, and I cannot decrease it further without violating the constraints.

Therefore, the problem reduces to checking if the graph is bipartite.

If the graph is bipartite, then the sum is fixed, and I can only decrease it if the current sum is larger than the minimal sum, which seems unlikely given the problem's constraints.

Wait, but in the bipartite case, is the sum fixed?

In the square example, the sum was fixed to d_BC + d_DA.

Is this always the case in bipartite graphs?

Let me consider a bipartite graph with more components.

Suppose I have a bipartite graph with two connected components, each being a square.

In each square, the sum of radii is fixed as d_BC + d_DA for that square.

Therefore, the total sum is the sum of these minimal sums for each component.

So, in bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed per connected component.

Now, in non-bipartite graphs, like a triangle, the sum is also fixed per connected component, but with a different formula.

Wait, but in the triangle, the sum is (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2.

Is this fixed?

Well, it's determined by the distances, so yes, it's fixed.

But in that case, in both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed per connected component.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, but in the triangle (non-bipartite), if the current sum is larger than (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2, I can adjust the radii to achieve that smaller sum.

But in the square (bipartite), the sum is fixed at d_BC + d_DA.

Wait, but perhaps in bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed, whereas in non-bipartite graphs, there is some flexibility.

But in the triangle, the sum is also fixed at (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps in bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed, and in non-bipartite graphs, there might be some flexibility to adjust the sum.

But in the triangle, the sum is also fixed.

Wait, maybe it's about the existence of odd cycles.

In bipartite graphs, there are no odd cycles, and in non-bipartite graphs, there are odd cycles.

In non-bipartite graphs, there might be multiple connected components, some bipartite, some not.

Wait, perhaps the key is to check if the graph is bipartite.

If the graph is bipartite, then the sum is fixed, and I cannot decrease it further without violating the constraints.

If the graph is not bipartite, then there might be some flexibility to adjust the sum.

But in the triangle example, the sum is fixed at (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2.

So, perhaps in non-bipartite graphs, the sum is not necessarily fixed, and I can adjust it as long as the tangency conditions are maintained.

Wait, but in the triangle, the sum is fixed by the tangency conditions.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the rank of the system of equations.

In the triangle, there are three equations and three variables, so the system is determined, and the sum is fixed.

In the square, there are four variables and four equations, but due to the cycle, the system might be dependent, and the sum is still fixed.

So, perhaps in general, for connected components, the sum is fixed by the tangency conditions.

Therefore, I cannot decrease the sum without violating the tangency or overlap conditions.

Therefore, the answer should always be "NO", because the sum is already at its minimal possible value given the tangency constraints.

But the sample input suggests that sometimes it's possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, in the first sample input, the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum.

But according to my current understanding, the sum should be fixed.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the first sample input.

Input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Assuming these are the centers and radii of the disks.

The output is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency where it existed and not causing overlaps.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the sum should be fixed by the tangency conditions.

So, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Maybe the sum is not necessarily fixed, and there is some flexibility in adjusting the radii.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is fixed in some components but not in others.

Wait, maybe if there are multiple connected components, I can adjust the radii within each component independently.

But in the first sample, there are multiple components, and perhaps in some components, I can decrease the sum.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider two separate components.

Suppose I have two separate disks that don't interact with each other.

In this case, I can independently adjust the radii of each disk, as long as they don't overlap with any other disk, which they don't anyway.

So, in this case, I can decrease the radii of both disks, as long as they remain positive and don't start overlapping with each other, which they won't since they are separate.

Therefore, in this case, it's possible to decrease the sum of radii.

But wait, the problem states that disks can be tangent to each other, but not overlap in a region of positive area.

So, if two disks are not tangent, they can have r_i + r_j < d_i_j, meaning they don't touch.

In such a case, I can decrease r_i and r_j as long as r_i + r_j <= d_i_j.

If they are not tangent, I can make r_i + r_j strictly less than d_i_j.

If they are tangent, I must have r_i + r_j = d_i_j.

So, in components where there are no tangencies, I can decrease the radii as much as I want, as long as r_i > 0.

In components where there are tangencies, the radii are constrained by the tangency conditions.

Therefore, in components with no tangencies, I can decrease the radii and decrease the sum.

In components with tangencies, the sum is fixed by the tangency conditions.

Therefore, if there are components with no tangencies, I can decrease the radii in those components and decrease the total sum.

In components with tangencies, I cannot decrease the sum further without violating the tangency conditions.

Therefore, the overall sum can be decreased if there are components with no tangencies.

Wait, but in the first sample input, there are tangent disks, and the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum.

So, perhaps my reasoning is still incomplete.

Let me consider that in some components with tangencies, there might still be some flexibility to adjust the radii and decrease the sum.

Perhaps when the graph is not bipartite, there is some flexibility.

Wait, going back to the triangle (cycle of length 3), which is not bipartite, I saw that the sum is fixed at (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2.

So, in that case, the sum is fixed.

Similarly, in a square (cycle of length 4), which is bipartite, the sum is fixed at d_BC + d_DA.

So, in both cases, the sum is fixed.

But in the first sample input, there are multiple components, some with tangencies and some without.

Perhaps in components without tangencies, I can decrease the radii.

But in components with tangencies, the sum is fixed.

Therefore, if there are components without tangencies, I can decrease the radii in those components and decrease the total sum.

In components with tangencies, I cannot decrease the sum further.

Therefore, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one component without tangencies, where I can decrease the radii.

Otherwise, it's "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample input, there are tangent disks, so some components have tangencies.

But the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum.

So, perhaps there are components without tangencies where I can decrease the radii.

Wait, but in the first sample input, all disks are connected through tangencies.

Let me visualize the first sample.

Disk 1: (0,2), r=1

Disk 2: (0,0), r=1

Disk 3: (4,-3), r=4

Disk 4: (11,0), r=3

Disk 5: (11,5), r=2

Let me calculate the distances between centers:

Between 1 and 2: distance is sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

Since r1 + r2 = 1 + 1 = 2, they are tangent.

Between 2 and 3: distance is sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0+3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

r2 + r3 = 1 + 4 = 5, so they are tangent.

Between 3 and 4: distance is sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58)

r3 + r4 = 4 + 3 = 7

But sqrt(58) â‰ˆ 7.615, which is greater than 7, so they are not tangent.

Between 4 and 5: distance is sqrt((11-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = 5

r4 + r5 = 3 + 2 = 5, so they are tangent.

Between 1 and 3: distance is sqrt((0-4)^2 + (2+3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41)

r1 + r3 = 1 + 4 = 5

sqrt(41) â‰ˆ 6.403, which is greater than 5, so not tangent.

Between 1 and 4: distance is sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) â‰ˆ 11.180

r1 + r4 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is less than 11.180, so not tangent.

Between 1 and 5: distance is sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) â‰ˆ 11.402

r1 + r5 = 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 11.402, so not tangent.

Between 2 and 4: distance is sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

r2 + r4 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is less than 11, so not tangent.

Between 2 and 5: distance is sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) â‰ˆ 12.083

r2 + r5 = 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 12.083, so not tangent.

Between 3 and 5: distance is sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-5)^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) â‰ˆ 10.630

r3 + r5 = 4 + 2 = 6, which is less than 10.630, so not tangent.

So, the tangent pairs are:

1-2, 2-3, 4-5

Therefore, the graph has two connected components:

Component 1: disks 1,2,3 (connected through 1-2 and 2-3)

Component 2: disks 4,5 (connected through 4-5)

Now, in component 1, there are two tangencies: 1-2 and 2-3.

In component 2, there is one tangency: 4-5.

Now, in component 1, it's a path of length 2 (1-2-3).

Is this bipartite? A path is always bipartite.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in bipartite graphs, the sum is fixed.

But in this case, the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's about the structure of the component.

Let me consider component 1: disks 1,2,3 with tangencies 1-2 and 2-3.

So, r1 + r2 = d12 = 2

r2 + r3 = d23 = 5

From these, I can express r1 and r3 in terms of r2:

r1 = 2 - r2

r3 = 5 - r2

Then, the sum is r1 + r2 + r3 = (2 - r2) + r2 + (5 - r2) = 7 - r2

To minimize the sum, I need to maximize r2.

But r2 must be positive, and r1 and r3 must be positive.

So, r2 < 2 (from r1 > 0) and r2 < 5 (from r3 > 0), and r2 > 0.

Therefore, 0 < r2 < 2

So, the minimal sum is 7 - 2 = 5, achieved when r2 approaches 2.

But the current sum is r1 + r2 + r3 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, I can decrease the sum down to 5 by increasing r2 to approach 2, which allows r1 and r3 to approach 0.

But in the problem, radii must be positive, so I can get arbitrarily close to 5 but not reach it.

But since the new radii can be arbitrary positive real numbers, I can make the sum arbitrarily close to 5.

Similarly, in component 2: disks 4 and 5, with r4 + r5 = 5

Sum is r4 + r5 = 5, which is fixed.

Therefore, the total sum can be decreased from 6 + 5 = 11 to approximately 5 + 5 = 10, which is a decrease.

Hence, "YES"

So, in this case, even though component 1 is bipartite, I could decrease the sum by adjusting the radii in that component.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in bipartite components, the sum is fixed.

But in this example, it seems that in component 1, which is a path (bipartite), I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Let me think again.

In component 1:

r1 + r2 = 2

r2 + r3 = 5

Then, sum = r1 + r2 + r3 = (2 - r2) + r2 + (5 - r2) = 7 - r2

To minimize sum, maximize r2.

r2 can be up to 2 (but not including 2, since r1 > 0)

So, sum can be made arbitrarily close to 5.

Similarly, in component 2, sum is fixed at 5.

Therefore, total sum can be made arbitrarily close to 10, which is less than the original sum of 11.

Hence, "YES"

So, in this case, even though the component is bipartite, I could decrease the sum.

Therefore, my earlier assumption that in bipartite components the sum is fixed is incorrect.

So, perhaps the condition is different.

Let me consider another example.

Take a square (cycle of length 4), which is bipartite.

Letâ€™s label nodes A, B, C, D.

Constraints:

r_A + r_B = d_AB

r_B + r_C = d_BC

r_C + r_D = d_CD

r_D + r_A = d_DA

As before, sum = d_BC + d_DA

So, in this case, the sum is fixed.

Therefore, in this component, I cannot decrease the sum.

But in the path (component 1 in the first sample), I could decrease the sum.

So, perhaps in trees (acyclic connected graphs), I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum, whereas in cycles, the sum is fixed.

Is that the case?

Let me check.

In component 1 of the first sample, which is a path (a tree), I could decrease the sum.

In component 2, which is a single edge (also a tree), the sum is fixed.

Wait, no, in component 2, it's a single edge, and sum is fixed.

Wait, but in component 1, I could decrease the sum.

Wait, but in component 2, with only one edge, sum is fixed at r4 + r5 = 5.

So, I cannot decrease it further.

But in component 1, which is a path of length 2, I could decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of edges versus nodes.

In component 1, there are 3 nodes and 2 edges.

In component 2, there are 2 nodes and 1 edge.

In general, for a connected component with n nodes and m edges:

If m = n - 1, it's a tree, and perhaps I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

If m = n, it's a cycle, and the sum is fixed.

Wait, but in component 1, m = 2, n = 3, m = n - 1, and I could decrease the sum.

In component 2, m = 1, n = 2, m = n - 1, but I couldn't decrease the sum.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of cycles in the component.

Wait, in component 1, there are no cycles, so I can adjust the radii.

In component 2, it's a single edge, no cycle, but I cannot decrease the sum.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of independent cycles.

In component 1, no cycles, so I can adjust.

In component 2, no cycles, but sum is fixed.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of nodes and edges in the component.

Wait, in component 1, n=3, m=2, and I could decrease the sum.

In component 2, n=2, m=1, sum is fixed.

So, perhaps in components with n >=3 and m = n -1, I can decrease the sum, whereas in components with n=2 and m=1, sum is fixed.

Is that the case?

Wait, but in component 1, n=3, m=2, sum is not fixed, can be decreased.

In component 2, n=2, m=1, sum is fixed.

So, perhaps in components with n >=3 and m = n -1, I can decrease the sum.

But in a cycle of length 3 (n=3, m=3), sum is fixed.

Wait, but in component 1, m = n -1, and it's not a cycle, it's a tree, and I can decrease the sum.

In a cycle, m = n, and sum is fixed.

So, perhaps in acyclic components (trees), I can decrease the sum, whereas in cyclic components, the sum is fixed.

In component 2, it's a tree with n=2, m=1, sum is fixed.

Wait, but why?

Wait, maybe in trees where n >=3, I can decrease the sum, whereas in trees with n=2, sum is fixed.

Is that the case?

In component 1, n=3, can decrease sum.

In component 2, n=2, sum is fixed.

So, perhaps in components with n >=3, I can decrease the sum, whereas in components with n=1 or n=2, the sum is fixed.

Wait, but for n=1, there are no tangencies, so I can decrease the radius as much as I want, as long as r_i > 0.

But in n=2 with one tangency, sum is fixed.

Therefore, in components with n >=3, I can decrease the sum, whereas in components with n=1 or n=2, sum is either adjustable (for n=1) or fixed (for n=2).

But in n=1, I can decrease the radius, but in n=2 with tangency, sum is fixed.

So, perhaps in components with more than one edge, the sum is fixed, whereas in components with only one node or one edge, I can adjust the sum.

Wait, but in component 1, which has n=3 and m=2, I could decrease the sum.

So, perhaps only in components that are trees with at least three nodes, I can decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps it's about the existence of a unique cycle.

But in component 1, there are no cycles, so it's a tree.

In component 2, it's a tree with n=2, m=1.

So, maybe in trees with n >=3, I can decrease the sum, whereas in trees with n=2, sum is fixed.

Therefore, in the overall graph, if there exists at least one component that is a tree with n >=3, then I can decrease the sum.

Otherwise, if all components are either trees with n=1 or n=2, or have cycles, then I cannot decrease the sum.

But in the first sample, there is a component with n=3, m=2 (a tree), and a component with n=2, m=1 (a tree).

In the n=3 component, I can decrease the sum, so overall, I can decrease the sum.

In the second sample, which is a square (n=4, m=4, a cycle), the sum is fixed, so I cannot decrease it.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with n >=3, otherwise "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample, one component is a tree with n=3, m=2, and the other is a tree with n=2, m=1.

In the second sample, it's a cycle of n=4, m=4.

So, according to this, the first sample allows decreasing the sum, and the second does not.

Which matches the sample outputs.

Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with at least three nodes, then "YES", else "NO".

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose I have four disks forming a tree: A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D.

So, n=4, m=3.

In this case, I should be able to decrease the sum.

Let's see.

For A-B: r_A + r_B = d_AB

B-C: r_B + r_C = d_BC

C-D: r_C + r_D = d_CD

Expressing in terms of r_B:

r_A = d_AB - r_B

r_C = d_BC - r_B

r_D = d_CD - r_C = d_CD - (d_BC - r_B) = d_CD - d_BC + r_B

Sum: r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = (d_AB - r_B) + r_B + (d_BC - r_B) + (d_CD - d_BC + r_B) = d_AB + d_CD

So, sum = d_AB + d_CD, which is fixed.

Wait, so in this tree with n=4, m=3, the sum is fixed.

Therefore, I cannot decrease it.

But according to my earlier hypothesis, I should be able to decrease the sum in trees with n >=3.

But in this case, the sum is fixed.

So, perhaps my hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, in the first sample's component 1, with n=3, m=2, sum = 7 - r2, which can be decreased by increasing r2.

But in this n=4, m=3, sum = d_AB + d_CD, which seems fixed.

Wait, perhaps only in trees with n=3 and m=2, I can adjust the sum, but not in larger trees.

So, perhaps only in components with n=3 and m=2, I can adjust the sum.

In components with n >=4 and m = n-1, sum is fixed.

Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with exactly three nodes, then "YES", else "NO".

In the first sample, there is one component with n=3, m=2, so "YES".

In the second sample, it's a cycle of n=4, m=4, sum is fixed, so "NO".

In the n=4 tree with n=4, m=3, sum is fixed, so "NO".

Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with exactly three nodes, then "YES", else "NO".

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, but in the first sample, even if I could decrease the sum in the n=3 component, but in the n=2 component, sum is fixed, so overall, can I decrease the total sum?

Yes, because the n=3 component's sum can be decreased, while the n=2 component's sum remains fixed.

Hence, total sum can be decreased.

In the second sample, it's a single component with n=4, m=4, sum is fixed, so cannot decrease.

In the n=4 tree with n=4, m=3, sum is fixed, so "NO".

Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with exactly three nodes, then "YES", else "NO".

But I need to make sure that in such components, I can indeed decrease the sum.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose I have four disks: A connected to B, B connected to C, and C connected to D, but also D connected back to A, forming a cycle.

In this case, n=4, m=4, which is a cycle, sum is fixed.

If I remove one edge, say D connected to A, then it's a tree with n=4, m=3, sum is fixed.

But according to my earlier reasoning, in trees with n >=3, sum is fixed unless n=3 and m=2.

Wait, but in the first sample's component 1, n=3, m=2, sum is not fixed.

In n=4, m=3, sum is fixed.

So, perhaps only in trees with n=3 and m=2, sum is not fixed, and I can decrease the sum.

In all other cases, sum is fixed.

Therefore, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one connected component that is a tree with exactly three nodes, else "NO".

Hence, I need to find if there exists a connected component that is a tree with exactly three nodes.

To implement this, I need to build the graph based on tangencies, find connected components, and check if any component is a tree with exactly three nodes.

But how do I check if a component is a tree with exactly three nodes?

Well, a tree with three nodes has exactly two edges.

So, in the component, if the number of nodes is three and the number of edges is two, then it's a tree with three nodes.

Therefore, in the graph, I need to check if there exists a connected component with exactly three nodes and two edges.

If such a component exists, then "YES", else "NO".

This seems manageable.

I can build the graph, find connected components, and for each component, check if it has exactly three nodes and two edges.

If any component satisfies this condition, then "YES", else "NO".

But in the first sample, there is one component with n=3, m=2, and another with n=2, m=1.

Hence, "YES"

In the second sample, it's a single component with n=4, m=4, which is not a tree with three nodes, so "NO"

Another example: n=4, m=3, forming a tree, which is not a tree with three nodes, so "NO"

Another example: n=3, m=2, which is a tree with three nodes, "YES"

n=2, m=1, "NO"

n=1, m=0, I can decrease the radius, but according to the condition, I need components with three nodes and two edges.

Wait, but in n=1, m=0, I can decrease the radius, so perhaps I need to consider that case separately.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, in components with n=1, I can decrease the radius, but in n=2, m=1, sum is fixed.

But according to the condition, "YES" only if there exists a component with n=3 and m=2.

But in n=1, I can decrease the radius, so perhaps it's "YES" if there exists a component with n=1 or a component with n=3 and m=2.

Wait, but in n=1, I can decrease the radius, but in n=2, m=1, sum is fixed.

In n=3, m=2, sum can be decreased.

Therefore, "YES" if there exists a component with n=1 or a component with n=3 and m=2.

But in n=1, I can decrease the radius arbitrarily, but in the problem, radii must be positive real numbers, so I can make it arbitrarily small but not zero.

But the sum can be made arbitrarily small.

Hence, if there exists at least one component with n=1 or a component with n=3 and m=2, then "YES", else "NO"

But in the first sample, there is a component with n=3 and m=2, so "YES"

In the second sample, it's a single component with n=4 and m=4, which is neither n=1 nor n=3 with m=2, so "NO"

Another example: n=4, m=3, forming a tree, which is n >=3, but m = n-1, which is a tree, but n !=3, so "NO"

Wait, but earlier I saw that in n=3, m=2, sum can be decreased, but in n=
