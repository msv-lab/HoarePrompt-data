Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Jay created a problem of difficulty x and wants to make it the second problem for a Codeforces round. But Yash is worried that this might make the contest unbalanced, so he decides to break this problem into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of these sub-problems should be equal to x.

Now, the coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of all the sub-problems. Yash wants to choose the difficulties of these sub-problems in such a way that this balance is maximized.

Okay, so I need to find the maximum possible GCD given x and n.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if all sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of some number d, then d is a candidate for the GCD.

Wait, but they don't all have to be multiples of d; they have to be such that d is the GCD of all of them. So, d should divide each of the sub-problems' difficulties.

Let me think differently. Suppose I choose all sub-problems to have the same difficulty, say d. Then, the sum would be n*d, which should equal x. So, d = x/n, but x might not be divisible by n. Hmm.

Actually, d needs to be such that n*d <= x, but not necessarily equal to x. Wait, no, the sum has to be exactly x.

So, if I have n sub-problems, each of difficulty at least 1, and their sum is x, and I want to maximize the GCD of their difficulties.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first example from the input:

10 3

Possible ways to split 10 into 3 positive integers:

- 1,1,8 GCD is 1

- 1,2,7 GCD is 1

- 1,3,6 GCD is 1

- 1,4,5 GCD is 1

- 2,2,6 GCD is 2

- 2,3,5 GCD is 1

- 2,4,4 GCD is 2

- 3,3,4 GCD is 1

- etc.

From these, the maximum GCD is 2.

Another example:

5 5

Possible ways:

- 1,1,1,1,1 GCD is 1

- There are no other ways since n=5 and x=5, so all must be 1.

So, GCD is 1.

Third example:

420 69

I don't want to list all possibilities here, but the answer is 6.

So, I need a general method to find the maximum possible GCD d for given x and n.

Let me think about properties of GCD.

If the GCD is d, then each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of d.

So, if I denote the difficulties as d*a1, d*a2, ..., d*an, where a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers and pairwise coprime (since d is the GCD).

Wait, no, a1, a2, ..., an just need to be positive integers, but their GCD is 1 because if they had a common divisor greater than 1, then the GCD of the difficulties would be greater than d.

Wait, actually, since d is the GCD, the a1, a2, ..., an should be such that their GCD is 1.

But for maximizing d, I need to find the largest d such that d divides x, and x - n*d is divisible by d.

Wait, let's see.

Since the sum of difficulties is x, and each difficulty is at least d, the minimal sum is n*d. The remaining x - n*d should be distributed among the sub-problems in multiples of d, but since d is the GCD, the remaining part should be divisible by d.

So, x - n*d must be divisible by d.

Wait, x is equal to d*(a1 + a2 + ... + an), where a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers with GCD 1.

So, x must be divisible by d.

Also, since a1 + a2 + ... + an = x/d, and a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers with GCD 1, x/d must be at least n, because each ai is at least 1.

So, x/d >= n, which implies d <= x/n.

So, d can be at most floor(x/n).

But in the first example, x=10, n=3, floor(10/3)=3, but the maximum d is 2, which is less than 3.

Wait, why is that?

Because if d=3, then x/d=10/3â‰ˆ3.333, which is not an integer, so d=3 is not possible.

Wait, no, in integer division, x/d should be an integer only if x is divisible by d.

Wait, no, x/d should be the sum of a1 to an, which must be an integer.

Wait, a1 + a2 + ... + an = x/d, and ai are positive integers with GCD 1.

So, x/d must be an integer greater than or equal to n.

So, d must be a divisor of x, and x/d >= n.

Therefore, d must be a divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

So, to maximize d, I need to find the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but in the first example, x=10, n=3, floor(10/3)=3.

Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.

Among these, 1,2 <=3.

So, d can be 1 or 2.

From the example, d=2 is achievable.

Similarly, for x=5, n=5, floor(5/5)=1.

Divisors of 5 are 1,5.

Only 1 <=1, so d=1.

For x=420, n=69, floor(420/69)=6.

Divisors of 420 that are <=6 are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Among these, d=6 is achievable.

So, it seems that the maximum d is the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but in the first example, d=2 is less than floor(x/n)=3, but d=3 is not a divisor of x=10.

Hence, d=2 is the largest possible.

So, the approach is:

- Compute floor(x/n), let's call it max_d.

- Find the largest divisor of x that is <= max_d.

- That will be the maximum possible d.

So, to implement this, I need to:

- For each test case, read x and n.

- Compute max_d = floor(x/n).

- Find all divisors of x.

- Select the largest divisor that is <= max_d.

- Print that divisor.

Now, to find all divisors of x efficiently, especially since x can be up to 10^8, I need an efficient way to find divisors.

I know that finding all divisors of a number up to 10^8 can be time-consuming if not done efficiently, especially since t can be up to 10^3.

So, I need an optimized way.

I recall that the number of divisors of a number is usually small, especially for numbers up to 10^8.

I think the maximum number of divisors for numbers up to 10^8 is around 100 or so.

So, if I can find all divisors of x in O(sqrt(x)) time, and since x is up to 10^8, sqrt(x) is up to 10^4, which is acceptable.

But t=10^3, so total time would be around 10^7 operations, which should be fine.

But in the given code, it seems like they are trying to do something similar.

Let me look at the provided program.

The program is:

from math import sqrt

def func():

for q in range(int(input())):

(x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

ans = 1

for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:

ans = max(ans, i)

if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

ans = max(ans, x // i)

print(ans)

So, it's reading t, then for each test case, reading x and n.

Then, it initializes ans=1.

Then, it loops i from 1 to sqrt(x), checks if i is a divisor of x.

If it is, it checks two conditions:

1. x - n*i >=0 and (x - n*i) % i ==0, and updates ans if true.

2. x - n*(x//i) >=0 and x//i >0 and (x - n*(x//i)) % (x//i) ==0, and updates ans if true.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, I need to understand why it's doing this.

First, it's iterating i from 1 to sqrt(x), checking if i is a divisor of x.

Then, for each divisor i, it's checking if x - n*i >=0 and (x - n*i) % i ==0.

Similarly, it's checking for x//i.

I need to understand what these conditions mean.

From earlier reasoning, I know that d should be a divisor of x, and x/d >=n.

Also, x - n*d should be divisible by d.

Wait, x - n*d should be divisible by d.

But x is divisible by d, since d is a divisor of x.

So, x - n*d is divisible by d only if n*d is divisible by d, which it always is, since d divides d.

Wait, n*d is always divisible by d.

So, x - n*d is divisible by d only if x is divisible by d, which it is, since d is a divisor of x.

So, this condition is always true when d is a divisor of x.

But in the code, it's checking (x - n*i) % i ==0.

Given that i is a divisor of x, x % i ==0, so (x - n*i) % i == (0 - 0) % i ==0, which is always true.

Similarly, for x//i, it's checking (x - n*(x//i)) % (x//i) ==0.

Again, since x is divisible by x//i, x - n*(x//i) is divisible by x//i.

So, these conditions are always true when i is a divisor of x.

Therefore, the code is essentially finding the maximum divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Wait, but in the first example, x=10, n=3, floor(x/n)=3.

Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.

Among these, 1 and 2 are <=3.

So, ans=2.

Which matches the expected output.

Similarly, for x=5, n=5, floor(x/n)=1.

Divisors of 5 are 1,5.

Only 1 <=1.

So, ans=1.

For x=420, n=69, floor(x/n)=6.

Divisors of 420 <=6 are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, ans=6.

Which matches the sample output.

So, it seems correct.

But why is the code checking both i and x//i?

Because for each i that is a divisor of x, x//i is also a divisor of x.

So, by checking both, it ensures that it considers all divisors.

But in the loop, i goes from 1 to sqrt(x), inclusive.

So, for each i, it checks if i is a divisor.

If yes, it checks if i <= floor(x/n), and updates ans if necessary.

Similarly, it checks x//i, as long as x//i >0 and x - n*(x//i) >=0.

Wait, but x//i can be equal to i if x is a perfect square and i is sqrt(x).

So, to avoid duplicates, perhaps it needs to handle that case.

But in the code, it's checking both i and x//i separately.

I think to make it efficient, it's checking both to cover all divisors without having to collect all divisors first.

This way, it can directly compute the maximum d on the fly.

I think this is an optimized way to find the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x/n).

Hence, the program seems correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the balance (GCD) of a problemset consisting of `n` sub-problems derived from a problem of difficulty `x`. 

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to split `x` into `n` positive integers such that their sum is `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of these `n` integers.
   - Our goal is to maximize this GCD.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the GCD of the `n` sub-problems is `d`, then each sub-problem's difficulty must be a multiple of `d`.
   - Hence, `d` must be a divisor of `x`.
   - Additionally, since there are `n` sub-problems, `d` must be such that `x - n*d >= 0` and `(x - n*d)` is divisible by `d`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Find all divisors of `x`.
   - Select the largest divisor `d` that is less than or equal to `floor(x/n)` and satisfies the condition `(x - n*d) % d == 0`.

4. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Iterate through possible divisors from `1` to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, check if it satisfies the conditions.
   - Also, consider the corresponding divisor `x // i`.

## Solution Code

```python
from math import isqrt

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        max_d = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                # Check for divisor i
                if i <= max_d and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                # Check for divisor x // i
                if x // i != i and x // i <= max_d and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `x` and `n`.

- **Divisor Calculation**:
  - Compute `max_d` as `x // n`.
  - Initialize `ans` to 1.
  - Iterate from `1` to `sqrt(x)`:
    - If `i` is a divisor of `x`:
      - Check if `i <= max_d` and `(x - n*i) % i == 0`. If so, update `ans`.
      - Check the corresponding divisor `x // i` (if different from `i`):
        - If `x // i <= max_d` and `(x - n*(x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, update `ans`.

- **Output**:
  - Print the maximum possible GCD `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest possible GCD by leveraging the properties of divisors and the constraints provided.
