Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output:

2

So, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I have to choose two numbers, take the smaller one, and that's my score. So, if I pick 2 and 3, min(2,3)=2, which matches the output.

Another example:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

Output:

2

Here, n=2, so I have to perform two moves. I need to pair the numbers in a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

One way to do this is to pair 1 and 1, which gives min(1,1)=1, and then pair 2 and 1, which gives min(2,1)=1, totaling 2.

Is there a better way? If I pair 1 and 2 first, min(1,2)=1, and then pair 1 and 1, min(1,1)=1, totaling 2 again. So, it seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score.

But let's see another pairing: what if I pair 1 and 1 first, getting 1, and then pair 2 and 1, getting 1 again, total 2. Same result.

So, in this case, it doesn't matter how I pair them; the score is the same. But is that always the case?

Looking at the third test case:

Input:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

3

Here, n=3, and all numbers are 1. So, pairing any two will give min=1 each time, and doing this three times will give a total score of 3.

This seems straightforward when all numbers are the same. But what if they are different?

Let's consider another example not provided in the problem. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.

If I pair 1 and 2, get min=1, and pair 3 and 4, get min=3, total score=4.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 3, get min=1, and pair 2 and 4, get min=2, total score=3.

Or, pair 1 and 4, get min=1, and pair 2 and 3, get min=2, total score=3.

So, the first pairing gives the highest score of 4.

Another way: pair 2 and 4, get min=2, and pair 1 and 3, get min=1, total still 3.

Wait, why does pairing 1 and 2 first give a lower score than pairing 3 and 4?

Wait, no, in the first approach, pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, and 3 and 4 gives 3, total 4.

But is there a way to get a higher score? Let's see.

If I pair 1 and 3, get min=1, then pair 2 and 4, get min=2, total 3.

Or pair 1 and 4, get min=1, pair 2 and 3, get min=2, total 3.

Or pair 2 and 3, get min=2, pair 1 and 4, get min=1, total 3.

So, the highest I can get is 4 by pairing 1 and 2, and 3 and 4.

Is there a general strategy here?

It seems like pairing smaller numbers together and larger numbers together gives a better score.

Wait, in the first example, pairing 1 and 1 gives 1, and pairing 2 and 1 gives 1, total 2.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, and pairing 1 and 1 gives 1, total 2.

So, same score.

In the second example, pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, and pairing 3 and 4 gives 3, total 4.

Pairing 1 and 3 gives 1, pairing 2 and 4 gives 2, total 3.

So, pairing smaller numbers together and larger numbers together gives a better score.

Wait, in this case, pairing the two smallest together and the two largest together gives a better score.

But in the previous example, it didn't matter.

Let me think about this.

I need to maximize the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

I think the optimal strategy is to sort the list in non-decreasing order and pair the numbers in order.

Wait, in the second example, if I sort the list: 1,1,1,2.

Pairing the smallest two first: 1 and 1, min=1, then 1 and 2, min=1, total 2.

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 1 first, min=1, then 1 and 2, min=1, total 2.

Same as the original pairing.

In the other example I made, with 1,2,3,4:

Sort the list: 1,2,3,4.

Pair 1 and 2, min=1, pair 3 and 4, min=3, total 4.

Which is the highest I could get.

Another way: pair 1 and 3, min=1, pair 2 and 4, min=2, total 3.

So, sorting and pairing in order gives a higher score.

So, maybe the strategy is to sort the list in non-decreasing order and pair the first two, then the next two, and so on.

Let me test this with another example.

Suppose n=3, and the list is 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sort: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pair 1 and 2, min=1.

Pair 3 and 4, min=3.

Pair 5 and 6, min=5.

Total score: 1+3+5=9.

Is there a better way?

Alternative pairing: pair 1 and 3, min=1.

Pair 2 and 5, min=2.

Pair 4 and 6, min=4.

Total score: 1+2+4=7, which is less than 9.

Another pairing: pair 1 and 4, min=1.

Pair 2 and 6, min=2.

Pair 3 and 5, min=3.

Total score: 1+2+3=6, which is less than 9.

Another pairing: pair 1 and 5, min=1.

Pair 2 and 4, min=2.

Pair 3 and 6, min=3.

Total score: 1+2+3=6, same as before.

So, the sorted pairing gives the highest score.

Another example: n=3, list=2,2,2,2,2,2.

Sort: 2,2,2,2,2,2.

Pair 2 and 2, min=2.

Pair 2 and 2, min=2.

Pair 2 and 2, min=2.

Total score: 6.

Which is obvious, as all numbers are the same.

Another example: n=4, list=1,3,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Sort: 1,3,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Pair 1 and 3, min=1.

Pair 3 and 4, min=3.

Pair 5 and 6, min=5.

Pair 7 and 8, min=7.

Total score: 1+3+5+7=16.

Is there a better way?

Alternative pairing: pair 1 and 5, min=1.

Pair 3 and 3, min=3.

Pair 4 and 7, min=4.

Pair 6 and 8, min=6.

Total score: 1+3+4+6=14, which is less than 16.

Another pairing: pair 1 and 4, min=1.

Pair 3 and 5, min=3.

Pair 3 and 7, min=3.

Pair 6 and 8, min=6.

Total score: 1+3+3+6=13, which is less than 16.

So, again, sorted pairing gives the highest score.

Therefore, it seems that sorting the list in non-decreasing order and pairing the first two, then the next two, and so on, gives the maximum possible score.

Let me see why this works.

When I sort the list, I have a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

Then, pairing a_1 with a_2, a_3 with a_4, ..., a_{2n-1} with a_{2n}.

The score is a_1 + a_3 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Wait, in the first example, with n=1, list=2,3.

Sorted: 2,3.

Pair 2 and 3, score=2.

In the second example, n=2, list=1,1,2,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

Pair 1 and 1, score=1.

Pair 1 and 2, score=1.

Total: 2.

In the third example, n=3, list=1,1,1,1,1,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,1,1,1.

Pair 1 and 1, score=1.

Pair 1 and 1, score=1.

Pair 1 and 1, score=1.

Total: 3.

In the example I made, n=2, list=1,2,3,4.

Sorted:1,2,3,4.

Pair 1 and 2, score=1.

Pair 3 and 4, score=3.

Total: 4.

Another example, n=3, list=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted:1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pair 1 and 2, score=1.

Pair 3 and 4, score=3.

Pair 5 and 6, score=5.

Total: 9.

So, in all these cases, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the maximum score.

But why?

I think because by pairing the smallest with the next smallest, you're ensuring that the smaller numbers are being added to the score, and the larger numbers are being used to pair with others, potentially allowing their smaller partners to be as large as possible.

Wait, in the sorted pairing, you're pairing a_1 with a_2, a_3 with a_4, and so on.

But in the list, a_1 <= a_2 <= a_3 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

So, a_1 is the smallest, a_2 is the next smallest, and so on.

By pairing a_1 with a_2, you're getting a_1 added to the score.

Then, pairing a_3 with a_4, you're adding a_3 to the score.

And so on.

So, the total score is a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Wait, but in the first example, n=1, list=2,3.

Paired 2 and 3, added 2, which is a_1.

In the second example, n=2, list=1,1,1,2.

Sorted:1,1,1,2.

Paired 1 and 1, added 1 (a_1).

Paired 1 and 2, added 1 (a_3).

Total: 2.

In the third example, n=3, all 1's.

Paired 1 and 1, added 1.

Paired 1 and 1, added 1.

Paired 1 and 1, added 1.

Total: 3.

In the example I made, n=2, list=1,2,3,4.

Sorted:1,2,3,4.

Paired 1 and 2, added 1 (a_1).

Paired 3 and 4, added 3 (a_3).

Total: 4.

Another way to look at it: the score is the sum of a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

But is there a better way?

Suppose I pair a_1 with a_3, then a_2 with a_4, and so on.

In that case, the score would be min(a_1,a_3) + min(a_2,a_4) + ... .

Given that a_1 <= a_2 <= a_3 <= a_4 <= ..., min(a_1,a_3)=a_1, min(a_2,a_4)=a_2, and so on.

So, the score would be a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + ... up to n pairs.

Wait, but in our earlier example, n=2, list=1,2,3,4.

Pairing a_1 and a_3: min(1,3)=1.

Pairing a_2 and a_4: min(2,4)=2.

Total: 3.

But pairing a_1 and a_2: min(1,2)=1.

Pairing a_3 and a_4: min(3,4)=3.

Total: 4, which is higher.

So, pairing a_1 with a_2, a_3 with a_4, etc., gives a higher score than pairing a_1 with a_3, a_2 with a_4, etc.

Hence, pairing consecutive numbers in the sorted list gives a higher score.

Another way to think about it: to maximize the sum of the minimums, we should pair numbers that are close to each other in value.

If we pair a small number with a large number, the minimum is the small number, and the large number is wasted in some sense because its value could have been used as a minimum with another large number.

Wait, but in the earlier example, pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, and pairing 3 and 4 gives 3, total 4.

Pairing 1 and 3 gives 1, and pairing 2 and 4 gives 2, total 3.

So, pairing 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 is better.

Similarly, in the list 1,1,1,2.

Pairing 1 and 1 gives 1, and pairing 1 and 2 gives 1, total 2.

Which is better than pairing 1 and 1 first, and then 1 and 2.

Wait, but in that case, both pairings give the same total.

So, perhaps pairing numbers with smaller differences gives a higher sum of minimums.

But in the case where all numbers are the same, it doesn't matter how you pair them.

In the case where numbers are different, pairing closer numbers gives a higher sum.

Wait, in the example with 1,2,3,4.

Pairing 1 and 2 (difference 1), and 3 and 4 (difference 1), gives sum 4.

Pairing 1 and 3 (difference 2), and 2 and 4 (difference 2), gives sum 3.

So, pairing with smaller differences gives a higher sum.

Hence, sorting and pairing consecutive numbers seems to be the optimal strategy.

Therefore, the approach in the given program seems correct.

The program sorts the list in non-decreasing order and then sums up the elements at even indices (0,2,4,...,2n-2), which correspond to the first elements of each pair when the list is sorted.

Wait, in Python, list indices start at 0.

So, for a sorted list l, l[0] is the smallest, l[1] is the next smallest, and so on.

Pairing l[0] and l[1], l[2] and l[3], ..., l[2n-2] and l[2n-1].

Then, the score is l[0] + l[2] + ... + l[2n-2].

Which is what the program is doing.

It's summing l[i] for i in range(0, 2n, 2).

This seems correct based on the examples I've considered.

Let me check with another example.

Suppose n=3, list=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted:1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sum of l[0], l[2], l[4]: 1+3+5=9.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

Another example: n=4, list=1,3,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Sorted:1,3,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Sum of l[0], l[2], l[4], l[6]:1+3+5+7=16.

Which again matches the earlier calculation.

Hence, the program seems to be correctly implementing the optimal strategy.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**
