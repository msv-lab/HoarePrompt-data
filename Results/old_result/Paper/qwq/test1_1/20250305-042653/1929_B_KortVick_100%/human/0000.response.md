Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a "diagonal" in this grid. In a square grid, there are diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right and others that run from top-right to bottom-left. For an n x n grid, there are a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. I think this is because for the main direction (top-left to bottom-right), there are 2n - 1 diagonals, and similarly for the other direction, but some overlap in the center.

Wait, actually, in a square grid, the number of diagonals going in one direction is 2n - 1, and the same for the other direction, but they intersect at some points. So, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 2, I suppose.

Okay, so the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to minimize the number of colored cells while covering at least k diagonals.

Let me think about how diagonals intersect and overlap.

In a grid, each cell belongs to exactly one diagonal in each direction. So, coloring a single cell affects two diagonals: one in each direction.

Therefore, each colored cell can cover two diagonals.

So, in terms of covering diagonals, each colored cell can cover two diagonals, except perhaps in some edge cases.

So, if I color m cells, I can cover up to 2m diagonals.

But wait, it's "up to" 2m because there might be overlaps where multiple diagonals share the same cell.

Actually, in the extreme case, if all m cells are on the same diagonal, then they only cover that one diagonal in one direction and another in the other direction, so it's not optimal.

So, to maximize the number of diagonals covered, I should spread out the colored cells so that each cell covers two new diagonals.

So, ideally, each colored cell covers two new diagonals that haven't been covered yet.

Therefore, in the best case, m colored cells can cover 2m diagonals.

But in reality, there might be some overlaps, so sometimes coloring a cell might cover one new diagonal and one already covered diagonal.

But to minimize the number of colored cells, I should aim for each cell to cover two new diagonals.

Now, the problem states that there are 4n - 2 diagonals in total.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me double-check.

In an n x n grid:

- For diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right: the number of such diagonals is 2n - 1.

- Similarly, for diagonals going from top-right to bottom-left: also 2n - 1.

- So, total diagonals would be 2*(2n - 1) = 4n - 2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, total diagonals are 4n - 2.

Now, the problem is to cover at least k of these diagonals with the fewest colored cells.

Each colored cell can cover up to two diagonals.

So, in the best case, the minimal number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

Wait, but the code provided has a condition: if k == 4n - 2, then print(k // 2 + 1), else print(ceil(k / 2)).

So, in general, it's ceil(k / 2), but in the case where k is the maximum possible (4n - 2), it's ceil(k / 2) + 1.

Is this correct?

Let me think about it.

If k is 4n - 2, meaning we want to cover all diagonals, is there a reason why we need to add +1 to ceil(k / 2)?

Let me consider a small n, say n=2.

For n=2, total diagonals are 4*2 - 2 = 6.

So, if k=6, according to the code, we should print(6//2 + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4.

Is that correct?

Let's see.

For n=2, the grid has 2 rows and 2 columns.

The diagonals are:

- Top-left to bottom-right: two diagonals.

- Top-right to bottom-left: two diagonals.

Wait, no. For n=2, the number of diagonals in one direction is 2*2 - 1 = 3.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought it's 2n - 1 for one direction.

But for n=2:

- Diagonals from top-left to bottom-right: diagonals with cells (1,1), (2,2); and (1,2); and (2,1). So, 3 diagonals.

- Similarly, diagonals from top-right to bottom-left: diagonals with cells (1,2), (2,1); (1,1); and (2,2). So, again 3 diagonals.

Total diagonals: 6.

So, k=6 means covering all 6 diagonals.

Now, what's the minimal number of cells needed to cover all 6 diagonals.

Let me try to see.

If I color one cell, say (1,1), it covers one diagonal from each direction: one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left.

So, it covers 2 diagonals.

Similarly, if I color another cell, say (2,2), it covers two more diagonals: one in each direction.

Wait, but (2,2) also covers the main diagonal (1,1)-(2,2) and the other diagonal (1,2)-(2,1).

So, coloring (1,1) and (2,2) covers:

- For (1,1): diagonal (1,1)-(2,2) and diagonal (1,1).

- For (2,2): diagonal (1,1)-(2,2) and diagonal (1,2)-(2,1).

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused with the diagonal definitions.

In n=2 grid:

- Diagonals from top-left to bottom-right:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2).

- Diagonal with cell (1,2).

- Diagonal with cell (2,1).

- Diagonals from top-right to bottom-left:

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,1).

- Diagonal with cell (1,1).

- Diagonal with cell (2,2).

So, total 6 diagonals.

Now, if I color cells (1,1) and (2,2), do I cover all 6 diagonals?

Let's see:

- (1,1) covers diagonals: (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,1).

- (2,2) covers diagonals: (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,2)-(2,1).

- So, diagonals covered: (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1).

But there are other diagonals: (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).

Wait, but (2,2) is already covered by (2,2).

Wait, maybe I need to color more cells.

Let me try coloring three cells: (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1).

Then:

- (1,1): covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,1).

- (1,2): covers (1,2)-(2,1) and (1,2).

- (2,1): covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (2,1).

So, diagonals covered: (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (1,2), (2,1).

Still missing (2,2).

So, I need to color (2,2) as well to cover that diagonal.

Wait, but (2,2) is already covered by (2,2).

Wait, but if I color (2,2), it covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,2)-(2,1).

So, with (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2), I cover all six diagonals.

So, four cells are needed to cover all six diagonals.

According to the code, for k=6, it would print(6//2 + 1) = 4, which matches.

Whereas, if I use ceil(k / 2) = ceil(6 / 2) = 3, which is less than actual 4.

So, in this case, for k=4n-2=6, the minimal number is 4, not ceil(6/2)=3.

So, the code is correct in this case.

Now, let's see for other values.

Take n=3, k=4.

According to the code, since k != 4*3 - 2 = 10, it would print ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

Is that correct?

For n=3, total diagonals are 4*3 - 2 = 10.

We need to cover at least 4 diagonals.

Can we cover 4 diagonals with 2 cells?

Yes, for example, color cells (1,1) and (2,2).

Each cell covers two diagonals, so total 4 diagonals covered.

So, minimal number is 2, which matches ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

Another example: n=3, k=10.

According to the code, since k=10=4*3-2, it would print(10//2 + 1) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Is that correct?

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, the output is 6.

So, according to the code, it's correct.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9.

Since k=9 < 10=4*3-2, it would print ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

In the sample input, for n=3, k=9, the output is 5, which matches.

Another sample: n=4, k=7.

According to the code, since k=7 < 4*4-2=14, it would print ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

Sample output is 4, which matches.

Similarly, n=7, k=11.

ceil(11 / 2) = 6, which matches the sample output.

And n=2, k=3.

Since k=3 < 4*2-2=6, it would print ceil(3 / 2) = 2, which should be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought for n=2, k=6, it's 4, and for k=3, it's 2.

Is that correct?

Let's see.

For n=2, k=3.

Can I cover 3 diagonals with 2 cells?

Yes, for example, color cells (1,1) and (1,2).

- (1,1) covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,1).

- (1,2) covers (1,2)-(2,1) and (1,2).

So, diagonals covered: (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (1,2).

That's four diagonals, which is more than k=3.

But can I cover exactly 3 diagonals with 2 cells?

For example, color (1,1) and (1,2):

Covers (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (1,2).

So, four diagonals.

Alternatively, color (1,1) and (2,1):

Covers (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (2,1).

Again, four diagonals.

Alternatively, color (1,1) and (2,2):

Covers (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (2,2).

Again, four diagonals.

So, it seems that with two cells, I can cover four diagonals.

But the problem is to cover at least k=3 diagonals.

So, yes, two cells cover four diagonals, which is more than enough.

So, minimal number is 2, which matches ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

Hence, the code seems correct in this case.

Now, let's consider another case: n=2, k=4.

According to the code, since k=4 < 4*2-2=6, it would print ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

Is that correct?

Wait, earlier I thought that for k=6, it's 4, but for k=4, it's 2.

But in reality, with two cells, I can cover four diagonals, which is sufficient for k=4.

So, yes, it's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for k=6, I need four cells, which is ceil(6 / 2) +1=4.

So, the code handles that case correctly.

Hence, it seems the code is correct.

But let's think about another example to confirm.

Take n=1.

Wait, n starts from 2, according to the problem.

Wait, n >=2, as per the constraints.

Another example: n=5, k=10.

According to the code, since k=10 < 4*5-2=18, it would print ceil(10 / 2)=5.

Is that correct?

Let's see.

In n=5, total diagonals are 18.

We need to cover at least 10 diagonals.

Can we do it with 5 cells?

Each cell covers two diagonals.

So, 5 cells can cover up to 10 diagonals.

So, yes, minimal number is 5.

Seems correct.

Another case: n=3, k=1.

According to the code, since k=1 < 10=4*3-2, it would print ceil(1 / 2)=1.

Is that correct?

Yes, because coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is more than k=1.

Wait, but the problem says k >=1, but in this case, k=1, and ceil(1/2)=1.

But actually, coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is more than k=1.

So, minimal number is 1, which is correct.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says k >=1, but for n=3, k=1, the output is 1, which is correct.

Similarly, for n=3, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, but coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is enough for k=2.

So, minimal number is 1, which is correct.

Wait, but for k=3, ceil(3/2)=2, which is correct, as coloring two cells covers four diagonals, which is more than k=3.

Similarly, for k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, which is correct.

And so on.

Hence, it seems that the code is correct.

The special case is when k=4n-2, in which case, it's ceil(k / 2) +1.

Is that necessary?

In the earlier example with n=2, k=6, we saw that minimal number is 4, which is ceil(6 / 2) +1=4.

But, is there a better way to cover all 6 diagonals with fewer than 4 cells?

Let's see.

If I color three cells: (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1).

Then, diagonals covered:

- (1,1): covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,1).

- (1,2): covers (1,2)-(2,1) and (1,2).

- (2,1): covers (1,1)-(2,2) and (2,1).

So, diagonals covered: (1,1)-(2,2), (1,1), (1,2)-(2,1), (1,2), (2,1).

Still missing (2,2).

So, I need to color (2,2) to cover that diagonal.

Hence, four cells are needed, which matches the code's output.

So, in this case, ceil(k / 2) +1 is necessary.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Diagonals**: Each cell in the grid belongs to exactly two diagonals: one from the top-left to bottom-right and one from the top-right to bottom-left.
2. **Coverage per Cell**: Each colored cell can cover two diagonals.
3. **General Case**: For most values of k, the minimum number of cells required is the ceiling of k divided by 2, because each cell covers two diagonals.
4. **Special Case**: When k is equal to the total number of diagonals (4n - 2), it requires one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered, hence the minimum number of cells is the ceiling of k divided by 2 plus one.

### Solution Code

```python
from math import ceil

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: Read all input data at once and split it into a list for easier access.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - Extract the values of n and k for each test case.
    - If k is equal to the total number of diagonals (4n - 2), calculate the minimum cells as floor division of k by 2 plus one.
    - For all other values of k, calculate the minimum cells as the ceiling of k divided by 2.
3. **Output the Results**: Print the result for each test case accordingly.

This approach ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals with the fewest cell colorings, handling both general and special cases efficiently.
