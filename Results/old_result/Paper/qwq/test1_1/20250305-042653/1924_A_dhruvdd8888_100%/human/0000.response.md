Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so I need to check if every possible combination of length n from the first k alphabets is a subsequence of s. That sounds tricky, especially since n can be up to 26, and k up to 26, but m, the length of s, can be up to 1000, and the total sum of m across all test cases is up to 10^6, which is a million. So, efficiency is key here.

Let me think about how many possible strings there are of length n using k alphabets. It's k^n, which for k=26 and n=26 is way too big to handle directly. So, I definitely can't generate all possible strings and check them against s.

I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can think about the problem differently. Instead of checking all possible subsequences, perhaps I can check if s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k alphabets.

Wait, that sounds similar to what I just said. Let's try to rephrase it. I need to ensure that for every possible string of length n using the first k letters, there exists a subsequence in s that matches that string.

This seems computationally expensive. Is there a better way to approach this?

Let me consider the properties of subsequences. If s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k alphabets, then for each position in the subsequence, there must be enough characters in s in the correct order.

Hmm. Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a character, and I need to find paths of length n that cover all possible combinations.

That might be too complicated. Let's think smaller.

Suppose n=1. Then, I just need to check if s contains all of the first k alphabets. That's straightforward.

If n=2, I need to check if s contains all possible pairs of the first k alphabets as subsequences.

Wait, but even for n=2 and k=2, like in the example, n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba", I need to check if "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb" are all subsequences of "abba".

Let's verify that:

- "aa": positions 1 and 4.

- "ab": positions 1 and 2.

- "ba": positions 2 and 3.

- "bb": positions 2 and 4.

All of these are present in "abba", so the answer is "YES".

In the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", let's check:

- "aa": is "a" at position 1, but there's no second "a", so "aa" is not a subsequence.

Hence, "NO" and the string "aa" is provided.

In the third test case, n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab", need to check if all possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c' are subsequences of s.

There are 27 possible strings: 'aaa', 'aab', ..., 'ccc'.

The answer is "NO" and the string "ccc" is provided, meaning "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

So, the task is to efficiently determine if all k^n possible strings are present as subsequences in s, and if not, provide one that's missing.

Given the constraints, generating all k^n strings is not feasible for large n and k, as k^n can be up to 26^26, which is astronomically large.

Hence, I need a smarter way to check this.

Let me think about the problem differently. Suppose I fix a string of length n, and I want to check if it's a subsequence of s.

To check if a string t is a subsequence of s, I can iterate through s and try to match the characters of t in order.

But doing this for all k^n strings is not practical.

Is there a way to check this in a more efficient manner?

Maybe I can think about the maximum number of distinct subsequences of length n that s can have, and compare it to k^n.

But even calculating the number of distinct subsequences of s is non-trivial.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using dynamic programming or some other approach.

Let me consider building a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the earliest position in s where the subsequence corresponding to the first j characters of t has been matched up to the i-th character.

But again, this seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider the positions of each character in s.

Suppose I have a list of positions for each of the k characters.

For example, for k=3, I have lists pos_a, pos_b, pos_c containing the positions in s where 'a', 'b', and 'c' appear, respectively.

Now, to form a subsequence of length n, I need to choose n positions from these lists, in order, such that each subsequent position is greater than the previous one.

This sounds similar to finding the number of ways to choose n positions with specific characters in specific orders.

But again, enumerating all possibilities is not feasible.

Wait a minute, maybe inclusion-exclusion could help here, but I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to find the minimal s that contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k alphabets.

What would that s look like?

It's probably very long, something like n*k or more.

But in this problem, s can be up to 1000 per test case, and up to 10^5 test cases, but the total sum of m across all test cases is up to 10^6.

So, s can be large in total.

I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider the dual problem: finding a string that is missing as a subsequence.

If I can find one such string, then I can output "NO" and that string.

If I can't find any, then output "YES".

So, I need an efficient way to find a missing subsequence.

But again, generating all possible strings is not feasible.

Maybe I can try to construct a string that is likely to be missing.

For example, if a particular character is missing in s, then any string containing that character is missing.

Similarly, if a character appears fewer times in s than needed in the subsequence, it might be missing.

Wait, but in this problem, s consists only of the first k lowercase English letters, and it's guaranteed that s contains only those letters.

So, all characters from the first k letters are present in s.

Wait, no, it's only guaranteed that s contains only the first k lowercase English alphabets, but it's possible that some letters might not appear in s.

Wait, no, the problem says: "m is the length of the string s, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets."

So, s consists only of the first k lowercase letters, but it's possible that some of those k letters don't appear in s.

Wait, but the problem also says: "It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6."

But I think sum of m is up to 10^6, and sum of n is also up to 10^6, but m can be up to 1000 per test case, and t up to 10^5.

I need to be careful with time constraints.

Let me consider that some letters might not appear in s, even though s consists only of the first k letters.

So, if a particular letter doesn't appear in s, then any string containing that letter is missing.

Hence, in that case, I can immediately output "NO" and provide a string of length n containing that missing letter.

But, in the example provided, in the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", and it's missing "aa".

But in this case, 'a' is present in s, but "aa" is not a subsequence.

So, this approach isn't sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the positions of each character.

For each character from the first k letters, I can collect the positions where it appears in s.

Then, to form a subsequence of length n, I need to pick n positions, each corresponding to one of the characters, and ensure that the positions are in increasing order.

This sounds like finding a chain of positions, each belonging to a specific character.

But again, checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent positions in s, and edges represent possible transitions from one character to another.

But building such a graph explicitly would be too slow.

Wait, maybe I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the possible subsequences up to a certain point.

But again, with n up to 26 and t up to 1e5, time constraints are tight.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=1, s must contain all k characters at least once.

For n=2, s must contain all pairs of characters in some order.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", it's missing "aa".

So, just having both characters isn't enough; I need to have enough repetitions to cover all possible pairs.

Similarly, for n=3, I need to have enough triplets.

This seems complicated.

Is there a pattern or formula that can help me determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters?

I'm not sure.

Let me consider the total number of possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, which is k^n.

Then, I need to check if s contains all of these as subsequences.

But again, generating and checking each one is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the minimal number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=1, each character needs to appear at least once.

For n=2, perhaps each character needs to appear at least twice, but that doesn't seem right, because in "abb", 'a' appears once and 'b' appears twice, but "aa" is missing.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that for any sequence of n characters, there are positions in s where those characters can be selected in order.

This still seems too vague.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a string t of length n using the first k letters.

To check if t is a subsequence of s, I can iterate through s and try to match each character of t in order.

If I can find a sequence of positions in s that match t in order, then t is a subsequence of s.

But checking this for all k^n possible t is not practical.

Is there a way to represent this more efficiently?

Maybe I can model this as a finite automaton, where each state represents the progress in matching the subsequence.

But building such an automaton for all possible t is still too slow.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for any string t of length n, there should be a way to choose n positions in s where the characters match t in order.

Alternatively, if I can find a t where no such sequence of positions exists, then the answer is "NO" and I can output that t.

But how do I find such a t efficiently?

Wait, maybe I can look for the minimal number of occurrences of each character in s and see if it's sufficient to cover all possible combinations.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a string t of length n, the number of times each character appears in t can vary from 0 to n.

But ensuring that s has enough repetitions of each character to cover all possible t is tricky.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the dual problem: finding a t that is not a subsequence of s.

To find such a t, I need to find a sequence of n characters where there is no increasing sequence of positions in s that match those characters in order.

This sounds similar to finding a sequence that is not present in s.

But how?

Perhaps I can try to find a t where for some i, the i-th character in t cannot be matched because the required character doesn't appear after the position where the (i-1)-th character was matched.

This seems promising.

So, I can try to construct t by choosing characters that are not present in s after certain positions.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set of characters that appear in s, and I track the positions where each character appears.

Then, to form a subsequence t, I need to pick positions in s where each character in t is matched, and the positions are in increasing order.

If I cannot find such positions for some t, then that t is missing.

But again, checking for all t is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to find at least one missing t.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the characters that appear least frequently in s.

If a particular character appears fewer than required in s, then some t containing that character more times than available will be missing.

But in the second test case, 'a' appears once, and n=2, so "aa" is missing because 'a' appears only once.

Similarly, in the third test case, 'c' appears twice, and n=3, so "ccc" is missing.

So, in general, for each character, if the number of times it appears in s is less than the number of times it's required in t, then that t is missing.

But t can have any combination of characters.

Wait, more precisely, for a string t of length n, if the number of times a particular character appears in t exceeds the number of times that character appears in s, then t cannot be a subsequence of s.

But in the second test case, 'a' appears once in s, and n=2, so any t with two 'a's is missing.

Similarly, in the third test case, 'c' appears twice in s, and n=3, so "ccc" is missing.

But this doesn't cover all cases.

For example, suppose s="abcabc", n=3, k=3.

Then, "aaa" is missing because 'a' appears twice in s, but n=3, so "aaa" cannot be formed.

Similarly, "bbb" and "ccc" would also be missing.

But in this case, the answer should be "NO", and I can output any of the missing strings, say "aaa".

But in the first test case, n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba", all possible t of length 2 are present.

So, in that case, the answer is "YES".

Hence, a way to approach this is:

- For each character in the first k letters, count how many times it appears in s.

- For a string t of length n, the number of times each character appears in t cannot exceed its count in s.

- However, t can have any combination of characters, so it's not just about individual character counts, but about the sequence in which they appear.

Wait, but actually, since we're dealing with subsequences, the order matters.

So, it's not just about the frequency of characters, but also about their positions.

For example, in s="abba", 'a' appears twice, at positions 1 and 4.

So, for t="aa", I can choose positions 1 and 4.

Similarly, for t="ab", positions 1 and 2.

And so on.

Hence, just looking at the frequency of characters isn't sufficient; I need to consider the order as well.

This seems complicated.

Is there a way to model this problem using graphs or some other structure to make it more manageable?

Let me consider building a graph where nodes represent positions in s, and edges represent possible transitions from one character to another.

But with s up to 1000 per test case and t up to 1e5, this might not be efficient enough.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that to cover all possible subsequences of length n, s must have enough "diversity" and "repetition" of characters in order.

But I need a concrete way to check this.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of distinct subsequences of s.

The total number of distinct subsequences of s is 2^m, but that includes all possible combinations, not just those of length n.

But calculating the number of distinct subsequences of length n is still too slow.

I need a different angle.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for any sequence of n characters from the first k letters, there must be a way to choose n positions in s where those characters appear in order.

To check if this is true, I can try to find a t where this is not possible.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through all possible t and check if they are subsequences of s.

But as discussed earlier, this is not feasible for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if s has enough repetitions of each character, such that for any t, there are sufficient characters in s in the required order.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the sample inputs.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible t:

aa, ab, ba, bb

All are present.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Possible t:

aa, ab, ba, bb

"aa" is missing.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Possible t: all combinations of length 3 from a, b, c.

"ccc" is missing.

So, in general, I need to find if there exists a t that cannot be formed as a subsequence of s.

To find such a t efficiently, perhaps I can construct t by choosing characters that are not present in s after certain positions.

Let me try to formalize this.

I can try to build t step by step, choosing at each step the character that cannot be matched in s after the previous character's position.

Here's an algorithmic approach:

1. Initialize an empty string t.

2. Start from the beginning of s.

3. For each position in t (from 1 to n):

a. For each character from the first k letters:

i. Check if this character can be added to t such that there exists a position in s after the previous character's position.

ii. If not, choose this character for t.

4. If I can build such a t, then output "NO" and the string t.

5. If no such t exists, output "YES".

But this seems too vague and may not be efficient.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the positions of each character in s.

For example, for s="abb", k=2 (a and b):

a: positions [0, 2]

b: positions [1, 3]

For n=2, I need to check if all possible pairs are present as subsequences.

I can iterate through all possible pairs and check if they exist in s.

But for larger n and k, this is inefficient.

Wait, maybe I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of subsequences covered.

But time constraints are tight.

Let me consider that if s has length m, then the number of possible subsequences of length n is C(m, n), which can be large.

But again, not practical for large m and n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=1, each character must appear at least once.

For n=2, each pair must appear at least once as a subsequence.

This seems similar to covering all possible combinations with subsequences.

But I need a general approach.

Let me consider that for a string s to contain all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, it must have enough repetitions of each character in the correct order.

But I need a way to quantify "enough".

Wait, perhaps I can think about the minimal number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible subsequences of length n.

For example, for n=1, each character needs to appear at least once.

For n=2, each character needs to appear at least twice, but that's not sufficient, as seen in the second test case.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb":

- '
