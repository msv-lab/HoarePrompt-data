Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to print one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, the problem is asking me to check if all possible strings of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet are subsequences of s. The alphabet is the first k lowercase letters, so for k=2, it's 'a' and 'b'; for k=3, it's 'a', 'b', and 'c', and so on.

The constraints are:

- t is up to 10^5, which is 100,000 test cases.

- n is from 1 to 26.

- k is from 1 to 26.

- m is from 1 to 1000, and s is of length m.

- The sum of m over all test cases is up to 10^6.

So, efficiency is key here because with t=10^5 and m=1000, a naive approach would be too slow.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the total number of possible strings of length n using k letters is k^n. For k=2 and n=2, there are 4 possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". I need to check if all of these are subsequences of s.

But checking each of these k^n strings individually would be too slow, especially since k^n can be up to 26^26, which is a huge number. So, I need a smarter way to check if all these strings are subsequences of s.

I need to find a way to determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n using the first k letters.

One way to think about this is to model s as a graph where each node represents a prefix of s, and edges are labeled with the letters from the alphabet.

Wait, that might be overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently. If I can find a way to ensure that s contains enough instances of each letter in the right order, then maybe I can guarantee that all possible combinations are present.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the positions of each letter in s and see how they can be combined to form the required subsequences.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal requirements. For example, if n=1, then s must contain all k letters at least once. Because all possible strings of length 1 are just the individual letters.

Yes, that's straightforward. So, for n=1, I just need to check if s contains all k letters.

For n=2, I need to check if all possible pairs of letters appear in s in order, not necessarily consecutively.

So, for "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb" when k=2, I need to ensure that:

- There are at least two 'a's in s, in order, for "aa".

- There is at least one 'a' followed by at least one 'b' for "ab".

- There is at least one 'b' followed by at least one 'a' for "ba".

- There are at least two 'b's in s, in order, for "bb".

Similarly, for higher n, I need to ensure that all possible sequences of length n using the k letters appear as subsequences in s.

This seems tricky to check directly for large n and k.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each letter appears in s.

For example, for n=2 and k=2, if 'a' appears at least twice, then "aa" is covered. If 'a' appears at least once and 'b' appears at least once after it, then "ab" is covered. Similarly for "ba" and "bb".

But this seems case-specific. I need a general approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of times each letter must appear in s to cover all possible sequences.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion could help, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of a de Bruijn sequence.

A de Bruijn sequence of order n on a k-letter alphabet is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length n appears exactly once.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of times each letter appears and how they overlap.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the provided program and see how it approaches the problem.

Looking at the code:

from collections import *

from math import *

from heapq import *

import sys

from bisect import *

from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

for i in s:

if i in us:

win.add(i)

if len(win) == k:

ans.append(i)

ps += 1

win.clear()

if ps >= n:

return print('YES')

print('NO')

for i in us:

if i not in win:

return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))

Okay, so the program reads t, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calls func_1().

In func_1():

- It reads n, k, m.

- Reads the string s.

- Creates a set us containing the first k lowercase letters.

- Initializes an empty set win and an empty list ans and a counter ps.

- Then, it iterates through each character in s:

- If the character is in us:

- Add it to win.

- If win has all k letters:

- Append the character to ans.

- Increment ps.

- Clear win.

- If ps >= n, print 'YES'.

- Else, print 'NO'.

- Then, for each letter in us:

- If it's not in win, print a string consisting of ans + that letter + 'a' repeated (n - len(ans) - 1) times.

Wait, this seems problematic.

First, ps counts how many times we have collected all k letters in win.

So, if ps >= n, it means we have found at least n occurrences where we have collected all k letters.

But is this condition sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length n using the first k letters are subsequences of s?

I'm not sure.

Let's consider the first sample input:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

us = {'a', 'b'}

win starts empty.

Iterate through s:

- 'a': in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'a','b'}

- len(win)==k, so append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win.

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'b'}

- 'a': in us, add to win -> win={'b','a'}

- len(win)==k, so append 'a' to ans, ps=2, clear win.

Now, ps=2 >= n=2, so print 'YES'.

This seems correct for the first test case.

Second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

us={'a','b'}

win starts empty.

- 'a': in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'a','b'}

- len(win)==k, append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win.

- 'b': in us, add to win -> win={'b'}

- End of string.

ps=1 < n=2, so print 'NO'.

Then, for i in us:

- 'a': not in win={'b'}, so print ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a'*(2-1-1) = 'b' + 'a' + '' = 'ba'

But according to the sample output, it should be 'aa'.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, maybe I misread the approach.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the idea is to find the minimal number of times we can collect all k letters in order.

But I'm not sure if that guarantees that all possible subsequences of length n are present.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I maintain, for each possible prefix of length up to n, the earliest position where that prefix ends in s.

Then, for each possible extension of that prefix, I can find the next occurrence of the required letter after the end position of the prefix.

But this seems too slow for the constraints.

Another idea: For n=1, just check if all k letters are present in s.

For n=2, check if for every pair of letters, there exists at least one subsequence in s.

For n=3, check for every triplet, and so on.

But this is too slow because k^n can be up to 26^26.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the minimal requirements.

For a string of length n using k letters, to be a subsequence of s, there must be at least n occurrences of the letters in s in the required order.

But how to generalize this?

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each letter appears and their positions.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the provided program.

In the program, ps counts how many times we can collect all k letters in order.

Then, if ps >= n, it returns 'YES'.

But in the second test case, ps=1 < n=2, so it returns 'NO' and prints 'ba', but according to the sample output, it should print 'aa'.

So, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program's logic.

Let me see.

In the program, win is a set that collects letters until it has all k letters.

Then, it appends the last letter that completed the set to ans, increments ps, and clears win.

Then, it checks if ps >= n, and if so, prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and tries to construct a string that is not a subsequence.

But in the second test case, it prints 'NO' and 'ba', but the correct output should be 'NO' and 'aa'.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I misread the logic.

Let me consider another approach.

I need to check if all possible strings of length n using the first k letters are subsequences of s.

One way to think about this is to consider the positions of each letter in s.

For each letter, find all its positions in s.

Then, for any sequence of letters, I can check if there exists a sequence of positions that are in increasing order, corresponding to the letters in the sequence.

But again, checking all k^n sequences is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can think about the minimal number of times each letter must appear in s to cover all possible sequences.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider n=1: Just check if all k letters are present in s.

For n=2: Need to ensure that for every pair of letters, there exists at least one subsequence in s.

Similarly, for higher n.

But checking each possible sequence individually is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the length of the subsequence and j is the current state representing which letters have been used so far.

But this seems too slow for the constraints.

Another idea: For s to contain all possible subsequences of length n using k letters, s must have enough repetitions of the letters in the right order.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of times each letter appears in s and ensure that the combinations cover all possible sequences.

Still, too vague.

Let me look back at the program.

In the program, it seems to be trying to find sequences where it collects all k letters and counts how many such collections it can make.

Then, if the number of collections is at least n, it returns 'YES'.

But this doesn't seem to correctly check if all possible sequences are present.

In the second test case, s="abb", k=2, n=2.

The program finds one collection (from 'a' and 'b'), so ps=1 < n=2, hence 'NO', and then tries to find a string that's not a subsequence.

But according to the sample, "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb", so the program should output 'NO' and "aa".

But according to the program, it outputs 'NO' and "ba".

So, it's incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
