Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But the tricky part is that we have to wait for each sign to occur one after another in sequence.

Let me try to rephrase the problem in my own words. We start at year 0. We wait for the first sign to occur. Once it does, in its occurrence year, we then start waiting for the second sign to occur in the years after that, and so on, until the nth sign occurs.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

36

5

5

2012

In the first test case, n=6 and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]. The output is 36.

Let me try to simulate this:

- Start at year 0.

- Wait for the first sign, which occurs every 3 years. So it occurs in years 3,6,9,12,...

- Let's say it occurs at year 3.

- Now, starting from year 4, wait for the second sign, which occurs every 2 years (years 2,4,6,8,...). The next possible occurrence after year 3 is year 4.

- Then, starting from year 5, wait for the third sign, which occurs every 4 years (years 4,8,12,16,...). The next occurrence after year 4 is year 8.

- Wait for the fourth sign starting from year 9. It occurs every 5 years (years 5,10,15,20,...). The next occurrence after year 8 is year 10.

- Wait for the fifth sign starting from year 11. It occurs every 9 years (years 9,18,27,...). The next occurrence after year 10 is year 18.

- Finally, wait for the sixth sign starting from year 19. It occurs every 18 years (years 18,36,54,...). The next occurrence after year 18 is year 36.

So, the nth sign occurs in year 36, which matches the sample output.

Okay, that makes sense. Now, I need to generalize this process for any n and any list of a_i.

Let me think about how to approach this programmatically.

I need to keep track of the current year, starting from 0.

For each sign from 1 to n:

Find the earliest year >= current_year + 1 where the sign occurs.

Update the current_year to that year.

Finally, the year when the nth sign occurs is the answer.

Wait, more formally:

Initialize current_year = 0

For each sign ai in a:

Find the smallest year y such that y >= current_year + 1 and y is a multiple of ai.

Set current_year = y

Output current_year

That seems straightforward.

Now, how do I find the smallest y that is >= current_year + 1 and is a multiple of ai?

Well, if current_year + 1 is already a multiple of ai, then y = current_year + 1.

Otherwise, y is the next multiple of ai after current_year + 1.

Mathematically, y = ceil((current_year + 1) / ai) * ai

Or, in integer division, y = ((current_year + 1) // ai + (1 if (current_year + 1) % ai != 0 else 0)) * ai

Alternatively, in code, it's easier to write it as:

if (current_year + 1) % ai == 0:

y = current_year + 1

else:

y = (current_year + 1)//ai + 1)*ai

Yes, that should work.

Let me test this logic with the first sample input.

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Start with current_year=0

First sign, ai=3

current_year +1 =1

1 % 3 !=0, so y=(1//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

Set current_year=3

Second sign, ai=2

current_year +1=4

4 % 2 ==0, so y=4

Set current_year=4

Third sign, ai=4

current_year +1=5

5 % 4 !=0, so y=(5//4 +1)*4=2*4=8

Set current_year=8

Fourth sign, ai=5

current_year +1=9

9 % 5 !=0, so y=(9//5 +1)*5=2*5=10

Set current_year=10

Fifth sign, ai=9

current_year +1=11

11 % 9 !=0, so y=(11//9 +1)*9=2*9=18

Set current_year=18

Sixth sign, ai=18

current_year +1=19

19 % 18 !=0, so y=(19//18 +1)*18=2*18=36

Set current_year=36

Output is 36, which matches the sample.

Good.

Let me check another sample.

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Start with current_year=0

First sign, ai=1

current_year +1=1

1 %1 ==0, so y=1

Set current_year=1

Second sign, ai=2

current_year +1=2

2%2==0, y=2

Set current_year=2

Third sign, ai=3

current_year +1=3

3%3==0, y=3

Set current_year=3

Fourth sign, ai=4

current_year +1=4

4%4==0, y=4

Set current_year=4

Fifth sign, ai=5

current_year +1=5

5%5==0, y=5

Set current_year=5

Output is 5, which matches the sample.

Another sample:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Start with current_year=0

First sign, ai=1

current_year +1=1

1%1==0, y=1

Set current_year=1

Second sign, ai=1

current_year +1=2

2%1==0, y=2

Set current_year=2

Third sign, ai=1

current_year +1=3

3%1==0, y=3

Set current_year=3

Fourth sign, ai=1

current_year +1=4

4%1==0, y=4

Set current_year=4

Fifth sign, ai=1

current_year +1=5

5%1==0, y=5

Set current_year=5

Output is 5, matching the sample.

Last sample:

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

Start with current_year=0

First sign, ai=50

current_year +1=1

1%50 !=0, y=(1//50 +1)*50=1*50=50

Set current_year=50

Second sign, ai=30

current_year +1=51

51%30 !=0, y=(51//30 +1)*30=2*30=60

Set current_year=60

Third sign, ai=711

current_year +1=61

61%711 !=0, y=(61//711 +1)*711=1*711=711

Set current_year=711

Fourth sign, ai=200

current_year +1=712

712%200 !=0, y=(712//200 +1)*200=4*200=800

Set current_year=800

Fifth sign, ai=503

current_year +1=801

801%503 !=0, y=(801//503 +1)*503=2*503=1006

Set current_year=1006

Sixth sign, ai=1006

current_year +1=1007

1007%1006 !=0, y=(1007//1006 +1)*1006=2*1006=2012

Set current_year=2012

Output is 2012, matching the sample.

Seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

t = int(input().strip())

test_cases = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input().strip())

a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

test_cases.append((n, a))

results = func_1(t, test_cases)

for result in results:

print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for test in test_cases:

(n, a) = test

current_year = 0

for ai in a:

if current_year % ai == 0:

next_year = current_year + ai

else:

next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai

current_year = next_year

results.append(current_year)

return results

So, the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list a, stores them in test_cases, then calls func_1 to compute the results for each test case, and finally prints each result.

Looking at func_1:

For each test case (n, a):

Initialize current_year = 0

For each ai in a:

if current_year % ai == 0:

next_year = current_year + ai

else:

next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai

Set current_year = next_year

Append the final current_year to results

Return all results

Comparing this to my earlier reasoning, it seems correct.

But wait, in my earlier reasoning, I have:

if (current_year + 1) % ai == 0:

y = current_year + 1

else:

y = (current_year + 1 // ai + 1) * ai

But in the code:

if current_year % ai == 0:

next_year = current_year + ai

else:

next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai

Hmm, there's a difference.

In my reasoning, I used current_year + 1, but in the code, it's using current_year directly.

Let me check if this is equivalent.

Suppose current_year is 0, ai=3

current_year % 3 == 0 => next_year = 0 + 3 = 3

In my earlier reasoning, current_year +1 =1, 1%3 !=0, y=(1//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

Same result.

Next, current_year=3, ai=2

3 % 2 !=0 => next_year=(3//2 +1)*2=2*2=4

In my earlier reasoning, current_year +1=4, 4%2==0, y=4

Same result.

Next, current_year=4, ai=4

4%4==0, next_year=4+4=8

In my reasoning, current_year +1=5, 5%4 !=0, y=(5//4 +1)*4=2*4=8

Same.

Next, current_year=8, ai=5

8%5 !=0, next_year=(8//5 +1)*5=2*5=10

In my reasoning, current_year +1=9, 9%5 !=0, y=(9//5 +1)*5=2*5=10

Same.

Next, current_year=10, ai=9

10%9 !=0, next_year=(10//9 +1)*9=2*9=18

In my reasoning, current_year +1=11, 11%9 !=0, y=(11//9 +1)*9=2*9=18

Same.

Next, current_year=18, ai=18

18%18==0, next_year=18+18=36

In my reasoning, current_year +1=19, 19%18 !=0, y=(19//18 +1)*18=2*18=36

Same.

So, even though the code is using current_year directly, and my reasoning used current_year +1, both approaches lead to the same result.

Let me see why.

In the code's approach:

If current_year is a multiple of ai, then next_year = current_year + ai

Else, next_year = ceiling of (current_year / ai) * ai

Which is the same as finding the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.

In my approach:

Find the smallest y >= current_year +1 that is a multiple of ai.

Which is also the smallest multiple of ai greater than current_year.

So, both approaches are equivalent because if current_year is a multiple of ai, then the next multiple is current_year + ai, else it's the smallest multiple greater than current_year.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
