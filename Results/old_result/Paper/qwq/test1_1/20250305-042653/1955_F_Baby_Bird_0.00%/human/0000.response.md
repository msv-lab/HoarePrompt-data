Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game between Alice and Bob where they have a sequence of numbers, each number is at most 4, and they play by some rules involving bitwise XOR. The winner is determined by whether the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero or zero. Alice wins if it's non-zero, Bob wins if it's zero.

Then, there's Eve who acts as a judge and removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. This continues until there are no numbers left. Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she removes numbers in a way that helps Bob win as many times as possible.

My task is to determine, for given counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, how many times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the winning condition. The XOR of all numbers in the sequence determines the winner. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; if it's zero, Bob wins.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4, I should look into the properties of XOR with these specific numbers.

Let's recall that XOR is associative and commutative, meaning the order doesn't matter, and it's its own inverse. So, XOR-ing a number with itself results in zero.

Given that, I can think about the XOR of the entire sequence based on the counts of each number.

Let me consider the binary representations:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (which is 1 + 2)

- 4: 100

So, XOR-ing these numbers would involve bitwise XOR of their binary representations.

Wait, but since 3 is just 1 XOR 2, and 4 is independent, maybe I can think in terms of the counts of these numbers and how their XORs combine.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula that can help me determine the XOR of the entire sequence based on the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

First, let's consider that XOR is associative and commutative, so the order doesn't matter.

Let's think about the XOR of multiple numbers:

- XOR of even counts of any number is zero.

- XOR of odd counts of a number is the number itself.

So, if I have an even number of 1s, their XOR is zero; if odd, it's 1.

Similarly for 2s, 3s, and 4s.

But since 3 is 1 XOR 2, I need to account for that.

Wait, actually, 3 is binary 011, which is 1 (001) XOR 2 (010).

So, if I have a sequence with certain counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4, I need to compute the XOR of all these numbers together.

Let me try to compute the total XOR step by step.

Let me denote:

- c1: count of 1s

- c2: count of 2s

- c3: count of 3s

- c4: count of 4s

I need to find XOR of c1*1 XOR c2*2 XOR c3*3 XOR c4*4.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, and that XOR-ing a number with itself cancels out (i.e., even counts of a number result in zero), I can consider only the parity (odd or even) of the counts.

Wait, but 3 is 1 XOR 2, so c3*3 is c3*(1 XOR 2).

So, the total XOR would be (c1 mod 2)*1 XOR (c2 mod 2)*2 XOR (c3 mod 2)*(1 XOR 2) XOR (c4 mod 2)*4.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, since XOR is linear over each bit, I can consider each bit separately.

So, for each bit position, I can count the number of 1s in that bit position across all numbers and then take the parity.

For example:

- Bit 0: 1 has 1, 2 has 0, 3 has 1, 4 has 0

- Bit 1: 1 has 0, 2 has 1, 3 has 1, 4 has 0

- Bit 2: 1 has 0, 2 has 0, 3 has 0, 4 has 1

So, for bit 0: total 1s is c1 + c3

For bit 1: total 1s is c2 + c3

For bit 2: total 1s is c4

Then, the XOR result for each bit is 1 if the count of 1s in that bit is odd, else 0.

So, the final XOR is:

- Bit 0: (c1 + c3) mod 2

- Bit 1: (c2 + c3) mod 2

- Bit 2: c4 mod 2

So, the XOR result is:

((c4 mod 2) * 4) XOR ((c2 + c3) mod 2 * 2) XOR ((c1 + c3) mod 2 * 1)

Wait, actually, since XOR is just bitwise, I can represent it directly.

So, the XOR is:

((c4 % 2) * 4) XOR ((c2 + c3) % 2 * 2) XOR ((c1 + c3) % 2 * 1)

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the parities.

Now, the problem is that Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, so she removes numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Given that, I need to find, for each step from n down to 1, whether there's a way to remove one number such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Wait, but actually, Eve removes one number, and then they play with the remaining numbers. Then Eve removes another number, and they play again, and so on, until no numbers are left.

So, it's not that Eve removes one number and then we check the XOR of the remaining numbers, but rather, she removes one number, then another, and after each removal, we check the XOR of the current sequence.

So, starting with n numbers, Eve removes one, leaving n-1, check XOR, then removes another, leaving n-2, check XOR, and so on, until 0.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, I need to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero as Eve removes numbers one by one.

This sounds like a problem where I need to strategically choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of zero XOR states.

But this seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the total number of games played: it's n games, since they play with n numbers, then n-1, and so on, down to 1.

Wait, no, they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 1, but the problem says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers." and so on, until the sequence is empty.

Wait, but when the sequence is empty, there are no numbers to play with, so the last game is with 1 number.

Wait, no, let's read carefully:

- Start with n numbers.

- Play with n numbers.

- Eve removes one number, play with n-1 numbers.

- Eve removes another number, play with n-2 numbers.

- Continue until the sequence is empty.

So, the number of games is n, and the sequence sizes are n, n-1, ..., 1.

Wait, but when the sequence is empty, there are no numbers to play with, so perhaps the last game is with 1 number.

Wait, no, perhaps the games are played with n, n-1, ..., 1 numbers, and then the sequence is empty.

Wait, but the problem says: "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems like there are n games: with n, n-1, ..., 1 numbers, and then the sequence is empty.

But, in programming terms, it's n games with n, n-1, ..., 1 numbers.

But, in terms of XOR, for each game, the XOR is determined by the current sequence.

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, with the goal of maximizing the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

This seems complex because Eve has to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of zero XOR states.

I need to find a way to model this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, but the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, 4, and their counts are given.

Given that, maybe I can precompute the XOR for different subsets.

But that seems too time-consuming, especially since t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to the sum of p_i, which is up to 200*4 = 800 per test case.

Wait, but 10^4 test cases with up to 800 numbers each would be too slow if I try to simulate each removal step.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how removing a number affects the XOR of the sequence.

Let me denote the initial XOR of the entire sequence as XOR_all.

When Eve removes a number x, the new XOR becomes XOR_all XOR x, because removing x is equivalent to XOR-ing with x again (since XOR is its own inverse).

So, after removing x, the new XOR is XOR_all XOR x.

Bob wins if this new XOR is zero.

So, for each possible x that Eve can remove, the condition for Bob to win is XOR_all XOR x == 0, which implies x == XOR_all.

So, for Bob to win after removing x, x must be equal to XOR_all.

Therefore, Eve can make Bob win if and only if there exists an x in the sequence such that x == XOR_all.

So, in each step, if XOR_all is present in the sequence, Eve can choose to remove XOR_all, making the XOR of the remaining sequence zero, and Bob wins. Otherwise, Eve cannot make Bob win in that step.

Therefore, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of steps where XOR_all is present in the sequence.

Now, the sequence changes after each removal, so XOR_all changes accordingly.

Wait, but actually, in each step, Eve looks at the current sequence, computes XOR_all, checks if that value is present in the sequence, and if so, removes it, making Bob win that round.

Then, she removes that number, and the sequence changes for the next round.

I need to simulate this process to find out how many times Bob can win.

But simulating this for up to 800 numbers per test case and 10^4 test cases would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the entire sequence and how the XOR changes as numbers are removed.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4, and their counts are given, perhaps I can find a pattern based on the counts.

Let me recall that 3 is 1 XOR 2, and 4 is independent.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where each number corresponds to a vector in a 3-dimensional space (since 4 is 100 in binary), and the XOR is the sum modulo 2.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the parity of the counts.

Wait, let's try to compute XOR_all based on the counts.

As I thought earlier, XOR_all is determined by the parities of the sums of the counts:

- Bit 0: (c1 + c3) mod 2

- Bit 1: (c2 + c3) mod 2

- Bit 2: c4 mod 2

So, XOR_all is:

((c4 % 2) * 4) XOR ((c2 + c3) % 2 * 2) XOR ((c1 + c3) % 2 * 1)

Which simplifies to:

((c4 % 2) * 4) + ((c2 + c3) % 2 * 2) + ((c1 + c3) % 2 * 1)

Since XOR is just addition modulo 2 in each bit.

Now, to maximize the number of times Bob wins, Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that XOR_all is present in the sequence as often as possible.

Given that XOR_all must be equal to one of the numbers being removed, which are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So, in each step, if XOR_all is equal to one of the numbers present in the sequence, Eve can remove that number, making Bob win that round.

Otherwise, Bob cannot win that round.

So, I need to simulate the process of removing numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times XOR_all is present in the sequence.

But simulating this directly is too slow for the time constraints.

I need to find a mathematical formula or a pattern that allows me to compute the maximum number of Bob's wins without simulating each removal.

Let me consider that the sequence starts with certain counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

As Eve removes numbers, the counts decrease, and XOR_all changes accordingly.

I need to find a way to count how many times XOR_all is equal to one of the numbers present in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of times each possible XOR_all value is achievable, and then see how many times it matches one of the numbers present.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is determined by the parities of the counts, as I calculated earlier.

So, perhaps I can think about the sequence of XOR_all values as numbers are removed.

But this still seems too involved.

Let me look for patterns or properties that can help me find a direct formula.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

So, for the first test case, with 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, and 0 fours, Bob wins only once.

Similarly, for the second test case, Bob wins once.

For the third and fourth test cases, Bob wins three times each.

For the fifth test case, Bob wins twelve times.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can produce these outputs based on the inputs.

Looking at the counts:

First test case: 1,1,1,0

Total numbers: 3

Bob wins once.

Second test case:1,0,1,2

Total numbers: 4

Bob wins once.

Third test case:2,2,2,0

Total numbers:6

Bob wins three times.

Fourth test case:3,3,2,0

Total numbers:8

Bob wins three times.

Fifth test case:0,9,9,9

Total numbers:27

Bob wins twelve times.

Looking at the relationship between the counts and the number of Bob's wins, it seems that in some cases, it's half the total numbers rounded down, but that doesn't hold for all cases.

For example, in the first test case, total numbers are 3, and Bob wins once, which is floor(3/2) = 1.

Second test case: 4 numbers, Bob wins once, but floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Third test case:6 numbers, floor(6/2)=3, and output is 3.

Fourth test case:8 numbers, floor(8/2)=4, but output is 3.

Fifth test case:27 numbers, floor(27/2)=13, but output is 12.

So, it's not exactly floor(n/2), but close.

Perhaps it's floor(n/2) minus something.

Looking at the differences:

- Test case 1: floor(3/2)=1, output=1 → difference=0

- Test case 2: floor(4/2)=2, output=1 → difference=1

- Test case 3: floor(6/2)=3, output=3 → difference=0

- Test case 4: floor(8/2)=4, output=3 → difference=1

- Test case 5: floor(27/2)=13, output=12 → difference=1

So, in some cases, it's floor(n/2), in others, floor(n/2)-1.

But looking closer, perhaps it's related to whether the XOR_all is zero at some point.

Wait, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_all is zero during the process.

But according to the problem, Bob wins when XOR_all is zero.

Wait, but in the first test case, with 1,1,1,0, total numbers=3, Bob wins once.

Let's compute XOR_all for this case:

c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

XOR_all = ((0 % 2)*4) XOR ((1 + 1) % 2 *2) XOR ((1 + 1) % 2 *1) = (0) XOR (0*2) XOR (0*1) = 0

So, initially, XOR_all is 0, so Bob wins the first game.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, now c1=0, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

XOR_all = (0%2)*4 XOR (1+1)%2*2 XOR (0+1)%2*1 = 0 XOR 0*2 XOR 1*1 = 0 XOR 0 XOR 1 =1

Now, XOR_all=1, which is not zero, so Bob doesn't win this game.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, now c1=0, c2=0, c3=1, c4=0

XOR_all = (0%2)*4 XOR (0+1)%2*2 XOR (0+1)%2*1 = 0 XOR 1*2 XOR 1*1 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 =3

Now, XOR_all=3, which is not zero, so Bob doesn't win this game.

Then, Eve removes the last number, 3, and the sequence is empty.

So, only once Bob wins, which matches the first output.

Similarly, for the second test case:1,0,1,2

Total numbers=4

Initial XOR_all: c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

XOR_all = (2%2)*4 XOR (0+1)%2*2 XOR (1+1)%2*1 = 0 XOR 1*2 XOR 0*1 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 0 =2

Now, 2 is present in the sequence (since c2=0, but c3=1, and 3 is 1 XOR 2, but specifically, there are no 2s initially, c2=0.

Wait, c2=0, but c3=1, which represents 3, which is 1 XOR 2.

Wait, but in the sequence, there is one 1, one 3, and two 4s.

So, the sequence is [1,3,4,4]

XOR_all=1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 =1 XOR 3 XOR 0=1 XOR 3=2

So, XOR_all=2, which is not present in the sequence (since c2=0), so Bob doesn't win this round.

Then, Eve removes one number. She wants to make XOR_all zero in the next step.

If she removes 1, sequence becomes [3,4,4], XOR_all=3 XOR 4 XOR 4=3 XOR 0=3, which is not zero.

If she removes 3, sequence becomes [1,4,4], XOR_all=1 XOR 4 XOR 4=1 XOR 0=1, not zero.

If she removes 4, sequence becomes [1,3,4], XOR_all=1 XOR 3 XOR 4=1 XOR 3 XOR 4=2 XOR 4=6, not zero.

If she removes another 4, same as above.

So, no matter which number she removes, XOR_all is not zero in the next step.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Bob wins once in this test case.

But according to my simulation, Bob doesn't win in the first step, and in the second step, no matter what Eve removes, XOR_all is not zero.

So, perhaps Bob doesn't win any time in this test case.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts my simulation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, XOR_all is 2, which is not present in the sequence (since c2=0), so Bob doesn't win.

Then, Eve removes one number.

Suppose she removes 1, sequence becomes [3,4,4], XOR_all=3 XOR 4 XOR 4=3 XOR 0=3

3 is present in the sequence (c3=1), so Eve can remove 3, making XOR_all=4 XOR 4=0, so Bob wins this step.

Then, sequence is [4,4], XOR_all=4 XOR 4=0, which is zero, so Bob wins again.

Then, Eve removes one 4, sequence is [4], XOR_all=4, which is not zero, so Bob doesn't win.

Then, remove the last 4, sequence is empty.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Initial sequence: [1,3,4,4], XOR_all=2, which is not present in the sequence (c2=0), so Bob doesn't win the first game.

Eve removes one number.

Option 1: remove 1, sequence becomes [3,4,4], XOR_all=3 XOR 4 XOR 4=3

Now, 3 is present in the sequence, so Eve can remove 3, making XOR_all=4 XOR 4=0, so Bob wins this game.

Then, sequence is [4,4], XOR_all=0, which is present (since there are no 0s in the sequence, but 0 is the XOR of 4 and 4), but wait, the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, so 0 isn't present in the sequence.

Wait, but XOR_all is 0, so Bob wins regardless of whether 0 is in the sequence.

Wait, no, according to the problem, Bob wins if the XOR of the numbers is zero, regardless of whether 0 is in the sequence.

So, in this case, with [4,4], XOR_all=0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one 4, sequence is [4], XOR_all=4, which is not zero, so Bob doesn't win.

Then, remove the last 4, sequence is empty, XOR_all=0, so Bob wins again.

Wait, but an empty sequence has XOR_all=0, so Bob wins again.

But according to the sample output, it's only 1 for this test case.

But according to this simulation, Bob wins twice.

Wait, perhaps the last step with the empty sequence doesn't count, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence, after which Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 1 number, and then the sequence is empty.

So, there are n games in total.

In each game, after removing one number, they play with the remaining numbers.

So, in the last step, with 1 number left, they play, then Eve removes it, and the sequence is empty.

But the problem says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems like they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 1 number, and then the sequence is empty.

But in the empty sequence, there's no game to play, so perhaps the last step doesn't count.

In that case, for n=4, they play with 4,3,2,1 numbers, total 4 games.

In my simulation, Bob wins when there are 2 numbers and when there is 0 number.

But according to the sample output, it's only 1.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a game where Bob can win.

So, perhaps only when there is at least one number.

Then, in the last step, with 1 number, if XOR is zero, Bob wins, but with 0 numbers, it's not counted.

In that case, in my simulation, Bob wins only once, when there are 2 numbers.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my simulation accordingly.

Anyway, this simulation is too time-consuming for the time constraints.

I need a better approach.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of times XOR_all is zero during the process.

But I need to maximize that by choosing which number to remove at each step.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using the properties of XOR and the counts of each number.

Given that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and their counts are given, perhaps I can find a formula based on the parities of the counts.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is determined by the parities of the sums as I calculated earlier:

XOR_all = ((c4 % 2)*4) XOR ((c2 + c3) % 2 *2) XOR ((c1 + c3) % 2 *1)

Now, Bob wins when XOR_all is zero.

So, in each step, if XOR_all is zero, Bob wins.

Eve can choose to remove any number present in the sequence.

After removing a number, the counts decrease, and XOR_all changes accordingly.

I need to maximize the number of times XOR_all is zero.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the binary representation and linear algebra.

Given that XOR is linear over GF(2), maybe I can model this as a system of linear equations.

But that might be too slow for the time constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_all is zero, which occurs when certain conditions on the counts are met.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case:1 1 1 0 → output 1

Second test case:1 0 1 2 → output 1

Third test case:2 2 2 0 → output 3

Fourth test case:3 3 2 0 → output 3

Fifth test case:0 9 9 9 → output 12

Looking at the total numbers:

First:3 →1

Second:4 →1

Third:6 →3

Fourth:8 →3

Fifth:27 →12

Looking for a pattern:

In the third test case, with 6 numbers, Bob wins 3 times.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, with 27 numbers, Bob wins 12 times.

12 is floor(27/2)=13, but output is 12.

In the fourth test case, with 8 numbers, Bob wins 3 times, which is floor(8/2)=4, but output is 3.

In the second test case, with 4 numbers, floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

In the first test case, with 3 numbers, floor(3/2)=1, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is floor(n/2) minus something.

Looking at the differences:

For n=3, floor(3/2)=1, output=1 → difference=0

n=4, floor(4/2)=2, output=1 → difference=1

n=6, floor(6/2)=3, output=3 → difference=0

n=8, floor(8/2)=4, output=3 → difference=1

n=27, floor(27/2)=13, output=12 → difference=1

So, in some cases, it's floor(n/2), in others, floor(n/2)-1.

Perhaps it's floor(n/2) minus the number of times XOR_all is non-zero in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of times XOR_all is zero, which depends on the counts.

Wait, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_all is zero, which occurs when certain conditions on the counts are met.

Looking back at the formula for XOR_all:

XOR_all = ((c4 % 2)*4) XOR ((c2 + c3) % 2 *2) XOR ((c1 + c3) % 2 *1)

Bob wins when this is zero.

So, XOR_all =0 when:

((c4 % 2)*4) XOR ((c2 + c3) % 2 *2) XOR ((c1 + c3) % 2 *1) =0

Which implies that each bit is zero.

So, for bit 0: (c1 + c3) % 2 ==0

Bit 1: (c2 + c3) % 2 ==0

Bit 2: c4 % 2 ==0

So, XOR_all is zero when:

(c1 + c3) is even,

(c2 + c3) is even,

c4 is even.

So, Bob wins when these three conditions are satisfied.

Now, Eve can remove one number at a time, and she wants to maximize the number of times these conditions are satisfied.

So, in each step, if the current counts satisfy these conditions, Bob wins, and Eve can choose to remove any number.

Then, the counts are updated, and the process continues.

But this is still too slow to simulate for large n.

I need a smarter way to count how many times these conditions are satisfied as numbers are removed.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of steps where all three conditions are met.

But how to count that efficiently?

Let me consider that each removal changes the counts, and thus may affect the parity conditions.

But since the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and each has specific effects on the parities.

For example:

- Removing 1: c1 -=1 → affects bit 0: (c1 + c3) %2

- Removing 2: c2 -=1 → affects bit 1: (c2 + c3) %2

- Removing 3: c3 -=1 → affects bit 0: (c1 + c3) %2 and bit 1: (c2 + c3) %2

- Removing 4: c4 -=1 → affects bit 2: c4 %2

So, each removal affects specific parity conditions.

This seems like a state machine where each state is determined by the parities of the counts.

Given that, there are 2^3=8 possible states for the parities:

- bit 0: (c1 + c3) %2

- bit 1: (c2 + c3) %2

- bit 2: c4 %2

So, there are 8 possible states, each corresponding to a specific combination of parities.

Bob wins when the state is (0,0,0).

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the state is (0,0,0).

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are the states, and edges represent the removal of a number, leading to a new state.

Then, the problem reduces to finding a path from the initial state to the empty state (which would be all parities zero, but with no numbers left), such that the number of times the state is (0,0,0) is maximized.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in each step, Eve can choose to remove a number that, if possible, makes the XOR_all zero.

But from the earlier analysis, XOR_all is zero when (c1 + c3) even, (c2 + c3) even, and c4 even.

So, if Eve can remove a number that makes these conditions true, Bob wins that round.

Now, I need to find out how many such opportunities Eve can create by choosing which number to remove at each step.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of times the conditions are met during the entire process.

Given that, maybe I can compute the number of times all three parity conditions are satisfied as numbers are removed.

But I need to maximize that count.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to floor(n/2), but adjusted based on the initial parities.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

Test case 1:1 1 1 0 → n=3, floor(3/2)=1, output=1

Test case 2:1 0 1 2 → n=4, floor(4/2)=2, but output=1

Test case 3:2 2 2 0 → n=6, floor(6/2)=3, output=3

Test case 4:3 3 2 0 → n=8, floor(8/2)=4, but output=3

Test case 5:0 9 9 9 → n=27, floor(27/2)=13, but output=12

So, in some cases, it's floor(n/2), in others, floor(n/2)-1.

Perhaps it's floor(n/2) minus the number of times the initial parities don't allow XOR_all to be zero.

Wait, in test case 2, n=4, floor(4/2)=2, output=1, which is floor(n/2)-1.

In test case 4, n=8, floor(8/2)=4, output=3, which is floor(n/2)-1.

In test case 5, n=27, floor(27/2)=13, output=12, which is floor(n/2)-1.

In test case 1, n=3, floor(3/2)=1, output=1, which is floor(n/2).

In test case 3, n=6, floor(6/2)=3, output=3, which is floor(n/2).

So, perhaps the formula is floor(n/2) minus something that depends on the initial parities.

Let me see.

Define S = floor(n/2)

Then, if initial parities satisfy certain conditions, the number of Bob's wins is S or S-1.

Looking at the initial parities:

Define:

p0 = (c1 + c3) %2

p1 = (c2 + c3) %2

p2 = c4 %2

In the initial state, if p0=p1=p2=0, then XOR_all=0, Bob wins the first game.

Otherwise, Bob doesn't win the first game.

Then, in the next steps, the parities change based on which number is removed.

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to floor(n/2) minus the number of non-zero parities in the initial state.

But that doesn't seem to fit the sample inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(n/2) minus a value based on whether the initial XOR_all is zero or not.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(n/2) minus k, where k is the number of times the initial parities are non-zero.

But in test case 1, n=3, S=1, and initial parities are p0=(1+1)%2=0, p1=(1+1)%2=0, p2=0%2=0, all zero, so k=0, then number of wins=1-0=1, which matches the sample.

In test case 2, n=4, S=2, initial parities p0=(1+1)%2=0, p1=(0+1)%2=1, p2=2%2=0, so k=1, number of wins=2-1=1, matches the sample.

In test case 3, n=6, S=3, initial parities p0=(2+2)%2=0, p1=(2+2)%2=0, p2=0%2=0, k=0, number of wins=3-0=3, matches the sample.

In test case 4, n=8, S=4, initial parities p0=(3+2)%2=1, p1=(3+2)%2=1, p2=0%2=0, k=2, number of wins=4-1=3, but according to my formula, it would be 4-1=3, which matches the sample.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, k is the number of non-zero parities, but in test case 4, k=2, but the number of wins is 3, which is S-1=3.

Wait, perhaps it's S minus floor(k/2).

In test case 4, S=4, k=2, floor(2/2)=1, so number of wins=4-1=3, matches the sample.

In test case 2, S=2, k=1, floor(1/2)=0, so number of wins=2-0=2, but sample is 1.

Wait, doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's S minus ceil(k/2).

In test case 2, S=2, k=1, ceil(1/2)=1, number of wins=2-1=1, matches the sample.

In test case 4, S=4, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, number of wins=4-1=3, matches the sample.

In test case 1, S=1, k=0, ceil(0/2)=0, number of wins=1-0=1, matches the sample.

In test case 3, S=3, k=0, number of wins=3-0=3, matches the sample.

In test case 5, S=13, k= ??

Wait, for test case 5:0 9 9 9

p0=(0+9)%2=1

p1=(9+9)%2=0

p2=9%2=1

So, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, number of wins=13-1=12, matches the sample.

So, it seems that the formula is:

Number of Bob's wins = floor(n/2) - ceil(k/2), where k is the number of non-zero parities in the initial state.

Wait, but in test case 2, S=2, k=1, ceil(1/2)=1, number of wins=2-1=1, matches.

In test case 4, S=4, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, number of wins=4-1=3, matches.

In test case 5, S=13, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, number of wins=13-1=12, matches.

In test case 1, S=1, k=0, ceil(0/2)=0, number of wins=1-0=1, matches.

In test case 3, S=3, k=0, number of wins=3-0=3, matches.

So, this formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the maximum number of times Bob can win is floor(n/2) - ceil(k/2), where k is the number of non-zero parities in the initial state.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

1. Compute n = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4

2. Compute S = floor(n/2)

3. Compute p0 = (c1 + c3) %2

p1 = (c2 + c3) %2

p2 = c4 %2

4. Compute k = number of non-zero parities among p0, p1, p2

5. Compute ceil(k/2)

6. Number of Bob's wins = S - ceil(k/2)

But, in programming terms, ceil(k/2) is (k +1 ) //2

So, the formula becomes:

Number of Bob's wins = floor(n/2) - (k +1 ) //2

But, need to ensure that k is correctly calculated.

Wait, but in test case 2, k=1, ceil(1/2)=1, which is (1+1)//2=1, correct.

In test case 4, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, which is (2+1)//2=1, correct.

In test case 5, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, which is (2+1)//2=1, correct.

In test case 1, k=0, ceil(0/2)=0, which is (0+1)//2=0, correct.

In test case 3, k=0, ceil(0/2)=0, which is (0+1)//2=0, correct.

So, this formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the final formula is:

Number of Bob's wins = floor(n/2) - (k +1 ) //2

Where k is the number of non-zero parities among p0, p1, p2.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Read t test cases

- For each test case:

- Read p0, p1, p2, p3 (counts of 1,2,3,4)

- Compute n = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3

- Compute S = n // 2

- Compute p0 = (p0 + p2) %2

p1 = (p1 + p2) %2

p2 = p3 %2

- Compute k = number of non-zero parities among p0, p1, p2

- Compute number of Bob's wins = S - (k +1 ) //2

- Print the result

Wait, but in test case 2, p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, k=2, (2+1)//2=1, S=2, number of wins=2-1=1, matches.

In test case 4, p0=3+2=5%2=1, p1=3+2=5%2=1, p2=0%2=0, k=2, (2+1)//2=1, S=4, number of wins
