Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each organized in a 5x3 grid, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take 1x1 cells and others take 2x2 cells (which would occupy 4 cells). The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to figure out how to optimally place these icons on the screens to minimize the number of screens used. Since 2x2 icons take up more space, I should prioritize placing them first.

Let's think about the capacity of one screen. Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon uses 1 cell.

I need to maximize the usage of each screen by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

But there's a constraint: the 2x2 icons must fit within the grid without overlapping, and without going outside the grid boundaries.

Let's visualize the grid. It's 5 rows and 3 columns:

Row 1: Cell (1,1) | Cell (1,2) | Cell (1,3)

Row 2: Cell (2,1) | Cell (2,2) | Cell (2,3)

Row 3: Cell (3,1) | Cell (3,2) | Cell (3,3)

Row 4: Cell (4,1) | Cell (4,2) | Cell (4,3)

Row 5: Cell (5,1) | Cell (5,2) | Cell (5,3)

A 2x2 icon would occupy a block of 4 cells in a square. Given the grid dimensions, how many 2x2 icons can fit in one screen?

Looking at the columns, since there are only 3 columns, a 2x2 icon can be placed in columns 1-2 or 2-3, but not overlapping beyond the grid.

Similarly, in rows, with 5 rows, a 2x2 icon can be placed in rows 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.

So, for columns, options for 2x2 icons are positions covering columns 1-2 or 2-3.

Similarly for rows, positions covering rows 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.

Now, how many 2x2 icons can fit in one screen without overlapping?

Let's consider placing them in non-overlapping positions.

If I place one 2x2 icon in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2, that would occupy cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Then, another 2x2 icon could be placed in rows 1-2 and columns 2-3, occupying cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). But this overlaps with the first icon on cells (1,2) and (2,2), which is not allowed.

So, they can't be placed side by side in the same rows.

Alternatively, placing them in different rows.

If I place one 2x2 icon in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2, and another in rows 3-4 and columns 1-2, that would be non-overlapping.

Similarly, I could place a third 2x2 icon in rows 3-4 and columns 2-3.

Wait, but rows 3-4 and columns 2-3 would occupy cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), which don't overlap with the first two.

So, in one screen, it seems possible to place up to 3 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Let me confirm:

- First 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 1-2 (cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2))

- Second 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 1-2 (cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2))

- Third 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 2-3 (cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3))

Wait a minute, there's overlapping between the second and third icons on cells (3,2) and (4,2). That's a problem.

So, they cannot both be placed like that.

Alternative placement:

- First 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 1-2

- Second 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 1-2

- Third 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 2-3

But the first and third would overlap on cells (1,2) and (2,2).

Another try:

- First 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 1-2

- Second 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 2-3

- Third 2x2: rows 4-5, columns 1-2

But then the second and third would overlap on cells (4,2) and (4,3).

It seems challenging to place more than two 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Let me try with two 2x2 icons per screen.

For example:

- First 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 1-2

- Second 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 2-3

These don't overlap.

Similarly, in rows 4-5, I could place another 2x2 in columns 1-2, but that would overlap with the second icon on cells (4,2) and (4,3).

So, perhaps only two 2x2 icons per screen without overlapping.

Let me check the example in the problem.

In the first test case, x=1, y=1.

According to the output, it's 1 screen.

So, one 1x1 and one 2x2 on the same screen.

That makes sense, since two 2x2 icons wouldn't fit without overlapping, but one 2x2 and one 1x1 can coexist.

Looking at the grid:

The 2x2 icon takes cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

The 1x1 icon can be placed in any of the remaining cells, say (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), etc.

So, that works.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4.

Output is 2 screens.

So, total icons: 12 1x1 and 4 2x2.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

If each screen has 2 2x2 icons, that's 8 cells used per screen for 2x2 icons.

So, 15 - 8 = 7 cells left for 1x1 icons per screen.

So, two screens can hold 4 2x2 icons and 14 1x1 icons.

But we only have 4 2x2 and 12 1x1, which fits within two screens.

Makes sense.

Another test case: x=0, y=9.

Output is 5 screens.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

So, 2 per screen, 9 icons would require 5 screens (since 4 screens would hold 8 icons, needing one more for the remaining 1 icon).

Okay, that aligns.

So, the strategy seems to be:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

2. Then, check if the remaining space on those screens can accommodate the 1x1 icons; if not, additional screens may be needed.

But in the examples provided, it seems that the number of screens is primarily determined by the number of 2x2 icons, with the 1x1 icons fitting into the remaining space.

Let's formalize this.

Let y be the number of 2x2 icons.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

So, the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, we need to see if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space on these screens.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

So, if a screen has 2 2x2 icons, it uses 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If a screen has 1 2x2 icon, it uses 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If a screen has no 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, with s screens, the maximum number of 1x1 icons that can be placed is:

s * (15 - 4 * number_of_2x2_icons_per_screen)

Given that we're using ceil(y / 2) screens for the 2x2 icons, we need to check if the remaining space can accommodate x 1x1 icons.

If not, we need additional screens.

But in the examples, it seems that ceil(y / 2) is sufficient, as long as x doesn't exceed the remaining space.

Wait, in the third test case, x=12, y=4.

Number of screens for y: ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

Each screen with 2 2x2 icons has 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

So, total remaining cells: 2 * 7 = 14, which is more than x=12.

Hence, 2 screens suffice.

In the last test case, x=0, y=9.

Number of screens for y: ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, except possibly the last one, which would hold only 1.

But since x=0, no need to worry about 1x1 icons.

Hence, 5 screens are needed.

Another test case: x=1, y=0.

Output should be 1, since 1 1x1 icon can fit on a screen.

x=0, y=0.

Output is 0, which makes sense.

x=15, y=0.

Output is 1, as 15 1x1 icons fit perfectly on one screen.

x=16, y=0.

Would need 2 screens.

So, general approach:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: s = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate the remaining space on these s screens: remaining_cells = s * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

- If x <= remaining_cells, then s screens are sufficient.

- Else, need additional screens to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

- The number of additional screens needed: a = ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)

- Total screens: s + a

But need to handle cases where y is not perfectly divisible by 2.

Wait, in the first test case, y=1.

s = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

remaining_cells = 1 * (15 - 4 * 1) = 11

x=1 <= 11, so s=1 is sufficient.

In the second test case, x=7, y=2.

s = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

remaining_cells = 1 * (15 - 4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7

x=7 <= 7, so s=1 is sufficient.

Third test case, x=12, y=4.

s = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

remaining_cells = 2 * (15 - 4 * 2) = 2 * 7 = 14

x=12 <= 14, so s=2 is sufficient.

Fourth test case, x=0, y=3.

s = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

remaining_cells = 2 * (15 - 4 * 2) = 14

x=0 <= 14, so s=2 is sufficient.

Fifth test case, x=1, y=0.

s = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

remaining_cells = 0 * 15 = 0

x=1 > 0, so a = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Total screens: 0 + 1 = 1

Sixth test case, x=8, y=1.

s = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

remaining_cells = 1 * (15 - 4 * 1) = 11

x=8 <= 11, so s=1 is sufficient.

Seventh test case, x=0, y=0.

s = 0

remaining_cells = 0

x=0 <= 0, so total screens = 0

Eighth test case, x=2, y=0.

s=0

remaining_cells=0

x=2 > 0, so a=1

Total screens=1

Ninth test case, x=15, y=0.

s=0

remaining_cells=0

x=15 == 15, so a=1

But according to the example, output is 1, which matches.

Tenth test case, x=8, y=2.

s=ceil(2/2)=1

remaining_cells=1*(15-8)=7

x=8 >7, so a=ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens=1+1=2

Eleventh test case, x=0, y=9.

s=ceil(9/2)=5

remaining_cells=5*(15-8)=35

x=0<=35, so total screens=5

This seems consistent with the example outputs.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

- s = ceil(y / 2)

- remaining_cells = s * (15 - 4 * min(2, y_per_screen))

But need to adjust y_per_screen.

Wait, in the calculation above, y_per_screen is min(2, y), but need to handle cases where y is odd.

More accurately:

- If y <= 0: s = 0

- Else: s = ceil(y / 2)

Then, remaining_cells = s * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

Wait, no. It's s * (15 - 4 * 2) when y >=2 per screen, otherwise s * (15 - 4 * 1)

But since s is ceil(y / 2), and each screen gets up to 2 y's, need to calculate remaining_cells accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total cells used by y 2x2 icons and see how many screens are needed, then see the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.

Total cells used by y 2x2 icons: 4y cells.

Each screen can hold up to 15 cells.

But since 2x2 icons must be placed in a specific way, not just any 4 cells.

But for simplicity, perhaps we can assume that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- If y_per_screen = 2:

- 8 cells used by 2x2 icons

- Remaining 7 cells for 1x1 icons

- If y_per_screen =1:

- 4 cells used by 1 2x2 icon

- Remaining 11 cells for 1x1 icons

- If y_per_screen =0:

- 0 cells used by 2x2 icons

- 15 cells for 1x1 icons

Now, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, which is 2.

So, s = ceil(y / 2)

Then, total remaining cells for 1x1 icons across s screens: s * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

Wait, more accurately: s * (15 - 8) = s *7 if y >=2 per screen.

But need to handle cases where y is not perfectly divisible by 2.

For example, if y=5, then s=3.

In these 3 screens:

- Two screens have 2 2x2 icons each (using 8 cells per screen)

- One screen has 1 2x2 icon (using 4 cells)

So, total cells used by 2x2 icons: 2*8 +4=20 cells

Total cells available for 1x1 icons: 2*7 +11=25 cells

Then, if x <=25, s=3 is sufficient.

Else, need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seemed that s*7 was used, but that might not always be accurate.

Wait, in the case above, with y=5, s=3, remaining cells are 2*7 +11=25.

But according to the earlier formula, s*(15-8)=3*7=21, which is less than 25.

So, the formula needs adjustment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of screens needed based on the total cells required divided by 15, considering the constraints of placing 2x2 icons.

But that might be too involved.

An alternative approach is to iterate over the number of screens and check if the given number of screens can accommodate y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons.

But since t can be up to 10^4, and a single test case might require up to, say, 100 screens (for y=99), this could be inefficient.

We need a smarter way.

Looking back, in the initial approach, s=ceil(y /2), and then check if the remaining cells can fit x 1x1 icons.

If not, add additional screens, each of which can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, additional screens a=ceil(max(x - s*(15-4*min(2,y_per_screen)),0)/15)

But need to adjust for y_per_screen.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total remaining cells as s*(15 - 8) if s*2 <=y, else adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total cells used by 2x2 icons and the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons.

Total cells used by y 2x2 icons: 4y cells.

Each screen can hold up to 15 cells, but placing 2x2 icons has constraints due to their shape, so it's not just about cell counting.

But for estimation, perhaps we can assume that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- If y_per_screen =2:

- 8 cells used by 2x2 icons

- Remaining 7 cells for 1x1 icons

- If y_per_screen=1:

- 4 cells used by 1 2x2 icon

- Remaining 11 cells for 1x1 icons

- If y_per_screen=0:

- 0 cells used by 2x2 icons

- 15 cells for 1x1 icons

So, for s screens:

- Number of screens with 2 2x2 icons: floor(y /2)

- Number of screens with 1 2x2 icon: y %2

Then, total remaining cells:

= (floor(y /2)) *7 + (y %2)*11

Wait, no.

Wait, if s=ceil(y /2), then:

- Number of screens with 2 2x2 icons: floor(y /2)

- Number of screens with 1 2x2 icon: y %2

So, total remaining cells:

= (floor(y /2)) *7 + (y %2)*11

Then, if x <= total remaining cells, s is sufficient.

Else, need additional screens to hold the remaining 1x1 icons.

Additional screens: a=ceil((x - total_remaining_cells)/15)

Total screens: s + a

This seems more accurate.

Let's test this with the third test case: x=12, y=4.

s=ceil(4/2)=2

floor(4/2)=2

y%2=0

total_remaining_cells=2*7 +0*11=14

x=12<=14, so s=2 is sufficient.

Another test case: x=8, y=2.

s=1

floor(1)=1

y%2=0

total_remaining_cells=1*7 +0*11=7

x=8>7, so a=ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens:1+1=2

But according to the example, output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, in the example, for x=8, y=1, output is1.

Wait, in the given output sequence:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

5

Assuming the inputs are in the order given:

1 1 ->1

7 2 ->1

12 4 ->2

0 3 ->2

1 0 ->1

8 1 ->1

0 0 ->0

2 0 ->1

15 0 ->1

8 2 ->2

0 9 ->5

Wait, for x=8, y=1, output is1.

But according to my calculation:

s=ceil(1/2)=1

floor(1)=0

y%2=1

total_remaining_cells=0*7 +1*11=11

x=8<=11, so s=1 is sufficient.

Okay, that matches the example.

Wait, earlier I thought x=8, y=2 would require s=1 and a=1, but according to the example, for x=8, y=2, output is1.

Wait, no, in the example, x=8, y=2 is the tenth test case, which has output2.

Wait, looking back:

Input:

So, for x=8,
