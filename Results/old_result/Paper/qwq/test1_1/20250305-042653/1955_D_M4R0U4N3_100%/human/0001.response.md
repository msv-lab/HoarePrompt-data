Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But wait, it says "match the elements of array b," which might imply that the values are the same, not necessarily their positions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding. In the first test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 2

a = [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4]

We need to consider all subsegments of a of length 4:

1. [4,1,2,3] - can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b in all elements.

2. [1,2,3,4] - already matches b.

3. [2,3,4,5] - can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has three elements matching b: 2,3,4.

4. [3,4,5,6] - can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has two elements matching b: 3,4.

Since k=2, all these subsegments are good because they have at least two elements matching b.

In the second test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 3

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] - matches all four elements.

2. [1,2,3,4] - matches all four.

3. [2,3,4,5] - matches three elements: 2,3,4.

4. [3,4,5,6] - matches two elements: 3,4.

Only the first three subsegments have at least three matching elements, so ans=3.

Third test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 4

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] - matches all four.

2. [1,2,3,4] - matches all four.

3. [2,3,4,5] - matches three elements.

4. [3,4,5,6] - matches two elements.

Only the first two subsegments have at least four matching elements, so ans=2.

Fourth test case:

n = 11, m = 5, k = 3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

We need to find subsegments of length 5 with at least three elements matching b.

Let's list the subsegments:

1. [9,9,2,2,10] - matches 9,9,10 (three elements).

2. [9,2,2,10,9] - matches 9,9,10 (three elements).

3. [2,2,10,9,7] - matches 2,10,9,7 (four elements).

4. [2,10,9,7,6] - matches 10,9,7,6 (four elements).

5. [10,9,7,6,3] - matches 10,9,7,6 (four elements).

6. [9,7,6,3,6] - matches 9,7,6 (three elements).

7. [7,6,3,6,3] - matches 7,6 (two elements).

So, subsegments starting at positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are good, but only positions 1,2,3,4,5 have at least three matching elements. Wait, but the output says 4. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps there are only four positions where at least three elements match. Let's check again.

1. [9,9,2,2,10] - matches 9,9,10 (three elements).

2. [9,2,2,10,9] - matches 9,10,9 (three elements).

3. [2,2,10,9,7] - matches 2,10,9,7 (four elements).

4. [2,10,9,7,6] - matches 2,10,9,7,6 (five elements).

5. [10,9,7,6,3] - matches 10,9,7,6 (four elements).

6. [9,7,6,3,6] - matches 9,7,6 (three elements).

7. [7,6,3,6,3] - matches 7,6 (two elements).

So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are good, but position 6 has only two matches, which is less than k=3. Wait, but in the output, it's 4. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in position 6: [9,7,6,3,6] - matches 9,7,6 (three elements). Yes, that's correct.

So, ans=4.

Fifth test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a=[4,1,5,6]

b=[6]

We need subsegments of length 1 from a that match at least one element in b.

Subsegments:

1. [4] - doesn't match 6.

2. [1] - doesn't match 6.

3. [5] - doesn't match 6.

4. [6] - matches 6.

Only one subsegment is good, so ans=1.

Okay, now I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints:

- t <= 10^4

- n and m can be up to 2*10^5 each, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, and similarly for m.

So, per test case, n and m can be up to 2*10^5, but across all test cases, the total n and m are limited to 2*10^5.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, but with the sum of n and m across all test cases being 2*10^5, it implies that individual test cases have small n and m.

But wait, the problem says "the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5," and similarly for m.

So, overall, we have up to 2*10^5 elements to process.

Given that, I need an efficient way to process each test case without exceeding time limits.

Let me think about the sliding window approach, since we're dealing with subsegments of a fixed length m.

I need to slide a window of size m over array a and, for each window, check if there are at least k elements that are present in b.

But since b can have duplicates, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Wait, b can have duplicates, so I need to keep track of the count of each element in b.

Similarly, in the window of a, I need to count how many elements are in b, considering the frequency.

Wait, but the problem says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's not about the elements being equal, but about being able to rearrange c to have at least k elements that match b in value.

Given that, I think it's about having at least k elements in the window that are present in b, with frequency considered.

Wait, but in the example, b=[1,2,3,4], and in a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], the first window [4,1,2,3] can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b in all elements.

Similarly, [1,2,3,4] matches directly.

[2,3,4,5] can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has three elements matching b: 2,3,4.

[3,4,5,6] can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has two elements matching b: 3,4.

So, it seems that we need to count, in each window, how many elements are present in b, regardless of their frequency, as long as they exist in b.

But wait, b can have duplicates. For example, if b=[1,1,2,2], and a's window is [1,1,2,2], that would match all four elements.

But if a's window is [1,2,3,4], it would only match two elements (1 and 2), even if b has duplicates.

So, I need to consider the frequency of elements in b.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about selecting k positions in the window where the elements match the elements in b, regardless of their frequency.

But considering the example where b has duplicates, and c has duplicates, I need to make sure that the frequencies are handled correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can use frequency counting for b and then, in each window of a, count how many elements are in b, considering their frequencies.

But in the sliding window approach, I need an efficient way to maintain the count of matching elements.

Let me think about using a frequency array or dictionary for b.

Given that a_i and b_i can be up to 10^6, using a frequency array of size 10^6 + 1 might be feasible, but it could be memory-intensive if done for each test case.

But since t can be up to 10^4, and n and m up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, and similarly for m. So, overall, it's manageable.

I can use a frequency array for b, initialized for each test case.

Then, for each window of size m in a, I can count how many elements in the window are present in b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, but frequency counting is necessary because if b has multiple instances of an element, I need to account for that in the window.

For example, if b=[1,1,2,2], and a's window is [1,1,2,2], it matches all four elements.

If a's window is [1,2,2,3], it matches three elements.

If a's window is [1,2,3,4], it matches two elements.

So, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b and ensure that the window has at least the required frequency for each element to reach the k matches.

But this seems complicated to handle in a sliding window, especially with high n and m.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider using a counter for b and then, in the sliding window, keep a counter for the window, and check how many elements in the window match b, considering their frequencies.

But implementing this efficiently is tricky, especially with the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can use a frequency array for b and then, in the sliding window, keep a count of how many elements in the window match b, considering their frequencies.

Here's an idea:

- For each test case, create a frequency array cnt_b for b, where cnt_b[x] is the count of x in b.

- Then, initialize a sliding window of size m over a.

- In the first window, count how many elements in the window are in b and have not exceeded their frequency in b.

- Specifically, for each element in the window, if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0, then it's a match, and decrement cnt_b[a[i]].

- Keep a counter curr for the number of matches in the current window.

- If curr >= k, then it's a good subsegment.

- Then, slide the window one step at a time:

- When removing the leftmost element of the previous window, if it was a match, increment cnt_b[a[left]].

- If cnt_b[a[left]] >= 1 after incrementing, then curr decreases by 1.

- Add the new rightmost element: if cnt_b[a[new_right]] > 0, then it's a match, decrement cnt_b[a[new_right]], and increment curr.

- Check if curr >= k.

- Repeat until the end.

This seems efficient because it only requires O(m) initial processing and O(n - m) for sliding, which is O(n).

Given that sum of n over all test cases is 2*10^5, it should be acceptable.

Let me see if this works with the first example.

Test case 1:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b=[1,2,3,4]

Initialize cnt_b:

cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1, cnt_b[4]=1

First window: [4,1,2,3]

- 4: cnt_b[4]=0, not a match.

- 1: cnt_b[1]=0, not a match.

- 2: cnt_b[2]=0, not a match.

- 3: cnt_b[3]=0, not a match.

Wait, but in the example, it should be a good subsegment.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in my initial approach, I need to reset cnt_b for each test case, but in the code provided, it seems cnt_b is not being reset properly.

Wait, in the code, cnt_b is initialized once at the beginning with max_val=1000000, and then for each test case, it's updated for b.

But in the code, after processing each test case, for i in b_values: cnt_b[i] = 0

This is attempting to reset cnt_b for the next test case.

But is this sufficient?

Wait, in the sliding window, cnt_b is being decremented for elements in the window, and incremented when sliding.

But in the first window, for [4,1,2,3], cnt_b[4]=1, cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1.

So, for each element in the window:

- 4: cnt_b[4]=0, but since it was >=0 before decrementing, curr +=1.

- 1: cnt_b[1]=0, curr +=1.

- 2: cnt_b[2]=0, curr +=1.

- 3: cnt_b[3]=0, curr +=1.

So curr=4, which is >=2, so it's good.

Then, sliding to [1,2,3,4]:

- Remove 4: cnt_b[4]=1, since cnt_b[4] >0, curr -=1.

- Add 4: cnt_b[4]=0, curr +=1.

So curr remains 4.

Similarly, sliding to [2,3,4,5]:

- Remove 1: cnt_b[1]=1, curr -=1.

- Add 5: cnt_b[5]=0, curr +=1.

So curr remains 4.

Sliding to [3,4,5,6]:

- Remove 2: cnt_b[2]=1, curr -=1.

- Add 6: cnt_b[6]=0, curr +=1.

So curr remains 4.

Thus, all four subsegments are good, which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a, b.

From the earlier analysis, subsegments starting at positions 1,2,3 are good, position 4 is not.

Let's see with the code's logic.

First window: [4,1,2,3]

As above, curr=4 >=3, good.

Second window: [1,2,3,4]

After sliding:

Remove 4: cnt_b[4]=1, curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 4: cnt_b[4]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, good.

Third window: [2,3,4,5]

Remove 1: cnt_b[1]=1, curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 5: cnt_b[5]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, good.

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6]

Remove 2: cnt_b[2]=1, curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 6: cnt_b[6]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, good.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, position 4 is not good, but according to this, it is good.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, in the problem statement, for the second test case, it says good subsegments start at positions 1,2,3.

But according to this logic, position 4 would also be good, which contradicts the problem's assertion.

What's going on?

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the matches are not exceeding the frequency in b.

In the first window [4,1,2,3], cnt_b[4]=1, cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1.

So, matches are 4,1,2,3, all matching.

In the second window [1,2,3,4], after sliding:

Remove 4: cnt_b[4]=1, which is >0, so curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 4: cnt_b[4]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4

So, curr=4 >=3, good.

Third window [2,3,4,5]:

Remove 1: cnt_b[1]=1, curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 5: cnt_b[5]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, good.

Fourth window [3,4,5,6]:

Remove 2: cnt_b[2]=1, curr -=1 -> curr=3

Add 6: cnt_b[6]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, good.

But according to the problem, position 4 is not good.

Wait, perhaps I need to reset cnt_b for each test case.

In the code, after each test case, it tries to reset cnt_b for the next test case.

But in my earlier analysis, I didn't account for the frequency properly.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the frequency of matches does not exceed the frequency in b.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the frequency of matches for each element.

Wait, maybe my initial approach is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Alternative approach:

- For each test case, create a frequency dictionary for b.

- Then, for each window of size m in a, create a frequency dictionary for the window.

- Check if, for each element in b, the window's frequency for that element is at least the frequency in b.

- If the sum of minimum frequencies for each element in b is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

Wait, but this seems too slow for the constraints.

Another idea:

- Since b can have duplicates, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

- In each window of a, count how many elements are in b, considering their frequencies.

- Specifically, for each element in b, keep track of how many times it appears in the window, up to its frequency in b.

- Sum these up to get the number of matches.

- If the sum is >=k, it's a good subsegment.

This sounds similar to my initial approach.

But in the second test case, according to the problem, position 4 is not good, but according to my logic, it is good.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle the frequencies.

Let me look at position 4: [3,4,5,6]

b=[1,2,3,4]

cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1, cnt_b[4]=1

In the window [3,4,5,6]:

- 3 is in b, cnt_b[3]=0 after matching.

- 4 is in b, cnt_b[4]=0 after matching.

- 5 is not in b.

- 6 is not in b.

So, matches = 2, which is >=3? No, it's 2 < 3, so it should not be good.

But in my earlier sliding window approach, I had curr=4, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in updating curr.

Let me simulate the sliding window more carefully.

Initialize cnt_b for b=[1,2,3,4]:

cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1, cnt_b[4]=1

First window [4,1,2,3]:

- 4: cnt_b[4]=0 (was 1), curr +=1 (since cnt_b[4] >=0 after decrement).

- 1: cnt_b[1]=0, curr +=1.

- 2: cnt_b[2]=0, curr +=1.

- 3: cnt_b[3]=0, curr +=1.

So curr=4.

Then, slide to [1,2,3,4]:

- Remove 4: cnt_b[4]=1 (was 0 after previous addition), since cnt_b[4] >0, curr -=1 -> curr=3

- Add 4: cnt_b[4]=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4

Wait, but cnt_b[4] was 0 after adding the first 4, then removing 4 makes cnt_b[4]=1, which is >0, so curr -=1.

But in reality, cnt_b[4] should be 1 after removing 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to update cnt_b.

Let me look at the code provided:

In the func() function:

- cnt_b is initialized as [0] * (max_val +1)

- For each test case:

- For each element in b, cnt_b[b[i]] +=1

- b_values = set(b)

- Initialize curr=0

- For the first window of size m:

- If a[i] in b_values:

- cnt_b[a[i]] -=1

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >=0:

- curr +=1

- If curr >=k, ans +=1

- Then, slide the window from i=0 to i=n-m:

- If a[i] in b_values:

- cnt_b[a[i]] +=1

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >0:

- curr -=1

- If a[i+m] in b_values:

- cnt_b[a[i+m]] -=1

- If cnt_b[a[i+m]] >=0:

- curr +=1

- If curr >=k:

- ans +=1

- Print ans

- At the end of each test case, for i in b_values:

- cnt_b[i] =0

So, in the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b=[1,2,3,4]

Initialize cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[3]=1, cnt_b[4]=1

First window [4,1,2,3]:

- 4: in b_values, cnt_b[4]=0, cnt_b[4] >=0, curr +=1

- 1: in b_values, cnt_b[1]=0, cnt_b[1] >=0, curr +=1

- 2: in b_values, cnt_b[2]=0, cnt_b[2] >=0, curr +=1

- 3: in b_values, cnt_b[3]=0, cnt_b[3] >=0, curr +=1

So curr=4 >=3, ans=1

Then, slide to [1,2,3,4]:

- Remove 4: in b_values, cnt_b[4]=1, cnt_b[4] >0, curr -=1 -> curr=3

- Add 4: in b_values, cnt_b[4]=0, cnt_b[4] >=0, curr +=1 -> curr=4 >=3, ans=2

Slide to [2,3,4,5]:

- Remove 1: in b_values, cnt_b[1]=1, cnt_b[1] >0, curr -=1 -> curr=3

- Add 5: not in b_values, no change -> curr=3 >=3, ans=3

Slide to [3,4,5,6]:

- Remove 2: in b_values, cnt_b[2]=1, cnt_b[2] >0, curr -=1 -> curr=2

- Add 6: not in b_values, no change -> curr=2 <3, not good

So, ans=3, which matches the problem's assertion.

Wait, in my earlier manual simulation, I had curr=4 for position 4, but according to this, curr=2.

I must have made a mistake in my earlier simulation.

So, the code seems to be correctly implementing the sliding window approach, and it matches the expected output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
