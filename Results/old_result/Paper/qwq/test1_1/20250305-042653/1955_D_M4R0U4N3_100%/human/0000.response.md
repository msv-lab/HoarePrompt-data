Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But wait, it says "match the elements of array b," which might imply that the values are the same, not necessarily their positions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding. In the first test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 2

a = [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4]

We need to consider all subsegments of a of length 4:

1. [4,1,2,3] - rearranged, we can have [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least 2 match.

2. [1,2,3,4] - same as above.

3. [2,3,4,5] - rearranged, [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b.

4. [3,4,5,6] - rearranged, [3,4,5,6], which has 3 elements matching b.

All of these have at least 2 elements matching b, so the output is 4.

In the second test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 3

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] - matches 4 elements.

2. [1,2,3,4] - matches 4 elements.

3. [2,3,4,5] - matches 3 elements.

4. [3,4,5,6] - matches 3 elements.

But according to the explanation, only positions 1, 2, and 3 are good, so output is 3. Wait, but in the first test case, it was 4. Maybe there's a difference in how it's counted. I need to read the problem again carefully.

Wait, in the second test case, k=3, so we need at least 3 matches. From the subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3] - 4 matches.

2. [1,2,3,4] - 4 matches.

3. [2,3,4,5] - 3 matches.

4. [3,4,5,6] - 3 matches.

So all four subsegments have at least 3 matches, but the output is 3. That means I must have misread the example output. Wait, looking back, in the first test case, output is 4, second is 3, third is 2, fourth is 4, fifth is 1. Okay, so in the second test case, output is indeed 3, but according to my counting, it should be 4. Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the matching is not just about having at least k elements that are in b, but rather, after rearrangement, at least k elements are exactly as in b. But in the example, it seems like it's about having at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of order.

Wait, let's read the problem statement again: "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about having at least k elements in common between c and b, regardless of their positions.

But in the note, it says that in the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1, 2, and 3. Maybe the fourth subsegment doesn't have at least k matches. Let's check:

a[4..7] = [3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Common elements: 3,4. So two matches. But k=3, so it shouldn't be considered good. Wait, but earlier I thought it had three matches. Wait, a[4..7] is [4,5,6], but n=7, so indices are from 0 to 6. Wait, the array has 7 elements: indices 0 to 6.

Wait, m=4, so subsegments are:

a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4]

a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5]

a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6]

Now, b = [1,2,3,4]

Common elements:

- [4,1,2,3] ∩ [1,2,3,4] = [1,2,3,4] → 4 matches

- [1,2,3,4] ∩ [1,2,3,4] = [1,2,3,4] → 4 matches

- [2,3,4,5] ∩ [1,2,3,4] = [2,3,4] → 3 matches

- [3,4,5,6] ∩ [1,2,3,4] = [3,4] → 2 matches

Given k=3, the first three subsegments have at least 3 matches, the last one has only 2, so it's not good. Hence, output is 3, not 4. Got it.

So, the task is to count the number of subsegments of a of length m that have at least k elements in common with b.

Now, to solve this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2e5, same for m. So, per test case, the time complexity should be O(n), or at least O(m), to pass within time limits.

I need an efficient way to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of elements that are present in b. Then, check if this count is at least k.

One way is to precompute for each position in a, whether that element is in b or not. But since b can have duplicates, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Wait, b can have duplicates, so I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Similarly, in the subsegment of a, I need to count how many elements are in b, considering the frequencies.

Wait, no, the problem says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about having at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of frequency. It doesn't specify that the frequencies need to match, just that at least k elements in c are also in b.

Wait, but b can have duplicates, so perhaps the frequencies matter.

Wait, let's consider an example where b has duplicates.

Suppose b = [1,2,2,3], and c = [1,2,3,4]. Then, can we rearrange c to match b in at least k positions?

Wait, the problem says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about permuting c and seeing if at least k elements match b in the same positions.

Wait, perhaps I misread it. Let me read it again.

"elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about permuting c to match b in at least k positions.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to having at least k elements in common, but considering the frequencies.

Wait, another way: suppose I have c and b, both of length m. I can permute c and see if there are at least k positions where c[i] == b[i].

But that would be a different problem.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of matching elements, regardless of position.

But the example suggests that [2,3,4,5] is good because it can be rearranged to [5,2,3,4], which has three matches with b=[1,2,3,4], namely 2,3,4.

So, it's about having at least k elements in c that are also in b.

Wait, but considering frequencies. If b has two 2's, and c has one 2, does that count as one match or two? In the above example, elements seem to be matched without considering frequency.

Given that, perhaps it's sufficient to count, for each subsegment c, the number of elements that are present in b, regardless of frequency.

But b can have duplicates, so I need to handle frequencies properly.

Wait, in the first test case, b = [1,2,3,4], and c = [4,1,2,3], which has all four elements matching.

In the second test case, b = [1,2,3,4], and c = [3,4,5,6], which has two elements matching.

So, it seems like matching is done by unique elements, not considering frequency.

Wait, but b can have duplicates.

Wait, in the third test case:

n = 7, m = 4, k = 4

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Subsegments:

[4,1,2,3] → matches 4 elements.

[1,2,3,4] → matches 4 elements.

[2,3,4,5] → matches 3 elements.

[3,4,5,6] → matches 2 elements.

So, only the first two subsegments have at least 4 matches, which means ans = 2.

Wait, but [4,1,2,3] and [1,2,3,4] both have all four elements matching, so ans = 2.

Okay, now, in another test case:

n = 11, m = 5, k = 3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

Subsegments of length 5:

[9,9,2,2,10] → matches 9,9,10 → at least 3 matches.

[9,2,2,10,9] → matches 9,9,10 → at least 3 matches.

[2,2,10,9,7] → matches 2,10,9,7 → at least 3 matches.

[2,10,9,7,6] → matches 10,9,7,6 → at least 3 matches.

[10,9,7,6,3] → matches 10,9,7,6 → at least 3 matches.

[9,7,6,3,6] → matches 9,7,6 → at least 3 matches.

[7,6,3,6,3] → matches 7,6 → less than 3 matches.

So, 6 subsegments have at least 3 matches, but the output is 4. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, n=11, m=5, so number of subsegments is 11-5+1=7.

But according to the output, only 4 are good. So, perhaps some subsegments don't have at least 3 matches.

Wait, let's list them:

a[0:5] = [9,9,2,2,10] ∩ b = [9,9,10,2,2] ∩ [6,9,7,8,10] = [9,10] → two matches, less than k=3 → not good.

Wait, earlier I thought 9 appears twice, but in b, 9 appears only once, so matches are 9 and 10 → two matches.

So, not good.

a[1:6] = [9,2,2,10,9] ∩ b = [9,2,10,9] ∩ b = [9,10] → two matches.

Not good.

a[2:7] = [2,2,10,9,7] ∩ b = [2,10,9,7] ∩ b = [2,10,9,7] → four matches.

Good.

a[3:8] = [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = [2,10,9,7,6] → five matches.

Good.

a[4:9] = [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = [10,9,7,6] → four matches.

Good.

a[5:10] = [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = [9,7,6] → three matches.

Good.

a[6:11] = [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = [7,6,3] → three matches.

Good.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 4, but according to this, it's 5.

Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in a[0:5] = [9,9,2,2,10], intersection with b = [9,10], so two matches.

a[1:6] = [9,2,2,10,9], intersection with b = [9,10], two matches.

a[2:7] = [2,2,10,9,7], intersection with b = [2,10,9,7], four matches.

a[3:8] = [2,10,9,7,6], intersection with b = [2,10,9,7,6], five matches.

a[4:9] = [10,9,7,6,3], intersection with b = [10,9,7,6], four matches.

a[5:10] = [9,7,6,3,6], intersection with b = [9,7,6,3], four matches.

a[6:11] = [7,6,3,6,3], intersection with b = [7,6,3], three matches.

So, subsegments with at least three matches are a[2:7], a[3:8], a[4:9], a[5:10], a[6:11] → five subsegments, but output is 4. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps matching is considering unique elements only, not frequencies.

In a[0:5], [9,9,2,2,10] ∩ [6,9,7,8,10] = [9,10], two unique matches.

Similarly, a[1:6], [9,2,2,10,9] ∩ b = [9,10], two unique matches.

a[2:7], [2,2,10,9,7] ∩ b = [2,9,10,7], four unique matches.

a[3:8], [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = [2,10,9,7,6], five unique matches.

a[4:9], [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = [10,9,7,6], four unique matches.

a[5:10], [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = [9,7,6,3], four unique matches.

a[6:11], [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = [7,6,3], three unique matches.

So, subsegments with at least three unique matches are a[2:7], a[3:8], a[4:9], a[5:10], a[6:11] → five subsegments.

But the output is 4. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps matching is considering the frequency of elements.

In a[0:5], [9,9,2,2,10] and b = [6,9,7,8,10], matches are one 9 and one 10, so two matches.

Similarly, a[1:6], [9,2,2,10,9] ∩ b = one 9 and one 10 → two matches.

a[2:7], [2,2,10,9,7] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7 → four matches.

a[3:8], [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → five matches.

a[4:9], [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → four matches.

a[5:10], [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = one 9, one 7, one 6, one 3 → four matches.

a[6:11], [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = one 7, one 6, one 3 → three matches.

So, all subsegments with at least three matches are the last five subsegments.

But the output is 4. Maybe there's an error in the problem or I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers matching based on the frequency of elements.

Wait, in a[0:5], [9,9,2,2,10] and b = [6,9,7,8,10], b has one 9 and one 10, so matches are one 9 and one 10 → two matches.

Similarly, a[1:6], [9,2,2,10,9] ∩ b = one 9 and one 10 → two matches.

a[2:7], [2,2,10,9,7] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7 → four matches.

a[3:8], [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → five matches.

a[4:9], [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → four matches.

a[5:10], [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = one 9, one 7, one 6, one 3 → four matches.

a[6:11], [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = one 7, one 6, one 3 → three matches.

So, subsegments with at least three matches are a[2:7], a[3:8], a[4:9], a[5:10], a[6:11] → five subsegments.

But the output is 4. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps matching is done by positions after rearrangement.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, perhaps it's about permuting c to match b in at least k positions.

In that case, it's about the number of matching elements in any order, considering the frequency.

So, it's similar to counting the number of common elements between c and b, considering frequencies.

In a[0:5], c = [9,9,2,2,10], b = [6,9,7,8,10], common elements are one 9 and one 10 → two matches.

Similarly, a[1:6], [9,2,2,10,9] ∩ b = one 9 and one 10 → two matches.

a[2:7], [2,2,10,9,7] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7 → four matches.

a[3:8], [2,10,9,7,6] ∩ b = one 2, one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → five matches.

a[4:9], [10,9,7,6,3] ∩ b = one 10, one 9, one 7, one 6 → four matches.

a[5:10], [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = one 9, one 7, one 6 → three matches.

a[6:11], [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = one 7, one 6, one 3 → three matches.

So, subsegments with at least three matches are a[2:7], a[3:8], a[4:9], a[5:10], a[6:11] → five subsegments.

But the output is 4. Maybe in the problem, the last subsegment is not considered good, but according to this, it should be good.

Wait, a[5:10] = [9,7,6,3,6] ∩ b = [9,7,6,3] → four matches.

a[6:11] = [7,6,3,6,3] ∩ b = [7,6,3] → three matches.

So, five subsegments have at least three matches.

But output is 4. Maybe there's an error in the problem or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the frequencies matter differently.

Wait, in a[5:10], c = [9,7,6,3,6], b = [6,9,7,8,10].

Common elements considering frequencies:

- 9: c has one 9, b has one 9 → one match.

- 7: c has one 7, b has one 7 → one match.

- 6: c has two 6's, b has one 6 → one match.

- 3: c has one 3, b has zero 3's → no match.

Total matches: one 9, one 7, one 6 → three matches.

Similarly, a[6:11] = [7,6,3,6,3], b = [6,9,7,8,10].

Common elements:

- 7: one match.

- 6: two in c, one in b → one match.

- 3: two in c, zero in b → no match.

Total matches: one 7, one 6 → two matches.

So, a[6:11] has only two matches, not three.

Therefore, only a[2:7], a[3:8], a[4:9], a[5:10] have at least three matches → four subsegments, which matches the output.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, the matching is based on the frequency of elements.

Hence, to solve this, for each subsegment c of length m, count the number of elements that are common between c and b, considering the frequencies, and check if this count is at least k.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.

One way is to precompute the frequency of each element in b, then for each subsegment c, compute the number of common elements considering frequencies.

To do this efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach.

First, create a frequency dictionary for b.

Then, initialize a window of size m in a, and compute the number of matches in this window.

To compute matches, for each element in the window, if it's in b and the frequency in the window is less than or equal to the frequency in b, count it accordingly.

Wait, but frequencies are tricky.

A better way is to keep track of how many times each element in the window is present in b, considering the frequency in b.

So, for each element in b, we have a certain frequency.

For each element in the window, if it's in b and the frequency in the window is less than or equal to the frequency in b, add the frequency in the window.

If the frequency in the window exceeds the frequency in b, add the frequency in b.

Wait, no. It's about counting the number of elements in c that are also in b, considering the frequencies.

So, for each unique element in c that is also in b, the number of matches is the minimum of the frequency in c and the frequency in b.

So, total matches = sum over all unique elements in c and b of min(freq_c[element], freq_b[element]).

Given that, we can maintain a sliding window of size m in a, and keep track of the frequency of elements in the window.

We precompute freq_b.

Then, for each window, compute sum over all elements in window of min(freq_c[element], freq_b[element]).

If this sum is >= k, then it's a good subsegment.

To implement this efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach, where we maintain a frequency dictionary for the current window, and keep track of the sum of min(freq_c[element], freq_b[element]).

When sliding the window, we remove the element that is leaving the window and add the new element entering the window, updating the frequency dictionary and the sum accordingly.

This way, we can compute the sum for each window in O(1) time, after initializing it for the first window in O(m) time.

Given that, the total time per test case would be O(n), which is acceptable since the sum of n over all test cases is 2e5.

Now, to implement this in code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k.

- Read array a of size n.

- Read array b of size m.

- Create freq_b dictionary: count the frequency of each element in b.

- Initialize a frequency dictionary for the window.

- Initialize the sum of min(freq_c[element], freq_b[element]) for the first window.

- If the sum >= k, increment the answer.

- Slide the window from left to right:

- Remove the element that is leaving the window: decrement its frequency in freq_c, and update the sum accordingly.

- Add the new element entering the window: increment its frequency in freq_c, and update the sum accordingly.

- If the sum >= k, increment the answer.

- After processing all windows, print the answer.

Edge cases to consider:

- k = 1: even if only one element matches, it's good.

- k = m: all elements in the window must match b.

- b has duplicate elements.

- a has duplicate elements.

- n = m: only one window.

- m = 1: simple matching.

- All elements in a are in b.

- No elements in a are in b.

I need to make sure that the frequency handling is correct, especially when elements are added or removed from the window.

Also, since elements can be up to 1e6, I need to use a dictionary to store frequencies, or an array with index as the element value, if elements are small enough.

Given that elements can be up to 1e6, using a dictionary is more appropriate.

But for efficiency, since elements can be up to 1e6, and n and m up to 2e5, using a list of size 1e6+1 might be acceptable in terms of memory.

But dictionaries in Python are efficient enough for this purpose.

I need to decide which one to use based on performance considerations.

Given that, I'll proceed with using dictionaries for frequency counts.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

max_val = 1000000

cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):

cnt_b[b[i]] += 1

b_values = set(b)

ans = 0

curr = 0

for i in range(m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

for i in range(n - m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] += 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:

curr -= 1

if a[i + m] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

print(ans)

for i in b_values:

cnt_b[i] = 0

So, the code uses a list cnt_b of size max_val+1 to keep track of frequencies of elements in b.

For each test case:

- It reads n, m, k.

- Reads array a of size n.

- Reads array b of size m.

- Initializes cnt_b for elements in b by counting their frequencies.

- Creates a set b_values containing the unique elements in b.

- Initializes ans to 0.

- Initializes curr to 0.

- Processes the first window of size m:

- For each element in the first window, if it's in b_values, decrements cnt_b[a[i]] and if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0, increments curr.

- If curr >= k, increments ans.

- Then, slides the window from left to right:

- For each slide, if the element leaving the window is in b_values, increments cnt_b[a[i]] and if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0, decrements curr.

- If the element entering the window is in b_values, decrements cnt_b[a[i + m]] and if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0, increments curr.

- If curr >= k, increments ans.

- After processing all windows, prints ans.

- Resets cnt_b for elements in b_values to 0 for the next test case.

Now, let's see if this logic is correct.

First, it initializes cnt_b as a list of zeros with size max_val+1.

For each test case, it reads n, m, k, a, and b.

It then counts the frequency of each element in b by iterating through b and incrementing cnt_b[b[i]].

Then, it creates a set b_values containing the unique elements in b.

It initializes ans to 0 and curr to 0.

For the first window of size m:

For each element in the first window, if it's in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i]].

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0, increment curr.

So, cnt_b[a[i]] is initially the frequency of a[i] in b. By decrementing it, cnt_b[a[i]] represents the remaining frequency in b that hasn't been matched yet.

If cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0 after decrementing, it means that there was a positive frequency left in b for that element, so it's a match.

Hence, curr counts the number of matches in the current window.

If curr >= k, it increments ans.

Then, it slides the window from left to right:

For each slide:

- If the element leaving the window is in b_values:

- Increment cnt_b[a[i]] (restoring its frequency in b).

- If cnt_b[a[i]] > 0, decrement curr (since there was a match that is now restored).

- If the element entering the window is in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i + m]].

- If cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0, increment curr.

- If curr >= k, increment ans.

After processing all windows, it prints ans.

Finally, it resets cnt_b for elements in b_values to 0 for the next test case.

This seems to be implementing the sliding window approach correctly.
