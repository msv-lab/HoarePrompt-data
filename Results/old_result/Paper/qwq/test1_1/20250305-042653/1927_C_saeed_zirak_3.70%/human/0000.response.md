Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and an even number k. I need to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included in the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The arrays a and b can have duplicates since the problem mentions, for example, a having multiple 5s. The values in the arrays can be up to 10^6, which is fine since I'm only interested in values from 1 to k.

The problem guarantees that k is even and that k is at most 2 times the minimum of n and m. This means there are enough elements in both arrays to potentially select k/2 from each.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to ensure that every number from 1 to k is chosen, and I have to choose exactly k/2 from each array. So, for each number from 1 to k, I need to make sure it's selected either from a or from b, but not necessarily from both.

One way to think about this is to track which numbers from 1 to k are present in a and which are present in b. Then, I need to distribute the selections such that each number from 1 to k is covered by at least one selection, and I select exactly k/2 from each array.

Wait, but actually, since I have to choose exactly k/2 from each array, and ensure that all numbers from 1 to k are included in the union of the selected elements from both arrays.

I need to make sure that for each number from 1 to k, it is selected at least once, and the total selections from each array are exactly k/2.

This sounds like a problem of ensuring coverage with limited selections from each array.

Let me consider the frequencies of numbers from 1 to k in both arrays.

I should probably count how many times each number from 1 to k appears in a and in b.

Then, for each number from 1 to k, I need to decide whether to take it from a or from b, but keeping in mind the limited number of selections from each array.

Wait, but it's not just about deciding for each number where to take it from, because I might have multiple instances of the same number in an array, and I can only select one instance per selection.

Actually, since I'm choosing elements, not necessarily distinct numbers, I need to be careful.

Wait, but the problem says "every integer from 1 to k is included" among the chosen elements. It doesn't specify that they have to be distinct in the chosen set, just that all numbers from 1 to k are present in the chosen elements.

But typically, when they say "every integer from 1 to k is included", they mean that each number appears at least once in the chosen elements.

So, I need to choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, and ensure that the union of these chosen elements contains all numbers from 1 to k at least once.

I need to find a way to select k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that the union covers all numbers from 1 to k.

This seems like a problem that can be solved by checking if there is a way to cover all required numbers with the given selection constraints.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, identify which numbers from 1 to k are present in a and which are present in b.

I can create two sets: one for numbers present in a and one for numbers present in b.

Then, the intersection of these two sets would be numbers present in both arrays.

Numbers that are only in a or only in b would need to be selected from those arrays respectively.

The tricky part is deciding how to handle numbers that are present in both arrays.

I need to maximize the coverage while respecting the selection limits from each array.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of requirements.

For each number from 1 to k, I need to ensure it's selected at least once, either from a or from b.

So, for numbers that are only in a, I have to select at least one occurrence from a.

Similarly, for numbers that are only in b, I have to select at least one occurrence from b.

For numbers that are in both, I can choose to select it from either a or b.

Additionally, I have to make sure that the total number of selections from a and b are exactly k/2 each.

So, perhaps I can calculate the minimum number of selections needed from each array to cover all the required numbers.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define:

- Let S_a be the set of numbers that are only in a.

- Let S_b be the set of numbers that are only in b.

- Let S_both be the set of numbers that are in both a and b.

Then, for S_a, I need to select at least |S_a| numbers from a (one for each unique number in S_a).

Similarly, for S_b, I need to select at least |S_b| numbers from b.

For S_both, I can choose to select the numbers from either a or b.

So, the total selections from a should be at least |S_a| plus the number of S_both numbers I decide to select from a.

Similarly, the total selections from b should be at least |S_b| plus the number of S_both numbers I decide to select from b.

But I have to select exactly k/2 from each.

So, I need to find a distribution of selections from S_both to a and b such that:

- The number of selections from a is exactly k/2.

- The number of selections from b is exactly k/2.

- All numbers in S_a are selected at least once from a.

- All numbers in S_b are selected at least once from b.

- For each number in S_both, it is selected at least once from either a or b.

Wait, but actually, since I'm selecting elements, not necessarily ensuring that each number is selected a certain number of times, as long as it's selected at least once.

I think I need to approach this differently.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of unique numbers I need to cover from each array.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are present in a and b.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Identify the unique numbers in a and b that are in the range [1, k].

2. Determine which of these numbers are only in a, only in b, or in both.

3. Calculate the minimum number of selections needed from a and b to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

4. Check if these minimum selections can be adjusted to exactly k/2 from each array.

Let me try to outline this with variables.

Let:

- only_a = numbers in [1, k] that are only in a.

- only_b = numbers in [1, k] that are only in b.

- both = numbers in [1, k] that are in both a and b.

Then, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, I need to select all numbers in only_a from a, all numbers in only_b from b, and for each number in both, I can choose to select it from a or b.

Let me denote:

- selections_a = |only_a| + x, where x is the number of numbers from both that I choose to select from a.

- selections_b = |only_b| + y, where y is the number of numbers from both that I choose to select from b.

With the constraints:

- selections_a == k/2

- selections_b == k/2

- x + y == |both|

Because I have to select exactly k/2 from each array, and the total selections from a and b must cover all numbers from 1 to k.

So, I can set up the equations:

|only_a| + x = k/2

|only_b| + y = k/2

And

x + y = |both|

From these equations, I can solve for x and y.

Let me express y in terms of x from the first two equations:

y = k/2 - |only_b|

Similarly,

x = k/2 - |only_a|

But also, x + y = |both|

So, substituting:

(k/2 - |only_a|) + (k/2 - |only_b|) = |both|

Simplify:

k - |only_a| - |only_b| = |both|

But, we know that:

|only_a| + |only_b| + |both| = k

Because together, they cover all numbers from 1 to k.

So, |both| = k - |only_a| - |only_b|

Substituting back:

k - |only_a| - |only_b| = k - |only_a| - |only_b|

Which holds true.

So, as long as |only_a| + |only_b| + |both| = k, which is always true since they partition the set [1, k], the equations are consistent.

But, I need to ensure that x and y are non-negative.

So, x = k/2 - |only_a| >= 0

And y = k/2 - |only_b| >= 0

So, for the selection to be possible, both k/2 >= |only_a| and k/2 >= |only_b| must hold.

If either |only_a| > k/2 or |only_b| > k/2, it's impossible to make the selections as required.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the number of times I select each number meets the requirements.

Wait, but in the problem, I can select multiple instances of the same number, but I only need each number to be present at least once in the selected elements.

So, as long as I select at least one occurrence of each number from its available array(s), I'm good.

Given that, I think the condition I derived is sufficient.

So, in summary, the selection is possible if and only if:

- The number of unique numbers in a that are not in b (only_a) is <= k/2

- The number of unique numbers in b that are not in a (only_b) is <= k/2

Because I need to select at least |only_a| numbers from a and at least |only_b| numbers from b.

And since I have to select exactly k/2 from each, these inequalities must hold.

Moreover, the total number of unique numbers from 1 to k should be equal to |only_a| + |only_b| + |both| = k, which is already satisfied.

So, in the code, I need to:

- For each test case, collect a and b.

- Find the unique numbers in a and b that are in [1, k].

- Compute only_a = unique numbers in a intersect [1, k] minus unique numbers in b.

- Compute only_b = unique numbers in b intersect [1, k] minus unique numbers in a.

- Check if |only_a| <= k/2 and |only_b| <= k/2.

- If both conditions hold, output "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but let's verify this logic with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,4,10,5]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,6]: {2,3,5,6}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,6]: {1,3,4,5}

only_a = {2,6}

only_b = {1,4}

both = {3,5}

|only_a| = 2 <= 3 (k/2=3)

|only_b| = 2 <= 3

So, it should output "YES", which matches the sample.

Second sample input:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,6]: {2,3,4,5,6}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,6]: {1,3}

only_a = {2,4,5,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3}

|only_a| = 4 > 3 (k/2=3)

|only_b| = 1 <= 3

Since |only_a| > k/2, it should output "NO", matching the sample.

Third sample input:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,3,5]

b = [2,4,6]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,4]: {1,3}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,4]: {2,4}

only_a = {1,3}

only_b = {2,4}

both = {}

|only_a| = 2 <= 2 (k/2=2)

|only_b| = 2 <= 2

So, "YES", matching the sample.

Fourth sample input:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a = [1,4]

b = [7,3,4,4,2]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,4]: {1,4}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,4]: {2,3,4}

only_a = {1}

only_b = {2,3}

both = {4}

|only_a| = 1 <= 2 (k/2=2)

|only_b| = 2 <= 2

So, "YES"

Fifth sample input:

n=1, m=4, k=2

a = [6,4,4,2]

b = [1,5,2]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,2]: {2}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,2]: {1,2}

only_a = {2}

only_b = {1}

both = {}

|only_a| = 1 <= 1 (k/2=1)

|only_b| = 1 <= 1

So, "YES"

Sixth sample input:

n=3, m=2, k=4

a = [2,2,1,4,3]

b = [2,2]

Unique numbers in a intersect [1,4]: {1,2,3,4}

Unique numbers in b intersect [1,4]: {2}

only_a = {1,3,4}

only_b = {}

both = {2}

|only_a| = 3 > 2 (k/2=2)

|only_b| = 0 <= 2

So, "NO"

All sample inputs are consistent with this logic.

Therefore, I can implement this logic in code.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The provided program is:

def func():

for t in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

aOnes = 0

bOnes = 0

newk = k // 2

i = 1

while i <= k:

if i in a and i in b:

if aOnes < bOnes:

aOnes += 1

else:

bOnes += 1

elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:

aOnes += 1

elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:

bOnes += 1

else:

break

i += 1

if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:

print('yes')

else:

print('no')

This code tries to iterate through numbers from 1 to k and decide from which array to take each number to balance aOnes and bOnes.

However, this approach might not be correct because it doesn't necessarily ensure that the selections cover all required numbers efficiently.

In particular, the condition where a number is present in both arrays, and the code chooses to increment aOnes or bOnes based on which has fewer ones so far, might not lead to a valid selection if the distributions don't align properly.

Moreover, the break statement when a number can't be selected appropriately might exit early without considering other possibilities.

Comparing this to my earlier logic, which simply checks if the number of unique numbers only in a and only in b are both <= k/2, seems more straightforward and correct.

Therefore, I believe the provided program might not be correct in all cases.

Wait, but let's check with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5], b = [1,3,4,10,5], k=6

only_a = {2,6}, only_b = {1,4}, both = {3,5}

|only_a| = 2 <= 3

|only_b| = 2 <= 3

So, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in b, choose bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=2: in a, choose aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=3: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (since aOnes=1 < bOnes=1), aOnes=2

i=4: in b, choose bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

i=5: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 < bOnes=2), but since aOnes == bOnes, it would choose bOnes +=1, but actually aOnes could still take it.

This might not be optimal.

Wait, but in this case, it seems it would still reach i=6: in a, choose aOnes +=1, aOnes=3

Then, aOnes=3, bOnes=2, which is fine since both are <= k/2=3.

But according to my earlier logic, as long as |only_a| and |only_b| <= k/2, it should be "YES".

Second sample input:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6

only_a = {2,4,5,6}, only_b = {1}, both = {3}

|only_a| = 4 > 3, so "NO"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=2: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=3: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=1), so aOnes=2

i=4: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=3

i=5: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=3 > bOnes=1), so bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

i=6: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=4

But aOnes=4 > k/2=3, which violates the condition.

Hence, "NO"

So, in this case, it works.

But let's consider another test case.

Suppose:

n=4, m=4, k=4

a = [1,2,3,4]

b = [1,2,3,4]

only_a = {}, only_b = {}, both = {1,2,3,4}

|only_a|=0 <=2, |only_b|=0 <=2, so "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=0 < bOnes=0), so aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), so aOnes=2

i=3: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 > bOnes=0), so bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in a and b, choose bOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 > bOnes=1), so bOnes=2

Finally, aOnes=2, bOnes=2, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {4}, both = {2,3}

|only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, so "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), so aOnes=2

i=3: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 > bOnes=0), so bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

Final aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Seems correct.

Wait, but consider this test case:

n=2, m=2, k=4

a = [1,2]

b = [3,4]

only_a = {1,2}, only_b = {3,4}, both = {}

|only_a|=2 <=2, |only_b|=2 <=2, so "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=2

i=3: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Good.

Another test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,4]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {3}, both = {2,4}

|only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), aOnes=2

i=3: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in a and b, choose bOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 == bOnes=1), bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Perfect.

Wait, but consider this tricky case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,2]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {3}, both = {2,4}

|only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), aOnes=2

i=3: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in a and b, choose bOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 == bOnes=1), bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Good.

Another tricky case:

n=4, m=4, k=4

a = [1,2,2,2]

b = [2,3,4,4]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {3}, both = {2,4}

|only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), aOnes=2

i=3: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in a and b, choose bOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 == bOnes=1), bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {4}, both = {2,3}

|only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes +=1 (aOnes=1 < bOnes=0), aOnes=2

i=3: in a and b, choose bOnes +=1 (aOnes=2 > bOnes=0), bOnes=1

i=4: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Good.

But what if:

n=2, m=2, k=4

a = [1,2]

b = [3,4]

only_a = {1,2}, only_b = {3,4}, both = {}

|only_a|=2 <=2, |only_b|=2 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=2

i=3: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

i=4: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Perfect.

Another edge case:

n=1, m=1, k=2

a = [1]

b = [2]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {2}, both = {}

|only_a|=1 <=1, |only_b|=1 <=1, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

aOnes=1, bOnes=1, "YES"

Good.

One more edge case:

n=2, m=2, k=2

a = [1,1]

b = [2,2]

only_a = {1}, only_b = {2}, both = {}

|only_a|=1 <=1, |only_b|=1 <=1, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes +=1, aOnes=1

i=2: in b, bOnes +=1, bOnes=1

aOnes=1, bOnes=1, "YES"

Correct.

Seems like the provided program, despite its seemingly suboptimal logic, arrives at the correct answer for these cases.

However, considering time constraints, since n and m can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 4e5, the program needs to be efficient.

The provided program has a loop from 1 to k, and for each i, it checks "if i in a" and "if i in b", which could be O(k * (n + m)) per test case, which is too slow for the given constraints.

To optimize, I need a faster way to check presence.

I can convert a and b to sets for O(1) lookups.

But even then, with t=1e4 and k up to 2e5, it's still potentially too slow.

Wait, but the problem states that the sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 4e5, so overall time should be acceptable if implemented efficiently.

But perhaps there's a better way.

In my earlier logic, I suggested computing only_a, only_b, and both, which can be done by creating sets of unique numbers in a and b intersected with [1,k], then taking set differences.

This can be done in O(n + m) per test case, which is acceptable.

Then, checking |only_a| <= k/2 and |only_b| <= k/2 is O(1).

Overall, this seems efficient and correct.

Comparing to the provided program, which seems to work correctly for the sample inputs, but might be inefficient.

Moreover, my logic is simpler and more straightforward.

Therefore, I would say that the provided program is correct, but not optimal.

However, since the problem only asks to determine correctness, not efficiency, and assuming it runs within time limits, I would say it's correct.

But to be sure, let's consider if there are any cases where it might fail.

Suppose:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,3,4]

In my logic: only_a={1}, only_b={4}, both={2,3}, |only_a|=1 <=2, |only_b|=1 <=2, "YES"

In the program's logic:

i=1: in a, aOnes=1

i=2: in a and b, choose aOnes=2

i=3: in a and b, choose bOnes=1

i=4: in b, bOnes=2

aOnes=2, bOnes=2, "YES"

Another case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,4]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a={1}, only_b={3}, both={2,4}, "YES"

Program's logic:

i=1: aOnes=1

i=2: aOnes=2

i=3: bOnes=1

i=4: bOnes=2

"YES"

Seems consistent.

Another case:

n=2, m=2, k=4

a = [1,3]

b = [2,4]

only_a={1,3}, only_b={2,4}, both={}, "YES"

Program's logic:

i=1: aOnes=1

i=2: bOnes=1

i=3: aOnes=2

i=4: bOnes=2

"YES"

Good.

One more:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,3,4]

only_a={1}, only_b={4}, both={2,3}, "YES"

Program's logic:

i=1: aOnes=1

i=2: aOnes=2

i=3: bOnes=1

i=4: bOnes=2

"YES"

All right.

I can't find a case where the program fails, and my logic confirms it should work.

Therefore, I conclude that the provided program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
