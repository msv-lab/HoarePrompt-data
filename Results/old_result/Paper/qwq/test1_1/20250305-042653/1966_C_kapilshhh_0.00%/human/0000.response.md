Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones. Alice and Bob take turns removing stones. On each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which must be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile, and then removes k stones from each non-empty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

Alice goes first, and both players play optimally. I need to determine who wins each game for multiple test cases.

Looking at the input format: The first line is the number of test cases t. For each test case, the first line is n, the number of piles, followed by a line with n integers representing the number of stones in each pile.

Constraints are important here: t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, with a sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5. Also, the number of stones in each pile can be up to 10^9.

Given these constraints, efficiency is key. I need an algorithm that can handle up to 2*10^5 test cases quickly.

Let me think about the game mechanics. In each move, the player chooses a k (where k is at most the smallest pile's size) and removes k stones from every non-empty pile.

This is different from standard Nim or other stone-removal games where stones are typically removed from one pile at a time. Here, choosing a k affects all piles simultaneously.

I need to find a way to determine the winner without simulating the entire game, which would be too slow given the constraints.

Maybe I can find some mathematical pattern or formula that directly tells me who wins based on the initial configuration of the piles.

Let me consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 5

Piles: 3 3 3 3 3

Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty in one move. So Alice wins.

Second test case:

n = 2

Piles: 1 7

Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has 1 stone). After removing 1 from each pile, the piles become 0 and 6. Now it's Bob's turn. Bob can choose k up to 6 (since the smallest non-empty pile is 6), but if he chooses k=6, he removes 6 stones from the pile of 6, making it 0, and the other pile is already 0. So Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the example output, Bob wins this case.

Third test case:

n = 7

Piles: 1 3 9 7 4 2 100

This seems more complex. I need a general approach.

Perhaps I should look at the game in terms of the number of possible moves.

Wait, but with large n and large stone counts, I need something efficient.

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of times stones can be removed until all piles are empty.

Consider that in each move, the player chooses a k and removes k stones from each pile. This is equivalent to reducing the height of each pile by k.

So, if I think of the piles as lengths, each move cuts the same amount from each pile.

This seems similar to the game of cutting sticks where each cut reduces the length of all sticks by the same amount.

In such games, the number of moves required to reduce all sticks to zero is equal to the number of distinct lengths of the sticks.

Wait, is that right?

Let me think.

Suppose I have piles of sizes 3, 3, 3. As in the first example.

The number of distinct sizes is 1 (only 3). And Alice wins by removing all stones in one move.

In the second example, piles are 1 and 7. Distinct sizes: 1 and 7, so 2 distinct sizes. Bob wins.

Wait, in the third test case, piles are 1,3,9,7,4,2,100: 7 distinct sizes. Alice wins.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=3, piles:1,2,3. Distinct sizes:3. Alice wins.

Fifth test case, n=6, piles:2,1,3,4,2,4. Distinct sizes:2,1,3,4 -> 4 distinct sizes. Bob wins.

Sixth test case, n=8, piles:5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2. Distinct sizes:5,7,2,9,6,3 -> 6 distinct sizes. Alice wins.

Seventh test case, n=1, pile:1000000000. Distinct sizes:1. Alice wins.

So, looking at the number of distinct pile sizes:

- If the number of distinct sizes is odd, Alice wins.

- If it's even, Bob wins.

Wait, let's check the examples:

1. n=5, piles:3,3,3,3,3 -> distinct sizes:1 -> Alice wins.

2. n=2, piles:1,7 -> distinct sizes:2 -> Bob wins.

3. n=7, piles:1,3,9,7,4,2,100 -> distinct sizes:7 -> Alice wins.

4. n=3, piles:1,2,3 -> distinct sizes:3 -> Alice wins.

5. n=6, piles:2,1,3,4,2,4 -> distinct sizes:4 -> Bob wins.

6. n=8, piles:5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2 -> distinct sizes:6 -> Alice wins.

7. n=1, pile:1000000000 -> distinct sizes:1 -> Alice wins.

This seems to match the sample outputs.

So, perhaps the game can be determined by the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

This seems too straightforward. Is this always true?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose n=2, piles:1,1. Distinct sizes:1 -> Alice wins.

But in this case, Alice can choose k=1, remove 1 from each pile, making both piles empty, and win immediately.

Another case: n=3, piles:1,1,1. Distinct sizes:1 -> Alice wins by choosing k=1 and removing all stones.

n=2, piles:1,2. Distinct sizes:2 -> Bob wins.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile, making piles 0 and 1.

Then Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from the remaining pile, making it 0, and wins.

So, seems consistent.

Another case: n=4, piles:1,2,2,3. Distinct sizes:3 -> Alice wins.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile: piles become 0,1,1,2.

Now, Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,0,1.

Then Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from the last pile, making it 0, and wins.

So, Alice wins when the number of distinct sizes is odd.

Wait, but in the second test case, distinct sizes:2 -> Bob wins.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Let me consider a more complex example.

Suppose n=4, piles:1,2,3,4. Distinct sizes:4 -> Bob wins.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile: piles become 0,1,2,3.

Now, Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,1,2.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,0,1.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from the last pile: piles become all 0. Bob wins.

So, consistent with the parity of the number of distinct sizes.

Another example: n=5, piles:1,2,3,4,5. Distinct sizes:5 -> Alice wins.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile: piles become 0,1,2,3,4.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,1,2,3.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,0,1,2.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile: piles become 0,0,0,0,1.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from the last pile: piles become all 0. Alice wins.

So, seems to hold.

Wait, but in the second test case, with n=2, piles:1,7, distinct sizes:2 -> Bob wins, which matches.

Hence, it seems that the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes determines the winner.

Therefore, to solve the problem, I just need to find the number of distinct pile sizes in each test case and output "Alice" if it's odd, and "Bob" if it's even.

This approach is efficient because for each test case, I can sort the pile sizes and count the number of unique values, which can be done in O(n log n) time per test case, but since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, this should be acceptable.

Wait, but sorting is not necessary. I can use a set to count unique pile sizes, which would be O(n) per test case, since set operations in Python are efficient.

But, in the provided program, the approach seems different. Let's look at the given program.

The program does the following:

- Read the number of test cases tc.

- For each test case:

- Read n, the number of piles.

- Read the pile sizes, convert them to integers, and store them in a list.

- Create a sorted list of unique pile sizes in descending order and append a 0 at the end.

- Initialize a variable dp to True.

- Set n to the length of the unique sorted list minus 1.

- Iterate through the list from the first to the second last element:

- For each element, check if arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1 or not dp, and set dp accordingly.

- Print "Alice" if dp is True, else print "Alice" again. Wait, that seems like a mistake.

Wait, in the last line, it should probably print "Bob" if dp is False, but in the code, it always prints "Alice", which is likely a typo.

Assuming it's a typo and it should print "Bob" when dp is False, let's analyze the logic.

So, the program seems to be trying to compute something based on the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.

But from my earlier analysis, it seems that simply counting the number of distinct pile sizes and checking its parity is sufficient.

Is the provided program's logic equivalent to this?

Let's see.

In the program, it sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a 0 at the end.

Then, it iterates through the list and for each pair of consecutive elements, checks if their difference is greater than 1 or toggles dp based on some condition.

This seems overly complicated compared to just counting the number of unique pile sizes.

Moreover, in my analysis, the winner depends solely on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

Therefore, the provided program seems unnecessary complex and likely incorrect due to the typo in printing "Alice" in both cases.

Hence, I think the correct approach is to count the number of unique pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
