Alright, so I have this problem here about Alice and Bob playing a game with their wallets. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses. We need to determine who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. So, in each turn, the player has two options:

1. Swap wallets with the opponent.

2. Keep the current wallet.

After choosing one of these, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet. Importantly, the wallet cannot have zero coins before removing the coin. So, if a player's current wallet has zero coins, they can't remove a coin and thus lose.

The game continues until one player can't make a move. Since both play optimally, they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

Looking at the provided program, it seems quite straightforward. There's a main function, func_2, which reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads the values of 'a' and 'b', passes them to func_1, and collects the results. Finally, it prints out the winners for each test case.

The func_1 function simply checks if the sum of 'a' and 'b' is even or odd. If it's even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

Wait a minute, is this correct? Does the sum of 'a' and 'b' determine the winner so simply? I need to verify this.

Let's look at the example provided in the problem statement.

Input:

10

1 1

1 4

5 3

4 5

11 9

83 91

1032 9307

839204 7281

1000000000 1000000000

53110 2024

Output:

Bob

Alice

Bob

Alice

Bob

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Bob

So, for the first test case, a=1, b=1. Sum is 2, which is even, and the output is 'Bob', which matches func_1's logic.

Second test case, a=1, b=4. Sum is 5, which is odd, and the output is 'Alice', again matching.

Third test case, a=5, b=3. Sum is 8, even, 'Bob'.

Fourth, a=4, b=5. Sum 9, odd, 'Alice'.

This seems to hold for the first few test cases. But is this a general rule?

I need to think about the game more deeply. Let's consider the game as a impartial game, where the possible moves don't depend on who's moving, only on the game state.

In such games, we can use the concept of Nimbers or mex function to determine the game's outcome. But maybe there's a simpler way here.

Let me try to see if the sum being even or odd indeed determines the winner.

Consider the base case: a=1, b=1.

As shown in the example, Alice can't swap or not swap in a way that leads to her victory, and Bob wins. So, sum=2 even, Bob wins. Correct.

Another base case: a=1, b=2.

If Alice swaps, she gets b=2, and removes 1, so b=1. Now Bob has a=1, b=1. If Bob doesn't swap, a=0, b=1. Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. She must swap to a=1, b=0. Bob's turn: a=1, b=0. He removes 1 from a, a=0, b=0. Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to func_1, sum=3 is odd, so Alice should win, but in this case, Bob wins. Contradiction.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the game play.

Let's replay:

Alice starts with a=1, b=2.

Option 1: Swap, so a=2, b=1. Remove 1 from a, so a=1, b=1.

Now Bob's turn: a=1, b=1.

Bob can swap, a=1, b=1 (no change), remove 1 from a, a=0, b=1.

Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. She must not swap, because swapping would be a=1, b=0. She removes 1 from a=1, a=0, b=0. Now Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to func_1, sum=3 is odd, so Alice should win, which matches this outcome.

But earlier, I thought of another scenario where Bob wins, but that was incorrect.

So perhaps the func_1 is correct.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for a=1, b=4, it's sum=5, which is odd, and the output is 'Alice', which matches.

Another test case: a=1, b=1, sum=2 even, 'Bob', matches.

a=1, b=2, sum=3 odd, 'Alice', matches my corrected game play above.

So maybe it's correct.

But I need to think more deeply.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of coins.

Each move, a player reduces the number of coins in their current wallet by 1.

They can choose to swap wallets before removing the coin.

The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin, i.e., their current wallet has 0 coins.

So, the game is about managing the coins in two wallets, with the option to swap them each turn.

I need to find a general strategy or pattern that determines the winner based on 'a' and 'b'.

Looking at func_1, it's simply checking if a + b is even or odd.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me consider the total number of coins: a + b.

Each move, one coin is removed from the total, since one coin is removed from one of the wallets.

The game continues until one player is unable to remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet has 0 coins.

So, the game effectively ends when one wallet is empty, and the other player cannot make a move.

Wait, but both wallets can be empty at some point.

Wait, no, because once one wallet is empty, the player whose turn it is and who has to remove a coin from their wallet cannot do so if their wallet is empty.

So, the game ends when a player has an empty wallet and must remove a coin from it.

But swapping wallets might allow a player to access the other wallet's coins.

Wait, but if a player's current wallet is empty, they must not swap to access the other wallet, unless swapping would give them a non-empty wallet.

Wait, but swapping would exchange the wallets, so if one wallet is empty and the other is not, swapping would give the empty wallet to the opponent.

But let's think differently.

Perhaps the game can be modeled as a Nim game with two heaps, where the heaps are the number of coins in each wallet, and players can reduce one heap by one each turn, with the option to swap the heaps.

But the swapping adds complexity.

Alternatively, maybe it's equivalent to a game where the total number of moves is a + b, and the player who is forced to make a move when one wallet is empty loses.

But I need to find a pattern.

Let me try to find a pattern by evaluating small values of a and b.

Let's make a table for a and b from 1 to 4.

For each pair (a, b), determine who wins.

I'll use the provided func_1 to see if it matches.

a b sum func_1 Winner according to func_1

1 1 2 Bob Bob (matches example)

1 2 3 Alice Alice (as in my corrected game play)

1 3 4 Bob Bob

1 4 5 Alice Alice (matches example)

2 1 3 Alice Alice

2 2 4 Bob Bob

2 3 5 Alice Alice

2 4 6 Bob Bob

3 1 4 Bob Bob

3 2 5 Alice Alice

3 3 6 Bob Bob

3 4 7 Alice Alice

4 1 5 Alice Alice

4 2 6 Bob Bob

4 3 7 Alice Alice

4 4 8 Bob Bob

Looking at this table, it seems that func_1 correctly predicts the winner for these small values.

But is this always true?

Let me try to think of a general proof.

Suppose a + b is even.

Then, func_1 says Bob wins.

Suppose a + b is odd.

Then, Alice wins.

Is there a pattern in the game that aligns with this?

Let me think in terms of the number of moves.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one.

The game starts with a + b coins.

The player who makes the last move wins, because the opponent cannot make a move after that.

Wait, no.

Actually, the player who cannot make a move loses.

So, if the total number of moves is even, and Bob makes the last move, then Bob wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the parity of the number of moves.

Let's see.

Each move consists of possibly swapping and then removing one coin.

But the swapping complicates things because it allows players to switch between the two wallets.

Perhaps I should consider the game as having a state (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each player, on their turn, can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

I need to find a way to determine the winning player based on the initial (a, b).

This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem.

In combinatorial game theory, the concept of Nimbers or the mex function can be used to determine the game's outcome.

But perhaps there's a simpler way here.

Let me consider the game without the swapping option.

If there's no swapping, then each player just removes one coin from their own wallet each turn.

The game would end when a player's wallet is empty, and they can't remove a coin.

In this case, the player with more coins would force the opponent to lose, by depleting their own coins last.

But with swapping, the game becomes more complex because players can choose to swap wallets, possibly to access the opponent's coins.

Wait, but only if it benefits them.

I need to find a strategy that allows a player to force a win based on the initial values of a and b.

Looking back at the func_1, which simply checks if a + b is even or odd, it seems too simplistic.

Is there something I'm missing?

Let me consider the game where a = b.

If a = b, then a + b is even.

According to func_1, Bob wins.

Is this correct?

Let's take a = b = 1.

As in the first example, Bob wins, which matches.

a = b = 2.

Sum is 4, even, Bob wins.

Let's simulate:

Alice's turn: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=2, b=2. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

Bob's turn: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

Alice's turn: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

Bob's turn: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=0, b=1. He must swap to a=1, b=0. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

This matches func_1.

Another case: a=3, b=3.

Sum=6, even, Bob wins.

Alice's move: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=3, b=3. Remove 1, a=2, b=3.

Bob's move: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=3, b=2. Remove 1, a=2, b=2.

Alice's move: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=2, b=2. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

Bob's move: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

Alice's move: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

Bob's move: swap to a=1, b=0. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

Alice can't move, Bob wins.

Again, matches func_1.

Now, let's consider a=1, b=2.

Sum=3, odd, Alice wins.

Alice's move: swap, a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

Bob's move: swap or not.

If he doesn't swap, a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: swap, a=0, b=1. Remove 1 from b, a=0, b=0.

Bob can't move, Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Bob swaps in his first move: a=1, b=1. Then same as above.

So, Alice wins, matches func_1.

Another case: a=2, b=1.

Sum=3, odd, Alice wins.

Alice's move: swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

Now, Bob must not swap, because swapping would give a=2, b=0.

He removes 1 from a=2, a=1, b=2.

Alice's move: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

Bob's move: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move: swap, a=0, b=1. Remove 1 from b, a=0, b=0.

Bob can't move, Alice wins.

Again, matches func_1.

Wait, but earlier I thought of a case where sum is odd, Alice wins, which matches func_1.

Similarly, for sum even, Bob wins.

So, perhaps func_1 is correct.

But I need to confirm this for larger values.

Given the time constraints, and the fact that the problem allows a and b up to 1e9, I need a efficient solution.

If func_1 is correct, then it's O(1) per test case, which is efficient.

But I need to be sure.

Let me consider a=1, b=1, sum=2 even, Bob wins. Matches example.

a=1, b=4, sum=5 odd, Alice wins. Matches example.

a=5, b=3, sum=8 even, Bob wins. Matches example.

a=4, b=5, sum=9 odd, Alice wins. Matches example.

a=11,9 sum=20 even, Bob wins. Matches example.

a=83,91 sum=174 even, Bob wins. Matches example.

a=1032,9307 sum=1032+9307=10339, which is odd, Alice wins. Matches example.

a=839204,7281 sum=846485, which is odd, Alice wins. Matches example.

a=1000000000,1000000000 sum=2000000000 even, Bob wins. Matches example.

a=53110,2024 sum=55134, which is even, Bob wins. Matches example.

So, all the example test cases match the func_1's output.

Additionally, my manual simulations for small a and b also match.

Therefore, it seems that func_1 is correct.

I can't find a counterexample where the sum being even or odd doesn't determine the winner as per func_1.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
