Alright, I have this problem here about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with their wallets. Each has some coins, and they take turns making moves according to specific rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the key points are:

1. Players take turns, Alice starts.

2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.

3. After choosing, they remove one coin from their current wallet.

4. The player who can't make a move loses.

I need to determine, for given values of 'a' and 'b', who will win the game if both play optimally.

Looking at the provided program, it seems quite straightforward. There's a main function that reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads 'a' and 'b', passes them to 'func_1', which determines the winner based on whether the sum of 'a' and 'b' is even or odd.

Wait a minute, that seems too simple. Is the winner determined just by whether the total number of coins is even or odd?

Looking back at the example in the problem statement:

- In the first test case, a=1, b=1. The output is "Bob".

- In the second test case, a=1, b=4. The output is "Alice".

But according to the program, for a=1, b=1, a+b=2 which is even, so Bob wins. For a=1, b=4, a+b=5 which is odd, so Alice wins. That matches the example outputs.

But is this logic correct in general? Let's think about it step by step.

Let me try to analyze the game.

First, the game involves two players, Alice and Bob, with each having a certain number of coins.

The game alternates between the players, with Alice starting first.

Each turn, a player can choose to swap the wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The game continues until a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins and they choose to keep it, but since they have to remove one coin, they can't, and thus lose.

I need to find a strategy that determines who will win based on the initial number of coins each has.

Let me consider some small values of 'a' and 'b' to see if I can find a pattern.

Case 1: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: must not swap because swapping would mean taking a wallet with zero coins, which is allowed, but he chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move because her wallet has zero coins, so Bob wins.

This matches the first test case.

Case 2: a=1, b=4.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=4, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: must not swap. Now a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: must swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

This matches the second test case.

Alright, so in the first case, where a+b is even (1+1=2), Bob wins.

In the second case, where a+b is odd (1+4=5), Alice wins.

Is this a general rule?

Let me try another case.

Case 3: a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: must not swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Here, a+b=4, which is even, and Bob wins.

Another case: a=2, b=3.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=3, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=2, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: must swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Here, a+b=5, which is odd, and Alice wins.

Another case: a=3, b=3.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=2, b=3.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. Now a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: must not swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Here, a+b=6, even, Bob wins.

Seems consistent.

Another case: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=2, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: must not swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Here, a+b=3, odd, Alice wins.

Another case: a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=2, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: must not swap. Now a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Here, a+b=4, even, but according to previous cases, when a+b is even, Bob wins, but in this case, Alice wins. Wait, this contradicts the earlier pattern.

Wait, in this case, a=1, b=3, a+b=4, even, but Alice wins.

Hmm, that contradicts the previous pattern where a+b even means Bob wins.

Wait, in the first test case, a=1, b=1, a+b=2 even, Bob wins.

In this new case, a=1, b=3, a+b=4 even, Alice wins.

So, the pattern doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe there's another factor at play.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the game is equivalent to some known impartial game in game theory, like Nim.

In Nim, the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner.

Maybe something similar here.

But in this game, the players can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin.

It's not exactly like Nim.

Let me try to model this game in terms of game theory.

This seems like an impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them at each turn.

In such games, the concept of Nimbers or mex can be applied.

But maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the game as a sequence of moves where players can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin.

The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as each player having a pile of coins, and in each turn, a player chooses which pile to remove a coin from, with the option to swap the piles.

But that's not exactly accurate because swapping affects both players' piles.

This seems more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the difference between the number of coins.

Let me consider the difference d = a - b.

In some games, the difference or the parity of the difference determines the winner.

In the earlier cases:

- When a+b is even, Bob wins.

- When a+b is odd, Alice wins.

But the counterexample (a=1, b=3) shows that when a+b is even, Alice can still win.

So that pattern is inconsistent.

Wait, in that case, a=1, b=3, a+b=4 even, but Alice wins.

In the first case, a=1, b=1, a+b=2 even, Bob wins.

So perhaps it's not just the sum that matters, but also the individual values.

Let me look for another pattern.

Maybe it's about the parity of a and b.

Let me consider:

- If both a and b are even.

- If both a and b are odd.

- If one is even and the other is odd.

Wait, in the first test case, a=1 odd, b=1 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1 odd, b=4 even, sum odd, Alice wins.

Third test case, a=5 odd, b=3 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4 even, b=5 odd, sum odd, Alice wins.

Fifth test case, a=11 odd, b=9 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

Sixth test case, a=83 odd, b=91 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

Seventh test case, a=1032 even, b=9307 odd, sum odd, Alice wins.

Eighth test case, a=839204 even, b=7281 odd, sum odd, Alice wins.

Ninth test case, a=1000000000 even, b=1000000000 even, sum even, Bob wins.

Tenth test case, a=53110 even, b=2024 even, sum even, Bob wins.

Wait, in the third test case, a=5 odd, b=3 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

But in the sixth test case, a=83 odd, b=91 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

Seventh test case, a=1032 even, b=9307 odd, sum odd, Alice wins.

So, when both a and b are odd, sum is even, Bob wins.

When one is even and one is odd, sum is odd, Alice wins.

When both are even, sum is even, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the tenth test case, a=53110 even, b=2024 even, sum even, Bob wins.

So, perhaps the pattern is:

- If both a and b have the same parity (both even or both odd), Bob wins.

- If a and b have different parities, Alice wins.

Looking back at the counterexample I thought of earlier, a=1 odd, b=3 odd, sum even, Bob wins.

But according to the earlier incorrect assumption, when a+b is even, Bob wins, but in another case, a=1, b=3, which is even, Alice wins. Wait, no, in that case, Bob wins.

Wait, in the counterexample I thought of earlier, a=1, b=3, a+b=4 even, but I thought Alice wins, but according to the pattern, Bob should win.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that earlier thought.

Let me replay that game:

a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses to swap. Now a=1, b=3.

This seems like it's repeating. But in reality, the game would continue until one player can't make a move.

Wait, but in this scenario, it's possible to cycle like this indefinitely.

Wait, no, because each time they swap, the amounts remain the same.

Wait, but in each turn, after swapping or not, they remove one coin from their current wallet.

I missed that in the earlier thought.

Let me correct that.

Starting with a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn:

- Chooses to swap: now a=3, b=1.

- Removes one coin from her current wallet: a=3-1=2, b=1.

- Now a=2, b=1.

- Bob's turn:

- Chooses to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Removes one coin from his current wallet: a=1, b=2-1=1.

- Now a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn:

- Chooses to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Removes one coin from her current wallet: a=1-1=0, b=1.

- Now a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn:

- Must not swap because swapping would mean taking a wallet with zero coins, which is allowed, but he chooses not to swap.

- Removes one coin from his current wallet: a=0, b=1-1=0.

- Now a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn:

- Must swap because her wallet is empty.

- Swaps: a=0, b=0.

- Can't remove a coin because her wallet is empty.

- Therefore, Bob wins.

Wait, according to this, Bob wins, which matches the pattern that when a and b have the same parity (both odd), Bob wins.

Wait, but earlier I thought Alice wins in this case, but actually, Bob wins.

So, the correct pattern seems to be:

- If a and b have the same parity (both even or both odd), Bob wins.

- If a and b have different parities (one even, one odd), Alice wins.

This matches all the test cases in the example.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

In 'func_1', it checks if a + b is even, which means a and b have the same parity, and returns 'Bob'. If a + b is odd, which means a and b have different parities, it returns 'Alice'.

This seems to be the correct logic.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have, assuming both play optimally.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin from their chosen wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Insight**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the parities of the number of coins each player has.
   - If both `a` and `b` are even or both are odd, Bob wins.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is even and the other is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - We need to check the sum of `a` and `b`. 
   - If the sum is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

## Solution Code

```python
def determine_winner(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = determine_winner(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **determine_winner function**: Determines the winner based on the parities of `a` and `b`.
  - If `a + b` is even, returns 'Bob'.
  - If `a + b` is odd, returns 'Alice'.

- **main function**: Handles input and output operations.
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads `a` and `b`, determines the winner using `determine_winner`, and stores the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures an efficient determination of the winner for each test case based on the parity of the sum of coins, achieving O(1) time complexity per test case.
