Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

We have a village with n houses, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left side (0) or the right side (1). This preference is given in a sequence a1 to an, where each aj is either 0 or 1.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. So, if the road is built between house i and i+1, then houses 1 to i are on the left side, and houses i+1 to n are on the right side.

The goal is to choose the position for the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. That is, on the left side, at least ceil(i/2) residents want to be on the left (0), and on the right side, at least ceil((n-i)/2) residents want to be on the right (1).

Moreover, among all possible positions that satisfy this condition, we need to choose the one where the road is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to the middle, we should choose the smaller i.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

7

3

101

6

010111

6

011001

3

000

3

110

3

001

4

1100

Output:

2

3

2

3

0

1

0

So, for n=3 and a="101", the output is 2. That means the road is built after house 2.

Let's verify:

- Left side: houses 1 and 2 with preferences 1 and 0. So, out of 2, at least ceil(2/2)=1 should want to be on the left. Only one (0) wants to be on the left, so it satisfies.

- Right side: house 3 with preference 1. So, out of 1, at least ceil(1/2)=1 should want to be on the right. It does, so it's good.

Now, why not i=1 or i=0?

- i=0: Entire village is on the right side. So, n=3, need at least ceil(3/2)=2 residents wanting right. In "101", two 1's, so it satisfies. But, is it closer to the middle than i=2?

- i=2: Distance to middle is |3/2 - 2| = |1.5 - 2| = 0.5

- i=0: Distance to middle is |1.5 - 0| = 1.5

So, i=2 is closer to the middle.

Another example: n=6, a="010111"

Output: 3

Let's check:

- Left side: houses 1 to 3 with "010". So, out of 3, at least ceil(3/2)=2 should want left (0). We have two 0's, so it's good.

- Right side: houses 4 to 6 with "111". So, out of 3, at least ceil(3/2)=2 should want right (1). All three want right, so it's good.

Is there any other position with the same distance to the middle or closer?

- i=2: Left: "01" (out of 2, ceil(2/2)=1 should want left. One 0 wants left.

- Right: "0111" (out of 4, ceil(4/2)=2 should want right. Two 1's, so it's good.

Distance to middle: |3 - 2| = 1

- i=1: Left: "0" (out of 1, ceil(1/2)=1 should want left. It does.

- Right: "10111" (out of 5, ceil(5/2)=3 should want right. Three 1's, so it's good.

Distance to middle: |3 - 1| = 2

- i=4: Left: "0101" (out of 4, ceil(4/2)=2 should want left. Two 0's, so it's good.

- Right: "111" (out of 3, ceil(3/2)=2 should want right. Two 1's, so it's good.

Distance to middle: |3 - 4| = 1

- i=3 has distance 0, which is better than 1.

Wait, no: i=3 has distance |3 - 3| = 0, which is better than i=2 or i=4.

So, i=3 is the best.

Alright, now I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints:

- t test cases, up to 2*10^4

- n up to 3*10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5

So, overall time complexity should be O(n), or O(n log n) at most, but preferably O(n).

First, I need to preprocess the prefix sums for the number of 0's and 1's.

Let's define S[i] as the number of 0's in the first i houses.

And T[i] as the number of 1's in the first i houses.

Wait, actually, it's better to have prefix sums.

Define S[0] = [0,0]

S[1] = [a1==0, a1==1]

S[2] = [a1==0 + a2==0, a1==1 + a2==1]

...

S[i] = [sum of 0's in a1 to ai, sum of 1's in a1 to ai]

Then, for any i, number of 0's on the left side is S[i][0]

Number of 1's on the right side is T[n] - T[i]

Wait, better to have cumulative sums.

Wait, in the code provided, S is a list where S[i] = [number of 0's in a1 to ai, number of 1's in a1 to ai]

So, S[0] = [0,0]

S[1] = [1 if a1==0 else 0, 1 if a1==1 else 0]

...

S[n] = [total 0's, total 1's]

Then, for a given i, left side is houses 1 to i.

Number of 0's on left: S[i][0]

Number of 1's on left: S[i][1]

Number of 0's on right: S[n][0] - S[i][0]

Number of 1's on right: S[n][1] - S[i][1]

Wait, but in the code, it's S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

Yes, S[-1] is S[n]

So, it's correct.

Now, for the left side, which has i houses, we need at least ceil(i/2) residents wanting left, which means 0's.

Similarly, on the right side, which has n-i houses, we need at least ceil((n-i)/2) residents wanting right, which means 1's.

So, the conditions are:

Left side: S[i][0] >= ceil(i / 2)

Right side: (S[n][1] - S[i][1]) >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

We need to find the smallest i where both these conditions hold, and among all such i, choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|.

Wait, actually, in the code provided, it's iterating through all i from 0 to n-1, checking the conditions, and keeping track of the i with the smallest |n/2 - i|.

Wait, in the code, it's func_2() which calls func_1() for each test case.

In func_1(), it reads n and a, then computes S as a list of [sum of 0's so far, sum of 1's so far].

Then, it iterates through i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it checks:

left = S[i][0]

lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1] = i

right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

rsum = n - lsum = n - i

if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:

continue

elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):

ans = i

Wait, but in the problem, i ranges from 0 to n-1, and ans is initialized to 0.

But in the code, ans is initialized to 0, and satisfy is initialized to 0, but satisfy is not used.

So, it seems like ans is being updated to the i with the smallest |n/2 - i| where the conditions hold.

But, in the problem, if there are multiple i with the same |n/2 - i|, we should choose the smaller i.

In the code, it's choosing the i with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, it's taking the last one, since it's iterating from i=0 to i=n-1.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

for i in range(n):

left = S[i][0]

lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]

right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

rsum = n - lsum

if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:

continue

elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):

ans = i

So, it's iterating i from 0 to n-1, and updating ans if the current i has a smaller or equal |n/2 - i|.

Since it's iterating in increasing order of i, if there are multiple i with the same |n/2 - i|, it will take the smaller i.

Which matches the problem's requirement.

Now, let's check if the logic is correct.

First, the prefix sums are correctly computed.

Then, for each i, it calculates:

left: number of 0's on the left side (houses 1 to i)

lsum: total houses on the left side, which is i

right: number of 1's on the right side (houses i+1 to n)

rsum: total houses on the right side, which is n - i

Then, it checks if left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum

Wait, in the code, it's left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, then continue.

Which means, if either left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, skip this i.

Else, check if |n/2 - i| <= |n/2 - ans|, and if so, set ans = i

Finally, print ans

Seems correct.

But, in the problem, it's ceil(x/2), which is equal to (x + 1) // 2 in integer division.

So, left >= ceil(i / 2) is equivalent to left >= (i + 1) // 2

Similarly, right >= ceil((n - i)/2) is right >= (n - i + 1) // 2

In the code, it's checking left * 2 >= lsum, which is left >= lsum / 2

But lsum is i, so left >= i / 2

Since left is integer, and i / 2 could be a float, but in Python, it's fine because left >= floor(i / 2)

But we need left >= ceil(i / 2)

Wait, ceil(i / 2) is equal to (i + 1) // 2

While left >= floor(i / 2) is left >= i // 2

So, the code is checking left >= floor(i / 2), but we need left >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly for right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

So, the code might accept some i where left >= floor(i / 2) instead of ceil(i / 2)

Wait, in the code, it's left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum

Which is equivalent to left < floor(lsum / 2) or right < floor(rsum / 2)

But we need left >= ceil(lsum / 2) and right >= ceil(rsum / 2)

Wait, floor(x / 2) is equal to floor(x / 2), while ceil(x / 2) is equal to (x + 1) // 2

So, left >= ceil(i / 2) is equivalent to left > floor(i / 2)

Because ceil(x) = floor(x) + 1 if x is not integer, else ceil(x) = floor(x)

But in integer division, ceil(x / 2) = (x + 1) // 2

While floor(x / 2) = x // 2

So, left >= ceil(i / 2) is left > floor(i / 2)

Similarly, right >= ceil((n - i)/2) is right > floor((n - i)/2)

But in the code, it's left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, which is left < lsum / 2 or right < rsum / 2

Which is equivalent to left <= floor(lsum / 2) - 1 or right <= floor(rsum / 2) - 1

Wait, no.

left * 2 < lsum is equivalent to left < lsum / 2

Since lsum = i, left < i / 2

Similarly, right < rsum / 2

So, if left < floor(i / 2) or right < floor((n - i)/2), skip this i.

Else, consider this i.

But we need left >= ceil(i / 2) and right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

Wait, ceil(i / 2) = floor((i + 1)/2)

So, ceil(i / 2) = (i + 1) // 2

Similarly, ceil((n - i)/2) = (n - i + 1) // 2

Now, let's see when left >= ceil(i / 2)

Which is left >= (i + 1) // 2

And right >= (n - i + 1) // 2

In the code, it's skipping when left < floor(i / 2) or right < floor((n - i)/2)

But floor(i / 2) = i // 2

And ceil(i / 2) = (i + 1) // 2

So, floor(i / 2) <= ceil(i / 2) - 1 when i is odd, and equal when i is even.

Wait, for i even:

ceil(i / 2) = floor(i / 2)

For i odd:

ceil(i / 2) = floor(i / 2) + 1

So, ceil(i / 2) = floor((i + 1)/2)

Similarly, ceil((n - i)/2) = floor((n - i + 1)/2)

Now, in the code, it's checking left < floor(i / 2) or right < floor((n - i)/2)

And skipping if that's the case.

But we need left >= ceil(i / 2) and right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

So, the code is not exactly checking for left >= ceil(i / 2) and right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

Wait, let's see:

If left >= ceil(i / 2), then left >= (i + 1) // 2

And right >= ceil((n - i)/2) = (n - i + 1) // 2

In the code, it's skipping when left < floor(i / 2) or right < floor((n - i)/2)

Which is equivalent to not (left >= floor(i / 2) and right >= floor((n - i)/2))

But we need left >= ceil(i / 2) and right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

So, the code is not correctly implementing the required conditions.

Because ceil(x / 2) can be greater than floor(x / 2).

For example, when i is odd, ceil(i / 2) = floor(i / 2) + 1

So, the code might accept i where left >= floor(i / 2), but we need left >= ceil(i / 2)

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's verify with an example.

Take n=3, a="101"

From earlier, i=2 is acceptable.

left = S[2][0] = number of 0's in "10" = 1

ceil(2 / 2) = 1, so left >= 1, which holds.

right = S[-1][1] - S[2][1] = total 1's - 1's in first 2 houses = 2 - 1 = 1

ceil((3 - 2)/2) = ceil(1 / 2) = 1, so right >= 1, holds.

Now, i=1:

left = S[1][0] = number of 0's in "1" = 0

ceil(1 / 2) = 1, 0 < 1, so doesn't hold.

i=0:

left = S[0][0] = 0

ceil(0 / 2) = 0, so left >= 0 holds.

right = S[-1][1] - S[0][1] = 2 - 0 = 2

ceil((3 - 0)/2) = ceil(3 / 2) = 2, so right >= 2 holds.

So, i=0 and i=2 are acceptable.

But in the code, it chooses i=2 because it's closer to n/2=1.5.

Now, in this case, the code would accept i=0 and i=2.

But according to the problem, i=2 is better because |1.5 - 2| = 0.5 < |1.5 - 0| = 1.5

So, it's choosing i=2 correctly.

But in the code, it initializes ans=0, and then checks for each i from 0 to n-1.

So, for i=0, ans=0

Then for i=2, |1.5 - 2| = 0.5 < |1.5 - 0| = 1.5, so ans=2

Then for i=1, it's skipped because left=0 < floor(1/2)=0, but floor(1/2)=0, left=0 >= 0, wait:

left=0, floor(1/2)=0, so left >= floor(1/2), which is 0 >= 0, holds.

right=1, floor((3-1)/2)=1, right=1 >=1, holds.

So, it would consider i=1, and |1.5 -1|=0.5, which is equal to |1.5 -2|=0.5, so it would take i=1, but according to the problem, we need to take the smaller i, which is i=1.

But in the sample input, for n=3 and a="101", output is 2.

Wait, perhaps the code doesn't consider i=1 because left=0 >= ceil(1/2)=1, which is not true.

Wait, there's a discrepancy.

In the code, it's checking left >= floor(i / 2) and right >= floor((n - i)/2)

But we need left >= ceil(i / 2) and right >= ceil((n - i)/2)

So, in this case, for i=1:

left=0 >= ceil(1/2)=1, which is false, so it should skip i=1.

But according to the code, left=0 >= floor(1/2)=0, which is true.

right=1 >= floor(2/2)=1, which is true.

So, the code would consider i=1, but it shouldn't because left=0 < ceil(1/2)=1

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the code is incorrect because it's using floor instead of ceil in the conditions.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal position to build a road that divides the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side assignment. The road should be as close as possible to the middle of the village.

### Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - We maintain a prefix sum array `S` where each element is a pair `[count_zeros, count_ones]` up to that house.
    
2. **Condition Checking**:
    - For each possible position `i` (0 to n-1), we check if the number of residents satisfied on both sides meets or exceeds the required threshold.
    - Specifically, for the left side (houses 1 to i):
        - At least `ceil(i / 2)` residents want to be on the left (0).
    - For the right side (houses i+1 to n):
        - At least `ceil((n - i) / 2)` residents want to be on the right (1).
        
3. **Minimizing Distance to Middle**:
    - We select the position `i` that minimizes `|n/2 - i|`. If multiple positions have the same distance, we choose the smallest `i`.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = data[idx]
        idx += 1
        S = [[0, 0]]
        for s in a:
            x, y = S[-1]
            if s == '0':
                x += 1
            else:
                y += 1
            S.append([x, y])
        ans = -1
        min_dist = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            left_zeros = S[i][0]
            left_total = i
            right_ones = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
            right_total = n - i
            required_left = (left_total + 1) // 2
            required_right = (right_total + 1) // 2
            if left_zeros >= required_left and right_ones >= required_right:
                dist = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    ans = i
                elif dist == min_dist:
                    ans = min(ans, i)
        print(ans if ans != -1 else 0)

```

### Explanation

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - We create a list `S` to store cumulative counts of 0's and 1's up to each house.
    
2. **Condition Checking**:
    - For each possible division position `i`, calculate the number of 0's on the left and 1's on the right.
    - Check if these counts meet or exceed the required thresholds using ceiling division.
    
3. **Minimizing Distance to Middle**:
    - Track the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.
    - If multiple positions have the same distance, choose the smallest `i`.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the optimal road position while adhering to the problem constraints.
