Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a strip of cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'). I need to choose one continuous segment to paint white, and after painting, all the 'B's in that segment become 'W's, and the 'W's stay as they are. My goal is to make the entire strip white, and I need to find the minimum length of such a segment.

First, I need to understand what it means to paint a segment white. If I paint a segment from position i to j, all 'B's in that segment become 'W's. So, to make the entire strip white, I need to ensure that all 'B's in the strip are covered by this segment.

Wait a minute, if I paint a segment that covers all the 'B's, and leave the 'W's alone, then after painting, all 'B's in that segment become 'W's, and any 'B's outside that segment remain 'B's. But the problem says that after painting, the entire strip should be white. That means all 'B's must be within the painted segment.

So, the minimal segment I need to paint is the segment that covers all the 'B's in the strip. Any segment shorter than that wouldn't cover all 'B's, meaning some 'B's would remain outside the painted segment and hence remain 'B's.

But let's look at the example to confirm this understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 6

s = W B B W B W

I need to find the minimal segment to paint white so that the entire strip becomes white.

Looking at the positions:

1: W

2: B

3: B

4: W

5: B

6: W

So, 'B's are at positions 2,3,5.

If I paint from position 2 to 5, which is positions 2,3,4,5, then the 'B's at positions 2,3,5 become 'W's, and position 4 is already 'W', so it stays 'W'. After painting, the strip becomes:

1: W

2: W

3: W

4: W

5: W

6: W

Which is all white. The length of this segment is 4.

Is there a shorter segment? Let's see.

If I paint from position 2 to 4, that covers positions 2,3,4.

After painting, positions 2 and 3 become 'W', position 4 is already 'W', and position 5 is 'B', which is not covered, so it remains 'B'. So, the strip would be:

1: W

2: W

3: W

4: W

5: B

6: W

Which is not all white. So, segment length 4 is necessary in this case.

Another test case:

n = 1

s = B

Here, I need to paint the only cell, which has length 1, to make it white.

n = 2

s = W B

'B' is at position 2. If I paint position 2, length 1, it becomes 'W', so the entire strip is white.

n = 3

s = B B W

'B's are at positions 1 and 2. If I paint from position 1 to 2, length 2, 'B's become 'W's, and position 3 is already 'W', so the entire strip is white.

n = 4

s = B W W B

'B's are at positions 1 and 4. If I paint from position 1 to 4, length 4, all 'B's are covered and become 'W's.

Is there a shorter segment? If I paint from position 1 to 3, positions 1,2,3: positions 1 and 2 are 'B's, they become 'W's, but position 4 is 'B' and not covered, so it remains 'B'. So, length 4 is necessary.

n = 6

s = B W B W W B

'B's are at positions 1,3,6. If I paint from position 1 to 6, length 6, all 'B's are covered.

Is there a shorter segment? If I paint from position 1 to 5, positions 1,3 are covered, but position 6 is not, so it remains 'B'. So, length 6 is necessary.

n = 6

s = W W B B W B

'B's are at positions 3,4,6. If I paint from position 3 to 6, length 4, 'B's at positions 3,4,6 are covered and become 'W's.

After painting, the strip is:

1: W

2: W

3: W

4: W

5: W

6: W

So, length 4 is sufficient.

Is there a shorter segment? If I paint from position 3 to 5, positions 3,4,5: 'B's at positions 3,4 become 'W's, position 5 is 'W', so position 6 is 'B' and not covered, remains 'B'. So, length 4 is necessary.

n = 9

s = W B W B W W W B W

'B's are at positions 2,4,8.

If I paint from position 2 to 8, length 7, 'B's at positions 2,4,8 become 'W's.

After painting:

1: W

2: W

3: W

4: W

5: W

6: W

7: W

8: W

9: W

So, length 7.

Is there a shorter segment? If I paint from position 2 to 7, positions 2,4 are covered, but position 8 is not, so it remains 'B'. So, length 7 is necessary.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal segment length is the distance from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

So, to generalize, find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment to paint is from the leftmost 'B' to the rightmost 'B', inclusive.

The length of this segment is (rightmost 'B' position - leftmost 'B' position + 1).

Wait, but in the first example:

s = W B B W B W

leftmost 'B' at position 2

rightmost 'B' at position 5

length = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second example:

s = B

leftmost 'B' at position 1

rightmost 'B' at position 1

length = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

Third example:

s = W B

leftmost 'B' at position 2

rightmost 'B' at position 2

length = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1

Fourth example:

s = B B W

leftmost 'B' at position 1

rightmost 'B' at position 2

length = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2

Fifth example:

s = B W W B

leftmost 'B' at position 1

rightmost 'B' at position 4

length = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4

Sixth example:

s = B W B W W B

leftmost 'B' at position 1

rightmost 'B' at position 6

length = 6 - 1 + 1 = 6

Seventh example:

s = W W B B W B

leftmost 'B' at position 3

rightmost 'B' at position 6

length = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4

Eighth example:

s = W B W B W W W B W

leftmost 'B' at position 2

rightmost 'B' at position 8

length = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7

All of these match the sample outputs.

So, the minimal segment length is the distance between the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', inclusive.

Hence, in code, I need to find the index of the first 'B' and the index of the last 'B', and compute the difference.

But I need to be careful with the indexing. If the positions are 1-based, then the length is (right - left + 1).

In programming, strings are 0-based in Python, so I need to adjust for that.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the cells are numbered from 1 from left to right", so positions are 1-based.

But in Python, string indices are 0-based.

So, if s = "WBBWBW", positions correspond to:

Position 1: s[0]

Position 2: s[1]

...

Position 6: s[5]

So, to find the leftmost 'B', find the index of the first 'B' in s, then add 1 for 1-based indexing.

Similarly, find the index of the last 'B' in s, add 1 for 1-based indexing, then compute length as right - left + 1.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the given code:

def func_1():

ma = mi = 0

m = int(input())

s = input()

c = d = 0

l = []

for j in s:

c += 1

if j == 'B':

mi = c

break

for j in s[::-1]:

d += 1

if j == 'B':

ma = len(s) - d

break

return ma - mi + 2

So, it's trying to find the positions of the first 'B' and the last 'B'.

First loop:

Iterate through s from left to right, find the first 'B', set mi to its position (1-based).

Second loop:

Iterate through s from right to left, find the first 'B', set ma to its position (1-based).

Then, compute ma - mi + 2.

Wait, why +2?

Let's see with the first example:

s = "WBBWBW"

First 'B' at position 2, last 'B' at position 5.

So, ma = 5, mi = 2, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the correct answer is 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, in the code, it's returning ma - mi + 2, which in this case would be 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the correct answer is 4.

So, it seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, let's see.

In the first test case, ma = 5, mi = 2, ma - mi + 2 = 5, but the correct length is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's ma - mi + 1, but then 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct.

So, maybe it's a typo in the code.

Wait, but in the code, it's ma - mi + 2.

Which would be 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the correct answer is 4.

So, that seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the positions.

Wait, in the code, ma is calculated as len(s) - d, where d is the distance from the end.

Let's see:

s = "WBBWBW"

Reversed s: "WB BW B W" -> "WBWBW"

Wait, no, in Python, s[::-1] reverses the string, so "WBBWBW" reversed is "WBWB BBW".

Wait, no, "WBBWBW" reversed is "WBWBW".

Wait, no, "WBBWBW" reversed is "WBWBW".

Wait, no, "WBBWBW" reversed is "WBWBW".

Wait, but the original string has 6 characters: W B B W B W

Reversed: W B W B B W

So, len(s) = 6

In the second loop:

for j in s[::-1]:

d +=1

if j == 'B':

ma = len(s) - d

break

So, iterating from the end:

First j = s[5] = 'W'

d =1

j = 'W' != 'B'

Next j = s[4] = 'B'

d=2

j = 'B', so ma = 6 - 2 = 4

So, ma =4

mi =2

So, ma - mi +2 =4 -2 +2=4

Which matches the sample output of 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 -2 +2=5, but actually, ma is 4, mi is 2, so 4-2+2=4, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated ma.

In the first loop:

for j in s:

c +=1

if j == 'B':

mi =c

break

So, s[0] = 'W', c=1

s[1] = 'B', c=2, set mi=2

In the second loop:

for j in s[::-1]:

d +=1

if j == 'B':

ma = len(s) - d

break

s[::-1] = 'WBWBW'

d=1, j='W' != 'B'

d=2, j='B' == 'B', set ma =6 -2=4

So, ma=4, mi=2, ma - mi +2 =4-2+2=4, which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought ma should be position 5 for 'B' at position 5, but in this calculation, ma is position 4.

Wait, in the string "WBBWBW", positions are:

1: W

2: B

3: B

4: W

5: B

6: W

So, the last 'B' is at position 5, but according to the code, ma = len(s) - d =6 -2=4

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, d is the position from the end, so d=2 means it's the second character from the end, which is position 5 (since len(s)=6, position 6 is 'W', position 5 is 'B').

So, ma =6 -2=4, which is position 4, which is 'W', not 'B'.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in Python, s[::-1] reverses the string.

So, s = "W B B W B W"

s[::-1] = "W B W B B W"

So, iterating from the end:

First j = s[5] = 'W', d=1

j != 'B'

Next j = s[4] = 'B', d=2

j == 'B', set ma = len(s) - d =6 -2=4

So, ma=4, which corresponds to position 4 in the original string, which is 'W'.

But we need to set ma to the position of the last 'B', which is position 5.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Wait, if I set ma = len(s) - d, and d is the index from the end, then ma = len(s) - d -1, because Python uses 0-based indexing.

Wait, let's think carefully.

In Python, s[::-1] gives the reversed string.

So, s = "W B B W B W" (positions 1 to 6)

s[::-1] = "W B W B B W" (positions 6 to 1)

So, when d=1, j='W', which is position 6

d=2, j='B', which is position 5

So, when j='B' at d=2, ma = len(s) - d =6 -2=4, which corresponds to position 4 in the original string.

But the last 'B' is at position 5.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's off by one.

Wait, maybe ma should be len(s) - d.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, position 5 is len(s) - d, because d is the distance from the end.

Wait, position from the end:

d=1: position 6

d=2: position 5

So, ma = len(s) - d =6 -2=4, but in 1-based indexing, position 4 is 'W', not 'B'.

Wait, that's a mistake.

It should be ma = len(s) - d +1.

Because position from the end d=1 is position 6, len(s) -1 +1=6

d=2 is position 5, len(s) -2 +1=5

So, ma = len(s) - d +1

In the code, it's ma = len(s) - d

So, it's off by one.

In the first example, ma should be 5, mi should be 2, ma - mi +1=4, which matches the sample output.

But in the code, it's ma - mi +2=5-2+2=5, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, according to the code, ma = len(s) - d =6 -2=4

mi =2

Then, ma - mi +2=4-2+2=4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but according to my calculation, ma should be 5, but in the code, ma is 4.

Yet, ma - mi +2=4, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps it's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let's try another test case.

Take n=3, s='BBW'

First 'B' at position 1, last 'B' at position 2.

So, ma=2, mi=1, ma - mi +2=2-1+2=3, but the correct answer should be 2.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be ma - mi +1=2-1+1=2.

But the code has ma - mi +2=3, which is incorrect.

But in the first example, it gave the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

In the first example, ma=4, mi=2, ma - mi +2=4, which is correct, but only coincidentally.

In the third example, n=3, s='BBW'

ma = len(s) - d =3 -1=2 (since d=1 for last 'B' at position 2)

mi=1

ma - mi +2=2-1+2=3, but the correct answer is 2.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output for t=8, the seventh test case with n=6, s='WWBBWB', the output is 4.

According to the code:

First 'B' at position 3, last 'B' at position 6

ma=6, mi=3, ma - mi +2=5, but the sample output is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

The correct formula should be ma - mi +1.

So, the code should return ma - mi +1, not ma - mi +2.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that should be painted white to make the entire strip white. 

## Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - We have a strip of cells, each either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
    - We need to paint one continuous segment white, turning all 'B's in that segment to 'W's.
    - The goal is to find the smallest such segment that, when painted white, results in all cells being white.

2. **Key Insight**:
    - Identify the positions of the first and last 'B's in the strip.
    - The minimal segment to paint must cover from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

3. **Steps**:
    - Find the position of the first 'B' from the left.
    - Find the position of the last 'B' from the right.
    - Calculate the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

## Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the position of the first 'B'
    for c in range(m):
        if s[c] == 'B':
            mi = c + 1  # Convert to 1-based indexing
            break
    # Find the position of the last 'B'
    for d in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        if s[d] == 'B':
            ma = d + 1  # Convert to 1-based indexing
            break
    # Calculate the length of the segment to paint
    return ma - mi + 1

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    print(func_1())
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read `n` (length of the strip) and the string `s`.

- **Finding Positions**:
    - Locate the first occurrence of 'B' from the left (`mi`).
    - Locate the last occurrence of 'B' from the right (`ma`).

- **Calculating Segment Length**:
    - Compute the length of the segment from `mi` to `ma` inclusive, which is `ma - mi + 1`.

- **Output**:
    - Print the minimal segment length for each test case.

This approach ensures that all 'B's are covered in the minimal possible segment, making the entire strip white with a single painting action.
