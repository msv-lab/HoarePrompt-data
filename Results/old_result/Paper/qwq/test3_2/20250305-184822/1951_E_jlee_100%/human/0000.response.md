Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. If it's possible to do that, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba". So, my task is to split the string into substrings that aren't palindromes.

The problem mentions that each test case contains a string, and there are multiple test cases, with t being the number of test cases. The constraints are that t can be up to 10^4, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters, but the sum of all string lengths across test cases doesn't exceed 10^6. That means I need to be efficient in my solution to handle up to 10^4 test cases.

Let me think about how to approach this. For each string, I need to decide how to partition it so that no part is a palindrome. One way to ensure that a substring is not a palindrome is to make sure that it doesn't read the same forwards and backwards.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

sinktheyacht

lllllllll

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

NO

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

In the first test case, "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so I can take the entire string as one part, and it's not a palindrome. So, "YES" and then 1, followed by the string itself.

In the second test case, "lllllllll" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. Moreover, any substring of it is also a palindrome. So, there's no way to partition it into parts that are not palindromes. Hence, "NO".

In the third test case, "uwuowouwu" is not a palindrome, but it can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

From these examples, I can see that if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can just take it as one part. If it is a palindrome, I need to try splitting it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, in the second test case, since every substring is a palindrome, there's no way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, I need a way to check if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about the conditions under which a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

If the string is composed of repeated characters, like "aaaaa", then every possible substring is a palindrome. So, in such cases, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

In other cases, if there's at least one position where the characters differ, I might be able to split the string at that position to get non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Let me consider a string like "abc". It's not a palindrome, so I can take it as one part. Alternatively, I can split it into "a", "b", "c", but "a" is a palindrome, so that's invalid. So, in this case, taking the whole string as one part is sufficient.

Wait, no, "a" is a palindrome, but if I split "abc" into "a", "b", "c", each of them is a palindrome, which is invalid. So, in this case, since the whole string "abc" is not a palindrome, I can take it as one part.

Wait, no, "abc" is not a palindrome, so it's acceptable as one part.

But in the third example, "uwuowouwu" is not a palindrome, so I can take it as one part. But the output shows it being split into three parts: "uw", "uow", "ouwu". Each of these is not a palindrome.

So, it's possible to split it into multiple parts, but it's also possible to take it as one part. The problem allows any partition that satisfies the condition, so taking the whole string as one part would suffice in this case as well.

Wait, but in the third test case, why is it split into three parts? Maybe to demonstrate that it's possible, but indeed, taking the whole string as one part is sufficient.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output "YES" and print the string as one part.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, then try to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

- If it's impossible to split it into non-palindromic parts, output "NO".

So, I need a way to check if a string is a palindrome, and if it is, try to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, in the case where all substrings are palindromes, like in the second test case "lllllllll", it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, I need to identify such cases and output "NO".

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

First, for checking if a string is a palindrome, I can compare characters from the start and end moving towards the center.

To optimize, since the sum of string lengths across all test cases is up to 10^6, I need an O(N) solution, where N is the total length of all strings.

Now, let's think about the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read the string.

b. Check if the entire string is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES", 1, and the string itself.

- If it is a palindrome, proceed to try splitting it.

2. For splitting a palindromic string into non-palindromic substrings:

a. I need to find a way to split the string such that each part is not a palindrome.

b. One approach could be to split the string into two parts and check if both parts are not palindromes.

c. If splitting into two parts doesn't work, try splitting into more parts.

d. However, this could be inefficient for large strings.

Let me think of a smarter way.

Suppose the string is a palindrome. To split it into non-palindromic substrings, I need to ensure that each substring is not a palindrome.

One observation is that if I can find two consecutive characters that are different, I can split the string at that position to get two substrings, at least one of which is not a palindrome.

Wait, is that always true?

Let's consider a string like "aba". It's a palindrome. If I split it into "a" and "ba", "a" is a palindrome, but "ba" is not. So, in this case, splitting into "a" and "ba" doesn't satisfy the condition because one part is a palindrome.

Wait, but according to the problem, all parts must not be palindromes. So, in this case, splitting into "a" and "ba" is invalid because "a" is a palindrome.

So, that approach doesn't work.

Another idea: if the string is a palindrome, and it's of even length, splitting it into two equal halves, each half would be a palindrome only if the entire string is a palindrome, which it is. So, that won't help.

Wait, in the case of "abba", which is a palindrome, splitting it into "a", "b", "b", "a" would have all parts as single characters, which are palindromes. That's invalid.

Alternatively, splitting "abba" into "abb" and "a". "abb" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome. So, invalid.

Another split: "ab", "ba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome. So, this works.

Wait, but "ab" and "ba" are both not palindromes, so this works.

So, in this case, splitting into two parts works.

But in the case of "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a". "aa" is not a palindrome (wait, is "aa" a palindrome? Yes, it is, because it reads the same forwards and backwards.) So, "aa" is a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "a", "a", "a". All are palindromes. Invalid.

So, for "aaa", it's impossible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

Similarly, for "abba", splitting into "ab", "ba" works.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if their length is even, and the first half is not a palindrome, splitting into two equal parts would work.

Wait, but in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works, and both are not palindromes.

But in "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings of even length, if the first half is not a palindrome, splitting into two equal parts would work.

But in "abba", the first half is "ab", which is not a palindrome, and the second half is "ba", which is also not a palindrome.

In "aaaa", the first half is "aa", which is a palindrome, and the second half is "aa", which is also a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into two equal parts doesn't help.

Wait, but in "abba", both halves are not palindromes, so splitting works.

In "aaaa", both halves are palindromes, so splitting into two parts doesn't work.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if there exists a split where neither part is a palindrome, then it's possible.

But checking all possible splits is inefficient.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if there exists at least one position where splitting at that position results in at least one non-palindromic part, then it's possible.

Wait, but in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works because both are not palindromes.

In "aaaa", splitting into "aa" and "aa" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

But in "abba", both "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if there exists at least one split where both parts are not palindromes, then it's possible.

But how to find such a split efficiently?

Another idea: if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and it contains at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it might be possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But this seems vague.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if it has at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it might be possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But I need a concrete approach.

Let me think recursively. If the string is a palindrome, try splitting it into two parts and check if both parts are not palindromes.

If both parts are not palindromes, then it's okay.

If one or both parts are palindromes, then try further splitting those parts.

But this could be inefficient for large strings.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if it can be split into two non-palindromic substrings, then output "YES" with those two parts.

If not, try splitting into three parts, and so on.

But again, this seems inefficient.

Is there a way to minimize the number of parts?

The problem allows any partition as long as all parts are not palindromes, so I can aim for the fewest parts possible.

But to make it efficient, I need a linear time solution.

Let me consider that if the string is not a palindrome, I can take the whole string as one part.

If it is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

In the case where all substrings are palindromes, like in "aaaa", it's impossible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, I need to identify such cases and output "NO".

How can I identify if all substrings are palindromes?

Well, in "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

In "abba", substrings like "a", "b", "b", "a", "ab", "bb", "ba", "abba" include "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

So, in "abba", it's possible to split it into "ab" and "ba".

In "aabbaa", which is a palindrome, splitting into "aab" and "baa". "aab" is not a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into two parts works.

In "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

Splitting into "a", "a", "a" also doesn't work.

So, it's impossible.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if they contain at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome, it contains substrings like "ab" and "ba" which are not palindromes.

And I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

In "aaa", all substrings are palindromes, so it's impossible.

Similarly, in "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

In "abab", which is a palindrome, substrings like "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

So, splitting into "ab" and "ab" would be invalid because "ab" is not a palindrome, but "ab" is the same as "ab", which is not a problem here.

Wait, "ab" is not a palindrome, and "ab" is not a palindrome.

So, splitting "abab" into "ab" and "ab" would work.

Wait, but "abab" is a palindrome, and "ab" is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if they contain at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But how do I check if all substrings are palindromes?

In a string where all characters are the same, like "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

In a string like "abba", there are substrings that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if all characters in the string are the same, then all substrings are palindromes, and it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's possible.

Wait, but in "abba", all characters are not the same, and it contains substrings that are not palindromes.

In "aaa", all characters are the same, and all substrings are palindromes.

In "aabbaa", all characters are not the same, and it contains substrings that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if all characters in the string are identical, then it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's possible.

But is that always true?

Let's consider "abc". It's not a palindrome, so I can take it as one part.

But according to this idea, since not all characters are identical, it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But in this case, taking the whole string as one part works, and it's not a palindrome.

So, perhaps, the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are identical, output "NO".

- Else, split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

But, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works.

In "abab", splitting into "ab" and "ab" works.

In "abc", it's not a palindrome, so take it as one part.

In "aaa", all characters are the same, so output "NO".

In "aaaa", same as above.

So, this seems to be a viable approach.

Let me formalize it:

- For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If s is not a palindrome:

- Output "YES", 1, and the string s.

- Else (s is a palindrome):

- Check if all characters in s are the same.

- If they are, output "NO".

- Else:

- Try to split s into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- Since s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where splitting results in non-palindromic parts.

- Specifically, splitting at any position where s[i] != s[j], where i and j are symmetric positions, should help.

- But to make it simple, perhaps splitting into two parts of roughly equal length would work.

- For example, in "abba", splitting into "abb" and "a". "abb" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome. So, that doesn't work.

- Wait, in this case, splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

- So, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome.

- To ensure that both parts are not palindromes, I need to choose the split position carefully.

- In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works because both are not palindromes.

- In "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works because neither is a palindrome.

- In "abab", splitting into "ab" and "ab" works.

- So, perhaps splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome is possible.

- But how to ensure that both parts are not palindromes?

- One way is to choose a split position such that one part has a substring that is not a palindrome.

- Since s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where s[i] != s[j], and I can use that to split the string.

- Wait, in "abba", s[0] != s[3], but since it's a palindrome, s[0] == s[3], which is not the case here.

Wait, no, in "abba", s[0] = 'a' and s[3] = 'a', so s[0] == s[3].

Wait, but s[1] = 'b' and s[2] = 'b', so s[1] == s[2].

Wait, in "abba", it is a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abba", positions 0 and 3 are 'a', positions 1 and 2 are 'b'.

So, s[0] == s[3], s[1] == s[2].

Wait, but "abba" is a palindrome.

So, in "abba", all corresponding positions are equal.

Wait, but in "abcd", which is not a palindrome, s[0] != s[3], s[1] != s[2].

But in palindromic strings, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, in palindromic strings, all corresponding positions are equal.

So, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where s[i] != s[j], but since it's a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i].

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, in "abba", s[0] == s[3], s[1] == s[2].

So, all corresponding positions are equal.

Wait, but in "aabbaa", s[0] == s[5], s[1] == s[4], s[2] == s[3].

So, all corresponding positions are equal.

But in "abab", s[0] == s[3], s[1] == s[2].

Again, all corresponding positions are equal.

Wait, so in palindromic strings, by definition, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, if the string is a palindrome, all corresponding positions are equal.

If all characters are the same, then all substrings are palindromes.

If not all characters are the same, but it's a palindrome, then I need to find a way to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

Given that, perhaps splitting into two parts where each part has a length of at least 2 and is not a palindrome would work.

But I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works.

In "abab", splitting into "ab" and "ab" works.

In "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

In "aaaa", splitting into "aaa" and "a" doesn't work.

So, in cases where all characters are the same, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome should work.

But how to ensure that each part is not a palindrome?

Let me consider that for a palindromic string that is not entirely composed of the same character, there exists at least one split position where both parts are not palindromes.

I need to find such a split position.

One way is to iterate through possible split positions and check if both parts are not palindromes.

But this could be time-consuming for large strings.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, splitting it into two parts of lengths l and n-l, where l is from 1 to n-1.

I need to check if neither of these parts is a palindrome.

Given that the string is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one l where neither part is a palindrome.

But how to find such an l efficiently?

Let me consider that for palindromic strings, splitting into two parts where one part is not a palindrome and the other is not a palindrome.

Wait, but I need to ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works because neither is a palindrome.

In "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa" works because neither is a palindrome.

In "abab", splitting into "ab" and "ab" works.

In "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, splitting into two parts where each part has at least two characters would work.

Wait, in "abba", "ab" and "ba" both have length 2 and are not palindromes.

In "aabbaa", "aab" and "baa" both have length 3 and are not palindromes.

In "abab", "ab" and "ab" both have length 2 and are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings that are not all the same character, splitting into two parts where each part has length at least 2 works.

But, is this always true?

Let's consider "abcba". It's a palindrome, and not all characters are the same.

Splitting into "abc" and "ba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "abcdcba". Splitting into "abcd" and "cba". "abcd" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, it seems that splitting into two parts where each part has length at least 2 works.

But, what if the string is "aaabaaa". It's a palindrome, not all characters are the same.

Splitting into "aaab" and "aaa". "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, in this case, splitting into "aaaba" and "aa" would have "aaaba" which is not a palindrome and "aa" which is a palindrome. So, still invalid.

So, in some cases, splitting into two parts doesn't work because one part is a palindrome.

Is there a general way to split palindromic strings into non-palindromic substrings?

Let me consider that for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, there exists at least one split position where both parts are not palindromes.

I need to find such a position.

But to make it efficient, I need a way to find such a position without checking all possible splits.

Let me consider that for palindromic strings, if I split at position l, where 1 <= l <= n-1, then both parts must not be palindromes.

Given that the whole string is a palindrome, but not all characters are the same, there must be at least one l where neither part is a palindrome.

But how to find such an l efficiently?

One idea is to split the string into two parts where one part is not a palindrome.

Given that the whole string is a palindrome, but not all characters are the same, there must be at least one part that is not a palindrome.

Wait, but I need both parts to be not palindromes.

Wait, in "aaabaaa", splitting into "aaab" and "aaa", "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome.

So, that doesn't work.

Another split: "aaa" and "baaa". "aaa" is a palindrome, "baaa" is not a palindrome.

Still invalid because "aaa" is a palindrome.

Another split: "aaaba" and "aa". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

Another split: "a" and "aabaaa". "a" is a palindrome, "aabaaa" is not a palindrome.

Still invalid.

So, in this case, splitting into two parts doesn't work because one part is always a palindrome.

Wait, but according to my earlier idea, if I split into two parts where both are not palindromes, but in this case, it's not possible.

So, perhaps, for some palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, it's still impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the problem's note, in the second test case "lllllllll", which is all the same characters, it's "NO", and in the third test case "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's "YES".

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings with different characters, it's always possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", which is a palindrome with different characters, splitting into two parts doesn't work because one part is always a palindrome.

Wait, maybe I need to split into more than two parts.

In "aaabaaa", I can split it into "aaa", "aab", "aaa". "aaa" is a palindrome, so invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aab", "aaa". "aa" is a palindrome.

Another split: "a", "aab", "aaa". "a" is a palindrome.

Another split: "aaab", "aaa". As before, "aaa" is a palindrome.

Another split: "aaaba", "aa". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aa". "aa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "a", "a", "b", "a", "a", "a". All are palindromes.

Invalid.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to split "aaabaaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to my earlier idea, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, it should be possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But in this example, it's not working.

So, perhaps my idea is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, if the length is greater than 1, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", which has length 7, it's a palindrome, not all characters are the same, but splitting into non-palindromic substrings seems impossible.

So, perhaps there are exceptions.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to split into more than two parts.

In "aaabaaa", I can split it into "aaa", "a", "b", "aaa". But all of these are palindromes.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aa". "aa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "a", "aab", "aaa". "a" and "aaa" are palindromes.

Invalid.

Another split: "aaab", "aaa". "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

So, in this case, it seems impossible.

But according to the problem's note, in the third test case "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps there's a way to split "aaabaaa" into non-palindromic substrings that I'm missing.

Let me try splitting "aaabaaa" into "aaaba" and "aa". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "aaa" and "baaa". "aaa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Wait, what if I split it into "aaab" and "aaa". "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "a" and "aabaaa". "a" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "aa" and "abaaa". "aa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "aaa" and "baa". "aaa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "aaaba" and "a". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Another split: "aa" and "a" and "baa". "aa" and "a" are palindromes. Invalid.

Another split: "a" and "a" and "b" and "aaa". All are palindromes. Invalid.

So, it seems impossible to split "aaabaaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the problem's note, in the third test case "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's possible to split it into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", which are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings with different characters, it's always possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", all possible splits include at least one palindrome.

So, maybe my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps, for palindromic strings with different characters, it's possible to split them into three or more parts that are not palindromes.

In "uwuowouwu", splitting into "uw", "uow", "ouwu" works.

So, perhaps, in cases where splitting into two parts doesn't work, splitting into three or more parts might work.

In "aaabaaa", maybe splitting into three parts works.

Wait, earlier attempts showed that splitting into three parts still includes palindromic parts.

So, perhaps, for some palindromic strings with certain structures, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings, even if not all characters are the same.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- If such a split is possible, output "YES" with those two parts.

- Else, try splitting into three or more parts.

- However, this might be too time-consuming for large strings.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Perhaps, for palindromic strings that are not all the same character, I can always split them into three parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But I need to verify this.

Let's take "aaabaaa". It's a palindrome, not all characters are the same.

Split into "aaa", "aab", "aaa". "aaa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aa". "aa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "a", "aab", "aaa". "a" and "aaa" are palindromes.

Invalid.

Another split: "aaa", "ba", "aa". "aaa" and "aa" are palindromes.

Invalid.

Another split: "aaaba", "a". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "aa", "ab", "aaa". "aa" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "a", "a", "b", "aaa". All are palindromes.

Invalid.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to split "aaabaaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the problem's note, in the third test case "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, there's a difference in the structure of "aaabaaa" and "uwuowouwu" that allows one to be split and the other not.

Let me look at "uwuowouwu".

Possible splits:

- "uw" and "uowouwu". "uw" is not a palindrome, "uowouwu" is not a palindrome.

So, splitting into two parts works.

Alternatively, splitting into "uw", "uow", "ouwu". All are not palindromes.

So, in this case, splitting into two or three parts works.

But in "aaabaaa", no such split seems possible.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings with different characters, splitting into two parts where neither part is a palindrome is possible.

But in "aaabaaa", it's not possible.

So, perhaps, my initial approach needs adjustment.

Let me consider that for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, if the length is greater than 2, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", which has length 7, it's not working.

Wait, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, and its length is greater than 2, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", which has length 7, it's not working.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the frequency of characters.

In "aaabaaa", the characters are mostly 'a's with one 'b'.

In "uwuowouwu", the characters are more mixed.

Perhaps, in strings where a single character is different, it's harder to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Alternatively, perhaps, for palindromic strings with a single character different, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "abba", which has two different characters, splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

Wait, in "abba", there are two 'b's and two 'a's.

In "aaabaaa", there are multiple 'a's and one 'b'.

So, perhaps, the frequency of characters affects the possibility of splitting.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[j], where i and j are symmetric positions, then it's possible to split the string into non-palindromic substrings.

But since the string is a palindrome, s[i] == s[j] for all i and j.

Wait, that's the definition of a palindrome.

So, in palindromic strings, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, if the string is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

Therefore, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, there must be at least two different characters, but still, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

Wait, no, in "abba", s[0] == s[3], s[1] == s[2], but the characters 'a' and 'b' are different.

So, in palindromic strings, pairs of characters from the ends are equal, but the characters themselves can be different.

I need to find a way to split such strings into non-palindromic substrings.

Perhaps, splitting the string into two halves doesn't always work, as seen in "aaabaaa".

So, maybe I need to find a split where at least one part is not a palindrome.

Wait, but I need both parts to be not palindromes.

Wait, no, I need all parts to be not palindromes.

So, in "aaabaaa", splitting into "aaaba" and "aa", where "aaaba" is not a palindrome and "aa" is a palindrome, is invalid because "aa" is a palindrome.

Similarly, splitting into "aaa" and "baaa", where "aaa" is a palindrome, is invalid.

So, perhaps, in such cases, it's impossible to split the string into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the problem's note, in the third test case "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, there's a difference in the structure of "uwuowouwu" and "aaabaaa".

Let me look at "uwuowouwu".

Possible splits:

- "uw" and "uowouwu". "uw" is not a palindrome, "uowouwu" is not a palindrome.

So, splitting into two parts works.

Alternatively, splitting into "u", "w", "u", "w", "o", "u", "w", "u", "w", "u", but that would include single characters, which are palindromes.

But in the example, it's split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", all of which are not palindromes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But in "aaabaaa", no such split seems possible.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings with certain structures, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Therefore, perhaps, the correct approach is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- If such a split is possible, output "YES" with those two parts.

- Else, try splitting into three or more parts.

- If no such split is possible, output "NO".

But to make it efficient, I need a way to determine if such a split exists without trying all possible splits.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can assume that for palindromic strings with different characters, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome is always possible, and proceed accordingly.

But in "aaabaaa", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's not possible to split into two parts where both are not palindromes.

However, perhaps splitting into three parts can work in such cases.

But to keep it simple and efficient, perhaps I can implement the following approach:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, split the string into two parts where one part has at least two characters.

- Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output "YES" with those two parts.

- Else, output "NO".

But in "aaabaaa", splitting into "aaaba" and "aa" would have "aaaba" not a palindrome and "aa" a palindrome, which is invalid.

So, in this case, it would output "NO", which might be incorrect because perhaps splitting into three parts could work, but to keep it efficient, I can settle for splitting into two parts.

Given that, I can implement this approach.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

I need a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

Given that the sum of string lengths across all test cases is up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to check for palindromes.

A straightforward way is to reverse the string and check if it's equal to the original string.

But reversing a string takes O(N) time
