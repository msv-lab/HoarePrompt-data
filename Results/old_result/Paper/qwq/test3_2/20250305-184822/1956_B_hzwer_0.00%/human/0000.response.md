Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. Me and Nene each get n cards initially. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each turn, the player picks a card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place the chosen card on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine secondarily.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. So, there are 2n turns in total, with me and Nene each taking n turns alternately, starting with me. The key point is that Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Given that, I need to find out the best possible score I can achieve against her optimal play.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

In the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. Since there are 8 cards in total, and each number appears twice, Nene must have the other 1,2,3, and 4,4.

The explanation says that in one possible sequence of plays, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1 (and get a point because 1 is already on the table), Nene plays 4 and gets a point, then I play 2, Nene plays 2 and gets a point, then I play 3, Nene plays 3 and gets a point. So, I end up with 1 point.

It also says that it's impossible for me to get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, my goal is to maximize my points, considering that Nene is also playing optimally to maximize hers and minimize mine.

I need to think about how to model this game to find the optimal strategy.

First, I need to know how many duplicates of each number I have in my hand and how many are in Nene's hand.

Given that each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, if I have k cards with number x, then Nene has (2 - k) cards with number x.

So, for each number from 1 to n, I can determine how many of them I have and how many Nene has.

For example, in the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So,

Number 1: I have 2, Nene has 0

Number 2: I have 1, Nene has 1

Number 3: I have 1, Nene has 1

Number 4: I have 0, Nene has 2

Okay, now I need to think about the sequence of plays.

Since turns are public, both players can see the table at any time and make decisions based on that.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, in that order.

I need to find a way to model this game to compute the maximum points I can get.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where Nene is trying to minimize my score while maximizing hers.

Maybe I can model this as a minimax problem, where I try to maximize my score, considering that Nene will play to minimize it.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) or O(n log n).

Looking at the provided program, it seems to use dynamic programming with a 2D DP table of size (n+1) x (n+1).

The function func_1 reads n and the list of cards, then initializes a DP table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros.

Then, it sets dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] to 0, and iterates from i = n-3 down to 0, and for each i, iterates j from n-1 down to 0.

Inside the loop, it checks how many times j+1 appears in my cards:

- If it appears 0 times, dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j]

- If it appears once, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i+2][j-1] + 1)

- If it appears twice, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i+2][j-1] + 1, dp[i+1][j+1])

Finally, it returns dp[0][0]

Wait, this seems off. First, it's using count on the cards list inside the loop, which could be inefficient for large n.

Also, I need to understand what dp[i][j] represents.

I think I need to understand the DP approach here.

Let's try to think differently.

I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps I can think in terms of pairs of cards.

Since each number appears exactly twice, and we have to place one card at a time, the timing of placing cards can affect who gets points.

I need to think about when to play the second card of a pair.

If I play the second card of a pair, I get a point only if Nene hasn't played the first one yet.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of graph theory or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have completely in my hand or split between me and Nene.

Let's categorize the numbers based on how many cards I have:

- If I have both cards of a number, then I can play them together or separately.

- If I have one card of a number, and Nene has the other.

- If I have no cards of a number, Nene has both.

I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of "conflicts" or overlaps between our cards.

Wait, maybe I should look at the frequency of each number in my hand.

Let's consider that:

- For each number, I can have 0, 1, or 2 cards.

Given that, I can count how many numbers I have 0, 1, or 2 cards of.

Wait, but I need to consider the interaction between the numbers.

Maybe I should think in terms of the number of pairs I can form.

Wait, but since each number appears exactly twice, a pair is just a number's two cards.

But in my hand, for each number, I can have 0,1, or 2 cards.

So, for numbers where I have 2 cards, I can choose when to play them.

For numbers where I have 1 card, Nene has the other, so the timing of playing my card affects whether I get a point or not.

Similarly, for numbers where I have 0 cards, Nene has both, so she can play them accordingly.

I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems complex. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula based on the counts.

Let me try with small n.

Take n=1:

My cards: 1,1

Nene's cards: none

Sequence: I play 1, then Nene has no cards, so I get 0 points.

Wait, but according to the sample input, when n=1 and my cards are 1, output is 0.

Wait, but in this case, Nene has no cards, so she can't play anything.

Wait, but the problem says that the deck has 2n cards, and each number appears exactly twice.

So, for n=1, there are two cards, both are 1.

If I have both, then Nene has none.

Then, I play one 1, then Nene has no cards, so I can't play again.

Wait, but n=1, I have n=1 cards, but in this case, I should have one card, but according to the problem, I have n cards.

Wait, in the last test case, n=1, my cards are 1, so Nene also has 1.

So, sequence: I play 1, Nene plays 1 and gets a point.

I get 0 points.

Similarly, in n=3, my cards are 1,2,3, Nene has 1,2,3.

Possible sequence: I play 1, Nene plays 1 and gets a point, I play 2, Nene plays 2 and gets a point, I play 3, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

I get 0 points.

Another possible sequence: I play 2, Nene plays 1, I play 3, Nene plays 2, I play 1, Nene plays 3.

In this case, I get points only if there's already a card on the table.

Wait, in this sequence:

- I play 2 (table: 2)

- Nene plays 1 (table: 2,1)

- I play 3 (table: 2,1,3)

- Nene plays 2 (gets 1 point, table: 2,1,3,2)

- I play 1 (gets 1 point, table: 2,1,3,2,1)

- Nene plays 3 (gets 1 point, table: 2,1,3,2,1,3)

So, I get 1 point in this sequence.

But according to the sample output, it's 0.

So, perhaps there's a better sequence for Nene to prevent me from getting any points.

Wait, maybe Nene can play in a way that minimizes my points.

In the second sequence, I got 1 point, but perhaps there's a way for Nene to prevent that.

If Nene plays optimally to minimize my points, she might choose to play a card that blocks my potential points.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the numbers based on how many cards I have:

- Let's say I have k numbers with 2 cards each.

- Then, I have (n - k) numbers with 1 card each.

Since each number appears exactly twice, Nene will have:

- For the k numbers where I have both cards, she has 0 cards for those numbers.

- For the (n - k) numbers where I have 1 card, she has 1 card for each of those numbers.

Wait, no. If I have 1 card for a number, Nene has the other card for that number.

So, actually:

- I have k numbers with 2 cards each.

- I have m numbers with 1 card each.

- Then, Nene has the remaining numbers.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total numbers: n

For each number from 1 to n, I can have 0, 1, or 2 cards.

Let:

- Let A be the set of numbers where I have 2 cards.

- Let B be the set of numbers where I have 1 card.

- Then, Nene has:

- For numbers in A, she has 0 cards.

- For numbers in B, she has 1 card each.

- For numbers not in A or B, she has 2 cards each.

Wait, but all numbers are from 1 to n, and each number appears exactly twice.

So, for each number:

- If I have 2 cards, Nene has 0.

- If I have 1 card, Nene has 1.

- If I have 0 cards, Nene has 2.

So, let:

- Let A be the set of numbers where I have 2 cards.

- Let B be the set of numbers where I have 1 card.

- Let C be the set of numbers where I have 0 cards.

Then, |A| + |B| + |C| = n

Also, since each number appears exactly twice, the total number of cards is 2n.

I have n cards: 2*A + 1*B = n

Nene has n cards: 0*A + 1*B + 2*C = n

From 2*A + B = n

And B + 2*C = n

We can solve for B and C in terms of A.

From 2*A + B = n => B = n - 2*A

From B + 2*C = n => (n - 2*A) + 2*C = n => 2*C = 2*A => C = A

So, |C| = |A|

So, the number of numbers where I have 0 cards is equal to the number of numbers where I have 2 cards.

That's an interesting relation.

Now, I need to think about how to play my cards to maximize my points.

I need to consider the sequence in which we play the cards.

Since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to anticipate her moves.

This seems like a complex game to model directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of pairs I can form and how to play them.

Let me consider that:

- For numbers in A (I have 2 cards), I can play them together or separately.

- For numbers in B (I have 1 card), I need to play it at some point.

- Nene will play her cards accordingly to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my points against Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar, but that might be too time-consuming for large n.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to use dynamic programming with states based on i and j, but I'm not sure what i and j represent.

In the code:

dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

Then, it initializes dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] to 0, and iterates from i = n-3 down to 0, and for each i, iterates j from n-1 down to 0.

Inside the loop, it checks cards.count(j + 1):

- If 0, dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j]

- If 1, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i+2][j-1] + 1)

- If 2, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i+2][j-1] + 1, dp[i+1][j+1])

Finally, it returns dp[0][0]

This seems inefficient because cards.count(j+1) is O(n) inside nested loops, making the total time complexity O(n^3), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

Therefore, this program is incorrect due to inefficiency.

But perhaps there's a better way to implement the DP.

Wait, maybe the DP is trying to track something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to compute the maximum points I can get based on the counts of A, B, and C.

Let me think about that.

Suppose I have k numbers with 2 cards each (A), m numbers with 1 card each (B), and k numbers with 0 cards each (C), since |C| = |A|.

From earlier, we have:

B = n - 2*A

C = A

So, n = A + B + C = A + (n - 2*A) + A = n

Which checks out.

Now, I need to think about how to play these cards.

Let me consider that:

- For each number in A, I can play both cards at times of my choosing.

- For each number in B, I have one card, and Nene has one card.

- For each number in C, I have no cards, and Nene has two cards.

I need to maximize the number of times I play a card that already exists on the table.

Given that, perhaps I can try to play cards in a way that creates opportunities for myself to play duplicate cards when possible.

But Nene is trying to counter that by playing in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of "pairs" I can form and how to play them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can play a second card of a number that's already on the table.

For numbers in A, I have both cards, so I can play the first one at any time and the second one when the first is already on the table to get a point.

For numbers in B, I have one card, and Nene has the other.

So, if I play my card when Nene has already played her card, I get a point.

But Nene can choose when to play her card to minimize my points.

Similarly, for numbers in C, Nene has both cards and can play them accordingly.

This seems like I need to maximize the number of times I can play a second card of a number that's already on the table, considering Nene's optimal play.

Perhaps I can calculate the maximum matching or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I can use greedy approach.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, A = {1}, B = {2,3}, C = {4}

I have two 1's, one 2, one 3, Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

Total points: me 1, Nene 3

Another sequence:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 3

4. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

5. I play 1

6. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

7. I play 1 and get 1 point

8. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

Total points: me 1, Nene 3

Another sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 2

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 4

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

Total points: me 1, Nene 2

So, in different sequences, my points can be 1, and Nene's points vary.

But according to the sample explanation, the maximum I can get is 1 point.

So, perhaps the maximum I can get is equal to the number of numbers in A, which is 1 in this case.

Wait, but in the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, A = {4} (since I have two 4's), B = {1,2,3,5,6,7}, C = {8}

Nene has {1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8}

According to the sample output, I can get 1 point.

Is this because |A| = 1?

Wait, but in the first test case, |A| = 1, and I get 1 point.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, A = {5,8}, B={1,2,4,7}, C={3,6}

Wait, no, wait, let's see:

My cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, A = {5,8} (have two of each), B={1,2,4,7} (have one of each), C={3,6} (have zero of each)

Nene has B's other cards and C's two cards.

According to the sample, output is 2.

So, in this case, |A| = 2, output is 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, |A| =1, output is 1.

In the third test case, |A|=1, output is1.

In the fourth test case, |A|=1, output is0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

So, A={}, B={1,2,3}, C={}

Nene has A={}, B={1,2,3}, C={}

Output is0.

In the fifth test case:

n=1

My cards:1

A={}, B={1}, C={}

Nene has A={}, B={1}, C={}

Output is0.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to |A|, but in the fourth test case, |A|=0, output is0.

Wait, but in the first test case, |A|=1, output is1.

In the second test case, |A|=2, output is2.

In the third test case, |A|=1, output is1.

In the fourth test case, |A|=0, output is0.

In the fifth test case, |A|=0, output is0.

So, maybe the maximum points I can get is equal to |A|.

But in the first test case, |A|=1, output is1.

In the third test case, |A|=1, output is1.

In the fourth test case, |A|=0, output is0.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the second test case, |A|=2, output is2.

But is this always the case?

Wait, but in the first test case, |A|=1, and I can get 1 point.

But in the fourth test case, |A|=0, and I get 0 points.

Seems like it's equal to |A|.

But why?

Because for each number in A, I have two cards, so I can play the first one at any time and the second one when the first is already on the table, getting a point.

And for numbers in B, since I have only one card, I can't get a point unless Nene has already played her card.

But Nene is playing optimally to minimize my points, so she will play her card before I play mine to prevent me from getting a point.

Therefore, I can only get points from the numbers in A.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to |A|, which is the number of numbers I have two cards of.

This seems to match the sample outputs.

So, in the first test case, |A|=1, output=1.

Second test case, |A|=2, output=2.

Third test case, |A|=1, output=1.

Fourth test case, |A|=0, output=0.

Fifth test case, |A|=0, output=0.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, the solution is simply to count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand, which is |A|.

So, the program should just count how many unique numbers appear exactly twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the first test case, my hand is 1,1,2,3, so number 1 appears twice, numbers 2 and 3 appear once, so |A|=1.

In the second test case, my hand is 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, so numbers 5 and 8 appear twice, numbers 1,2,4,7 appear once, so |A|=2.

In the third test case, my hand is 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, so numbers 4 appear twice, others appear once, so |A|=1.

In the fourth test case, my hand is 1,2,3, so no numbers appear twice, |A|=0.

In the fifth test case, my hand is 1, so no numbers appear twice, |A|=0.

So, yes, this matches the sample outputs.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Hence, the program should just count, for each test case, the number of unique numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

This can be done by counting the frequency of each number in my hand and counting how many numbers have a frequency of exactly 2.

This is a much simpler solution than the provided program, which seems overly complicated and inefficient.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
