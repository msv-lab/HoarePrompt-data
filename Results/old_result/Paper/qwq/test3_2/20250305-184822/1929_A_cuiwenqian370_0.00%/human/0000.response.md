Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add up all those differences.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example output.

Wait a minute, though. If I just sort the array in ascending order, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized. But in this case, it seems like sorting ascending gives the maximum beauty. Is that always true?

Let me try another arrangement. Suppose I arrange it as [3, 1, 2]. Then beauty would be (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1. That's less than 2. What if I arrange it as [3, 2, 1]? Beauty is (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + (-1) = -2. Even worse.

Okay, so arranging in ascending order seems to give the highest beauty value in this case. But the problem says that Sasha can rearrange the array in any way. So, maybe there's a better way than just sorting it ascendingly.

Let me think about how the sum works. The sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is actually equal to a_n - a_1. Because it's a telescoping sum: when you expand it, all intermediate terms cancel out.

Wait, let's see:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the rearranged array.

So, to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize (an - a1). That means I want an to be as large as possible and a1 to be as small as possible.

Given that, the best way is to sort the array in ascending order, then set a1 to the smallest element and an to the largest element. So, the maximum beauty is (max(arr) - min(arr)).

Wait, but in the first example, that would be 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the example output. In the second example, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0, which also matches.

In the third example, arr = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. Max is 100, min is 43, so 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the output.

Fourth example, arr = [3, 4, 3, 3]. Max is 4, min is 3, so 4 - 3 = 1, matches the output.

Fifth example, [2, 1], max is 2, min is 1, so 2 - 1 = 1, matches the output.

So, it seems like the maximum beauty is always max(arr) - min(arr), and to achieve this, just sort the array in ascending order and arrange it accordingly.

But looking back at the code provided, it does something different. It sorts the array, then creates a new array by taking elements from both ends alternately. For example, for sorted array [1,2,3], it would create [3,1,2], which in the first test case gives a beauty of -1, which is less than the maximum possible.

Wait, that's not right. In the code, it appends arr[right] and arr[left] in each iteration, with left starting at 0 and right at n-1, incrementing left and decrementing right each time.

So, for [1,2,3], left starts at 0 (arr[left]=1), right at 2 (arr[right]=3). It appends 3 and 1, then left=1, right=1, appends arr[1]=2. So the new array is [3,1,2], which, as I calculated before, gives a beauty of -1, which is less than the maximum possible.

So, why is the code doing this? It seems like it's trying to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements, but that doesn't lead to the maximum beauty.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. But in the problem statement, it's (a_i - a_{i-1}), without absolute values. So, it's not the sum of absolute differences.

But in the code, it's using abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i-1]), which is sum of absolute differences.

Wait, is that a mistake? Let me check the problem statement again.

"the beauty of the array a is the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n"

So, it's sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), without absolute values.

But in the code, it's using abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i-1]). That seems incorrect based on the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the person who wrote the code misread the problem and thought it was sum of absolute differences.

Let me verify with the first test case. If arr = [1,2,3], sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

But if arr = [3,1,2], sum of (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1, which is less than 2.

So, the code's approach of alternating between largest and smallest doesn't maximize the sum as defined in the problem.

Moreover, as I realized earlier, the sum (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) simplifies to an - a1.

Therefore, to maximize an - a1, I should set a1 to the smallest value and an to the largest value.

Hence, sorting the array in ascending order and arranging it in that order would give the maximum beauty as max(arr) - min(arr).

But in the code, it's using abs differences, which is not required according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it's calculating the sum of absolute differences instead of just the sum of differences.

Moreover, the arrangement it's using (alternating between largest and smallest) doesn't lead to the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
