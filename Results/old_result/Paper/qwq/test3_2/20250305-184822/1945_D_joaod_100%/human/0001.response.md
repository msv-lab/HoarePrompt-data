Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values associated with them: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with someone at position j (where j < i), he has to pay a_j to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum cost Kirill has to pay to get into one of the first m positions.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that's ahead of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that I can compute the minimal cost. It seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the minimal cost to reach each position.

Let me think about the positions. Positions are from 1 to n+1, since Kirill is at position n+1 initially. But in the input, it's given that people are numbered from 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

Wait, no, according to the problem, "person number i=1", and Kirill stands after the n-th person. So, Kirill is at position n+1.

But in the code, it's written:

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

So, it's adjusting n and m to be 0-indexed.

I need to make sure I understand the indexing.

Let's assume the positions are 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position n.

He wants to be in one of the first m positions, which are positions 0 to m-1.

He can perform swaps with anyone in front of him, i.e., positions < current position.

Each swap with position j < i costs a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

I need to find the minimal cost to get to any position <= m-1.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from each position i to positions j < i with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

And Kirill starts at position n and wants to reach any position <= m-1.

To compute the minimal cost, I can use Dijkstra's algorithm, but given the constraints (n up to 2e5), that might not be efficient enough.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking at the code provided:

It iterates from na_frente down to 0, and keeps track of a total cost, and keeps track of the best cost to reach positions <= pos_final.

It seems like it's trying to simulate the process of moving Kirill forward by potentially swapping with people in front.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, let's understand what na_frente and pos_final represent.

na_frente is n-1, since Kirill is at position n, and there are n people in front of him.

Wait, no, according to the code, na_frente = n - 1, but in the code, it's na_frente -= 1, so na_frente becomes n-2.

Wait, let's see:

input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Then na_frente = n -1 = 3

pos_final = m -1 =1

Then it loops from na_frente down to 0:

v in 3,2,1,0

For each v, if v <= pos_final, it checks if best > total + a[v], then best = total + a[v]

Then, if a[v] < b[v], total += a[v], else total += b[v]

Wait, but in the example, n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5]

So, positions are 0,1,2,3 (Kirill starts at 4)

He wants to be in positions 0 or 1.

So, starting from position 3 (na_frente=3), which is the person just in front of Kirill.

First iteration, v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=1, so if a[3]=9 < b[3]=5, which is not, so total += b[3]=5

total=5

Second iteration, v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1, so if a[2]=6 < b[2]=8, which is true, so total += a[2]=6

total=11

Third iteration, v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1, so check if best > total + a[1]=11 + 3=14, and since best is initially maxfloat, set best=14

Then, since a[1]=3 < b[1]=3, which is not true (3 == 3), so total += b[1]=3

total=14

Fourth iteration, v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1, so check if best > total + a[0]=14 +7=21, which is not better than current best=14, so no update

Then, since a[0]=7 < b[0]=4, which is not true, so total += b[0]=4

total=18

But according to the example, the output should be 14, which matches the best found when v=1.

So, in this case, it seems correct.

Let's see another example:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

So, n=6, m=2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

na_frente=5

pos_final=1

Loop from v=5 down to 0:

v=5:

v=5 >1, a[5]=3 < b[5]=1? 3 >1, so total += b[5]=1

total=1

v=4:

v=4 >1, a[4]=8 < b[4]=4? 8 >4, so total +=4

total=5

v=3:

v=3 >1, a[3]=1 < b[3]=1? 1 <=1, so total +=a[3]=1

total=6

v=2:

v=2 >1, a[2]=7 < b[2]=8? 7<8, so total +=7

total=13

v=1:

v=1 <=1, check if best > total + a[1]=13+9=22, set best=22

Then, a[1]=9 < b[1]=8? 9>8, so total += b[1]=8

total=21

v=0:

v=0 <=1, check if best > total + a[0]=21+6=27, which is worse than 22, so no change

Then, a[0]=6 < b[0]=5? 6>5, so total +=5

total=26

But according to the example, the output should be 22, which matches the best found when v=1.

So, in this case, it also seems correct.

Another example:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

n=7, m=7

pos_final=6

na_frente=6

Loop from v=6 down to 0:

v=6:

v=6 >6, no, v=6 <=6, check if best > total + a[6], set best= total + a[6]

Then, if a[6]=9 < b[6]=9? 9==9, so total += b[6]=9

total=9

v=5:

v=5 <=6, check if best > total + a[5]=9+5=14, which is worse than current best=9, no change

Then, a[5]=5 < b[5]=1? 5>1, so total +=1

total=10

v=4:

v=4 <=6, check if best > total + a[4]=10+6=16, worse than 9

Then, a[4]=6 < b[4]=1? 6>1, so total +=1

total=11

v=3:

v=3 <=6, check if best > total + a[3]=11+2=13, worse than 9

Then, a[3]=2 < b[3]=7? 2<7, so total +=2

total=13

v=2:

v=2 <=6, check if best > total + a[2]=13+9=22, worse than 9

Then, a[2]=9 < b[2]=10? 9<10, so total +=9

total=22

v=1:

v=1 <=6, check if best > total + a[1]=22+2=24, worse than 9

Then, a[1]=2 < b[1]=1? 2>1, so total +=1

total=23

v=0:

v=0 <=6, check if best > total + a[0]=23+7=30, worse than 9

Then, a[0]=7 < b[0]=9? 7<9, so total +=7

total=30

But according to the example, the output should be 9, which matches the best found when v=6.

So, again, it seems correct.

Last example:

2 1

2 3

1 1

n=2, m=1

pos_final=0

na_frente=1

Loop from v=1 down to 0:

v=1:

v=1 >0, a[1]=3 < b[1]=1? 3>1, so total +=1

total=1

v=0:

v=0 <=0, check if best > total + a[0]=1+2=3, set best=3

Then, a[0]=2 < b[0]=1? 2>1, so total +=1

total=2

According to the example, the output should be 3, which matches the best found when v=0.

So, in this case, it's also correct.

Alright, so based on these examples, it seems like the code is working correctly.

But I need to make sure that the logic is sound in general, not just for these specific cases.

Let's try to understand the logic.

The code iterates from the position just in front of Kirill (na_frente = n-1) down to position 0.

For each position v:

- If v <= pos_final, it means that if Kirill reaches position v, and v is among the first m positions, then he can stop there, and the cost to reach there is total + a[v]. So, it keeps track of the minimum such cost.

- Then, it decides whether to pay a[v] to swap with position v, or pay b[v] to pass through position v.

- If a[v] < b[v], it's cheaper to swap with v, so total += a[v]

- Else, it's cheaper to pay b[v] to pass through v, so total += b[v]

Wait, but paying b[v] to pass through v doesn't make sense, because b_k is the cost to pay to people between j and i when swapping.

Wait, maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.

"The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9)."

"For the i-th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i. If at the moment Kirill is standing at position i, then he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k. Kirill can perform this action any number of times."

So, when Kirill is at position i and swaps with position j (j < i), he pays a_j plus sum of b_k for all k between j and i.

Wait, but in the code, it seems like it's considering moving from i to j by paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But in the iteration, it's going from higher positions to lower positions, simulating Kirill moving forward in the queue.

I need to make sure that the way total is accumulated makes sense.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n, and he wants to reach position <= m.

He can perform swaps with anyone in front of him, paying a_j plus sum of b_k between j and i.

The code seems to be iterating from position n-1 down to 0, keeping track of the total cost accumulated so far.

When v <= pos_final, it means that Kirill has reached a position that's among the first m, so it checks if the total cost up to that point plus the cost to swap to that position is better than the current best.

Then, it decides whether to swap with v (pay a_v) or to pay b_v to pass through v.

Wait, but passing through v doesn't directly correspond to any operation described in the problem.

In the problem, when you swap with j, you pay a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, in the code, when it says total += a_v or total += b_v, it's trying to model the cost of moving from current position to position v.

I think there's some confusion in the way the costs are accumulated.

Maybe a better way is to consider that Kirill starts at position n, and he can perform swaps to move forward.

Each swap with j < i costs a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

He can perform this any number of times, and he wants to reach position <= m with minimal cost.

To model this, perhaps we can think of it as a graph where each position is a node, and there's an edge from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal cost path from n to any position <= m.

But with n up to 2e5, building such a graph is not feasible.

We need a smarter approach.

Maybe we can compute for each position i from n down to 0, the minimal cost to reach position <= m.

We can use dynamic programming.

Let dp[i] be the minimal cost to reach from position i to some position <= m.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

We need to optimize it.

Let's see if we can find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be accumulating the total cost as it iterates from n-1 down to 0, and keeping track of the best cost when it reaches positions <= m.

In the code, total is accumulated by choosing the minimum between a[v] and b[v], but I'm not sure if this accurately reflects the cost of moving from one position to another.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that Kirill starts at position n.

He can swap with anyone in front of him, i.e., any j < n.

When he swaps with j, he pays a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < n.

After swapping, he's now at position j, and can repeat the process.

He wants to reach position <= m with minimal cost.

One way to model this is to consider that Kirill can skip over people by paying b_k.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that Kirill is at position i.

He can choose to swap with any j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Alternatively, he can choose not to swap and stay at i, but since he wants to move forward, that's not useful.

So, from position i, the cost to reach the goal is the minimum over j < i of (cost to swap to j + cost to reach the goal from j).

But this is too slow for large n.

I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from position 0 to n, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach each position.

Wait, but Kirill starts at n, so maybe I need to iterate from n down to 0.

Let me try.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach from position i to some position <= m.

Initialize dp[i] for i <= m as 0, since if he's already in the desired positions, he doesn't need to pay anything.

For i from m+1 to n, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to m of (a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1).

Wait, but j has to be less than i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the person he swaps with.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where p <= m-1.

To reach p, he needs to swap with p, and pay a_p plus sum of b_k from p+1 to n-1.

But he can also swap with someone else first.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimal cost to reach any position <= m.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

Each swap allows him to jump to any position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

He can perform this any number of times.

This seems similar to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges are defined by these swaps.

But with n up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps prefix sums can help.

Let's define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Then, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, let's see:

sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, if prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1, then sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, indices are getting confusing.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

Therefore, total cost to reach from i to some position <= m is the minimum over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]).

But dp[j] is the cost to reach from j to some position <=m.

Wait, but this seems recursive.

I need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Maybe I can iterate from i = m to n, computing dp[i] based on dp[j] for j < i.

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Let me consider that dp[i] = min over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

This can be rearranged as:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i-1]

So, define temp_j = dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j

Then dp[i] = min over j < i of temp_j + prefix_b[i-1]

Now, if I keep track of the minimum temp_j for j < i, then dp[i] = min_temp_j + prefix_b[i-1]

This can be computed in O(1) per i, after iterating through j < i.

So, here's the plan:

1. Compute prefix_b, where prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

2. Initialize dp[i] for i from 0 to m-1 as dp[i] = 0, since no cost is needed if already in the desired positions.

3. Initialize min_temp = dp[0] - prefix_b[0] + a[0]

4. For i from 1 to m-1:

min_temp = min(min_temp, dp[i] - prefix_b[i] + a[i])

5. For i from m to n:

dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

6. Then, the minimal cost is dp[n], but since Kirill starts at n, and he wants to reach any position <= m, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, Kirill starts at position n, which corresponds to index n in 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the code, na_frente = n -1, since Kirill is at position n.

Wait, I need to clarify the indexing.

Let's assume positions are 0 to n, with Kirill at position n.

He wants to reach any position from 0 to m-1.

So, dp[i] is the minimal cost to reach from position i to some position <= m-1.

Initialize dp[i] for i from 0 to m-1 as 0.

Compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=0 to i-1.

Then, for i from m to n:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

As we saw earlier, this can be optimized to:

temp_j = dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j

dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

So, in code:

prefix_b = [0] * (n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i-1]

dp = [0] * (n+1)

min_temp = dp[0] - prefix_b[0] + a[0]

for i in range(1, m):

temp_i = dp[i] - prefix_b[i] + a[i]

if temp_i < min_temp:

min_temp = temp_i

for i in range(m, n+1):

dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

Then, the minimal cost is dp[n].

But in the code provided, it's doing something different.

It's iterating from na_frente down to 0, accumulating total, and keeping track of the best cost when v <= pos_final.

So, it seems that the approach in the code is different from what I just described.

However, in the examples, it's giving the correct output, so maybe it's equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, and it's just coinciding with the correct outputs in these specific cases.

I need to think of a test case where the code gives the wrong answer.

Let me try constructing a small test case.

Suppose n=3, m=1

a = [1, 100, 100]

b = [10, 10, 10]

So, positions are 0,1,2, Kirill starts at 3.

He wants to reach position 0.

Option 1: Swap directly from 3 to 0, paying a_0 + sum of b_k from 0+1 to 3-1 = a_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

Option 2: Swap from 3 to 1, paying a_1 + b_2 = 100 + 10 = 110, then swap from 1 to 0, paying a_0 + b_1 = 1 + 10 = 11, total 121

Option 3: Swap from 3 to 2, paying a_2 + b_2 = 100 + 10 = 110, then swap from 2 to 0, paying a_0 + b_1 = 1 + 10 = 11, total 121

So, the minimal cost is 21.

Now, let's see what the code does.

n=3, m=1

na_frente = n -1 =2

pos_final = m -1 =0

Loop from v=2 down to 0:

v=2:

v=2 >0, so if a[2]=100 < b[2]=10? 100 >10, so total +=10

total=10

v=1:

v=1 >0, a[1]=100 < b[1]=10? 100 >10, so total +=10

total=20

v=0:

v=0 <=0, check if best > total + a[0]=20+1=21, set best=21

Then, a[0]=1 < b[0]=10? 1<10, so total +=1

total=21

So, best=21, which matches the correct answer.

Another test case:

n=3, m=2

a=[1,2,3]

b=[4,5,6]

He wants to be in positions 0 or 1.

Option 1: Swap directly to 0, cost a_0 + sum b_1 + b_2 =1+5+6=12

Option 2: Swap directly to 1, cost a_1 + sum b_2 =2+6=8

So, minimal cost is 8.

According to the code:

n=3, m=2

na_frente=2

pos_final=1

v=2:

v=2 >1, a[2]=3 < b[2]=6? 3<6, so total +=3

total=3

v=1:

v=1 <=1, check if best > total + a[1]=3+2=5, set best=5

Then, a[1]=2 < b[1]=5? 2<5, so total +=2

total=5

v=0:

v=0 <=1, check if best > total + a[0]=5+1=6, which is worse than 5, no change

Then, a[0]=1 < b[0]=4? 1<4, so total +=1

total=6

So, best=5, but the correct answer is 8.

Wait, that's different.

So, in this case, the code gives 5, but the correct answer is 8.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the examples, it seems correct.

But in this test case, it's giving an incorrect answer.

So, the correctness is False.

Wait, but in the first three examples, it gave the correct answer, but in this test case, it gave an incorrect answer.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can bribe people ahead of him to swap positions, incurring specific costs based on the positions involved.

## Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at position `n` and wants to be among the first `m` positions.
   - To swap with a person at position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill must pay `a[j]` and `b[k]` for each `k` between `j` and `i`.

2. **Insight**:
   - We need to find the minimal cost path from position `n` to any position within the first `m` positions.
   - This can be modeled using dynamic programming where we keep track of the minimal cost to reach any position <= m.

3. **Optimized Solution**:
   - Use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of `b[k]` for ranges.
   - Maintain a dynamic programming array to track the minimal cost to reach each position.

4. **Steps**:
   - Compute prefix sums for `b`.
   - Initialize DP for positions within the first `m` positions.
   - Iterate from position `m` to `n`, updating the DP array based on minimal costs.

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute prefix sums for array `b` to quickly calculate the sum of `b[k]` for any range.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - Initialize the DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimal cost to reach position `i` from position `n`.

4. **Updating DP Array**:
   - Maintain a running minimum of `temp_j` values to efficiently compute `dp[i]` for each position `i`.
   - Ensure that positions within the first `m` positions are handled correctly.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - For each test case, output the minimal cost to reach any of the first `m` positions from position `n`.
