Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. But he's not happy about being at the end; he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places, but there's a cost associated with each swap, and also costs for passing people in between.

First, I need to understand the setup. The queue starts with person 1 at the front, up to person n at the end, and then Kirill is at position n+1. He wants to be in one of the first m positions.

Now, the operations he can perform: he can choose any position j where j < i (his current position) and swap places with the person at position j. When he does this, he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j, and for every k between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to the person at position k.

Also, he can perform this operation any number of times, and he wants to minimize the total cost while ensuring that his final position is among the first m positions.

I need to figure out the minimum cost he has to spend to achieve this.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. Kirill is at position n+1, and he wants to be in one of the positions from 1 to m. To move to a position j that is less than his current position, he has to pay a_j to the person at position j, and for each position between j and his current position, he has to pay b_k to the person at position k.

I need to find the minimum cost for him to reach a position <= m.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about this is to model it as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges representing the cost to move from one position to another.

But considering the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) time per test case, since t can be up to 10^4, but with the sum of n over all test cases being <= 2*10^5.

So, it's essential to have an efficient solution.

Let me consider the positions from n down to 1, since Kirill starts at n+1 and needs to move towards the front.

Wait, but he's at position n+1 initially, and he can swap with anyone in front of him, meaning anyone from position 1 to n.

But the operation allows him to choose any j < i and swap to position j, paying a_j and b_k for each k between j and i.

Wait, but in terms of moving from i to j, where j < i.

I need to model this as a graph where edges are from i to j with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

But computing this directly would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0, since he's already there.

But actually, he wants to reach some position <= m, with minimum cost.

Wait, but he starts at n+1 and wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

I need to find the minimum cost among all possible dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

But I need to define how to compute dp[j].

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in reverse: from n+1 to positions 1 to m.

But maybe it's easier to think of it as moving from n+1 to some position <=m, with the allowed operations.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and operations are edges with associated costs.

But with n up to 2*10^5, a graph with n+1 nodes and potentially n edges per node would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps to move from position i to any position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, that sum is equivalent to sum from k=j to i-1 minus b_j.

But maybe there's a better way to look at it.

Wait, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k is the sum of b_k for positions between j and i, excluding j and i.

Wait, actually, the problem says: "for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, when swapping from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for k=j+1 to i-1.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This seems tricky.

Let me see if there's a way to compute the minimum cost without considering all possible sequences of swaps.

Perhaps I can iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach position m.

Wait, maybe I can use a sliding window or some cumulative sum approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where p <= m.

To reach p, he needs to swap to p, paying a_p plus sum of b_k from k=p+1 to n.

Wait, no.

Wait, when he swaps from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, to reach position p, he can swap directly from n+1 to p, paying a_p plus sum of b_k from k=p+1 to n.

But he can also swap to an intermediate position q, then to p.

But with the costs involved, maybe it's better to swap directly.

I need to find the minimum cost among all possible sequences of swaps that bring him to a position <= m.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the optimal strategy is to swap directly to the target position, without going through intermediate positions.

But I need to verify if that's the case.

Suppose Kirill swaps from n+1 to p, paying a_p + sum of b_k from k=p+1 to n.

Then, if p > m, he needs to swap again to some position q < p, and so on, until he reaches a position <= m.

But maybe it's better to swap directly to some position <= m, and pay the corresponding cost.

I need to find the minimum cost among all possible positions <= m that he can reach directly from n+1.

Wait, but he can reach any position j <= m by swapping directly to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n.

So, perhaps the minimum cost is the minimum over j from 1 to m of (a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n).

Is that correct?

Wait, but maybe there are better strategies by swapping to an intermediate position first.

But let's see.

If he swaps from n+1 to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n, and then from j to some q < j, paying a_q + sum of b_k from k=q+1 to j-1.

But then the total cost would be a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n + a_q + sum from k=q+1 to j-1.

I need to see if this is less than just swapping directly from n+1 to q, which would cost a_q + sum from k=q+1 to n.

Let's compare:

Cost of swapping directly to q: a_q + sum from k=q+1 to n.

Cost of swapping to j first, then to q: a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n + a_q + sum from k=q+1 to j-1.

Simplify the second expression:

a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n + a_q + sum from k=q+1 to j-1.

This can be rewritten as:

a_j + a_q + sum from k=j+1 to n + sum from k=q+1 to j-1.

Wait, sum from k=j+1 to n includes sum from k=q+1 to n if q < j.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider specific values.

Suppose n=4, m=2.

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

According to the sample input, the output should be 14.

Let's see what that means.

Kirill starts at position 5.

He wants to be in position 1 or 2.

Option 1: Swap directly to position 1.

Cost: a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to 5.

a_1 = 7

sum of b_k from 2 to 5: b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5, but b_5 is not given, since n=4.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5].

So, positions 1 to 4 have a and b values.

Position 5 is where Kirill starts, with no a or b value, since he's the one doing the swapping.

Wait, but in the problem statement, a and b are defined for positions 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

So, in this case, n=4, m=2.

He wants to be in position 1 or 2.

Option 1: Swap directly to position 1.

Cost: a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to 5.

But since position 5 is Kirill's starting position, perhaps b_k is only from k=2 to 4.

I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says: "for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, when swapping from i to j, for j < k < i.

So, from i=5 to j=1, k goes from 2 to 4, paying b_2 + b_3 + b_4.

So, total cost to swap from 5 to 1: a_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 23.

Similarly, swapping directly to position 2: a_2 + sum of b_k from k=3 to 4 = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16.

Now, is there a better way by swapping to an intermediate position first?

For example, swap from 5 to 3, then from 3 to 1.

Cost from 5 to 3: a_3 + sum of b_k from k=4 to 4 = 6 + 5 = 11.

Then, from 3 to 1: a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to 2 = 7 + 3 = 10.

Total cost: 11 + 10 = 21, which is higher than swapping directly to 1 (23), but still higher than the sample output of 14.

Wait, that's not better.

Is there another way?

What if he swaps from 5 to 2, then from 2 to 1.

Cost from 5 to 2: a_2 + sum of b_k from k=3 to 4 = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16.

Then from 2 to 1: a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to 1, but k must be between 1 and 2, which is only k=1, but j < k < i, so j=1, i=2, k=1, but j < k < i is 1 < k < 2, which is no k, so sum is 0.

So, cost from 2 to 1 is a_1 + 0 = 7.

Total cost: 16 + 7 = 23, same as swapping directly to 1.

But the sample output is 14, which is less than 16 and 23.

So, there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe swapping to position 4 first, then to position 2, then to position 1.

Cost from 5 to 4: a_4 + sum of b_k from k=5 to 4, but k=5 is not valid, since k must be between j and i, which is between 4 and 5, so k=5 is not included.

Wait, j=4, i=5, so j < k < i means k=5, but k=5 is Kirill's position, so b_5 is not defined.

Wait, n=4, so b only goes up to b_4.

So, cost from 5 to 4: a_4 + sum of b_k from k=5 to 4, which is empty, so just a_4 = 9.

Then, from 4 to 2: a_2 + sum of b_k from k=3 to 3 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Then, from 2 to 1: a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to 1, which is empty, so just a_1 = 7.

Total cost: 9 + 11 + 7 = 27, which is higher than 23.

Not better.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 3, then from 3 to 2, then from 2 to 1.

Cost from 5 to 3: a_3 + sum of b_k from k=4 to 4 = 6 + 5 = 11.

From 3 to 2: a_2 + sum of b_k from k=3 to 2, which is b_3 = 8, so 3 + 8 = 11.

From 2 to 1: a_1 + 0 = 7.

Total: 11 + 11 + 7 = 29, worse.

So, none of these paths give me the sample output of 14.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence of swaps.

Let's consider swapping from 5 to 4, paying a_4 = 9.

Then, from 4 to 2, paying a_2 + b_3 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Total so far: 9 + 11 = 20.

Then, from 2 to 1, paying a_1 = 7.

Total: 20 + 7 = 27.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 directly to 1, paying a_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 23.

Swapping from 5 directly to 2, paying a_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16.

Swapping from 5 directly to 3, paying a_3 + b_4 = 6 + 5 = 11.

Swapping from 5 directly to 4, paying a_4 = 9.

Then, from 4 to 2, paying a_2 + b_3 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Total: 9 + 11 = 20.

Then from 2 to 1, paying a_1 = 7.

Total: 20 + 7 = 27.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Perhaps swapping from 5 to 3, paying a_3 + b_4 = 6 + 5 = 11.

Then, from 3 to 1, paying a_1 + b_2 = 7 + 3 = 10.

Total: 11 + 10 = 21.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 2, paying a_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16.

Then, from 2 to 1, paying a_1 = 7.

Total: 16 + 7 = 23.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 1 directly, paying a_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 23.

Still higher than 14.

So, how can the answer be 14?

I must be missing a better path.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 3, paying a_3 + b_4 = 6 + 5 = 11.

Then, from 3 to 2, paying a_2 + b_2 = 3 + 3 = 6.

Wait, j=2, i=3, so j < k < i means k=2, but j < k < i is 2 < k < 3, which is no k, so sum is 0.

So, cost from 3 to 2 is a_2 + 0 = 3.

Total so far: 11 + 3 = 14.

Then, from 2 to 1, paying a_1 + 0 = 7.

Total: 14 + 7 = 21.

Wait, but the sample output is 14, which suggests that perhaps he doesn't need to swap to position 1 if he's already in position 2, since m=2.

Wait, the problem says he wants to be among the first m people, which are positions 1 to m.

So, if he's in position 2, which is <= m=2, he's satisfied.

So, in this path, swapping from 5 to 3 costs 11, then from 3 to 2 costs 3, total 14, and since position 2 is <= m=2, he's done.

So, the minimum cost is 14.

That makes sense now.

So, the key is that he doesn't necessarily have to reach position 1; reaching position 2 is sufficient, and in this path, he reaches position 2 with a cost of 14.

But why isn't the cost from 5 to 2 directly considered? Because that would be 16, which is higher than 14.

So, by swapping to an intermediate position (3), and then to 2, he achieves a lower total cost.

Therefore, the direct swap may not always be the optimal; sometimes swapping through intermediate positions can lead to a lower cost.

So, how can I model this to find the minimum cost efficiently?

I need an efficient way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.

One approach could be to iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach positions <= m.

I can keep a running minimum cost to reach any position <= m, and for each position, decide whether it's better to swap directly to it or to go through intermediate positions.

Wait, but with n up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider positions from n down to 1.

I can precompute the suffix sums of b_k for each position.

For example, suffix_sum[i] = sum of b_k from k=i to n.

Then, the cost to swap from n+1 to position j is a_j + suffix_sum[j+1].

But as we've seen, swapping through intermediate positions can lead to a lower cost.

So, I need to consider not only direct swaps but also indirect swaps through intermediate positions.

To handle this efficiently, perhaps I can keep track of the minimum cost to reach any position <= m, and for each position, consider the cost to swap to it from n+1, and also consider the cost to swap to it from positions ahead.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[j] as the minimum cost to reach position j from n+1.

Our goal is to find min(dp[j]) for j from 1 to m.

Initialize dp[j] to infinity for all j.

We can iterate from j=n down to 1, and for each j, compute dp[j] as a_j + suffix_sum[j+1].

But we also need to consider that from position j, we can swap to positions k < j, paying a_k + suffix_sum[k+1] - suffix_sum[j].

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Wait, maybe I can accumulate the costs in a way that allows me to keep track of the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps, and each swap has a cost.

I need to find the minimum cost path from n+1 to any position <=m.

This sounds like a shortest path problem.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Maybe I can model this as a graph with n+1 nodes and use Dijkstra's algorithm, but that would be too slow for this constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

This can be rewritten as a_j + (suffix_sum[j+1] - suffix_sum[i]).

Wait, no.

Wait, suffix_sum[j+1] is sum from k=j+1 to n.

sum from k=j+1 to i-1 would be suffix_sum[j+1] - suffix_sum[i], assuming i <= n.

Wait, actually, if i <= n, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is suffix_sum[j+1] - suffix_sum[i].

If i = n+1, then sum from k=j+1 to n.

So, when swapping from i to j, the cost is a_j + (suffix_sum[j+1] - suffix_sum[i]).

In particular, from n+1 to j, since suffix_sum[n+1] = 0, the cost is a_j + suffix_sum[j+1].

For i <= n, the cost is a_j + suffix_sum[j+1] - suffix_sum[i].

But this seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

At each position, I can compute the cost to swap to that position from n+1, and also consider the cost to swap to positions ahead.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that swapping to a position j from n+1 costs a_j + suffix_sum[j+1], and then from j, I can swap to any position k < j with cost a_k + suffix_sum[k+1] - suffix_sum[j], since the sum of b_k from k+1 to j-1 is suffix_sum[k+1] - suffix_sum[j].

But this still seems too involved.

Let me consider that the total cost to reach position p is the cost to swap from n+1 to some position q > p, then from q to p.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to find a way to accumulate the minimum costs as I iterate through the positions.

Let me consider starting from position n and moving backwards.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0.

For i from n down to 1, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min(dp[j] for j in i+1 to n+1).

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Perhaps I can use a sliding window minimum.

Wait, if I iterate from n down to 1, and keep track of the minimum dp[j] for j from i+1 to n+1, I can compute dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min_dp, where min_dp is the minimum dp[j] for j > i.

Then, the answer would be the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

This seems promising.

Let me try this with the sample input.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute suffix_sum:

suffix_sum[5] = 0

suffix_sum[4] = 5

suffix_sum[3] = 8 + 5 = 13

suffix_sum[2] = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16

suffix_sum[1] = 4 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 20

Now, initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Set min_dp = 0

For i=4:

dp[4] = a[4] + suffix_sum[5] + min_dp = 9 + 0 + 0 = 9

Update min_dp = min(min_dp, dp[4]) = min(0,9) = 0

For i=3:

dp[3] = a[3] + suffix_sum[4] + min_dp = 6 + 5 + 0 = 11

Update min_dp = min(0,11) = 0

For i=2:

dp[2] = a[2] + suffix_sum[3] + min_dp = 3 + 13 + 0 = 16

Update min_dp = min(0,16) = 0

For i=1:

dp[1] = a[1] + suffix_sum[2] + min_dp = 7 + 16 + 0 = 23

Update min_dp = min(0,23) = 0

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to 2 is min(23,16) = 16, which is higher than the sample output of 14.

So, this approach is not giving the correct answer.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, I need to adjust my approach.

What's wrong with this approach?

Well, perhaps I need to consider that min_dp is not just the minimum dp[j] for j > i, but the minimum dp[j] for j > i and j <= some limit.

Wait, no, the problem allows swapping to any j < i, so in this dp approach, j > i means swapping from j to i, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the dp definition.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0.

For dp[i], I can swap directly from n+1 to i, which costs a_i + suffix_sum[i+1], or I can swap to some j > i and then to i.

So, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min(dp[j] for j in i+1 to n+1).

This seems correct.

In the sample input, dp[4] = 9 + 0 + 0 = 9

dp[3] = 6 + 5 + 0 = 11

dp[2] = 3 + 13 + 0 = 16

dp[1] = 7 + 16 + 0 = 23

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to 2 is 16, but the sample output is 14.

So, this approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when swapping from j to i, the cost is a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[j], because sum from k=i+1 to j-1 is suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[j].

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate from position 1 to n, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Wait, but Kirill starts at n+1, so maybe iterating from n down to 1 is better.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from n down to 1, and keep track of the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Let me try this.

Initialize dp[i] as infinity for all i from 1 to n.

For i from n down to 1:

cost_direct = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1]

dp[i] = cost_direct

if i < current position, dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + a_i + (suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[j]))

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of a minimum value as I iterate.

Let me consider that for each position i, the cost to reach it directly is a_i + suffix_sum[i+1], and the cost to reach it through some position j > i is dp[j] + a_i + (suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[j]).

But this is still O(n^2).

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me rearrange the terms: dp[j] + a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[j] = (dp[j] - suffix_sum[j]) + a_i + suffix_sum[i+1]

So, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min(dp[j] - suffix_sum[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

This is interesting because now min(dp[j] - suffix_sum[j]) can be precomputed as I iterate from n down to 1.

I can keep a variable that keeps track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - suffix_sum[j]) for j from i+1 to n+1.

Initialize min_val = 0, since dp[n+1] = 0 and suffix_sum[n+1] = 0.

Then, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min_val

min_val = min(min_val, dp[i] - suffix_sum[i])

Then, the answer is the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

Let's try this with the sample input.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

suffix_sum:

suffix_sum[5] = 0

suffix_sum[4] = 5

suffix_sum[3] = 13

suffix_sum[2] = 16

suffix_sum[1] = 20

Initialize min_val = 0

For i=4:

dp[4] = 9 + 0 + 0 = 9

min_val = min(0, 9 - 0) = min(0,9) = 0

For i=3:

dp[3] = 6 + 5 + 0 = 11

min_val = min(0,11 - 5) = min(0,6) = 0

For i=2:

dp[2] = 3 + 13 + 0 = 16

min_val = min(0,16 - 13) = min(0,3) = 0

For i=1:

dp[1] = 7 + 20 + 0 = 27

min_val = min(0,27 - 20) = min(0,7) = 0

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j=1 to 2 is min(27,16) = 16, but the sample output is 14.

So, this approach is still not giving the correct answer.

Hence, it's incorrect.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps, and each swap has a cost.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and edges represent the cost to swap from one position to another.

But with n up to 2*10^5, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the fact that Kirill can swap to any position j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

This is similar to choosing a path where each step has a certain cost.

I need to find the minimum cost path from n+1 to any position <=m.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of potential functions or something similar to optimize this.

Let me consider defining potential[i] = dp[i] - suffix_sum[i]

Then, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min(dp[j] - suffix_sum[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

Which is dp[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] + min(potential[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

So, potential[i] = dp[i] - suffix_sum[i] = a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[i] + min(potential[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

Simplify a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[i] = a_i - (suffix_sum[i] - suffix_sum[i+1]) = a_i - b_i

Wait, suffix_sum[i] - suffix_sum[i+1] = b_i

So, a_i + suffix_sum[i+1] - suffix_sum[i] = a_i - b_i

Therefore, potential[i] = a_i - b_i + min(potential[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

This looks like potential[i] = a_i - b_i + min(potential[j] for j in i+1 to n+1)

So, I can compute potential[i] by iterating from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum potential[j] for j > i.

Then, dp[i] = potential[i] + suffix_sum[i]

And the answer is the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

Let's try this with the sample input.

Compute suffix_sum:

suffix_sum[5] = 0

suffix_sum[4] = 5

suffix_sum[3] = 13

suffix_sum[2] = 16

suffix_sum[1] = 20

Initialize min_pot = 0 (since potential[n+1] = dp[n+1] - suffix_sum[n+1] = 0 - 0 = 0)

For i=4:

potential[4] = a[4] - b[4] + min_pot = 9 - 5 + 0 = 4

dp[4] = potential[4] + suffix_sum[4] = 4 + 5 = 9

min_pot = min(min_pot, potential[4]) = min(0,4) = 0

For i=3:

potential[3] = a[3] - b[3] + min_pot = 6 - 8 + 0 = -2

dp[3] = -2 + 13 = 11

min_pot = min(0, -2) = -2

For i=2:

potential[2] = a[2] - b[2] + min_pot = 3 - 3 + (-2) = -2

dp[2] = -2 + 16 = 14

min_pot = min(-2, -2) = -2

For i=1:

potential[1] = a[1] - b[1] + min_pot = 7 - 4 + (-2) = 1

dp[1] = 1 + 20 = 21

min_pot = min(-2,1) = -2

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j=1 to 2 is min(21,14) = 14, which matches the sample output.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the correct approach is:

1. Compute the suffix_sum of b, where suffix_sum[i] = sum of b[k] from k=i to n.

2. Initialize min_pot = 0

3. Iterate from i=n down to 1:

a. potential[i] = a[i] - b[i] + min_pot

b. dp[i] = potential[i] + suffix_sum[i]

c. min_pot = min(min_pot, potential[i])

4. The answer is the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

This way, we compute dp[i] efficiently in O(n) time per test case.

Now, considering that t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is <= 2*10^5, this approach is acceptable.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for c in range(cases):

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = sys.float_info.max

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

In my approach, I computed suffix sums and potentials, but in this code, it's iterating from na_frente down to 0, and accumulating total cost, and updating best when v <= pos_final.

Wait, in the code, na_frente is n, and pos_final is m, both adjusted to 0-based indexing.

But in my approach, I need to compute suffix sums and potentials.

This code seems to be accumulating costs and keeping track of the best cost when v <= pos_final.

This seems too simplistic compared to my approach, and it doesn't seem to account for the correct costs.

In particular, in the sample input, with n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5], according to my approach, the answer is 14, but according to this code:

na_frente = 4 -1 = 3

pos_final = 2 -1 =1

Initialize total=0, best=inf

v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=1, so if a[3]=9 < b[3]=5, total += a[3]=9, else total += b[3]=5.

a[3]=6 < b[3]=8, so total +=6, total=6

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1, so if a[2]=3 < b[2]=8, total +=3, else +=8.

a[2]=3 < b[2]=8, so total +=3, total=9

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1, so best = min(best, total + a[1]=7) = min(inf, 9+7=16) =16

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1, so best = min(16, total + a[0]=7) = min(16, 9+7=16)=16

Then, print best=16, but the sample output is 14.

So, this code is giving 16, but the correct answer is 14.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier, with my approach, I got dp[2]=14, which matches the sample output.

So, the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

But wait, in my approach, dp[2]=14, which is correct, but in the code, it's doing something different.

Hence, the provided program is incorrect.

But perhaps I misread the code.

Let me look again.

In the code:

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

So, it's accumulating total by choosing the smaller of a[v] or b[v], and when v <= pos_final, it updates best with total + a[v].

But this doesn't account for the correct costs as per the problem's operations.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach among the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can perform swaps with people ahead of him, but each swap incurs costs based on the positions involved.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Kirill starts at position `n+1` and needs to reach any position from `1` to `m`.
   - Swapping from position `i` to `j` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for `k` from `j+1` to `i-1`.

2. **Insight**:
   - We need an efficient way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.
   - Using dynamic programming with suffix sums to handle the cumulative costs efficiently.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute suffix sums of `b` array to get the sum of `b_k` from any position to the end.
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
   - Iterate from position `n` down to `1`, calculating the cost to reach each position and maintaining a running minimum cost.

4. **Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) per test case.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for storing suffix sums and DP arrays.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, data[idx].split())
        a = list(map(int, data[idx+1].split()))
        b = list(map(int, data[idx+2].split()))
        idx += 3
        # Compute suffix sums
        suffix_sum = [0] * (n + 2)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            suffix_sum[i] = b[i-1] + suffix_sum[i+1]
        # Initialize min_pot and dp
        min_pot = 0
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            potential_i = a[i-1] - b[i-1] + min_pot
            dp[i] = potential_i + suffix_sum[i]
            min_pot = min(min_pot, potential_i)
        # Find the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m
        ans = min(dp[j] for j in range(1, m + 1))
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - We precompute the suffix sums of the `b` array to quickly get the sum of `b_k` from any position to the end.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We define a potential function to track the minimum cost efficiently.
   - For each position from `n` down to `1`, we calculate the potential and the dp value, keeping track of the minimum potential encountered so far.

3. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - After computing the dp array, we find the minimum value among the first `m` positions, which gives us the minimum cost for Kirill to reach within the first `m` positions.

This approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently and correctly, adhering to the constraints and operations defined.
