Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given three digits, a, b, and c, and I need to determine if they form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions provided.

First, I need to understand what a stair and a peak are. A stair is defined as a < b < c, meaning each subsequent digit is greater than the previous one. A peak is defined as a < b > c, which means the middle digit is greater than both the first and the third digits.

The input consists of multiple test cases, starting with an integer t that indicates how many test cases there are. For each test case, there's a line with three digits: a, b, and c.

My task is to process each test case and print "STAIR" if it's a stair, "PEAK" if it's a peak, and "NONE" otherwise.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

7

1 2 3

3 2 1

1 5 3

3 4 1

0 0 0

4 1 7

4 5 7

Output:

STAIR

NONE

PEAK

PEAK

NONE

NONE

STAIR

From this, I can see that for the first test case, 1 2 3, it's a stair because 1 < 2 < 3.

The second one, 3 2 1, doesn't meet either condition, so it's NONE.

The third, 1 5 3, is a peak because 1 < 5 > 3.

The fourth, 3 4 1, is also a peak for the same reason: 3 < 4 > 1.

The fifth, 0 0 0, doesn't meet either condition, so it's NONE.

The sixth, 4 1 7, doesn't meet either condition because 4 is not less than 1, and 1 is not greater than 7.

The seventh, 4 5 7, is a stair because 4 < 5 < 7.

So, my function needs to read t, then for each test case, read a, b, c, and determine which category they fall into.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

if a < b < c:

print('STAIRS')

elif a < b > c:

print('PEAK')

else:

print('NONE')

Hmm, there's something here that seems off. In the condition for stair, it's checking if a < b < c, which is correct, and for peak, it's checking if a < b > c, which is also correct. But in the example output, the first test case is "STAIR", not "STAIRS". Wait, in the code, it's printing 'STAIRS' for stairs, but in the problem description, it should print "STAIR".

That's a discrepancy. The problem says to print "STAIR", but the code prints "STAIRS". That's probably a typo in the code.

Other than that, the logic seems correct. It reads t, then for each test case, reads a, b, c, and checks the conditions for stair and peak, printing the appropriate string.

I should also consider edge cases. For example, if a, b, or c are equal.

Like in the fifth test case: 0 0 0. Here, a = b = c, so it shouldn't be a stair or a peak, so it's NONE.

Another case: 1 1 2. Here, a = b, so it doesn't satisfy a < b < c for stair, nor a < b > c for peak, so it's NONE.

Similarly, 2 1 1: a > b = c, so neither stair nor peak, hence NONE.

Also, 1 3 2: a < b > c, so it should be PEAK.

Seems like the code handles these cases correctly, except for the typo in printing "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR".

I need to decide if this program is correct based on the problem description. The only issue is this typo in the output string.

If I were to strictly follow the problem's instruction, the output should be "STAIR", not "STAIRS". So, technically, it's incorrect.

However, the logic is correct; it's just the output string that's wrong.

But according to the problem, I have to output the strings exactly as specified: "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE", without quotes.

So, since the code prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR", it's incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

Wait, but the problem says "output the strings without quotes", implying that we should print the exact strings "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".

So, printing "STAIRS" is not matching the required "STAIR".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But if I were to fix just that typo, changing 'STAIRS' to 'STAIR', then it would be correct.

But as it is, with 'STAIRS', it's incorrect.

So, Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the provided conditions. We will process multiple test cases as specified.

### Approach

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, read three digits: \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Check Conditions:**
   - Check if \( a < b < c \). If true, print "STAIR".
   - Else, check if \( a < b > c \). If true, print "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is satisfied, print "NONE".

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

# Example Usage
# func()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input:**
  - We first read the integer \( t \), which represents the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, we read three digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) using `map(int, input().split())`.

- **Checking Conditions:**
  - We check if \( a < b < c \). If this condition is true, it means the digits form a stair, and we print "STAIR".
  - If the first condition is not met, we check if \( a < b > c \). If this condition is true, it means the digits form a peak, and we print "PEAK".
  - If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, we print "NONE".

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and classify each test case according to the given criteria.
