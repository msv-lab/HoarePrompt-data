Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. Among all possible y values that give the highest sum, I can choose any one.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to look at all y values from 1 up to x-1, calculate y plus GCD of x and y, and find the y that gives me the highest sum.

Let me think about how to approach this. A brute-force way would be to iterate through all possible y values from 1 to x-1, calculate y + GCD(x, y) for each, and keep track of the y that gives the maximum sum.

But wait, the problem says that t can be up to 1000, and x can be up to 1000. So, in the worst case, I might have to perform up to 1000 tests, each with up to 999 y values to check. That seems manageable computationally, but maybe there's a smarter way to find y without checking all possibilities.

Let me think about the properties of GCD. If y is a divisor of x, then GCD(x, y) is y itself, because y divides x completely. So, in that case, y + GCD(x, y) would be y + y = 2y.

On the other hand, if y is not a divisor of x, then GCD(x, y) would be less than y, specifically, it would be the greatest common divisor of x and y.

So, if y is a divisor of x, the sum is 2y, and if y is not a divisor, the sum is y plus something less than y.

Wait a minute, if y is a divisor of x, sum is 2y, and if y is not a divisor, sum is less than 2y. So, perhaps the y that is a divisor of x and is as large as possible would give the maximum sum.

But let's verify this with an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. But y has to be less than x, so y can be 1, 2, or 5.

For y=1: GCD(10,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

For y=2: GCD(10,2)=2, sum=2+2=4

For y=5: GCD(10,5)=5, sum=5+5=10

So, the maximum sum is 10, achieved when y=5.

Now, let's see what the program outputs for x=10. According to the example, it's 5, which matches our calculation.

Another example: x=7.

Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. y can be 1 or 6.

Wait, 7 is prime, so only 1 and 7. But y < x, so y=1 or y=6.

For y=1: GCD(7,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

For y=6: GCD(7,6)=1, sum=6+1=7

So, y=6 gives a higher sum than y=1.

But according to the example, the output is 6 for x=7, which matches.

Another one: x=21.

Divisors: 1,3,7,21. y can be 1,3,7, or 20.

Wait, 20 is not a divisor. So y=1,3,7, or 20.

Wait, GCD for y=20 and x=21.

21 is 3*7, 20 is 2^2*5, so GCD is 1.

So, y=20: sum=20+1=21

y=7: sum=7+7=14

y=3: sum=3+3=6

y=1: sum=1+1=2

So, y=20 gives the highest sum of 21.

But according to the example, the output is 18 for x=21.

Wait, that's different. Let's check y=18.

x=21, y=18.

GCD(21,18)=3, sum=18+3=21.

Wait, that's the same as y=20.

But y=20 also gives sum=21.

So, both y=18 and y=20 give sum=21.

The problem says that any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

So, y=18 is acceptable.

Wait, but y=18 is not a divisor of 21, but GCD is 3.

So, in this case, y=18 gives sum=18+3=21, which is higher than y=7 giving sum=14.

So, it's better.

Wait, but earlier I thought that y being a divisor would give sum=2y, but in this case, y=18 is not a divisor, yet sum is higher than for y=7, which is a divisor.

Wait, no, y=18 gives sum=18+3=21, y=7 gives sum=7+7=14.

So, y=18 is better.

Wait, but 21 is 3*7, 18 is 2*3*3, so GCD is 3.

So, sum is y + GCD(x,y) = 18 + 3 = 21.

Wait, but y=20 also gives sum=20 +1=21.

So, both y=18 and y=20 give the same sum.

The program outputs y=18 for x=21, which is acceptable.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption that choosing the largest divisor is always the best is not correct.

Wait, in this case, y=18 is not a divisor, but it gives a higher sum than y=7, which is a divisor.

So, maybe choosing y such that y + GCD(x,y) is maximized isn't necessarily the largest divisor.

Wait, but in this case, y=20 also gives the same sum.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me think differently.

Let me try to maximize y + GCD(x,y).

I can write this as y + GCD(x,y).

I know that GCD(x,y) divides both x and y.

Let d = GCD(x,y), then d divides x and d divides y.

So, y = k*d for some integer k.

Similarly, x = m*d for some integer m.

Since d divides both, x = m*d and y = k*d.

Then, y + d = k*d + d = (k+1)*d.

So, the sum is (k+1)*d.

But I need to maximize this over all possible y < x.

Given that y = k*d and x = m*d, with k < m, since y < x.

So, sum = (k+1)*d.

To maximize this, I need to maximize (k+1)*d, with k < m.

But d is a divisor of x, so d divides x.

So, perhaps I need to choose d to be as large as possible, but also choose k such that y = k*d is less than x.

Wait, d divides x, and y = k*d < x.

So, k < m.

Given that, to maximize (k+1)*d, I can fix d and maximize k, or fix k and maximize d.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate over all possible d (divisors of x), and for each d, set k as large as possible under the constraint that y = k*d < x.

So, for each d that divides x, set k = floor((x-1)/d), which is the largest integer k such that k*d < x.

Then, sum = (k+1)*d.

And among all such sums for different d, choose the maximum.

Wait, that seems systematic.

Let me try this with x=21.

Divisors of 21 are 1,3,7,21.

But y < x, so d cannot be 21.

So, d=1,3,7.

For d=1:

k = floor((21-1)/1) = 20

sum = (20+1)*1 = 21

For d=3:

k = floor((21-1)/3) = floor(20/3) = 6

sum = (6+1)*3 = 7*3 = 21

For d=7:

k = floor((21-1)/7) = floor(20/7) = 2

sum = (2+1)*7 = 3*7 = 21

So, all d values give the same sum of 21.

But in the earlier manual calculation, y=18 also gives sum=21.

Wait, y=18 corresponds to d=3, since 18 is divisible by 3.

Wait, 18 is not a multiple of 7 or 1, but it's a multiple of 3.

Wait, but 18 is not a multiple of 21, but d=3 divides both 21 and 18.

Yes, GCD(21,18)=3.

So, in this case, y=18 corresponds to d=3, and k=6 (since 18=6*3).

So, sum=(6+1)*3=21.

Similarly, y=20 corresponds to d=1 (since GCD(21,20)=1), k=20.

sum=(20+1)*1=21.

And y=7 corresponds to d=7, k=1 (since 7=1*7), sum=(1+1)*7=14.

Wait, earlier I thought y=7 gives sum=14, but according to this, it's sum=14.

But according to this method, for d=7, sum=21.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something.

Wait, for d=7, k=floor((21-1)/7)=2, so y=2*7=14, which is less than 21.

sum=14 + GCD(21,14)=14 + 7=21.

Wait, but earlier I thought y=7 gives sum=14 +7=14, but that's incorrect.

Wait, GCD(21,14)=7, so sum=14+7=21.

But according to the formula, sum=(k+1)*d=(2+1)*7=21.

Wait, but y=7 corresponds to k=1 (since 7=1*7), sum=7+7=14.

But according to the formula, k=floor((21-1)/7)=2, so y=14.

So, y=14 gives sum=14+7=21.

So, y=14 is better than y=7.

But in the earlier manual calculation, y=18 also gives sum=21.

So, y=18 is acceptable.

But according to the program, for x=21, it outputs y=18.

So, it's acceptable.

Wait, but according to the example, for x=21, the output is y=18.

But according to this method, y=14 also gives sum=21.

So, both are acceptable.

Now, let's see what the program does.

Looking at the program:

It reads t, the number of test cases, then reads t integers into test_cases.

Then it calls func_1(t, test_cases), which processes each x and finds the corresponding y.

Then it prints each y.

Now, looking at func_1:

It initializes results as an empty list.

For each x in test_cases:

It initializes max_sum to 0 and best_y to 1.

Then it iterates y from x-1 down to 1.

For each y, it calculates GCD of x and y using math.gcd.

Then it calculates current_sum = gcd_val + y.

If current_sum > max_sum, it updates max_sum to current_sum and best_y to y, and breaks out of the loop.

Wait, it breaks after finding the first y that has a current_sum greater than the current max_sum.

Is that correct?

Wait, breaking out after finding the first y that improves max_sum might not necessarily give the correct y.

Because there might be a larger y that gives a higher sum, but since it's iterating from x-1 downwards, it might find a y that improves max_sum, but there could be smaller y values that give even higher sums.

Wait, but in the code, it breaks after updating max_sum and best_y.

So, it only considers the first y that improves max_sum.

Is that correct?

Let's see with an example.

Take x=10.

y starts from 9 down to 1.

y=9: GCD(10,9)=1, sum=9+1=10.

y=8: GCD(10,8)=2, sum=8+2=10.

y=7: GCD(10,7)=1, sum=7+1=8.

y=6: GCD(10,6)=2, sum=6+2=8.

y=5: GCD(10,5)=5, sum=5+5=10.

y=4: GCD(10,4)=2, sum=4+2=6.

y=3: GCD(10,3)=1, sum=3+1=4.

y=2: GCD(10,2)=2, sum=2+2=4.

y=1: GCD(10,1)=1, sum=1+1=2.

So, the maximum sum is 10, achieved by y=9, y=8, and y=5.

According to the program, it iterates from y=x-1 down to 1, and picks the first y that gives a sum greater than the current max_sum.

Initially, max_sum=0.

First y=9: sum=10 > 0, so max_sum=10, best_y=9, and it breaks.

So, it picks y=9.

But according to the example, it should pick y=5.

Wait, but y=9 also gives sum=10, which is correct.

So, it's acceptable because any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

But in the example, it outputs y=5 for x=10.

So, both y=5 and y=9 are acceptable.

But the program picks y=9.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another example: x=7.

y from 6 down to 1.

y=6: GCD(7,6)=1, sum=7.

y=5: GCD(7,5)=1, sum=6.

y=4: GCD(7,4)=1, sum=5.

y=3: GCD(7,3)=1, sum=4.

y=2: GCD(7,2)=1, sum=3.

y=1: GCD(7,1)=1, sum=2.

So, maximum sum is 7, achieved by y=6.

Program would pick y=6, which matches the example.

Another one: x=21.

y from 20 down to 1.

y=20: GCD(21,20)=1, sum=21.

y=19: GCD(21,19)=1, sum=20.

y=18: GCD(21,18)=3, sum=21.

y=17: GCD(21,17)=1, sum=18.

And so on.

So, first y=20 gives sum=21, which is greater than max_sum=0, so it picks y=20.

But according to the example, it outputs y=18.

Wait, but in the code, it's breaking after the first improvement.

But in the example, it's y=18.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, looking back at the code:

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for x in test_cases:

max_sum = 0

best_y = 1

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

results.append(best_y)

return results

So, it's breaking after the first y that improves max_sum.

In the case of x=10, it would pick y=9.

But in the example, it's y=5.

Similarly, for x=21, it should pick y=20, but the example shows y=18.

Wait, but y=20 also gives sum=21, which is correct.

So, y=18 is also correct, but the program picks y=20.

Wait, but in the example output, it's y=18.

Wait, perhaps the program is different from what's provided.

Wait, in the given program, it's breaking after updating max_sum.

So, for x=21, it would pick y=20.

But in the example, it's y=18.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Wait, maybe the program is not breaking after the first improvement.

Wait, looking at the code again:

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

Yes, it's breaking after the first y that improves max_sum.

So, for x=21, y=20 gives sum=21, which is greater than max_sum=0, so it picks y=20 and breaks.

But in the example, it's y=18.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

So, y=20 is acceptable, y=18 is also acceptable.

So, both are correct.

But the program is picking y=20 for x=21, but the example shows y=18.

But since both are correct, it's still acceptable.

Wait, but the problem says "any y which satisfies the statement", so both are fine.

So, perhaps the program is correct in picking y=20, and the example shows y=18, but both are correct.

Wait, but in the program, it's breaking after the first y that improves max_sum.

So, for x=10, it would pick y=9, which is correct.

For x=7, y=6.

For x=21, y=20.

But in the example, for x=10, y=5; x=7, y=6; x=21, y=18.

So, y=5 for x=10 also gives sum=10, y=6 for x=7 gives sum=7, y=18 for x=21 gives sum=21.

So, all are correct.

Hence, the program is correct as long as it picks any y that achieves the maximum sum.

But in the program, it picks the highest y that improves max_sum, which may not be the y that the example chooses, but it's still correct.

Wait, but in the program, it breaks after the first improvement, which might not necessarily give the y that matches the example, but as long as it achieves the maximum sum, it's acceptable.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the case of x=10, y=9 is acceptable, but the example shows y=5.

Both are acceptable, so the program is correct.

Similarly for x=21, y=20 is acceptable, y=18 is also acceptable.

Hence, the program is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \). We are allowed to output any such \( y \) if multiple options exist.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:

    - Given the constraints (\( t \leq 1000 \) and \( x \leq 1000 \)), this approach is computationally feasible.

3. **Optimization Consideration**:
    - Although a brute-force method works, we can potentially optimize by considering the divisors of \( x \). However, since the problem allows any \( y \) that achieves the maximum sum, we can stick with the straightforward approach for simplicity and efficiency.

4. **Implementation**:
    - For each test case, iterate from \( y = x-1 \) down to \( y = 1 \).
    - Compute \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) for each \( y \).
    - Track the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum and break upon finding the first such \( y \).

    - A brute-force approach would be to check all possible \( y \) from \( 1 \) to \( x-1 \), compute \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \), and select the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum.
    - Given the constraints (\( t \leq 1000 \) and \( x \leq 1000 \)), this approach is computationally feasible.

3. **Optimization Consideration**:
    - Although a brute-force method works, we can potentially optimize by considering the divisors of \( x \). However, since the problem allows any \( y \) that achieves the maximum sum, we can stick with the straightforward approach for simplicity and efficiency.

4. **Implementation**:
    - For each test case, iterate from \( y = x-1 \) down to \( y = 1 \).
    - Compute \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) for each \( y \).
    - Track the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum and break upon finding the first such \( y \).

## Solution Code

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
    - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
    - Read the next \( t \) lines to get the values of \( x \) for each test case.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each \( x \), initialize `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
    - Iterate \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
    - Calculate \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \).
    - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, update `max_sum` and `best_y`, and break out of the loop.

- **Output**:
    - For each test case, print the corresponding `best_y` that was found.

This approach ensures that we find a suitable \( y \) efficiently for each test case, adhering to the problem's requirements and constraints.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \). We are allowed to output any such \( y \) if multiple options exist.
