Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players playing a card game with a 32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. Suits are clubs (C), diamonds (D), hearts (H), and spades (S), and ranks are from '2' to '9'. So, cards are represented like '8H' for 8 of Hearts.

At the beginning, one suit is chosen as the trump suit. In each round, the first player plays a card, and the second player has to beat it with one of their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.

Now, I need to reconstruct the sequence of rounds based on the discard pile, which contains 2n cards shuffled. I have to find any possible sequence of n rounds that could have been played.

Let's understand how a card can beat another one:

1. If both cards have the same suit, the higher rank beats the lower one. For example, '8S' beats '4S'.

2. A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank. So, if trump is 'C', then '3C' beats any non-trump card, like '9D'.

3. Trump cards can only be beaten by higher trump cards. So, '3C' can be beaten by '4C', '5C', up to '9C'.

Given that, I need to arrange the 2n cards into n pairs where, in each pair, the second card beats the first one according to the rules above.

First, I need to parse the input. There are multiple test cases, each starting with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the number of rounds.

- The second line contains a single character representing the trump suit: 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'.

- The third line contains 2n card descriptions, each a two-character string where the first character is the rank ('2'-'9') and the second is the suit ('C','D','H','S'). All cards are unique.

My task is to output for each test case either:

- n lines, each containing two card descriptions: the first card played by the first player and the beating card played by the second player.

- Or, a single line "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid sequence of rounds can be reconstructed.

If multiple solutions exist, any one is acceptable.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to group the cards in such a way that for each pair, the second card beats the first one according to the game's rules.

Given that trumps are special, I should probably handle them separately from the non-trump cards.

Let's consider the non-trump cards first.

For non-trump cards, they can only beat other cards of the same suit if their rank is higher.

So, for each suit that is not the trump, I need to arrange the cards in such a way that if a card is played, it's beaten by a higher card of the same suit.

If there are multiple cards of the same suit, I need to pair them appropriately.

Now, for trump cards, they can beat any non-trump card, and they can only be beaten by higher trump cards.

So, trumps among themselves follow the same ranking order based on their ranks.

Given that, I need to make sure that any trump card is only beaten by a higher trump card.

Also, any non-trump card can be beaten by any trump card.

Alright, so maybe I should separate the cards into trump and non-trump categories.

For non-trump cards, group them by their suits and sort them by their ranks.

Then, for each suit, pair the cards such that a higher card beats a lower one.

For trumps, sort them by their ranks and pair them such that a higher trump beats a lower one.

But, there's a complication because trumps can also beat non-trump cards.

So, perhaps I need to consider that trumps can be used to beat non-trump cards, and non-trump cards can only be beaten by other non-trump cards of the same suit or by trumps.

Wait, no. Non-trump cards can only be beaten by higher cards of the same suit or by any trump card.

Trumps can be beaten only by higher trumps.

So, in the pairing, if a non-trump card is played, it can be beaten either by a higher non-trump card of the same suit or by any trump card.

If a trump card is played, it can only be beaten by a higher trump card.

Given that, I need to make sure that in each pair, if the first card is a non-trump, the second card is either a higher non-trump of the same suit or any trump.

If the first card is a trump, the second card must be a higher trump.

Also, I need to ensure that all pairs are valid according to these rules.

Moreover, since the discard pile is shuffled, I need to find any possible arrangement of the cards into n pairs that satisfy these conditions.

I need to find a way to pair the cards such that for each pair, the second card beats the first one as per the rules.

Let me think about an algorithm to do this.

First, I can separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

For non-trumps, I can further group them by their suits.

Then, for each suit, I can sort the cards by their ranks.

For trumps, I can sort them by their ranks as well.

Now, for each suit that is not the trump, I need to pair the cards in such a way that a higher card beats a lower one.

But, I also have the option to use trumps to beat non-trump cards.

Similarly, trumps can only be beaten by higher trumps.

So, perhaps I should start by pairing the non-trump cards within their suits.

For each suit, if there are multiple cards, I can pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on.

But, I need to make sure that I have enough trumps to beat any non-trump cards that don't have a higher non-trump card in their suit.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some non-trump cards don't have a higher card in their suit, so they must be beaten by trumps.

Similarly, trumps must be beaten by higher trumps.

So, perhaps I should first handle the non-trump suits.

For each non-trump suit, sort the cards by rank.

Then, for each card except the highest one, pair it with a higher card in the same suit.

If there are cards that don't have a higher card in the suit, they must be beaten by trumps.

So, I need to have enough trumps to beat those cards.

Similarly, trumps need to be paired with higher trumps.

So, I need to make sure that for each trump card, there's a higher trump to beat it, except for the highest trump, which doesn't need to be beaten.

Wait, no. In each round, one card is played by the first player, and the second player beats it.

So, trumps can be used to beat non-trump cards or other trumps that are lower.

But, trumps must be beaten only by higher trumps.

So, in the pairing, if a trump is played, it must be beaten by a higher trump.

Hence, I need to have enough higher trumps to beat the lower trumps.

Also, for non-trump cards, I need to have either higher non-trump cards in the same suit or trumps to beat them.

So, I need to ensure that the number of trumps is at least the number of non-trump cards that don't have a higher non-trump card in their suit.

Additionally, the trumps need to be arranged such that they can beat each other appropriately.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I need to parse the input and separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

Then, for non-trumps, group them by suit and sort them by rank.

For trumps, sort them by rank.

Define a way to pair the cards such that in each pair, the second card beats the first one according to the rules.

I need to make sure that all pairs are valid.

One way to approach this is to first pair the non-trump cards within their suits as much as possible, and then use trumps to beat any remaining non-trump cards that can't be beaten within their suit.

Then, pair the trumps among themselves appropriately.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Separate cards into trumps and non-trumps.

2. For non-trumps, group by suit.

3. For each non-trump suit group:

a. Sort the cards by rank.

b. Pair the lowest card with the next higher card in the suit.

c. Repeat until all but one card in the suit are paired.

d. The remaining highest card in the suit cannot be beaten within the suit, so it must be beaten by a trump.

4. Collect all the trumps.

5. Sort the trumps by rank.

6. Pair the lowest trump with the next higher trump.

7. Repeat until all but one trump is paired.

8. The remaining highest trump does not need to be beaten.

9. Now, for each suit group, the highest card in the suit that couldn't be paired within the suit needs to be beaten by a trump.

10. Assign a trump to beat each such non-trump card.

11. Ensure that there are enough trumps to beat all such non-trump cards.

12. Also, ensure that the trumps assigned to beat non-trump cards are higher than the non-trump cards.

Wait, but trumps can beat any non-trump cards, regardless of rank.

So, any trump can beat any non-trump card.

Hence, I just need to have enough trumps to beat the non-trump cards that don't have a higher non-trump card in their suit.

So, the number of such non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trumps is equal to the number of suits that have at least one card, minus the number of suits that have only one card.

Wait, no.

Actually, for each suit, if there is more than one card in the suit, then only the highest card doesn't need to be beaten within the suit; the rest can be paired within the suit.

But, if a suit has only one card, then that card must be beaten by a trump.

Hence, the number of non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trumps is equal to the number of suits that have at least one card minus the number of suits that have only one card.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each suit:

- If there is only one card in the suit, it must be beaten by a trump.

- If there are multiple cards in the suit, then all but the highest card can be paired within the suit, and the highest card can be beaten by a trump or, if there are enough trumps, it might not need to be beaten (but in this problem, every card is beaten by another card).

Wait, no. In each round, one card is played and beaten by another card.

So, all cards are involved in pairs where one beats the other.

Hence, for each suit:

- If there is only one card in the suit, it must be beaten by a trump.

- If there are multiple cards in the suit, then the highest card in the suit can be beaten either by a higher card in the same suit (if exists) or by a trump.

But in our earlier steps, for each suit, all but the highest card are paired within the suit, and the highest card is to be beaten by a trump.

Wait, no. If a suit has multiple cards, say three cards: '2D', '3D', '4D'.

- Pair '2D' with '3D'.

- Pair '4D' with a trump.

Or, pair '2D' with '3D', and '4D' with a higher trump.

But actually, in this case, '4D' doesn't need to be beaten by a higher trump necessarily; it can be beaten by any trump since it's a non-trump card.

Wait, no. '4D' is a non-trump card, so it can be beaten either by a higher non-trump card in the same suit or by any trump.

But in this case, there is no higher non-trump card in the same suit, so it must be beaten by a trump.

Hence, for each suit that has at least one card, if there are multiple cards, pair the lower ones with higher ones within the suit, and the highest one must be beaten by a trump.

If there is only one card in the suit, it must be beaten by a trump.

Hence, the number of non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trumps is equal to the number of suits that have at least one card.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each suit that has at least one card, if there are multiple cards, only the highest one needs to be beaten by a trump.

If there is only one card in the suit, it needs to be beaten by a trump.

Hence, the total number of non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trumps is equal to the number of suits that have at least one card.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each suit that has at least one card, if there are multiple cards, then all but the highest one are paired within the suit, and the highest one needs to be beaten by a trump.

If there is only one card in the suit, it needs to be beaten by a trump.

Hence, for each suit that has at least one card, one card needs to be beaten by a trump.

Hence, the total number of non-trump cards that need to be beaten by trumps is equal to the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

Moreover, trumps need to be paired among themselves, with each lower trump being beaten by a higher one.

Hence, the number of trumps needed to beat non-trump cards is equal to the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

Then, the remaining trumps can be paired among themselves.

Hence, the total number of trumps should be at least the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

In this problem, there are four possible suits: C, D, H, S.

Given that, the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card can be up to four.

Hence, the number of trumps should be at least the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

Otherwise, it's impossible to pair all cards appropriately.

Moreover, after assigning trumps to beat the highest non-trump cards in each suit, the remaining trumps need to be paired among themselves, with each lower trump beaten by a higher one.

Hence, the number of trumps should be at least the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card, and the remaining trumps should be even, since they need to be paired among themselves.

Wait, no.

Wait, in total, there are 2n cards, so n pairs.

Each pair consists of one card being beaten and one beating it.

Hence, the total number of pairs is n.

Given that, the number of trumps needed to beat the highest non-trump cards in each suit is equal to the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

Then, the remaining trumps need to be paired among themselves, which requires that the number of remaining trumps is even, since each pair consists of one lower trump beaten by a higher one.

Hence, the total number of trumps should be at least the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card, and the remaining trumps after assigning to beat non-trump cards should be even.

Wait, no.

Actually, after assigning one trump to beat each highest non-trump card in each suit, the remaining trumps should be paired among themselves.

Hence, the number of remaining trumps should be even, because each pair consists of one lower trump beaten by a higher one.

Hence, the total number of trumps should be congruent to the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card modulo 2.

Wait, no.

Wait, the total number of trumps is t.

Number of trumps needed to beat non-trump suits is s, where s is the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

Then, t - s should be even, because they need to be paired among themselves.

Hence, t - s should be even.

Therefore, t and s should have the same parity.

Moreover, t should be at least s.

If these two conditions hold, then it's possible to pair the cards appropriately.

Hence, in the algorithm, I need to:

1. Separate cards into trumps and non-trumps.

2. Group non-trumps by suit.

3. For each suit group:

a. Sort the cards by rank.

b. Pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on, until only the highest card remains.

c. The highest card in each suit group needs to be beaten by a trump.

4. Count the number of suit groups, which is the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card.

5. Let s be the number of such suit groups.

6. Let t be the number of trumps.

7. Check if t >= s and (t - s) is even.

a. If not, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

b. Else, proceed to pair the cards.

8. Assign one trump to beat each highest non-trump card in each suit group.

9. Pair the remaining trumps among themselves, with lower trumps being beaten by higher ones.

10. Output the pairs accordingly.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Parse the input.

- Separate trumps and non-trumps.

- Group non-trumps by suit.

- Sort each group by rank.

- Pair within suits as much as possible.

- Assign trumps to beat the highest non-trump cards in each suit.

- Pair the remaining trumps among themselves.

- Output the pairs.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases.

Let me think about how to implement the pairing.

First, define a function to sort the cards by rank.

Given that ranks are '2' to '9', I can map them to integers for sorting.

Define a rank order: '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.

So, I can map '2' to 2, '3' to 3, and so on.

Hence, I can sort the cards in each suit group based on their rank values.

Then, for each suit group, pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on.

The remaining highest card in each suit group needs to be beaten by a trump.

For trumps, sort them by rank and pair them accordingly.

Now, to assign trumps to beat the highest non-trump cards, I need to make sure that each assigned trump is higher than the non-trump card it beats.

Wait, no.

Actually, since trumps can beat any non-trump cards, regardless of rank, I don't need to worry about the rank of the trump compared to the non-trump card.

Any trump can beat any non-trump card.

Hence, I can assign any trump to beat any non-trump card.

Hence, I just need to have enough trumps to beat all the highest non-trump cards in each suit group.

Moreover, the remaining trumps need to be paired among themselves, with each lower trump beaten by a higher one.

Hence, I need to sort the remaining trumps and pair them accordingly.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

First, parse the input:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

a. Read n, the number of rounds.

b. Read the trump suit.

c. Read the 2n card descriptions.

Then, separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

Group non-trumps by suit.

For each suit group:

- Sort the cards by rank.

- Pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on.

- The highest card in the suit group needs to be beaten by a trump.

Collect all trumps.

Sort the trumps by rank.

Assign one trump to beat each highest non-trump card in each suit group.

Then, pair the remaining trumps among themselves, with lower trumps beaten by higher ones.

Finally, output the pairs.

Also, need to handle cases where it's impossible, i.e., when t < s or (t - s) is odd.

Now, think about the implementation in code.

I need to map ranks to integer values for sorting.

Define a rank order: '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.

Define a dictionary or a list to map ranks to their integer values.

Then, for sorting, use this mapping.

Implement the pairing logic as described.

Also, need to ensure that the output is in the correct format.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

There is a function func_1() that seems to handle each test case.

In func_1():

- input() is called, probably to read n, but it's not assigned to any variable. Maybe it's to consume the blank line or something, but in the code provided, it seems unnecessary.

- trump = input() reads the trump suit.

- trumps = [] is initialized to hold the ranks of trump cards.

- answers = [] to store the pairs.

- suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None} to handle non-trump suits.

Then, for each card in the input:

- card is split into rank and suit.

- If suit is trump, rank is added to trumps list.

- Else, if suits[suit] is not None, meaning there's already a card in that suit, it pairs the two cards and adds to answers.

- Else, stores the rank in suits[suit].

Then, for any suit that still has a card (suits[suit] is not None), it tries to pair it with a trump card.

- If trumps is not empty, it pairs the non-trump card with a trump card and adds to answers.

- Else, prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

Finally, it sorts the trumps and pairs them among themselves.

Then, prints the pairs.

Wait, but in the code, after handling the non-trump suits, it seems to pair the trumps among themselves.

But in the example provided, it seems to print the trumps pairs last.

But in the sample output, the trumps are paired among themselves only if needed.

Wait, perhaps I need to see the sample input and output to understand.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

8

3

S

3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

2

C

3S 5D 9S 6H

1

H

6C 5D

S

7S 3S

1

H

9S 9H

1

S

9S 9H

C

9D 8H

2

9C 9S 6H 8C

Sample Output:

3C 4C

6D 9S

3S 7S

IMPOSSIBLE

IMPOSSIBLE

3S 7S

9S 9H

9H 9S

IMPOSSIBLE

6H 9C

9S 8C

Looking at the first test case:

n=3, trump=S

Cards: 3C, 9S, 4C, 6D, 3S, 7S

Non-trump suits: C, D

- C: 3C, 4C → pair 3C 4C

- D: 6D → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: 9S, 3S, 7S

Assign one trump to beat 6D: say 3S beats 6D

Then, remaining trumps: 9S, 7S → pair 7S 9S

Hence, output:

3C 4C

6D 3S

7S 9S

But in the sample output, it's:

3C 4C

6D 9S

3S 7S

Which is also valid.

Hence, the assignment of which trump beats which non-trump card is flexible.

Now, in the code, it seems to pair non-trump suits first, then assign trumps to beat the remaining non-trump cards, and then pair the remaining trumps among themselves.

Seems logical.

But in the code, after handling the non-trump suits, it sorts the trumps and pairs them among themselves.

But in the sample output, it seems to pair the trumps with the non-trump cards first, then pair the trumps among themselves.

Wait, in the first test case, it pairs 3C 4C (non-trump suit C), then 6D 9S (non-trump suit D beaten by trump 9S), and then 3S 7S (trumps paired among themselves).

Hence, the code seems to handle it correctly.

Now, in the second test case:

n=2, trump=C

Cards: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H

Non-trump suits: D, H, S (since C is trump)

- D: 5D → needs to be beaten by a trump

- H: 6H → needs to be beaten by a trump

- S: 3S, 9S → pair 3S 9S

Trumps: none (since C is trump, but no C cards in the list)

Hence, no trumps to beat the non-trump suits D and H.

Hence, "IMPOSSIBLE", which matches the sample output.

Hence, the code should check if there are enough trumps to beat the non-trump suits that need a trump to beat them.

In this case, suits D and H need a trump, but there are no trumps available, hence "IMPOSSIBLE".

In the code, it seems to check if trumps are empty when trying to assign a trump to beat a non-trump suit, and if so, prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

Hence, it handles this case correctly.

Looking at the third test case:

n=1, trump=H

Cards: 6C, 5D

Non-trump suits: C, D

- C: 6C → needs to be beaten by a trump

- D: 5D → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: none (since H is trump, but no H cards in the list)

Hence, "IMPOSSIBLE", which matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=1, trump=S

Cards: 7S, 3S

Non-trump suits: none (since all cards are trumps)

Trumps: 7S, 3S → pair 3S 7S

Hence, output: 3S 7S, which matches the sample output.

Fifth test case:

n=1, trump=H

Cards: 9S, 9H

Non-trump suits: S

- S: 9S → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: 9H

Hence, pair 9S 9H

Hence, output: 9S 9H, which matches the sample output.

Sixth test case:

n=1, trump=S

Cards: 9S, 9H

Non-trump suits: H

- H: 9H → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: 9S

Hence, pair 9H 9S

Hence, output: 9H 9S, which matches the sample output.

Seventh test case:

n=1, trump=C

Cards: 9D, 8H

Non-trump suits: D, H

- D: 9D → needs to be beaten by a trump

- H: 8H → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: none (since C is trump, but no C cards in the list)

Hence, "IMPOSSIBLE", which matches the sample output.

Eighth test case:

n=2, trump=C

Cards: 9C, 9S, 6H, 8C

Non-trump suits: S, H

- S: 9S → needs to be beaten by a trump

- H: 6H → needs to be beaten by a trump

Trumps: 9C, 8C

Assign 8C to beat 6H, and 9C to beat 9S

Then, no trumps left to pair among themselves.

Hence, output:

6H 8C

9S 9C

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.

Now, looking back at the code:

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

}

There are a few issues here.

First, in the loop where it processes the non-trump suits:

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

This seems to pair the non-trump cards within their suits.

However, in the sample input and output, it seems that it's pairing the lower rank with the higher rank within the same suit.

But, according to the rules, the second card should beat the first one.

Hence, in the pairing, the higher rank should be the one that beats the lower one.

But in the code, it's sorting the ranks and joining them, but it's not ensuring that the second card beats the first one.

Wait, in the sample input and output, for non-trump suits, it's pairing the lower with the higher.

For example, 3C 4C, where 4C beats 3C.

Hence, in the code, by sorting [suits[suit], rank] and joining them, it's ensuring that the lower rank is first, and the higher rank is second.

Hence, it's correct in that sense.

Then, for the trumps, it's popping trumps to pair with the remaining non-trump suits.

Then, it sorts the remaining trumps and pairs them among themselves.

Seems logical.

But, in the code, there's a loop:

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

This assumes that there are even number of remaining trumps.

But earlier, it should have checked that t - s is even, where t is the number of trumps and s is the number of suits that need a trump.

Hence, perhaps it needs to check that before proceeding.

But in the code, it doesn't explicitly check that.

Wait, in the earlier steps, it assigns one trump to each suit that needs a trump, and then pairs the remaining trumps.

Hence, if t - s is odd, it won't be able to pair the remaining trumps.

Hence, it should check that t - s is even.

But in the code, it doesn't seem to check that explicitly.

However, in the sample inputs, it seems to handle cases where t - s is even or odd.

For example, in the first test case, t=3, s=2 (suits C and D need trumps), t - s=1, which is odd.

But in the code, it pairs the remaining trumps, assuming t - s is even.

Hence, there might be a mistake here.

Wait, in the first test case, t=3, s=2, t - s=1, which is odd, but in the sample output, it pairs all trumps.

Wait, in the first test case, trumps are 9S, 3S, 7S.

Assign one trump to beat 6D, say 3S.

Then, remaining trumps are 9S and 7S, which are paired together.

Hence, t - s =1, but in reality, t - s =1, which is odd, but in this case, t - s =3 -1=2, which is even.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first test case, n=3, total cards=6.

Trumps are 9S, 3S, 7S (3 trumps).

Suits that need trumps: C and D (s=2).

Hence, t=3, s=2, t - s=1, which is odd.

But in reality, after assigning one trump to beat the highest non-trump card in each suit, the remaining trumps should be paired among themselves.

In this case, t - s=1, which is odd, hence impossible.

But in the sample input and output, it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated s.

Wait, in the first test case, suits are C, D.

- Suit C: 3C, 4C → pair 3C 4C, so 4C beats 3C.

- Suit D: 6D → needs to be beaten by a trump.

Hence, s=1 (only suit D needs a trump).

Hence, t=3, s=1, t - s=2, which is even.

Hence, it's possible.

Hence, in the code, it should calculate s as the number of suit groups that have at least one card and need to be beaten by a trump.

In this case, s=1.

Hence, t - s=2, which is even.

Hence, it's possible.

Hence, the code seems to handle this correctly.

But in the code, it's not explicitly checking if t - s is even.

It just pairs the remaining trumps.

Hence, perhaps in the code, it's assuming that t - s is even, but it doesn't check it.

Hence, it might fail in cases where t - s is odd.

Hence, I need to modify the code to check if t - s is even.

Wait, in the code, it's pairing the remaining trumps two by two.

If t - s is odd, it will fail to pair them all.

Hence, it needs to ensure that t - s is even.

Hence, in the code, before pairing the remaining trumps, it should check if the number of remaining trumps is even.

If not, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

Otherwise, proceed to pair them.

Hence, I need to adjust the code accordingly.

Looking back at the code:

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

Hence, after assigning trumps to beat the highest non-trump cards in each suit, it sorts the remaining trumps and pairs them two by two.

But if the number of remaining trumps is odd, the while loop will fail when trying to pop the last trump.

Hence, need to ensure that the number of remaining trumps is even.

Hence, before the while loop, check if len(trumps) is even.

If not, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

Otherwise, proceed.

Hence, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Now, looking back at the initial code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

Hence, in this code, it's assuming that there are enough trumps to assign to the highest non-trump cards in each suit, and that the remaining trumps can be paired among themselves.

But it doesn't explicitly check if the number of remaining trumps is even.

Hence, it might fail in cases where t - s is odd.

Hence, I need to modify the code to check if t - s is even.

But in the code, it's not keeping track of s explicitly.

Hence, I need to calculate s as the number of suit groups that have at least one card and need to be beaten by a trump.

In the code, it's iterating through suits and assigning a trump to each suit that has a card and hasn't been paired within the suit.

Hence, I need to count the number of such suits and ensure that t >= s and (t - s) is even.

Hence, I need to modify the code to keep track of s and perform these checks.

Alternatively, I can count the number of trumps and the number of suits that have at least one non-trump card, and perform the checks accordingly.

Hence, perhaps I should adjust the code to:

- Collect all non-trump cards and group them by suit.

- For each suit group, pair the cards within the suit as much as possible, leaving the highest one to be beaten by a trump.

- Count the number of suit groups that have at least one card, which is s.

- Collect all trumps.

- Check if t >= s and (t - s) is even.

- If not, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

- Else, assign one trump to each suit group that needs it.

- Pair the remaining trumps among themselves.

- Output the pairs.

Hence, I need to adjust the code accordingly.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be attempting this, but it's not explicitly checking if (t - s) is even.

Hence, I need to add that check.

Moreover, in the code, it's using suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None} to keep track of the non-trump suits.

But in reality, for each suit, it should handle multiple cards appropriately.

In the current code, for each non-trump card, if there's already a card in that suit, it pairs them and adds to answers.

Else, it stores the rank in suits[suit].

Hence, for each suit, it pairs the cards in a way that the lower rank beats the higher one, which is incorrect.

According to the rules, the higher rank beats the lower one.

Hence, in the pairing, it should have the lower rank first and the higher rank second.

Hence, in the code, it's sorting [suits[suit], rank] and joining them.

Assuming that suits[suit] holds the lower rank and rank is the higher one, it's correct.

But need to ensure that.

Moreover, for the trumps, it's popping trumps to assign to the remaining non-trump suits.

But it's not ensuring that t - s is even.

Hence, I need to fix that.

Hence, perhaps I should modify the code to:

- Collect all non-trump cards and group
