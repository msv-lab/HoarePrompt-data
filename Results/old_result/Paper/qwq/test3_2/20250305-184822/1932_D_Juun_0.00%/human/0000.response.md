Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players playing a card game with a 32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. The suits are clubs (C), diamonds (D), hearts (H), and spades (S), and the ranks are from '2' to '9'. So, each card is represented by a two-character string, like '8H' for 8 of Hearts.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit. The rules for beating a card are a bit specific here. If both cards have the same suit, the one with the higher rank beats the other. But if a trump card is played, it can beat any non-trump card, regardless of its rank. Also, trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, in the game, there are n rounds, and in each round, the first player plays a card, and the second player has to beat it with one of their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile. Now, after n rounds, the discard pile has 2n cards, and these cards are shuffled. My task is to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds based on these discarded cards.

Given that, the input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get n (the number of rounds), the trump suit, and then a list of 2n unique cards.

My goal is to output n lines, each containing two cards: the first card played by the first player and the card used by the second player to beat it. If there's no possible way to reconstruct such a sequence, I should output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the constraints and the rules thoroughly.

- There are 32 cards in total: 4 suits, each with 8 ranks ('2' to '9').

- One suit is chosen as trump.

- In each round:

- Player 1 plays a card.

- Player 2 must play a card that beats it, based on the rules.

- Both cards are discarded.

- After n rounds, there are 2n cards in the discard pile, shuffled.

- I need to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds from these 2n cards.

Rules for beating a card:

1. If both cards are of the same suit:

- Higher rank beats lower rank.

2. If the first card is a trump card:

- It can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- It can only be beaten by a higher-ranked trump card.

3. If the first card is not a trump card:

- A trump card can beat it, regardless of rank.

Wait, point 2 seems a bit unclear. Let's make sure:

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- To beat a trump card, you need a higher-ranked trump card.

- Non-trump cards can only beat other non-trump cards of the same suit if they have a higher rank.

Got it.

Now, in the discard pile, I have 2n cards, shuffled. I need to pair them up in such a way that in each pair, the second card beats the first card, according to the rules above.

Moreover, I need to ensure that the sequence of pairs makes sense as a sequence of rounds. That is, in each round, Player 1 plays a card, and Player 2 plays a card that beats it, and this happens sequentially.

But since the cards are shuffled, I need to find any possible way to pair them up and order them into n rounds such that in each round, the second card beats the first card according to the rules.

Hmm.

First, I need to categorize the cards based on whether they are trumps or not.

Let's consider that.

Let me think about the properties required for a valid sequence.

For each pair (A, B), B must beat A, meaning:

- If A and B have the same suit (and neither is trump), then B has a higher rank than A.

- If A is not trump and B is trump, then B beats A regardless of rank.

- If both A and B are trump, then B has a higher rank than A.

- If A is trump and B is not trump, then B cannot beat A (unless B is a higher trump, but in this case, B is not trump), which violates the condition.

So, in this case, it's impossible for a non-trump card to beat a trump card.

Hence, in any pair (A, B), if A is trump, B must also be trump and of higher rank.

Otherwise, if A is not trump and B is trump, it's fine.

If both A and B are not trump and have the same suit, then B must have a higher rank than A.

Otherwise, it's invalid.

Wait, but according to the problem, trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, if A is trump, B must be trump and have a higher rank than A.

If A is not trump and B is trump, then B beats A regardless of rank.

If A and B are both not trump and have the same suit, then B beats A if B has a higher rank.

If A and B are both not trump and have different suits, then B cannot beat A.

Wait, but the problem says:

"Additionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank of the cards"

and

"trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher rank"

So, to summarize:

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- A non-trump card cannot beat a trump card.

- Between two trump cards, the higher-ranked one beats the lower-ranked one.

- Between two non-trump cards of the same suit, the higher-ranked one beats the lower-ranked one.

- A non-trump card cannot beat a non-trump card of a different suit.

Got it.

So, in the discard pile, I have 2n cards, shuffled.

I need to pair them up such that in each pair (A, B), B beats A according to the rules above.

Moreover, I need to order these pairs into a sequence of n rounds, where in each round, Player 1 plays A, and Player 2 plays B to beat it.

But since the cards are shuffled and I don't know which card was played when, I just need to find any possible way to pair them up and order them into n rounds, satisfying the beating condition.

Wait, but the problem says:

"Find any possible sequence of n rounds that might have been played in the game."

"So, you need to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds based on the discarded cards."

But it doesn't specify that the sequence has to respect any particular ordering beyond the beating condition.

So, perhaps I can treat it as just pairing up the cards such that in each pair, the second card beats the first, and then arrange these pairs in any order.

But perhaps I need to consider more.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile."

So, in each round, the two cards are discarded together.

But since the discard pile is shuffled, I don't know which two cards were discarded together in each round.

So, I need to find a way to group the 2n cards into n pairs, where in each pair (A, B), B beats A, according to the rules.

And then, for output, print n lines, each containing A and B, in that order.

If no such grouping is possible, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

I think that's the essence of the problem.

So, I need to find a way to pair up the cards such that in each pair, the second card beats the first card according to the rules.

And since the order of the rounds doesn't matter beyond the beating condition, I can arrange the pairs in any order for output.

So, my task is to group the 2n cards into n pairs, where in each pair, the second card beats the first.

If I can find such a grouping, I can output the pairs; otherwise, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Now, to implement this, I need to consider how to efficiently find such pairings.

First, I need to parse the input: t test cases, each with n, trump suit, and 2n cards.

I need to process each test case individually.

For each test case, I need to:

1. Identify which cards are trumps and which are not.

2. Sort the trumps and non-trumps appropriately.

3. Try to pair the non-trump cards first, based on their suits.

4. Use the trump cards to pair with remaining non-trump cards if necessary.

Wait, let's think carefully.

First, consider the non-trump cards.

For non-trump cards:

- They can only beat other non-trump cards of the same suit, if they have a higher rank.

- They can be beaten by any trump card.

So, for non-trump cards:

- If two cards of the same suit are present, I can pair them if one has a higher rank than the other.

- If a non-trump card cannot be paired with another non-trump card of the same suit, it must be paired with a trump card.

Similarly, trump cards:

- Can be paired with any non-trump card.

- Can only be paired with higher-ranked trump cards.

- Trump cards must be paired in a way that the second card is a higher-ranked trump card.

So, to summarize:

- For non-trump cards of the same suit, pair the lower-ranked with the higher-ranked.

- For non-trump cards that cannot be paired within their suit, pair them with trump cards.

- For trump cards, they can be paired with non-trump cards or with higher-ranked trump cards.

Moreover, I need to make sure that all pairings are valid and that each card is used exactly once.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think about an algorithm to achieve this.

One way is:

- Group the non-trump cards by suit.

- For each suit, sort the cards by rank.

- Pair the lowest-ranked card with the next higher-ranked card in the same suit.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the remaining card must be paired with a trump card.

- Then, use the trump cards to pair with any remaining non-trump cards.

- Finally, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

But I need to ensure that there are enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards.

Also, I need to make sure that the trump cards are paired in a way that the second card is of higher rank.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider an example from the problem:

Test case 1:

n = 3

trump = S

cards: 3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

So, trumps are cards with suit S: 3S, 7S, 9S

Non-trumps: 3C, 4C, 6D

Group non-trumps by suit:

C: 3C, 4C

D: 6D

For suit C, pair 3C with 4C, since 4C beats 3C.

For suit D, only one card: 6D, so it needs to be paired with a trump card.

Now, trumps: 3S, 7S, 9S

Pair 6D with the lowest trump, say 3S.

Now, remaining trumps: 7S, 9S

Pair 7S with 9S, since 9S beats 7S.

So, possible pairs:

3C 4C

6D 3S

7S 9S

This matches the first test case's output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 2

trump = C

cards: 3S 5D 9S 6H

Non-trumps: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H

Trumps: none? Wait, trump is C, so C cards are trumps, but none are present here.

Wait, cards are 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H.

None of them are C, so all are non-trumps.

Now, group by suit:

S: 3S, 9S

D: 5D

H: 6H

Pair 3S with 9S, since 9S beats 3S.

But what about 5D and 6H? They are different suits, so cannot pair within their suits.

But since there are no trump cards, I cannot pair them with trumps.

Hence, no solution, so "IMPOSSIBLE".

Which matches the second test case's output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 1

trump = H

cards: 6C 5D

Non-trumps: 6C, 5D

Trumps: none

Cannot pair them within their suits, as they are different suits.

No trump cards to pair with, so "IMPOSSIBLE".

Good.

Next test case:

n = 1

trump = S

cards: 7S 3S

Trumps: 7S, 3S

Non-trumps: none

Pair 3S with 7S, since 7S beats 3S.

Output: 3S 7S

Good.

Another test case:

n = 1

trump = H

cards: 9S 9H

Non-trumps: 9S

Trumps: 9H

Pair 9S (non-trump) with 9H (trump), since trump can beat non-trump.

Output: 9S 9H

Good.

Another test case:

n = 1

trump = S

cards: 9S 9H

Non-trumps: 9H

Trumps: 9S

Pair 9H (non-trump) with 9S (trump).

Output: 9H 9S

Wait, but according to the rules, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, so 9S can beat 9H.

But in this pairing, 9H is paired with 9S, which would mean 9S beats 9H, which is correct.

But in the sample output, it shows:

3S 7S

9S 9H

9H 9S

Wait, for n=1, with cards 9S 9H and trump S, it outputs 3S 7S, which is from a previous test case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output.

Wait, looking back:

Test case 5:

1

H

9S 9H

Output:

3S 7S

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the sample output.

Moving on.

Another test case:

n = 1

trump = C

cards: 9D 8H

Non-trumps: 9D, 8H

Trumps: none

Cannot pair within suits, no trumps to pair with, so "IMPOSSIBLE".

Good.

Last test case:

n = 2

trump = C

cards: 9C 9S 6H 8C

Trumps: 9C, 8C

Non-trumps: 9S, 6H

Pair 6H with 8C (trump beats non-trump)

Pair 9S with 9C (trump beats non-trump)

Wait, but 9C is already used to pair with 6H.

Alternatively, pair 6H with 8C, and then pair 9S with 9C.

But 9C is already used.

Wait, so perhaps it's impossible.

But the sample output is:

6H 9C

9S 8C

Wait, but 9S is a non-trump, and 8C is a trump, so 8C can beat 9S.

But earlier, 9C was paired with 6H.

Wait, but 9C is higher than 8C, so perhaps that's allowed.

Wait, no: 9C is higher than 8C, so 9C can beat 8C, but in the output, it's 9S 8C, which is incorrect because 8C should beat 9S.

Wait, no: according to the rules, trump can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

So, 8C can beat 9S, since 8C is trump and 9S is not.

So, that's valid.

Then, 6H is paired with 9C.

Again, 9C is trump, so it can beat 6H.

So, both pairs are valid.

Hence, the output is:

6H 9C

9S 8C

Good.

So, from these examples, I can see that the algorithm should:

- Group non-trump cards by suit.

- For each suit, sort the cards by rank and pair the lowest with the next higher.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the remaining card needs to be paired with a trump card.

- Then, pair the remaining non-trump cards with trump cards.

- Finally, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

I need to implement this logic carefully.

I also need to ensure that there are enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards.

Moreover, when pairing trump cards among themselves, I need to make sure that the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Ranks are from '2' to '9', so I can map them to numerical values 2 to 9.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

First, read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the trump suit.

- Read the list of 2n cards.

Then, separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

For non-trumps, group them by suit.

For each suit, sort the cards by rank and try to pair them.

If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the remaining card will be paired with a trump card.

Then, use the trump cards to pair with these remaining non-trump cards.

Finally, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

If at any point it's not possible to pair the cards according to the rules, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Otherwise, output the pairs.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Map the ranks to numerical values for comparison.

- Group non-trump cards by suit.

- Sort the cards in each suit group by rank.

- Pair them accordingly.

- Manage the trump cards separately.

- Ensure that all pairings are valid.

Let me think about how to handle the pairing of trump cards.

Suppose I have multiple trump cards left after pairing some with non-trump cards.

I need to pair them such that in each pair, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

To do this efficiently, I can sort the trump cards by rank and pair the lowest with the next higher, and so on.

For example, if I have trump cards with ranks 3, 5, 7, 9, I can pair 3 with 5, and 7 with 9.

This ensures that in each pair, the second card beats the first.

Now, regarding the non-trump cards:

- For each suit, sort the cards by rank and pair the lowest with the next higher.

- If there's an odd-numbered card, pair it with a trump card.

- Ensure that the trump cards are used only once.

- If there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Also, need to make sure that trump cards are only paired with non-trump cards or with higher-ranked trump cards.

Now, let's consider an example where there are multiple suits with odd numbers of cards.

For instance:

n = 4

trump = C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D

Assuming all cards are present, but let's say some are missing.

Wait, total cards should be 2n, which is 8 cards in this case.

Wait, n=4, so 8 cards.

Suppose:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 5C 2D 3D 4D 5D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C

Group non-trumps by suit D: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D

Pair them within the suit:

2D with 3D

4D with 5D

No remaining non-trump cards, so no need to use trump cards.

Then, the trump cards are left: 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C

Pair them as:

2C with 3C

4C with 5C

So, the pairs would be:

2D 3D

4D 5D

2C 3C

4C 5C

This seems valid.

Another example:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Group non-trumps by suit D: 2D, 3D, 4D

Pair 2D with 3D

Remaining 4D needs to be paired with a trump card.

So, pair 4D with 2C, since trump can beat any non-trump.

Then, remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C.

So, pairs:

2D 3D

4D 2C

3C 4C

This seems valid.

Another example where it's impossible:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 2D 3D 4D 5D

Non-trumps: all D

Group suit D: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D

Pair 2D with 3D

4D with 5D

No trumps to pair with, but all pairs are valid within the suit.

So, it should be possible.

Wait, but according to earlier test cases, if there are no trumps, and all non-trumps are of the same suit, as long as I can pair them within the suit, it's fine.

Wait, but in test case 2, n=2, trump=C, cards=3S 5D 9S 6H, which are all non-trumps, and cannot be paired within their suits, hence "IMPOSSIBLE".

But in this example, all cards are of suit D, so can be paired within the suit.

Hence, it's possible.

So, the key is:

- For non-trump cards of the same suit, pair them in ascending order.

- If there's an odd number, the remaining card needs to be paired with a trump card.

- Use trump cards to pair with these remaining non-trump cards.

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

- Ensure that there are enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards.

- Ensure that trump cards are paired with higher-ranked trump cards.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

First, map the ranks to numerical values:

rank_map = {'2':2, '3':3, '4':4, '5':5, '6':6, '7':7, '8':8, '9':9}

Then, for each test case:

- Read n, trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

- Separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

- For non-trumps, group them by suit.

- For each suit group:

- Sort the cards by rank.

- Pair them in ascending order.

- If there's an odd number, keep the remaining card to be paired with a trump card.

- Collect all remaining non-trump cards that need to be paired with trumps.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Pair the remaining non-trump cards with the lowest available trump cards.

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

- Collect all pairs and output them.

- If at any point there aren't enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Also, need to ensure that when pairing trump cards among themselves, there are enough higher-ranked trump cards available.

Let me think about potential issues.

Suppose I have multiple suits with remaining cards to be paired with trumps.

I need to make sure that there are enough trump cards to pair with all these remaining non-trump cards.

Also, when pairing trump cards among themselves, I need to have an even number of them left, otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, no, n can be up to 16, and 2n cards, so it's possible to have an odd number of trump cards left after pairing with non-trump cards.

Wait, but when pairing trump cards among themselves, I need to pair them in pairs, so the number of remaining trump cards must be even.

Hence, I need to ensure that the number of remaining trump cards after pairing with non-trump cards is even.

If it's odd, it's impossible to pair them all.

So, an additional condition: after pairing remaining non-trump cards with trump cards, the number of remaining trump cards must be even.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the earlier example where n=3, trump=C, cards=3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S, we had trumps: 3C, 4C, 7C, 9C.

Wait, no, in that example, trumps were 3S, 7S, 9S, and non-trumps were 3C, 4C, 6D.

Wait, no, in the first test case:

n=3

trump=S

cards: 3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

So, trumps: 9S, 3S, 7S

Non-trumps: 3C, 4C, 6D

Group non-trumps by suit:

C: 3C, 4C -> pair 3C with 4C

D: 6D -> remaining, pair with lowest trump, say 3S

Remaining trumps: 7S, 9S -> pair 7S with 9S

Seems valid.

Another example:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 3S 5D 9S 6H

Non-trumps: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H

Trumps: none

Cannot pair within suits, so need trumps, but no trumps available -> "IMPOSSIBLE"

Good.

Another example:

n=1

trump=H

cards: 9S 9H

Non-trumps: 9S

Trumps: 9H

Pair 9S with 9H

Output: 9S 9H

Good.

Another example:

n=1

trump=S

cards: 7S 3S

Trumps: 7S, 3S

Non-trumps: none

Pair 3S with 7S

Output: 3S 7S

Good.

Another example:

n=1

trump=C

cards: 9D 8H

Non-trumps: 9D, 8H

Trumps: none

Cannot pair within suits, no trumps -> "IMPOSSIBLE"

Good.

Another example:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 9C 9S 6H 8C

Trumps: 9C, 8C

Non-trumps: 9S, 6H

Pair 6H with 8C

Pair 9S with 9C

No remaining trumps -> valid

Output: 6H 8C

9S 9C

Good.

Now, think about a case where there are multiple suits with remaining cards.

For example:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 5C 2D 3D 4D 5D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

4D with 5D

No remaining non-trump cards.

Pair trumps:

2C with 3C

4C with 5C

Valid.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 4D

Pair 4D with 2C

Remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C

Valid.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 5D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 5D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 5D

Pair 5D with 2C

Remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C

Valid.

Another case:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

No remaining non-trump cards.

Pair trumps:

2C with 3C

Valid.

Another case:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair 2D with 2C

Pair 4D with 3C

But 3C is lower than 4D? Wait, no.

Wait, trump can beat any non-trump, regardless of rank.

So, 2C can beat 2D, and 3C can beat 4D.

So, it's valid.

Output: 2D 2C

4D 3C

Good.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 4D

Pair 4D with 2C

Remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C

Valid.

Another case:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

No remaining non-trump cards.

Pair trumps:

2C with 3C

Valid.

Another case:

n=2

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair 2D with 2C

Pair 4D with 3C

Valid.

Another case:

n=1

trump=C

cards: 2C 3D

Non-trumps: 3D

Trumps: 2C

Pair 3D with 2C

Valid.

Another case:

n=1

trump=C

cards: 3D 2H

Non-trumps: 3D, 2H

Trumps: none

Cannot pair within suits, no trumps -> "IMPOSSIBLE"

Good.

Now, think about a case where there are multiple suits with odd numbers of cards.

For example:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 5C 2D 3D 4D 5D 2H 3H 4H 5H

Wait, n=4, so 8 cards, but this has 12 cards. Ignore.

Another example:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 5D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 5D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 5D

Pair 5D with 2C

Remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C

Valid.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 4D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D

Trumps: 2C, 3C, 4C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 4D

Pair 4D with 2C

Remaining trumps: 3C, 4C

Pair 3C with 4C

Valid.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 4C 2D 3D 4D

Same as above.

Good.

Now, think about a case where there are not enough trumps.

For example:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

Remaining: 4D, 5D

Need to pair both with trumps, but only have 2 trumps.

But 2 trumps are available, so pair 4D with 2C, 5D with 3C.

No remaining trumps, so valid.

Output: 2D 3D

4D 2C

5D 3C

Good.

Another case:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D

Same as above.

Good.

Now, think about a case where after pairing within suits, there are remaining non-trump cards, but not enough trumps.

For example:

n=3

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D

Wait, n=3, but 8 cards, which is more than 2n (2*3=6). Ignore.

Another example:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D

Trumps: 2C, 3C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

4D with 5D

Remaining: 6D, 7D

Need to pair with trumps, but only have 2 trumps.

But 2 trumps can pair with 2 remaining non-trumps, so:

Pair 6D with 2C

7D with 3C

No remaining trumps, so valid.

Output: 2D 3D

4D 5D

6D 2C

7D 3C

Good.

Another case:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D

Same as above.

Good.

Now, think about a case where after pairing within suits, there are remaining non-trump cards, but not enough trumps.

For example:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 3C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D

Same as above, with enough trumps.

Another case:

n=4

trump=C

cards: 2C 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D

Non-trumps: 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D

Trumps: 2C

Pair within suits:

2D with 3D

4D with 5D

Remaining: 6D, 7D, 8D

Only one trump card available: 2C

Cannot pair all remaining non-trump cards with trumps -> "IMPOSSIBLE"

Yes, in this case, it's impossible.

Hence, I need to ensure that the number of remaining non-trump cards is less than or equal to the number of trump cards available.

Moreover, after pairing the remaining non-trump cards with trump cards, the remaining trump cards must be even, as they need to be paired among themselves.

So, in the earlier case, if after pairing remaining non-trump cards with trump cards, there's an odd number of trump cards left, it's impossible.

Wait, no, after pairing remaining non-trump cards with trump cards, the remaining trump cards should be paired with each other in pairs, so their number must be even.

Hence, the total number of trump cards must be >= the number of remaining non-trump cards, and the remaining trump cards after these pairings must be even.

Hence, number of trump cards >= number of remaining non-trump cards, and (number of trump cards - number of remaining non-trump cards) is even.

This ensures that the remaining trump cards can be paired among themselves.

So, in implementation, I need to check this condition.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

For each test case:

- Read n, trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

- Separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

- For non-trumps, group them by suit.

- For each suit group:

- Sort the cards by rank.

- Pair them in ascending order.

- Collect the pairs.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be paired with trumps.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Pair the remaining non-trump cards with the lowest available trump cards.

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

- Collect all pairs and output them.

- If at any point there aren't enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, or if the remaining trump cards are odd, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Also, need to ensure that when pairing trump cards among themselves, they are paired such that the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Now, implement this logic carefully.

Edge cases to consider:

- All cards are trumps.

- All cards are non-trumps of the same suit.

- All cards are non-trumps of different suits.

- Mix of trumps and non-trumps.

- Cases where the number of trump cards is just enough to pair with remaining non-trump cards.

- Cases where there are extra trump cards that need to be paired among themselves.

- Cases where there are odd numbers of cards in some suits.

- Cases where there are not enough trump cards to pair with remaining non-trump cards.

- Cases where after pairing with remaining non-trump cards, the remaining trump cards are odd.

Now, think about how to implement the pairing of trump cards among themselves.

Sort the trump cards by rank, and pair them in ascending order: lowest with the next higher, and so on.

This ensures that in each pair, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Now, implement this step-by-step.

First, define a function to map ranks to numerical values.

rank_map = {'2':2, '3':3, '4':4, '5':5, '6':6, '7':7, '8':8, '9':9}

Then, for each test case:

- Read n, trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

- Separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

- For non-trumps, group them by suit.

- For each suit group:

- Sort the cards by rank using rank_map.

- Pair them in ascending order.

- Collect the pairs.

- Collect the remaining non-trump cards that need to be paired with trumps.

- Sort the trump cards by rank.

- Pair the remaining non-trump cards with the lowest available trump cards.

- Then, pair the remaining trump cards with higher-ranked trump cards.

- If at any point it's not possible, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

- Otherwise, output the pairs.

Now, think about data structures to use.

- Use dictionaries to group non-trump cards by suit.

- Use lists to hold the trump cards.

- Sort lists as needed.

Implementing this carefully should solve the problem.

Now, look back at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the provided code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

Let's analyze this code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases and loops through each one, calling func_1() for each.

In func_1():

- Read input() for n, but it's not assigned to any variable. Probably, it's to consume the line.

- Read the trump suit.

- Initialize trumps as an empty list.

- Initialize answers as an empty list.

- Initialize suits as a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', all set to None.

- Loop through each card in the input().split():

- Split the card into rank and suit.

- If suit == trump, append rank to trumps.

- Else, if suits[suit] is not None, meaning there's already a card in this suit, append a pair to answers, sorted by rank, and set suits[suit] to None.

- Else, set suits[suit] to rank.

- After processing all cards, loop through suits dictionary:

- If a suit has a rank and it's not None, meaning there's an odd number of cards in that suit, and trumps are not empty, append a pair to answers: the non-trump card with the last trump card.

- If trumps are empty, print "IMPOSSIBLE" and return.

- Then, sort the remaining trumps.

- While trumps are not empty, print pairs of trumps, popping two at a time.

- Finally, print all answers.

Let's see if this implements the required logic.

First, it groups non-trump cards by suit.

For each suit, it pairs them in ascending order, which is correct.

For remaining non-trump cards with odd counts, it pairs them with trump cards, which is correct.

It ensures that there are enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards.

After pairing, it pairs the remaining trump cards with each other, which is correct.

Seems correct.

But let's verify with some test cases.

Take test case 1:

n=3

trump=S

cards: 3
