Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to think about how XOR and OR operations relate here. XOR gives me the bits where the two numbers differ, while OR gives me the bits that are set in either of the numbers.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j, which means I want p_i and p_j to differ in as many high-order bits as possible.

But how can I use the queries to find such a pair?

Let me consider the properties of OR and XOR.

If I have p_a OR p_b and p_c OR p_d, and I can compare them, maybe I can gather information about the magnitudes of p_a, p_b, p_c, and p_d.

Wait, but OR is not directly telling me about the magnitudes, because OR can be large even if one of the numbers is large.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation using these queries.

But the problem is to maximize XOR, not to find the maximum or minimum.

Let me think differently.

Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, all values are unique.

If I can sort the permutation or at least partially sort it, maybe I can find the pair with the maximum XOR.

But sorting would take too many queries if done naively.

Wait, but I have a limit of 3n queries, which is linear in n, so I need an efficient way.

Maybe I can find the maximum value in the permutation first.

Because the maximum XOR could be between the maximum and some other value.

But is that always the case?

Let me take an example.

Suppose n=4, and p=[0,1,2,3].

The XOR pairs are:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 3 = 3

1 XOR 2 = 3

1 XOR 3 = 2

2 XOR 3 = 1

So the maximum is 3, achieved by multiple pairs.

Another example: n=3, p=[0,2,1]

XOR pairs:

0 XOR 2 = 2

0 XOR 1 = 1

2 XOR 1 = 3

So maximum is 3.

Wait, in this case, it's between 2 and 1.

So it's not always between the maximum and another element.

In fact, in this case, it's between the second maximum and another element.

Hmm.

Wait, in binary:

2 is 10

1 is 01

XOR is 11, which is 3.

So, perhaps I need to look for elements that differ in as many bits as possible.

To maximize XOR, I want the bits to be different as much as possible.

So, perhaps finding the two most different numbers in terms of bit patterns.

But how to find that using the given queries?

Each query allows me to compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the bit patterns of p_i.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can try to find the position of the highest set bit in the permutation.

Because the maximum XOR would likely involve differing in that high bit.

Wait, but in a permutation of 0 to n-1, the highest set bit is determined by n.

For example, if n=4, numbers from 0 to 3: binary 00, 01, 10, 11.

The highest bit is 2 (10 in binary).

So, in this case, the maximum XOR would be between 10 and 01, which is 11, which is 3.

Similarly, for n=5 to 7, the highest bit is still 2, unless n reaches 8, where the highest bit is 3.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^4, so the numbers can have up to 14 bits (since 2^13=8192).

So, perhaps I can consider the bits from highest to lowest and try to maximize the XOR by making sure that the bits differ as much as possible.

But how to do that using the queries?

Alternatively, maybe I can find the maximum and second maximum values in the permutation, and return their indices.

But is that always correct?

In the earlier example, n=3, p=[0,2,1], the maximum is 2, and the second maximum is 1, and their XOR is 3, which is indeed the maximum.

Another example, n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], maximum is 3, second is 2, XOR is 1, but we have pairs with XOR 3.

So, in this case, it's not sufficient to just take maximum and second maximum.

Hmm.

So, perhaps I need to consider more than just the two largest numbers.

Maybe I need to find the two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns.

But how to do that using the queries?

Let me consider the properties of XOR.

XOR is maximized when the bits are different.

So, for each bit position, if the bits are different, it contributes to the XOR.

So, starting from the most significant bit, I want the bits to be different.

So, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their highest set bit.

For example, in n=4, numbers 0-3:

- 0: 00

- 1: 01

- 2: 10

- 3: 11

Here, numbers 2 and 3 have the highest bit set to 1, while 0 and 1 have it set to 0.

So, perhaps I can divide the numbers into groups based on the highest bit.

Then, the maximum XOR would be between groups that have different highest bits.

Wait, but in n=4, the maximum XOR is between 2 (10) and 1 (01), which are 11 (3), or between 3 (11) and 0 (00), which is also 11 (3).

So, in this case, it's between groups with different highest bits.

But, in n=3, p=[0,2,1], the maximum XOR is between 2 (10) and 1 (01), which have different highest bits.

Similarly, in n=2, p=[0,1], XOR is 1, which is maximum possible.

Wait, but in n=2, p=[0,1], XOR is 1, which is less than if n=4, where XOR can be 3.

So, it depends on n.

Wait, but n is given for each test case.

I need to maximize p_i XOR p_j for each test case separately.

Wait, but n varies between test cases, so I need a general approach.

Maybe I can find the position of the highest set bit in n-1, and work from there.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

The problem allows up to 3n queries, which is linear in n, so I need an efficient approach.

Perhaps I can find the maximum value in the permutation first, and then find the value that gives the maximum XOR with it.

But as seen in the earlier example, that might not always give the maximum XOR.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the two values that have the most differing bits.

But how to do that using the queries?

Wait, maybe I can sort the permutation using the queries, or at least partially sort it.

But sorting would take O(n log n) comparisons, which would be within 3n for small n, but for n=10^4, it's too slow.

Wait, but 3n is 30,000 queries, which should be sufficient.

Is there a way to find the maximum XOR using these queries efficiently?

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, there's a function func() that handles multiple test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, then proceeds with queries.

First, it initializes mak to 0.

Then, it loops from i=1 to n-1, and for each i, it asks a query comparing (p_mak | p_mak) with (p_i | p_i).

It compares p_mak OR p_mak with p_i OR p_i.

But p_mak OR p_mak is just p_mak, since p_mak | p_mak = p_mak.

Similarly, p_i | p_i = p_i.

So, it's effectively comparing p_mak with p_i.

Based on the comparison, if p_mak < p_i, it sets mak to i.

So, this loop is trying to find the index mak that has the maximum p_mak.

Because it's comparing p_mak with p_i directly, and updating mak if p_i is greater.

This seems like a way to find the index of the maximum value in the permutation using n-1 queries.

That makes sense.

Then, it sets mak2 to mak, which is the index of the maximum value.

Next, it initializes pans as an empty list.

Then, it loops through i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it asks a query comparing (p_mak | p_mak2) with (p_i | p_mak2).

Wait, p_mak is the index of the maximum value, and p_mak2 is also the same index initially.

Wait, actually, mak and mak2 are both set to the index of the maximum value.

So, p_mak and p_mak2 are the same value.

So, (p_mak | p_mak2) is p_mak | p_mak, which is p_mak.

And (p_i | p_mak2) is p_i | p_mak.

So, it's comparing p_mak with p_i | p_mak.

But p_i | p_mak is at least p_mak, since p_mak is already included in the OR.

So, if p_i has any bits set that p_mak doesn't have, then p_i | p_mak would be greater than p_mak.

But p_mak is the maximum value, so p_i | p_mak is either equal to p_mak or greater than p_mak.

Wait, but p_mak is the maximum value, so p_i | p_mak cannot be greater than p_mak, because p_mak already has all its bits set.

Wait, actually, p_i | p_mak can only be equal to p_mak or greater than p_mak if p_i has some bits set that p_mak doesn't have, but since p_mak is the maximum, no p_i can have a bit set that p_mak doesn't have.

Wait, no, p_mak is the maximum value, so for any p_i, p_i | p_mak is equal to p_mak.

Because p_mak has all the bits set that any other p_i has.

Wait, is that true?

Actually, no.

Consider p_mak = 7 (111 in binary), and p_i = 3 (011 in binary).

Then p_i | p_mak = 7, which is equal to p_mak.

Another example, p_mak = 7, p_i = 5 (101 in binary), p_i | p_mak = 7.

So, in this case, p_i | p_mak is equal to p_mak.

But if p_i has a bit set that p_mak doesn't have, then p_i | p_mak would be greater than p_mak.

Wait, but p_mak is the maximum, so no p_i should have a bit set that p_mak doesn't have.

Wait, is that necessarily true?

Actually, no.

Consider n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], p_mak=3 (11 in binary).

Then, for p_i=1 (01), p_i | p_mak = 3.

For p_i=2 (10), p_i | p_mak = 3.

For p_i=3 (11), p_i | p_mak = 3.

So, in this case, p_i | p_mak is always equal to p_mak.

But if n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], p_mak=4 (100 in binary).

Then, p_i=1 (001), p_i | p_mak = 5 (101), which is greater than p_mak=4.

Wait, 1 | 4 = 5, which is greater than 4.

Wait, but p_mak=4 is not the maximum in this case.

Wait, no, p_mak is the index of the maximum value, which is 4 (100 in binary).

Wait, but in this permutation, 5 is not present because n=5, so p_i values are 0 to 4.

Wait, 4 is 100, 3 is 011, 2 is 010, 1 is 001, 0 is 000.

So, p_i | p_mak:

- 0 | 4 = 4

- 1 | 4 = 5

- 2 | 4 = 6

- 3 | 4 = 7

- 4 | 4 = 4

So, in this case, p_i | p_mak can be greater than p_mak.

But p_mak is supposed to be the index of the maximum p_i.

Wait, but in this case, p_mak=4 is the maximum p_i=4.

But p_i | p_mak can be greater than p_mak, as seen with p_i=3, p_i | p_mak = 7 > 4.

Wait, but p_mak is supposed to be the index of the maximum p_i.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the permutation, p_mak is the index with the maximum p_i.

But in this example, p_mak=4, p_mak=4 (100), and p_i=3, p_i=3 (011), p_i | p_mak = 7, which is greater than p_mak=4.

But p_mak is supposed to be the maximum p_i, but in this case, p_i | p_mak can be greater than p_mak.

Wait, but that contradicts the assumption that p_mak is the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps in the permutation, p_mak is the index with the maximum p_i, but p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak if p_i has some bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

But in a permutation of 0 to n-1, is it possible for p_i | p_mak to be larger than p_mak?

Wait, in the earlier example with n=5, p_mak=4 (100), p_i=3 (011), p_i | p_mak = 111 (7), which is larger than p_mak=4.

So, in this case, p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak.

But p_mak is supposed to be the maximum p_i.

Wait, but in this permutation, p_mak=4 is the maximum p_i=4, but p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak.

So, perhaps p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak in some cases.

Wait, but p_mak is the maximum p_i, so perhaps in the permutation, there exists p_i such that p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

But in that case, p_i | p_mak is not part of the permutation, since the permutation contains only numbers from 0 to n-1.

Wait, but p_i | p_mak might be larger than n-1, but that's okay, because we're just comparing the values.

So, in the reference solution, in this loop:

for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

sys.stdout.flush()

s = str(input())

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

It's comparing (p_mak | p_mak2) with (p_i | p_mak2).

But p_mak and mak2 are the same initially, so p_mak | p_mak2 = p_mak | p_mak = p_mak.

And p_i | p_mak2 = p_i | p_mak.

So, it's comparing p_mak with p_i | p_mak.

If p_i | p_mak > p_mak, then s == '<', and it sets mak to i and pans = [i].

If p_i | p_mak == p_mak, then s == '=', and it appends i to pans.

So, in the end, pans contains all i where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

But in the earlier example, when p_mak=4 and p_i=3, p_i | p_mak=7 > p_mak=4, so s == '<', and mak is set to i=3, and pans=[3].

Then, for i=0, p_i=0 | 4 = 4 == p_mak=4, so s == '=', pans=[3,0].

For i=1, p_i=1 | 4 = 5 > 4, s == '<', mak=1, pans=[1].

For i=2, p_i=2 | 4 = 6 > 4, s == '<', mak=2, pans=[2].

For i=3, p_i=3 | 4 = 7 > 4, s == '<', mak=3, pans=[3].

So, in the end, pans=[3].

Wait, but in the earlier step, when i=1, pans was set to [1], then i=2, pans=[2], then i=3, pans=[3].

Wait, no, looking back at the code:

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

So, for each i, if p_i | p_mak > p_mak, it sets mak to i and resets pans to [i].

If p_i | p_mak == p_mak, it appends i to pans.

In the example with n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], p_mak=4.

For i=0, p_0 | p_mak = 0|4=4 == p_mak=4, so pans=[0].

For i=1, p_1 | p_mak =1|4=5 >4, so mak=1, pans=[1].

For i=2, p_2 | p_mak=2|4=6 >4, so mak=2, pans=[2].

For i=3, p_3 | p_mak=3|4=7>4, so mak=3, pans=[3].

For i=4, p_4 | p_mak=4|4=4==4, so pans=[3,4].

So, in the end, pans=[3,4].

Then, it seems that pans contains the indices where p_i | p_mak > p_mak, plus those where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Wait, but in the code, pans is reset to [i] whenever p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

Wait, no, looking back:

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

So, whenever p_i | p_mak > p_mak, it sets mak to i and sets pans to [i].

When p_i | p_mak == p_mak, it appends i to pans.

So, in the example above:

i=0: p_0 | p_mak=0|4=4==4, pans=[0]

i=1: p_1 | p_mak=1|4=5>4, mak=1, pans=[1]

i=2: p_2 | p_mak=2|4=6>4, mak=2, pans=[2]

i=3: p_3 | p_mak=3|4=7>4, mak=3, pans=[3]

i=4: p_4 | p_mak=4|4=4==4, pans=[3,4]

So, pans=[3,4]

Then, it seems that pans contains the indices where p_i | p_mak >= p_mak.

Wait, but mak is set to the last i where p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

In this case, mak=3.

Then, it seems that pans contains the indices where p_i | p_mak >= p_mak.

But p_i | p_mak >= p_mak always holds, since p_i | p_mak is at least p_mak.

Wait, no, in the earlier example, p_i | p_mak can be greater than p_mak.

But in general, p_i | p_mak >= p_mak only if p_i has some bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

Wait, no, p_i | p_mak >= p_mak always holds, because p_mak | p_i is at least p_mak.

Because p_mak | p_mak = p_mak, and p_i | p_mak is at least p_mak.

So, in this loop, pans ends up containing all indices where p_i | p_mak >= p_mak.

But p_i | p_mak >= p_mak always holds.

Wait, but in the code, pans is reset to [i] when p_i | p_mak > p_mak, and appends when p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Wait, but p_i | p_mak >= p_mak always holds, so pans will contain all indices.

Wait, but in the example above, pans=[3,4], which are the indices where p_i | p_mak > p_mak and where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Wait, p_i | p_mak > p_mak when p_i has some bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

But in the permutation, p_mak is the maximum, but p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak if p_i has some bits not in p_mak.

But in the permutation, p_mak is the maximum value, but p_i | p_mak can be larger than p_mak if p_i has some higher bits set.

Wait, but p_mak is the maximum value in the permutation, so no p_i should have a higher bit set than p_mak.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=5, p_mak=4 (100), p_i=3 (011), p_i | p_mak=7 (111), which is larger than p_mak=4.

So, in this case, p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

But p_mak is the maximum in the permutation, but p_i | p_mak is larger.

So, perhaps in the permutation, there can be p_i such that p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

Wait, but p_mak is the maximum p_i, so perhaps in the permutation, there are p_i's that when OR'ed with p_mak give a value larger than p_mak.

So, in this loop, pans contains indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Which are the indices where p_i has no bits set higher than p_mak.

But in the permutation, since p_mak is the maximum, p_i | p_mak >= p_mak always holds.

Wait, but p_i | p_mak == p_mak when p_i <= p_mak, and p_i | p_mak > p_mak when p_i has some bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

But in the permutation, p_mak is the maximum, so no p_i should have bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

Wait, but in the earlier example, p_i=3 | p_mak=4 gives 7, which is larger than p_mak=4.

So, in this case, p_i=3 has some bits set that p_mak=4 doesn't have.

Wait, p_mak=4 is 100, p_i=3 is 011, p_i | p_mak=111, which is larger than p_mak=100.

So, in this case, p_i has lower bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

So, in general, in a permutation, p_mak is the maximum value, but p_i can have some lower bits set that p_mak doesn't have.

So, in this loop, pans contains indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak, which are the indices where p_i <= p_mak.

Then, after this loop, mak is set to the last index where p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

In the example above, mak=3.

Then, it proceeds to find the maximum value in pans.

Which are the indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

In the example, pans=[3,4].

Wait, p_i | p_mak == p_mak for i=3 and i=4.

Wait, p_3=3 |4=7 !=4, so s == '>', so pans=[3]

p_4=4 |4=4 ==4, so pans=[3,4]

So, pans=[3,4]

Then, it tries to find the maximum value in pans by comparing p_pans[mak] with p_pans[i] for i in pans.

Wait, in the code:

mak = 0

for i in range(1, len(pans)):

print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])

sys.stdout.flush()

if str(input()) == '>':

mak = i

It's comparing p_pans[mak] with p_pans[i].

Since pans contains indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak, which are the indices where p_i <= p_mak.

So, in this loop, it's trying to find the maximum value among these p_i's.

In the example, pans=[3,4], p_pans[0]=3, p_pans[1]=4.

Comparing p_3=3 with p_4=4.

If p_3 < p_4, then set mak=1.

So, mak=1.

Then, it prints '! mak2 mak', which is '! 3 1'.

Wait, mak2=3, mak=1, so it's printing indices 3 and 1.

But in the permutation, p_3=3 and p_1=1, XOR is 2.

But the maximum XOR is between p_3=3 and p_2=2, which is 1.

Wait, no, p_3=3 and p_2=2, XOR is 1.

But p_3=3 and p_1=1, XOR is 2.

But the maximum XOR should be between p_3=3 and p_0=0, which is 3.

Wait, in this permutation, p=[0,1,2,3,4], the maximum XOR is between p_3=3 and p_0=0, which is 3.

But the code is outputting i=3 and j=1, which gives XOR=2.

So, it's incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the code.

Wait, in the code, it sets mak2=mak initially, which is the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, in the loop, it sets mak to the index where p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

In the example, mak=3.

Then, it finds the maximum among pans, which are indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

In this case, pans=[3,4], and p_4=4 > p_3=3, so mak=1.

Then, it prints '! mak2 mak', which is '! 3 1', meaning p_3 and p_1, which is 3 and 1, XOR=2.

But in reality, the maximum XOR is between p_3=3 and p_0=0, which is 3.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, mak2 is set to mak initially, which is the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, in the loop, mak is updated to the last index where p_i | p_mak > p_mak.

Then, pans contains indices where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Then, it finds the maximum among pans.

Finally, it prints '! mak2 mak', which should be the indices of the two values that maximize XOR.

But in this example, it's giving incorrect output.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Wait, in the example with n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], as in the sample input.

In that case, mak is set to 1, since p_1=3 is the maximum.

Then, mak2=1.

Then, loop through i=0 to 3:

i=0: p_0 | p_1 =0|3=3 == p_mak=3, pans=[0]

i=1: p_1 | p_1=3|3=3 == p_mak=3, pans=[0,1]

i=2: p_2 | p_1=1|3=3 == p_mak=3, pans=[0,1,2]

i=3: p_3 | p_1=2|3=3 == p_mak=3, pans=[0,1,2,3]

Then, mak=0.

Then, it compares p_pans[0]=0 with p_pans[1]=1, p_0=0 < p_1=1, so mak=1.

Then, compares p_pans[1]=1 with p_pans[2]=2, p_1=1 < p_2=2, so mak=2.

Then, compares p_pans[2]=2 with p_pans[3]=3, p_2=1 < p_3=2, so mak=3.

Then, prints '! 1 3', which is p_1=3 and p_3=2, XOR=3, which is correct.

So, in this case, it works.

But in the earlier example with n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], it outputs '! 3 1', which is p_3=3 and p_1=1, XOR=2, but the correct XOR is between p_3=3 and p_0=0, which is 3.

So, in this case, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what's wrong in the second case.

Wait, in the second case, n=2, p=[0,1], maximum is 1.

Then, mak=1.

Then, loop through i=0 and 1:

i=0: p_0 | p_1=0|1=1 == p_mak=1, pans=[0]

i=1: p_1 | p_1=1|1=1 == p_mak=1, pans=[0,1]

Then, mak=0.

Then, compare p_pans[0]=0 with p_pans[1]=1, p_0=0 < p_1=1, so mak=1.

Then, prints '! 1 1', which is p_1=1 and p_1=1, XOR=0, but the correct XOR is between p_0=0 and p_1=1, which is 1.

So, in this case, it's also incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=2, it just outputs '! 0 1'.

Wait, in the sample input, t=2.

First test case, n=4, and then n=2.

In the reference solution, for n=2, it would output '! 1 1', which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the logic better.

Wait, in the loop where it sets mak and pans, it's trying to group the indices based on whether p_i | p_mak > p_mak or == p_mak.

Then, it selects mak2 as the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, it finds the maximum among the group where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

Then, it outputs mak2 and mak.

In the first test case, n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], mak2=1 (p_1=3), pans=[0,1,2,3], mak=3.

Then, '! 1 3', which is p_1=3 and p_3=2, XOR=3, which is correct.

In the second test case, n=2, p=[0,1], mak2=1 (p_1=1), pans=[0,1], mak=1.

Then, '! 1 1', which is p_1=1 and p_1=1, XOR=0, but the correct is p_0=0 and p_1=1, XOR=1.

So, in this case, it's incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what the code is trying to achieve.

It seems that it's trying to find two values: one is the maximum p_i, and the other is the maximum among those p_i's where p_i | p_mak == p_mak.

But in the second test case, p_i | p_mak == p_mak for all i, since p_mak is the maximum.

So, pans would contain all indices, and it selects the maximum among them, which is p_1=1.

Then, it outputs '! 1 1', which is incorrect.

So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the two most significant different bits between any two numbers.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from highest to lowest, and try to maximize the XOR by choosing numbers that differ in as many high bits as possible.

But I need to implement this using the given queries.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the maximum XOR by finding the two numbers that have the highest set bit in different positions.

But in a permutation, the highest set bit might be the same for multiple numbers.

Wait, for example, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the highest set bit is 2 (10) for p=2 and p=3.

So, their XOR would be 11 (3).

Similarly, in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], the highest set bit for p=4 is 4 (100), and for p=3 is 2 (011), so their XOR would be 111 (7).

But in this case, p_i | p_j would be p_i | p_j.

Wait, but I need to maximize p_i XOR p_j.

I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two numbers that have the maximum possible XOR by finding the two numbers that differ in the most significant bit positions.

To do that, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their highest set bit.

Then, select one from each group to maximize XOR.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the permutation and select the last two elements.

But in the earlier example, that didn't work.

Wait, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], sorted is [0,1,2,3], last two are 2 and 3, XOR is 1.

But the maximum XOR is between 3 and 0, which is 3.

So, sorting doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the binary representations and try to maximize the differing bits.

But I need to do this using the queries provided.

Each query allows me to compare (p_a | p_b) with (p_c | p_d).

I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the p_i's.

This seems quite restrictive.

Perhaps I need to find a way to identify the positions of the highest set bits across different p_i's.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to maximize the XOR.

But I need to think about how to implement this with the given query types.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation and output their XOR.

But in the earlier example, that wouldn't work.

Wait, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], max=3, min=0, XOR=3, which is correct.

In n=3, p=[0,2,1], max=2, min=0, XOR=2, but the maximum XOR is between 2 and 1, which is 3.

So, it's not always correct.

So, that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to find two numbers that differ in as many bits as possible.

To maximize XOR, they should differ in all bits, but since it's a permutation, that might not be possible.

So, perhaps I need to find two numbers with the most differing high-order bits.

But how to do that using the queries?

This seems challenging.

Maybe I need to consider that in a permutation, each number is unique, and I can leverage that.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the maximum bitwise OR, and then select them.

But OR maximizes the set bits, while XOR maximizes the differing bits.

They are different.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the maximum sum.

But sum doesn't necessarily correlate with XOR.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the maximum XOR occurs between two numbers that have different highest set bits.

For example, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], p=2 (10) and p=3 (11) have the same highest set bit, but p=0 (00) and p=3 (11) have different highest set bits.

Their XOR is 3, which is the maximum.

Similarly, in n=3, p=2 (10) and p=1 (01) have different highest set bits, XOR=3.

So, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their highest set bit and select one from each group to maximize XOR.

But in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the groups would be:

- highest set bit 2: p=2, p=3

- highest set bit 1: p=1

- highest set bit 0: p=0

Then, selecting one from highest set bit 2 and highest set bit 0 gives maximum XOR.

So, perhaps I can find the highest set bit in n-1, then find the numbers with that set bit and those without, and select one from each.

But this might not always work.

Wait, in n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4], the highest set bit is 4 (100).

So, numbers with highest set bit 4: p=4

Numbers with highest set bit 2: p=2, p=3

Numbers with highest set bit 1: p=1

Numbers with highest set bit 0: p=0

So, selecting p=4 (100) and p=3 (011), XOR=111 (7), which is the maximum possible.

Similarly, p=4 (100) and p=1 (001), XOR=101 (5)

p=4 (100) and p=0 (000), XOR=100 (4)

p=3 (011) and p=0 (000), XOR=011 (3)

So, the maximum is between p=4 and p=3, which is 7.

So, in this case, selecting one from the highest set bit group and one from a lower set bit group gives the maximum XOR.

So, perhaps I can find the group with the highest set bit and another group with a lower set bit and select one from each.

But how to identify these groups using the queries?

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the highest to the lowest and try to maximize the XOR by choosing numbers that differ in those bits.

But again, implementing this with the given query types is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, maybe I should accept that the reference solution is incorrect and think of an alternative approach.

But considering time limits, perhaps I should accept that and move on.

So, in conclusion, the given program is incorrect, as it does not always output the correct pair of indices that maximize p_i XOR p_j.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
