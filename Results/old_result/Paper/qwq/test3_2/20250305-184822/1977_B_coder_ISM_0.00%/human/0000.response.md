Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer x, and I need to find an array of integers a_0 to a_{n-1} that satisfies certain conditions. The conditions are:

1. The array length n should be between 1 and 32.

2. Each element a_i in the array can only be 1, 0, or -1.

3. The sum of a_i multiplied by 2^i should equal x.

4. There shouldn't be any index i where both a_i and a_{i+1} are non-zero.

And it's guaranteed that such an array always exists for the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what this means. Essentially, I'm representing the number x in binary, but with some tweaks to satisfy the conditions, especially the fourth one about no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Let me think about the standard binary representation. In binary, each digit represents a power of 2, and the digits are either 0 or 1. So, for example, the number 5 is 101 in binary, which is 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5.

But in this problem, I can have -1 as well, and I have to ensure that no two consecutive digits are non-zero. That means if a_i is non-zero, a_{i+1} must be zero.

I need to find a way to represent x using these constraints.

Let me consider an example. Take x = 1. The simplest case.

Possible array: [1]. That satisfies all conditions: n=1, a_0=1, and the sum is 1*2^0=1. No consecutive non-zero elements since there's only one element.

Another example: x=2. In binary, it's 10, which is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. So, array [0,1]. This satisfies all conditions: n=2, elements are 0 and 1, sum is 0*1 + 1*2=2, and no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Wait, according to the problem, a_i can be -1 as well. So, is there another way to represent x=2? Maybe [1,-1,1]. Let's see: 1*2^0 + (-1)*2^1 + 1*2^2 = 1 - 2 + 4 = 3, which is not 2. So that doesn't work. Or [0,1], which works as above.

Hmm, seems like the standard binary representation works, but I need to make sure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

Wait, but in the standard binary representation, it's possible to have consecutive 1's. For example, x=3 is 11 in binary, which is 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 2 + 1 = 3. But this violates the condition that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

So, I need a different representation for x=3.

Let me think about using -1. If I use -1, I can maybe avoid having two consecutive 1's.

For x=3, if I use [1,1], that's invalid because of two consecutive 1's. Alternatively, maybe [1,-1,1]. Wait, earlier I tried that and got 1 - 2 + 4 = 3, which is correct, but the array length is 3, and I need to check if there are any two consecutive non-zero elements. Here, a0=1, a1=-1, a2=1. So, a0 and a1 are both non-zero and consecutive, which violates the condition.

So, that doesn't work. Another option could be [1,0,1]. Sum is 1*1 + 0*2 +1*4 = 1 + 0 + 4 = 5, which is not 3.

Hmm, not working.

Wait, maybe [0,-1,1]. That would be 0*1 + (-1)*2 +1*4 = 0 -2 +4 = 2, which is not 3.

Alternatively, [1,-1,0,1]. Sum is 1*1 + (-1)*2 +0*4 +1*8 =1 -2 +0 +8 =7, which is not 3.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the problem differently. Since a_i can be 1, 0, or -1, and no two consecutive a_i's can be non-zero, perhaps I can think of it in terms of choosing positions for 1 and -1 such that they are not adjacent.

Wait, but that might not cover all possibilities.

Let me look at the example in the problem. For x=14, the output is [0,-1,0,0,1], which corresponds to 0*1 + (-1)*2 +0*4 +0*8 +1*16 = 0 -2 +0 +0 +16 = 14. And no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Similarly, for x=15, the output is [-1,0,0,0,1], which is (-1)*1 +0*2 +0*4 +0*8 +1*16 = -1 +0 +0 +0 +16 = 15.

So, seems like it's possible to represent x using this scheme.

I need to find a general method to represent any x in this way.

Let me think about the standard binary representation and see how I can modify it to satisfy the condition of no two consecutive non-zero elements.

In standard binary, each bit is either 0 or 1, and they can be consecutive.

To avoid having two consecutive 1's, I can use the fact that 1*2^i + 1*2^{i+1} = 2^{i+1} + 2^i = 2^{i+1} + 2^i = 2^{i+1} + 2^i.

Wait, that's just the same.

Alternatively, I can think of borrowing from higher bits.

Wait, in binary, if I have two consecutive 1's, like 11, which is 3, I can represent it as 100 - 1, which is 4 -1 =3. So, in terms of a_i, that would be a_i=1, a_{i+1}=-1, a_{i+2}=1.

Wait, let's see: 1*2^{i} + (-1)*2^{i+1} +1*2^{i+2} = 2^i - 2^{i+1} + 2^{i+2} = 2^i (1 - 2 + 4) = 2^i *3 = 3*2^i.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right for representing 3.

Wait, for x=3, which is 11 in binary, I can represent it as 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 =2 +1=3.

But this violates the condition of having two consecutive non-zero elements.

Alternatively, I can represent it as 1*2^2 + (-1)*2^1 + 0*2^0 =4 -2 +0=2, which is not 3.

Not working.

Wait, maybe 1*2^2 + (-1)*2^0 =4 -1=3. That would be a_i=[-1,0,1], which is a0=-1, a1=0, a2=1. Check for consecutive non-zero elements: a0 and a1 are not both non-zero because a1=0. a1 and a2 are not both non-zero because a1=0. So, it's valid.

Yes, that works for x=3: [-1,0,1]. Sum is -1*1 +0*2 +1*4 = -1 +0 +4=3.

Great, so that's a valid representation.

How did I get there? I thought of representing 3 as 4 -1, which is 1*2^2 + (-1)*2^0.

So, in general, maybe I can represent x using higher powers and subtracting appropriate lower powers.

This seems similar to a signed binary representation or something like that.

Let me try to generalize this.

I can think of starting with the binary representation of x and then adjusting it to satisfy the no two consecutive non-zero elements condition.

Let's consider the binary representation from least significant bit to most significant bit.

I can iterate through the bits, and whenever I have two consecutive 1's, I can replace them by a higher 1 and adjust accordingly.

Wait, similar to carrying over in addition.

Let me try with x=3: binary 11.

I see two consecutive 1's. So, I can replace 11 by 100 -1, which is 4 -1=3.

So, in a_i, that would be a0=-1, a1=0, a2=1, which matches what I did earlier.

Another example: x=7, which is 111 in binary.

First, replace the last two 1's by 100 -1, so 110 -1 =1011 -1=1010.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Maybe a better way is to start from the least significant bit and process each bit, keeping track of carries or overlaps.

Let me try an algorithm:

1. Start with the binary representation of x.

2. Iterate through the bits from least significant to most significant.

3. If I find a '1', set a_i=1.

4. If the next bit is also '1', set a_i=1 and a_{i+1}=-1, and carry over to the next higher bit.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try with x=3 (11 in binary):

- Start with i=0: bit is 1, set a0=1.

- i=1: bit is 1, set a1=-1.

- No more bits.

- Sum: 1*1 + (-1)*2 =1 -2=-1, which is not 3.

Oops, that doesn't work.

Alternative approach: When I have two consecutive 1's, I can represent them as a higher 1 with a -1 at an earlier position.

Wait, like in x=3: 1*2^0 +1*2^1 =1 +2=3, but this has two consecutive 1's.

Alternatively, I can do 1*2^2 + (-1)*2^0 =4 -1=3.

So, to convert 11 to 100 -1.

Generalizing, whenever there are two consecutive 1's, I can add a 1 at the next higher bit and subtract 1 at an appropriate lower bit.

This seems similar to the process of creating a signed binary representation.

Let me look up if there's a standard way to represent numbers with digits 1,0,-1, with no two consecutive non-zero digits.

I recall something called the non-adjacent form (NAF) of binary representation, which is a way to represent integers in binary using digits 0, 1, and -1, with no two consecutive non-zero digits.

Yes, that seems to match exactly what's needed here.

In NAF, each integer has a unique representation, and it can be shown that such a representation always exists with certain properties.

So, perhaps I can implement the NAF representation for x.

Let me look up the algorithm for converting a binary number to its NAF form.

From what I found, the NAF representation can be obtained by the following algorithm:

1. Start from the least significant bit.

2. If a bit and its next higher bit are both 1, set the current a_i=-1 and carry over 1 to the next higher bit.

3. Otherwise, set a_i to the value of the current bit.

Wait, let's try this with x=3 (11 in binary):

- i=0: bit=1, i=1: bit=1.

- Since both are 1, set a0=-1, and carry over 1 to i=2.

- Set a1=1 (since carry over 1).

- No higher bits, so a2=1.

- So, a=[-1,1,1].

- Sum: (-1)*1 +1*2 +1*4 = -1 +2 +4=5, which is not 3.

Hmm, that didn't work.

Wait, maybe I misremembered the algorithm.

Let me try again.

Alternative algorithm for NAF:

1. While x is greater than 0:

a. If x is odd, append 1 to the result and subtract 1 from x.

b. Else, append 0.

c. If x is still greater than 0, divide x by 2 and repeat.

But this might not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero digits are present.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think differently.

I can represent x in binary and then adjust the representation to satisfy the no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Let me try with x=3: binary 11.

I need to have a_i such that no two consecutive a_i's are non-zero.

One way is to insert a zero between any two non-zero elements.

So, for x=3, instead of [1,1], I can do [1,0,1], but that sums to 1*1 +0*2 +1*4=1+0+4=5, which is not 3.

Alternatively, [1,-1,1]: 1*1 + (-1)*2 +1*4=1-2+4=3, and a0=1, a1=-1 are both non-zero and consecutive, which violates the condition.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the coefficients.

Another idea: Use the binary representation and, when two consecutive 1's are present, flip a higher bit and adjust lower bits accordingly.

Wait, similar to borrowing in subtraction.

Let me consider x=3: binary 11.

If I set a0=-1 and a2=1, then sum is -1*1 +1*4= -1 +4=3, which works, and no two consecutive non-zero elements since a1=0.

Perfect.

So, in this case, I transformed the two consecutive 1's into a -1 and a higher 1, with a zero in between.

Let me try this with x=7: binary 111.

Start from the least significant bit.

If I have three consecutive 1's, I can apply a similar transformation.

Set a0=-1, a1=0, a2=1, a3=1.

Sum: (-1)*1 +0*2 +1*4 +1*8 = -1 +0 +4 +8=11, which is not 7.

Not working.

Alternative approach: Maybe use the NAF algorithm more carefully.

I recall that in NAF, for each bit, if it's 1 and the next bit is 1, then set the current a_i=-1 and add 1 to the next higher bit.

Let's try that with x=3 (11):

- i=0: bit=1, i=1: bit=1.

- Set a0=-1, carry=1.

- i=1: bit=1 + carry=1, which is 2. Set a1=0, carry=1.

- i=2: bit=0 + carry=1, which is 1. Set a2=1, carry=0.

- No more carries.

- So, a=[-1,0,1].

- Sum: -1*1 +0*2 +1*4 = -1 +0 +4=3.

Perfect, that works.

Earlier, I mistakenly set a1=1, which was wrong.

Let me try with x=7 (111):

- i=0: bit=1, i=1: bit=1.

- Set a0=-1, carry=1.

- i=1: bit=1 + carry=1, which is 2.

- Set a1=-1, carry=1.

- i=2: bit=1 + carry=1, which is 2.

- Set a2=-1, carry=1.

- i=3: bit=0 + carry=1, which is 1.

- Set a3=1, carry=0.

- So, a=[-1,-1,-1,1].

- Sum: (-1)*1 + (-1)*2 + (-1)*4 +1*8 = -1 -2 -4 +8 =1, which is not 7.

Hmm, that's not correct.

What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps in NAF, when you set a_i=-1, you need to add 1 to the next higher bit, but in this case, it's getting complicated.

Maybe I need to adjust the algorithm.

Let me look up the exact steps for converting to NAF.

Upon looking it up, the algorithm for converting a binary number to its NAF form is:

1. Initialize an empty list for NAF digits.

2. While x is greater than 0:

a. If x is odd:

i. If x ==1, append 1 to NAF and subtract 1 from x.

ii. Else, append -1 to NAF and add 1 to x.

b. Else, append 0 to NAF.

c. Divide x by 2.

3. The NAF digits are in reverse order.

Wait, that seems different from what I tried earlier.

Let's apply this to x=3.

x=3 (binary 11)

- x is odd, so append 1 to NAF, x -=1 => x=2

- x=2, which is even, append 0 to NAF, x /=2 => x=1

- x=1, which is odd, append 1 to NAF, x -=1 => x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [1,0,1], which is a0=1, a1=0, a2=1.

- Sum:1*1 +0*2 +1*4=1+0+4=5, which is not 3.

Hmm, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I misread the algorithm.

Let me read it again.

Upon closer inspection, the algorithm I found is:

- While x >0:

- If x is odd:

- If x>1, append -1 to NAF and add 1 to x.

- Else, append 1 to NAF and subtract 1 from x.

- Else:

- Append 0 to NAF.

- x = floor(x/2)

Let's try this with x=3.

x=3 (odd and >1):

- Append -1 to NAF, x +=1 => x=4

- x=4 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x /=2 => x=2

- x=2 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x /=2 => x=1

- x=1 (odd and ==1):

- Append 1 to NAF, x -=1 => x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [-1,0,0,1], which is a0=-1, a1=0, a2=0, a3=1.

- Sum: (-1)*1 +0*2 +0*4 +1*8 = -1 +0 +0 +8 =7, which is not 3.

Not working.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the order of digits.

In the algorithm, the digits are appended in least significant first, so the final NAF should be reversed.

So, NAF=[1,0,0,-1], which is a0=1, a1=0, a2=0, a3=-1.

Sum:1*1 +0*2 +0*4 +(-1)*8=1+0+0-8=-7, which is not 3.

Not working.

Maybe the algorithm appends to the front instead of the back.

Let me check the algorithm again.

Upon further research, the correct NAF algorithm is:

- While x >0:

- If x is odd:

- If x>1:

- Append -1 to NAF

- x = (x +1)/2

- Else:

- Append 1 to NAF

- x = x/2

- Else:

- Append 0 to NAF

- x = x/2

Let's try this with x=3.

x=3 (odd and >1):

- Append -1 to NAF, x=(3+1)/2=2

- x=2 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=1

- x=1 (odd and ==1):

- Append 1 to NAF, x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [-1,0,1], which is a0=-1, a1=0, a2=1.

- Sum: (-1)*1 +0*2 +1*4 = -1 +0 +4 =3.

Perfect, that works.

Earlier, I mistakenly used x/=2 for even x, but according to this algorithm, it's correct.

Let me verify with another example.

Take x=7.

x=7 (odd and >1):

- Append -1 to NAF, x=(7+1)/2=4

- x=4 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=2

- x=2 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=1

- x=1 (odd and ==1):

- Append 1 to NAF, x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [-1,0,0,1], which is a0=-1, a1=0, a2=0, a3=1.

- Sum: (-1)*1 +0*2 +0*4 +1*8 = -1 +0 +0 +8 =7.

Perfect.

Another example: x=15.

x=15 (odd and >1):

- Append -1 to NAF, x=(15+1)/2=8

- x=8 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=4

- x=4 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=2

- x=2 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=1

- x=1 (odd and ==1):

- Append 1 to NAF, x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [-1,0,0,0,1], which is a0=-1, a1=0, a2=0, a3=0, a4=1.

- Sum: (-1)*1 +0*2 +0*4 +0*8 +1*16 = -1 +0 +0 +0 +16 =15.

Correct.

Seems like this algorithm works.

Let me try with x=14.

x=14 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=7

- x=7 (odd and >1):

- Append -1 to NAF, x=(7+1)/2=4

- x=4 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=2

- x=2 (even):

- Append 0 to NAF, x=1

- x=1 (odd and ==1):

- Append 1 to NAF, x=0

- Stop.

- NAF digits: [0,-1,0,0,1], which is a0=0, a1=-1, a2=0, a3=0, a4=1.

- Sum:0*1 +(-1)*2 +0*4 +0*8 +1*16 =0 -2 +0 +0 +16=14.

Perfect, matches the example.

So, the algorithm is:

While x >0:

if x is odd:

if x >1:

append -1 to NAF

x = (x +1)/2

else:

append 1 to NAF

x = x/2

else:

append 0 to NAF

x = x/2

And the NAF digits are in least significant first.

So, for implementation, I need to build the array from least significant to most significant, and then reverse it to have a0 to a_{n-1}.

Also, I need to ensure that the array length n is between 1 and 32, which should be fine since x < 2^30, and with possible adjustments, n should not exceed 32.

Now, looking at the given program, I need to evaluate if it correctly implements this logic.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for nalla in range(t):

x = int(input())

s = []

length = 30

for i in range(30):

if x & pow(2, i):

s.append('1')

else:

s.append('0')

print(*s)

flag = 0

for i in range(0, 29):

if flag and s[i] == '0':

s[i] = '1'

flag = 0

if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):

s[i] = '-1'

flag = 1

elif flag == 1:

s[i] = '0'

else:

pass

if flag and s[29] == '0':

s[29] = '1'

elif flag:

s[29] = '0'

s.append('1')

length += 1

for i in range(1, length):

if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):

s[i] = '0'

s[i - 1] = '-1'

print(length)

print(*s)

Wait, this seems overly complicated.

First, it initializes s as the binary representation of x, with '0's and '1's.

Then, it has a flag variable and iterates through s to make adjustments.

It seems to be trying to handle the cases where there are two consecutive '1's by setting one of them to '-1' and adjusting the flag.

However, it's not clear if this correctly implements the NAF algorithm or achieves the desired result.

Looking at the example in the problem, for x=14, the output is [0,-1,0,0,1], which matches the NAF representation.

But in the code, it seems to be manipulating the binary representation directly, which might not always produce the correct NAF.

Moreover, the code prints s after the initial binary conversion and before any adjustments, which doesn't make sense.

Also, the final adjustment loop where it checks if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1') and swaps them seems unnecessary and might corrupt the representation.

Given that, I suspect the code doesn't correctly implement the NAF algorithm and might produce incorrect results in some cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
