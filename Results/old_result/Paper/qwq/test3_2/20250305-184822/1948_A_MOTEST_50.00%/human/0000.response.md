Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. For a character to be special, it must be equal to one neighbor but not both. So, if I have a string like "AAB", the middle 'A' is special because it's equal to the 'A' on its left but not the 'B' on its right. Similarly, in "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters as per the example.

Okay, so my task is to construct a string where the number of such special characters is exactly n. I need to do this for multiple test cases, up to 50, and each n can be from 1 to 50. The string I build should be uppercase letters and have at most 200 characters.

Looking at the example, when n=6, the answer is "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters. When n=1, it's "NO", meaning it's impossible to have a string with exactly 1 special character. And when n=2, "MM" is the answer, but wait, "MM" has no special characters because both 'M's are equal to both their neighbors. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in "MM", each 'M' is equal to its only neighbor, so they are not special because they are equal to both neighbors, which is none in one side for the first 'M' and the second 'M'. Actually, in a two-character string where both are the same, neither is special because they are equal to their only neighbor. So, "MM" has zero special characters, but the problem asks for exactly n=2 special characters. So, "MM" is incorrect for n=2.

Looking back at the problem statement, for n=2, the output is "YES" and then "MM", but according to my reasoning, "MM" has 0 special characters, not 2. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the provided program or in my understanding.

Let me double-check the problem statement. It says: "print any suitable string or report that there is no such string." So, for n=2, the program is saying "YES" and providing "MM", but that's incorrect because "MM" has 0 special characters, not 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example output. Let's look at the example again:

Input:

3

6

1

2

Output:

YES

AAABAACC

NO

YES

MM

According to the problem, for n=6, it's "YES" and "AAABAACC" which has 6 special characters as per the problem's example. For n=1, it's "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly 1 special character, which makes sense because special characters come in pairs or something. Then for n=2, it's "YES" and "MM", but "MM" has 0 special characters.

This suggests that perhaps for n=2, there is no solution, but the program is incorrectly outputting "YES" and "MM". So, there might be a mistake in the program.

Let me think about how to approach this problem correctly.

First, I need to find a string where the number of special characters is exactly n.

Let's consider some small n values and see what strings would satisfy the condition.

For n=0: This would mean no special characters, so all characters are equal to both their neighbors (except boundary characters). For example, "AAA" has no special characters because the first 'A' is only equal to its right neighbor, but since it's the boundary, it's not considered special. Wait, no, according to the definition, a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. So, in "AAA", the first and last 'A's are special because they are equal to their only neighbor, and the middle 'A' is equal to both neighbors, so it's not special. Therefore, in "AAA", the first and last 'A's are special, so there are 2 special characters. So, "AAA" has 2 special characters, not 0. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider all characters being the same. In "AAAAA", the first and last 'A's are special, and the middle three are not, so there are 2 special characters again. So, to have 0 special characters, I need a string where no character is equal to exactly one neighbor.

Let's think about that. If a character is equal to both neighbors, it's not special. If it's not equal to either neighbor, it's not special. So, to have no special characters, every character should either be equal to both neighbors or equal to neither neighbor.

For example, in "AABB", the first 'A' is equal to its right neighbor, the second 'A' is equal to its left neighbor and not the right, so it's special. The first 'B' is equal to its right neighbor, the second 'B' is equal to its left neighbor. So, in "AABB", the second 'A' is special, and perhaps others. So, it's not meeting the condition for n=0.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that maximizes or minimizes special characters.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical relationship between the length of the string and the number of special characters.

Let me think differently. Let's consider that in a string, the number of special characters can be controlled by how we arrange the characters.

One way to have exactly n special characters is to create a pattern where n characters meet the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor.

For example, for n=2, I can have "AAB", where the first 'A' is special (equal to its right neighbor but not the left, since it's the start), and the second 'A' is special (equal to its left neighbor but not the right). The 'B' is not special because it's not equal to its left neighbor.

So, "AAB" has exactly 2 special characters. Wait, but according to the program, for n=2, it outputs "MM", which is incorrect. So, perhaps the program is wrong.

Similarly, for n=3, maybe "AAAB", which would have the first three 'A's as special characters.

Wait, but n=3 is odd, and in the program, for odd n, it seems to handle it differently.

Looking at the program:

def func():

os.system('cls')

s = string.ascii_uppercase

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n == 1:

print('NO')

else:

ans = ''

x = 0

if n % 2 == 0:

for j in range(n // 2):

ans += s[x] * 2

x += 1

else:

(ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)

for j in range(n // 2 - 1):

ans += s[x] * 2

x += 1

print('YES')

print(ans)

So, for n even, it creates a string of pairs of different letters. For n odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs.

Wait, for n=2, it's even, so it would add two pairs, like 'AA' + 'BB' = 'AABB'. But earlier I thought "AABB" has only one special character, but maybe I miscalculated.

Let's recount: in "AABB", positions are:

1. 'A' (equal to right neighbor 'A', not equal to left since it's the start) -> special

2. 'A' (equal to both neighbors) -> not special

3. 'B' (equal to right neighbor 'B', not equal to left) -> special

4. 'B' (equal to left neighbor 'B', not equal to right since it's the end) -> special

So, positions 1, 3, and 4 are special. That means three special characters. But n=2, so this is incorrect.

Hmm, so the program is outputting "AABB" for n=2, but that has three special characters, not two. So, the program is incorrect.

Similarly, for n=1, it correctly outputs "NO", which makes sense because you can't have exactly one special character; it has to be even in number or something.

Wait, why can't you have exactly one special character? Is it impossible?

Let's think about it. If you have a string with only one special character, that means only one character has exactly one neighbor equal to it.

But in a string, characters are connected in a chain, so if one character is equal to one neighbor but not the other, that implies something about the surrounding characters.

Let me try to construct a string with exactly one special character.

Suppose I have "A B", where 'A' is equal to its right neighbor 'B'? Wait, 'A' and 'B' are different, so 'A' is not equal to its right neighbor. So, no special characters.

Or "A A B", where the first 'A' is equal to its right neighbor, and the second 'A' is equal to its left and right neighbors, and 'B' is equal to its left neighbor. So, only the first 'A' is special. Wait, no, the second 'A' is equal to both neighbors, so not special. The 'B' is equal to its left neighbor 'A', but 'A' is not equal to 'B', so 'B' is not special. So, only the first 'A' is special. So, this has exactly one special character.

But according to the program, for n=1, it outputs "NO", but I just found a string "AAB" with n=1 special character. So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition of special characters.

Let me read the problem again: "special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

In "AAB":

- Position 1: 'A' (equal to right neighbor 'A', no left neighbor) -> special

- Position 2: 'A' (equal to left 'A' and right 'B') -> not special

- Position 3: 'B' (equal to left 'A', no right neighbor) -> not special (since it's only equal to one neighbor, but the definition says "equal to exactly one of its neighbors"

Wait, hold on. The problem says "equal to exactly one of its neighbors." So, for the first character, it's only equal to its right neighbor, so it's special. The second character is equal to both neighbors, so not special. The third character is only equal to its left neighbor, so it's special.

Wait, but in "AAB", both the first and the last 'B' are special. So, there are two special characters, not one.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I mistakenly considered 'B' as equal to its left neighbor 'A', but 'A' and 'B' are different, so 'B' is not equal to its left neighbor 'A'. So, 'B' is not special.

Wait, hold on:

In "AAB":

- Position 1: 'A' (equal to right neighbor 'A') -> special

- Position 2: 'A' (equal to left 'A' and right 'B') -> not special

- Position 3: 'B' (equal to left 'A'? 'A' != 'B', so not equal to left neighbor, no right neighbor) -> not special

So, only position 1 is special. Wait, but earlier I thought position 3 is special because it's equal to one neighbor (the left one), but 'A' != 'B', so it's not equal to its left neighbor. So, position 3 is not special.

Therefore, in "AAB", only the first 'A' is special, so n=1. But according to the program, for n=1, it outputs "NO", but actually, "AAB" is a valid string with n=1 special character.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Similarly, for n=2, "AAB" has one special character, which is less than 2. Maybe "AABA" has two special characters.

Let's check "AABA":

- Position 1: 'A' (equal to right 'A') -> special

- Position 2: 'A' (equal to left 'A' and right 'B') -> not special

- Position 3: 'B' (equal to left 'A', not equal to right 'A') -> special

- Position 4: 'A' (equal to left 'B', no right neighbor) -> not special

So, positions 1 and 3 are special: n=2. So, "AABA" is a valid string for n=2.

But the program outputs "MM" for n=2, which is incorrect because "MM" has 0 special characters.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
