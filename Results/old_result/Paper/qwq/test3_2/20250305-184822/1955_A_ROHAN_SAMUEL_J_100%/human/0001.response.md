Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. There are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of money Maxim has to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which can be up to 10,000. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price per yogurt if bought individually, and b is the price for two yogurts under the promotion.

The constraints are that n can be from 1 to 100, and a and b can be from 1 to 30. So, the numbers are relatively small, which is good for simplicity.

Now, I need to determine the minimum cost for each test case. To do that, I should consider how many pairs of yogurts Maxim can buy at the promotional price and how many he has to buy individually.

Let's think about it step by step.

First, if n is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. So, the total cost would be (n / 2) * b. But, I need to check if buying individually is cheaper than the promotion. For example, if 2 * a is less than b, then it's better to buy each yogurt individually instead of taking the promotion.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for even n, the minimum cost would be the smaller of (n / 2) * b or n * a.

But, I need to consider that n might be odd. If n is odd, Maxim has to buy one yogurt individually and the rest in pairs. So, the total cost would be (n // 2) * b + a. But again, I need to check if it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually or in pairs plus one individually.

Wait, no. If n is odd, he can't buy all in pairs. He has to buy one individually or see if buying three individually is cheaper than buying one pair and one individually, but that might not directly apply here.

Let me think again.

For n yogurts:

- If n is even:

- Option 1: Buy all in pairs: (n / 2) * b

- Option 2: Buy all individually: n * a

- Choose the minimum of these two.

- If n is odd:

- Option 1: Buy (n-1) yogurts in pairs and one individually: ((n-1) / 2) * b + a

- Option 2: Buy all individually: n * a

- Maybe there are other combinations, but I think these are the main options.

But, I need to ensure that I'm choosing the minimum cost. So, for odd n, I should compare the cost of buying in pairs and individually versus buying all individually.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

Let's verify these:

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9

Option 1: Buy two individually: 2*5=10

Option 2: Buy one pair: 9

So, minimum is 9.

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9

Option 1: Buy one pair and one individually: 9 + 5 = 14

Option 2: Buy all individually: 15

So, minimum is 14.

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

Option 1: Buy one pair and one individually: 11 + 5 = 16

Option 2: Buy all individually: 15

So, minimum is 15.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 15, which matches option 2.

Fourth test case: n=4, a=5, b=11

Option 1: Buy two pairs: 2*11=22

Option 2: Buy all individually: 4*5=20

So, minimum is 20.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, looking back at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n % 2:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b + a)

else:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b)

So, for even n:

- If 2*a < b, then buy all individually: n*a

- Else, buy all in pairs: (n//2)*b

For odd n:

- If 2*a < b, then buy all individually: n*a

- Else, buy (n//2) pairs and one individually: (n//2)*b + a

Wait, in the odd case, the condition is checking if 2*a < b, and if so, buy all individually, else buy (n//2) pairs and one individually.

But in the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11

Here, 2*a = 10, which is less than b=11, so it should buy all individually: 15

Which matches the example output.

In the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9

2*a = 10 > b=9, so buy one pair: 9

Second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9

2*a=10 > b=9, so buy one pair and one individually: 9+5=14

Fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11

2*a=10 < b=11, so buy all individually: 20

Which again matches the example.

So, the logic seems correct.

But, I need to think if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Let's consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1

So, n=1, a=10, b=15

Since n is odd, check if 2*a=20 < b=15? No, 20 > 15, so buy (1//2)*b + a = 0*15 + 10 = 10

But, wait, according to the logic, since n is odd and 2*a > b, it should buy (n//2)*b + a = 0*15 + 10 = 10

But, perhaps buying one pair is not possible since n=1.

But in this case, since n=1 is odd, and 2*a > b doesn't hold (2*a=20 > b=15), so it should buy (0)*15 + 10 = 10

But, wait, is there a better way? No, because you can't buy a pair when n=1.

Edge case 2: n=1, a=5, b=10

Here, 2*a=10 = b=10

So, according to the logic, since 2*a is not less than b (it's equal), so buy (0)*b + a = 5

Which is correct, because buying a pair isn't possible, so you have to buy individually.

Edge case 3: n=0, but n starts from 1 according to constraints, so n>=1

Edge case 4: n=100, a=1, b=2

Here, 2*a=2 = b=2

So, according to the logic, since 2*a is not less than b, buy (n//2)*b + (n%2)*a = 50*2 + 0*1 = 100

But, alternatively, buying all individually would be 100*1=100, which is the same.

So, no issue.

Edge case 5: n=3, a=3, b=7

2*a=6 < b=7, so buy all individually: 9

Which is correct, because buying one pair and one individually would be 7+3=10, which is more than 9.

Edge case 6: n=2, a=4, b=7

2*a=8 > b=7, so buy one pair: 7

Which is correct.

Seems like the logic holds for these cases.

Another consideration: Is there a possibility that buying in pairs is always cheaper, even when 2*a < b?

Wait, no. If 2*a < b, then buying individually is cheaper per two yogurts compared to the pair.

But, what if n is odd, like n=3, and 2*a < b?

Then, buying all individually would be cheaper than buying one pair and one individually.

For example, n=3, a=3, b=7

Buying all individually: 9

Buying one pair and one individually: 7+3=10

So, buying all individually is cheaper, which aligns with the logic in the program.

Alternatively, if 2*a >= b, then buying in pairs is better or equal in price.

For example, n=3, a=4, b=7

2*a=8 > b=7

So, buy one pair and one individually: 7+4=11

Which is better than buying all individually: 12

Hence, the logic seems sound.

I think the program is correct based on the problem description and the examples provided.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
