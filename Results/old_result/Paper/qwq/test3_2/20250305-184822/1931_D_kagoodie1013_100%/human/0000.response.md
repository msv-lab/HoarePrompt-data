Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> beautiful if two conditions are met:

1. The sum of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by x.

2. The difference of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by y.

I need to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for each test case.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by certain numbers. Let's recall that if a number a is divisible by b, then a mod b = 0.

So, for the sum a_i + a_j to be divisible by x, it means (a_i + a_j) mod x = 0.

Similarly, for the difference a_i - a_j to be divisible by y, it means (a_i - a_j) mod y = 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions hold true.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since the constraints mention that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the total n across all test cases is 2*10^5. So, I need an algorithm that's linear or linearithmic in n.

I recall that for problems involving counting pairs with certain properties related to modulo, using frequency maps based on residues can be helpful.

Let me consider the residues of the elements modulo x and y.

But since we have conditions on both sum and difference, I need to find a way to relate these.

Let's consider the properties of sum and difference:

- (a_i + a_j) mod x = (a_i mod x + a_j mod x) mod x

- (a_i - a_j) mod y = (a_i mod y - a_j mod y) mod y

So, if (a_i mod x + a_j mod x) mod x = 0, then a_j mod x = (-a_i mod x) mod x.

Similarly, if (a_i mod y - a_j mod y) mod y = 0, then a_j mod y = a_i mod y.

Wait, that seems useful.

So, for a pair <i, j> to be beautiful:

1. a_j mod x = (-a_i mod x) mod x

2. a_j mod y = a_i mod y

If I can find elements where these two conditions are satisfied, then the pair is beautiful.

So, perhaps I can group elements based on their residues modulo y, and within each group, count how many elements have a residue modulo x that is the negative of the residue I'm looking for.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define for each element a_i:

- r_x_i = a_i mod x

- r_y_i = a_i mod y

Then, for a pair <i, j> to be beautiful:

- r_x_j ≡ -r_x_i mod x

- r_y_j ≡ r_y_i mod y

So, if I fix a_i, then for a_j to form a beautiful pair with a_i, a_j must satisfy:

- r_x_j ≡ -r_x_i mod x

- r_y_j ≡ r_y_i mod y

Alternatively, I can group elements by their r_y_i, and within each group, count how many pairs have r_x_i and r_x_j such that r_x_j ≡ -r_x_i mod x.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me think differently. Since the conditions are independent in a way, maybe I can combine the residues.

Wait, perhaps I can consider a tuple of residues (r_x, r_y), and look for pairs where one element has (r_x, r_y) and the other has (-r_x mod x, r_y).

That seems promising.

So, for each element, I can compute its (r_x, r_y), and keep a frequency map of these tuples.

Then, for each element, to find the number of elements that can pair with it to form a beautiful pair, I can look for elements with (-r_x mod x, r_y).

Then, the total number of beautiful pairs would be half of the sum over all elements of the frequency of their corresponding (-r_x mod x, r_y), to avoid double-counting.

Wait, but I need to ensure that i < j, so I have to be careful about the order.

Alternatively, I can process the array in order, and maintain a frequency map of the elements processed so far, updating the count as I go.

Yes, that sounds better.

So, I can iterate through the array, and for each element, calculate its (r_x, r_y), then look up the frequency of (-r_x mod x, r_y) in the frequency map so far, and add that to the count.

Then, add the current (r_x, r_y) to the frequency map.

This way, I avoid double-counting because I'm always looking at previous elements.

Let me try to formalize this:

Initialize an empty frequency map.

Initialize count = 0.

For each element a_i in the array:

r_x_i = a_i mod x

r_y_i = a_i mod y

target_r_x = (-r_x_i) mod x

target_r_y = r_y_i

count += frequency_map[(target_r_x, target_r_y)]

frequency_map[(r_x_i, r_y_i)] += 1

This should give the total number of beautiful pairs.

Let me verify this with the first example:

n=6, x=5, y=2, a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Let's compute the residues:

a1=1: r_x=1 mod 5=1, r_y=1 mod 2=1

a2=2: r_x=2 mod 5=2, r_y=2 mod 2=0

a3=7: r_x=7 mod 5=2, r_y=7 mod 2=1

a4=4: r_x=4 mod 5=4, r_y=4 mod 2=0

a5=9: r_x=9 mod 5=4, r_y=9 mod 2=1

a6=6: r_x=6 mod 5=1, r_y=6 mod 2=0

So, the tuples are:

(1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), (4,1), (1,0)

Now, let's simulate the process:

Initialize frequency map: empty

count = 0

Process a1: (1,1)

target_r_x = (-1) mod 5 = 4

target_r_y = 1

frequency_map[(4,1)] = 0

count += 0

frequency_map[(1,1)] = 1

Process a2: (2,0)

target_r_x = (-2) mod 5 = 3

target_r_y = 0

frequency_map[(3,0)] = 0

count += 0

frequency_map[(2,0)] = 1

Process a3: (2,1)

target_r_x = (-2) mod 5 = 3

target_r_y = 1

frequency_map[(3,1)] = 0

count += 0

frequency_map[(2,1)] = 1

Process a4: (4,0)

target_r_x = (-4) mod 5 = 1

target_r_y = 0

frequency_map[(1,0)] = 0

count += 0

frequency_map[(4,0)] = 1

Process a5: (4,1)

target_r_x = (-4) mod 5 = 1

target_r_y = 1

frequency_map[(1,1)] = 1

count += 1

frequency_map[(4,1)] = 1

Process a6: (1,0)

target_r_x = (-1) mod 5 = 4

target_r_y = 0

frequency_map[(4,0)] = 1

count += 1

frequency_map[(1,0)] = 1

Total count = 2, which matches the example.

Great, seems correct.

Now, let's check the time complexity.

For each element, we perform a constant-time lookup in the frequency map and update it.

If we use a dictionary in Python, with tuples as keys, this should be efficient enough since dictionary operations are average O(1).

Given that the total n across all test cases is 2*10^5, this should be acceptable.

Edge cases to consider:

- All elements are the same.

- x or y is 1.

- x and y are equal.

- Negative numbers in the array (though according to the problem, a_i >=1).

Wait, the problem says 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, so no negatives.

Let me think about x or y being 1.

If x=1, then a_i + a_j is always divisible by 1, since any integer is divisible by 1.

If y=1, then a_i - a_j is always divisible by 1.

So, if both x and y are 1, every pair <i,j> is beautiful.

Similarly, if x=1 and y=another number, then the pairs where a_i - a_j is divisible by y are beautiful.

I need to ensure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Another edge case is when n=2, the smallest possible n.

If n=2, there's only one possible pair.

I need to make sure the code doesn't skip any pairs.

Also, since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, I need to make sure the code is optimized and doesn't have unnecessary overhead.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program reads all input at once, splits it into a list called data, and then processes the test cases.

It reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, x, y, and then the array a of size n.

It stores the test cases in a list called test_cases.

Then, it calls a function func_1(test_cases) to compute the results for each test case.

Finally, it prints the results separated by newline.

Now, looking at func_1:

def func_1(test_cases):

results = []

for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:

count = 0

residue_map = {}

for num in arr:

r_x = -num % x

r_y = num % y

count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)

current_key = (num % x, num % y)

residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1

results.append(count)

return results

Okay, so for each test case, it initializes count to 0 and a residue_map as an empty dictionary.

Then, for each number in the array:

It calculates r_x as -num % x

r_y as num % y

It looks up the frequency of the tuple (r_x, r_y) in the residue_map and adds it to count.

Then, it calculates the current_key as (num % x, num % y)

And increments the frequency of current_key in residue_map by 1.

Finally, it appends the count to results and returns the list of results.

Wait a minute, in the earlier reasoning, I had:

target_r_x = (-r_x_i) mod x

where r_x_i = a_i mod x

But in the code, r_x is calculated as -num % x, which is equivalent to (-num) mod x.

Is this the same as (-r_x_i) mod x?

Let's verify.

r_x_i = num % x

(-r_x_i) mod x = (- (num % x)) mod x

In Python, -num % x is equivalent to (x - num % x) mod x, which is the same as (-num) mod x.

So, (-num) mod x = x - (num % x) if num % x != 0, else 0.

Wait, no:

In Python, -num % x is calculated as:

If -num is negative, it finds the smallest s >= 0 such that -num = x * k + s for some integer k.

This s is the result of -num % x.

Which is equivalent to x - (num % x) if num % x != 0, else 0.

Similarly, (-r_x_i) mod x is (- (num % x)) mod x, which is the same as x - (num % x) if num % x != 0, else 0.

So, in the code, r_x = -num % x is correctly calculating (-r_x_i) mod x.

Then, r_y = num % y is correct.

So, in the frequency map, it's looking up (r_x, r_y), which is equivalent to looking up (-r_x_i mod x, r_y_i).

Then, it adds the frequency of that tuple to the count.

Finally, it updates the frequency map with the current element's (r_x_i, r_y_i).

This seems to match the earlier reasoning.

Hence, the program should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
