Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each time I play a card, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, I get a point. The same goes for Nene.

Nene is really smart and always plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she tries to minimize my points. So, I need to figure out, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, assuming Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards. We take n turns each, alternating, with me starting first.

During each turn, a player selects one card from their hand, plays it on the table. If there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point.

Nene is playing to maximize her points and minimize mine, given that her primary goal is to maximize her own score.

Given that, I need to maximize my points, considering how Nene will play in response.

Let me think about the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

So, for the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. Nene's cards must be 2,3,4,4. The explanation shows a possible sequence of plays where I get 1 point.

I need to confirm if the program provided is correctly calculating the maximum points I can get.

Looking at the program:

def func_1(n, a):

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(a)

pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))

return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

idx = 0

t = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))

idx += n

results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:

print(result)

So, func_1 takes n and a list of my cards, counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in my hand, and then returns the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, why n//2?

Let me think about it.

In the game, there are n numbers, each appearing twice. So, for each number, there are two cards.

If I have both cards of a number, then when I play the first one, there's no matching card on the table yet, so I don't get a point. When I play the second one, there is already a card with that number on the table, so I get a point.

Similarly, if Nene has both cards of a number, she can play them in a way to maximize her points.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, perhaps the strategy is to pair up numbers where I have both cards, and try to get points from those.

Wait, in func_1, it's counting how many numbers I have both cards of, i.e., count == 2 in my hand.

Then, it takes the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, why n//2?

Wait, n is the number of cards each player has.

Wait, n is the number of cards each player has, but the total numbers are from 1 to n, with each number appearing twice.

Wait, no, n is the number of cards each player has, and the total numbers are from 1 to n, with each number appearing twice in the deck.

So, total deck has 2n cards.

Wait, no, wait, the problem says:

"The deck with 2n cards is used to play this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1 through n appears exactly on 2 cards."

So, deck has 2n cards, with numbers from 1 to n, each appearing twice.

Then, me and Nene each get n cards.

So, n numbers, each appearing twice in the deck.

Me and Nene each get n cards, so together, we have all 2n cards.

Given that, in my hand, I have some cards, and Nene has the remaining n cards.

In func_1, it's counting how many numbers I have two cards of.

Then, it's returning the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

So, pairs = 1 (only number 1 appears twice in my hand).

Then, min(1, 4//2) = min(1,2) = 1, which matches the output of 1 in the first test case.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, in my hand:

7:1, 4:1, 1:1, 2:1, 8:2, 5:2.

So, pairs = 2 (numbers 8 and 5 appear twice in my hand).

min(2, 8//2) = min(2,4) = 2, which matches the second output of 2.

Similarly, third test case, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, in my hand:

7:1,1:1,4:2,5:1,3:1,2:1,6:1.

pairs = 1 (only 4 appears twice in my hand).

min(1,8//2)=min(1,4)=1, which matches the third output of 1.

Fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

pairs = 0 (no number appears twice in my hand).

min(0,3//2)=min(0,1)=0, matches the fourth output of 0.

Fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1.

pairs = 1 (number 1 appears twice in my hand, since there are only two cards, both are in my hand).

min(1,1//2)=min(1,0)=0, matches the fifth output of 0.

So, the function seems to be working correctly for the example cases.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me think about it.

The logic is: count how many numbers I have two cards of, and then take the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, why n//2?

Wait, in the game, there are 2n turns, with me and Nene each taking n turns.

Since I go first, I take turns 1,3,5,...,n (if n is even), or n+1 if n is odd.

Wait, n is always even because 2n cards, each number appears twice.

Wait, no, n can be odd.

Wait, n can be any positive integer, as per the constraints.

Wait, in the problem, n is at least 1, up to 2*10^5.

But in the game, me and Nene take n turns each, alternating, with me starting first.

So, in total, there are 2n turns: me, Nene, me, Nene, ..., me, Nene.

Each turn, a player plays one card from their hand to the table.

If there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of a tie in her points, minimize my points.

I need to find the maximum points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally.

So, the question is, is the number of pairs I have in my hand equal to the maximum points I can get?

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and the output is 1, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Similarly, in the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), output is 2.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), output is 1.

In the fourth test case, no pairs, output is 0.

In the fifth test case, I have one pair (two 1's), but min(1,0)=0, output is 0.

Wait, why min(pairs, n//2)?

In the fifth test case, n=1, which is odd, so me and Nene take one turn each.

Me first, I play my card with 1, there's no matching card on the table yet, so I get 0 points.

Nene plays her card with 1, now there is a matching card on the table, so she gets 1 point.

So, I get 0 points, which matches the output.

But according to the function, pairs=1, min(1,0)=0.

So, it works in this case.

Wait, but why n//2?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have k pairs in my hand, i.e., k numbers appear twice in my hand.

For each such pair, I can potentially get one point by playing the second card when the first one is already on the table.

But, Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she will try to prevent me from getting points.

Wait, but in reality, since she plays after me, and she knows the cards on the table, she can strategically play her cards to maximize her points and minimize mine.

But, in the function, it's just taking the minimum of the number of pairs I have and n//2.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of pairs I can play and get a point, considering that Nene can play her cards in a way to interfere.

Wait, maybe n//2 is the maximum number of points I can get, but limited by the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=1, which is odd, n//2=0, so I can't get any points, which makes sense because I only have one turn, and I play my card, and there's no matching card on the table yet.

In the first test case, n=4, n//2=2, but I have only one pair, so I can get at most one point, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=8, n//2=4, but I have two pairs, so I can get at most two points.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, n//2=4, but I have only one pair, so I can get at most one point.

In the fourth test case, n=3, n//2=1, but I have no pairs, so I get zero points.

So, it seems that the formula min(number of pairs I have, n//2) works for these cases.

But is this generally correct?

Let me think about another test case.

Suppose n=2, my cards are 1,2.

Nene's cards are 1,2.

So, I have no pairs.

n//2=1.

According to the function, min(0,1)=0.

Is that correct?

Let's simulate the game.

Me first: play 1.

Nene: play 1, gets a point because there's already a 1 on the table.

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 2, gets a point.

So, I get 0 points, which matches the function's output.

Another test case: n=3, my cards are 1,1,2.

Nene's cards are 2,3,3.

So, I have one pair (two 1's).

n//2=1.

min(1,1)=1.

Can I get one point?

Let's simulate:

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 2.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 3.

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 3, get a point.

So, I get one point, which matches.

Another test case: n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,2.

Nene's cards are 3,3,4,4.

So, I have two pairs.

n//2=2.

min(2,2)=2.

Can I get two points?

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 3.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 3, get a point.

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 4.

Me: play 2, get a point.

Nene: play 4, get a point.

So, I get two points, which matches.

Another test case: n=5, my cards are 1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,5,5.

So, I have one pair (two 1's).

n//2=2.

min(1,2)=1.

Can I get one point?

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 2.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 2, get a point.

Me: play 3.

Nene: play 3, get a point.

Me: play 4.

Nene: play 4, get a point.

Me: play 5.

Nene: play 5, get a point.

So, I get one point, which matches.

Seems consistent.

Another test case: n=6, my cards are 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Nene's cards are 4,4,5,5,6,6.

So, I have three pairs.

n//2=3.

min(3,3)=3.

Can I get three points?

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 4.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 4, get a point.

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 5.

Me: play 2, get a point.

Nene: play 5, get a point.

Me: play 3.

Nene: play 6.

Me: play 3, get a point.

Nene: play 6, get a point.

So, I get three points, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, my cards are 1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,5,5.

As before, I get one point.

If I try to play differently:

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 5.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 5, get a point.

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 2, get a point.

Me: play 3.

Nene: play 3, get a point.

Me: play 4.

Nene: play 4, get a point.

Still, I get one point.

Another strategy:

Me: play 2.

Nene: play 5.

Me: play 1.

Nene: play 5, get a point.

Me: play 1, get a point.

Nene: play 2, get a point.

Me: play 3.

Nene: play 3, get a point.

Me: play 4.

Nene: play 4, get a point.

Again, I get one point.

Seems like I can't get more than one point in this scenario.

Hence, the function seems correct.

So, the logic is: for each pair I have, I can potentially get one point by playing the second card when the first one is already on the table.

But, I can't get more points than the number of pairs I have.

Additionally, it's limited by n//2 because, in the game, there are n turns for me, and n//2 is the maximum points I can get, but in practice, it's limited by the number of pairs I have.

Hence, taking the minimum of the number of pairs I have and n//2 seems correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
