Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My task is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for "minimum excluded," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array up to that point. For example, MEX of [0,1,4] is 2 because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

So, for each position i, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in p. That's important because it means p_i are unique.

I need to find p such that for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i equals a_i.

Let me try to find a way to compute MEX incrementally as I build p.

I'll consider building p step by step, from p_1 to p_n, and keep track of the MEX at each step.

Starting with p_1:

- MEX(p_1) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1.

- Since p_1 is a single number, MEX(p_1) is 0 if p_1 != 0, else 1.

- Given a_1 = MEX(p_1) - p_1, I can solve for p_1.

Wait, actually, since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1, p_1 can be any of these numbers.

Let me try to express p_i in terms of a_i and MEX.

From a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i, I can write p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

So, p_i is equal to MEX of the first i elements minus a_i.

But MEX is a function of the first i elements, which includes p_i itself.

This seems a bit circular. Maybe I need to find a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Let me consider that MEX of p_1 to p_i is equal to p_i + a_i.

Since a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i, then MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, MEX of p_1 to p_i is p_i + a_i.

Maybe I can keep track of the MEX as I build the sequence.

I need to ensure that the MEX at each step is equal to p_i + a_i.

Also, since p is a permutation, all p_i are distinct.

Let me think about the properties of MEX.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

So, for p_1 to p_i, MEX is the smallest missing number.

Given that p_i are unique and from 0 to n-1, the MEX will be in the range from 0 to n.

Wait, but a_i can be from -n to n, and p_i is from 0 to n-1, so p_i + a_i can range from -n to 2n-1.

But MEX is always a non-negative integer, so p_i + a_i should be non-negative.

Wait, but in the example, a_i can be negative.

In the first example, a_3 = -2, which would mean MEX(p_1,p_2,p_3) = p_3 - 2.

But MEX is non-negative, so p_3 - 2 >= 0 implies p_3 >= 2.

So, I need to ensure that p_i + a_i >= 0.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the MEX.

Let me try to build p step by step.

Initialize an empty list for p.

Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers in p.

Initialize MEX as 0.

Wait, but MEX changes as p grows.

I need a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the MEX at each step based on a_i and p_i.

Wait, I have MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) is p_i + a_i.

I can use this to find p_i.

But p_i is part of the MEX calculation.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to iterate through the array and keep track of the MEX.

Let me consider the first element.

For i=1:

MEX(p_1) = p_1 + a_1.

But p_1 is in the permutation, so p_1 is unique and from 0 to n-1.

Similarly, for i=2:

MEX(p_1, p_2) = p_2 + a_2.

And so on.

I need to find p such that for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i accordingly.

Let me try with the first example:

n=5

a = [1,1,-2,1,2]

According to the sample output, p = [0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify:

MEX(p_1) = MEX(0) = 1, so a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1

MEX(p_1,p_2) = MEX(0,1) = 2, but a_2 = 1, so 2 - 1 = 1

MEX(p_1,p_2,p_3) = MEX(0,1,4) = 2, a_3 = -2, so 2 - 4 = -2

MEX(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4) = MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3, a_4 = 1, so 3 - 2 = 1

MEX(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5) = MEX(0,1,4,2,3) = 5, a_5 = 2, so 5 - 3 = 2

Yes, that matches.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need to find p_i such that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

But MEX is the smallest missing number in p_1 to p_i.

So, MEX is not directly related to p_i in a simple way.

I need another approach.

Let me consider that MEX is the number of elements less than MEX that are missing in p_1 to p_i.

Wait, that might not help.

Another idea: since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1, the MEX at any point is the smallest number from 0 to n that is not in p_1 to p_i.

Wait, no, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.

So, for p_1 to p_i, MEX is the smallest number from 0 to n not present in p_1 to p_i.

Given that, perhaps I can keep track of the numbers used so far and find the MEX accordingly.

But I still need a way to find p_i based on a_i.

Let me try to rearrange the equation.

Given that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

So, p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

But MEX is a function of p_1 to p_i, which includes p_i.

This seems circular.

Maybe I can find a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Let me think about the properties of MEX.

As I add elements to the array, the MEX can either stay the same or increase by 1.

Wait, actually, MEX can jump if multiple numbers are missing.

For example, if p_1 to p_i are [0,1,4], MEX is 2.

If I add 2, then p_1 to p_i+1 are [0,1,4,2], MEX is 3.

If I add 3, then MEX is 4, and so on.

So, MEX can increase by 1 each time I add a number that is equal to the current MEX.

If I add a number greater than the current MEX, the MEX stays the same.

If I add a number less than the current MEX that is not already present, the MEX increases by 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, when I add a number, if that number is equal to the current MEX, then the new MEX is the next integer.

If the number is less than the current MEX and not already present, the MEX remains the same.

If the number is greater than the current MEX, the MEX remains the same.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose current MEX is m.

If I add a number k:

- If k < m and k is not already in the array, then the new MEX is m+1.

- If k >= m, or if k < m but already in the array, the new MEX remains m.

Wait, but in permutations, all numbers are unique, so if k < m and not in the array, new MEX is m+1.

Else, new MEX is m.

So, in this case, since p is a permutation, and all numbers are unique, adding a number k:

- If k < m and not in the array, MEX becomes m+1.

- Else, MEX remains m.

But in our case, since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1, and we're adding one by one, MEX will eventually cover all numbers from 0 to n.

But I need a way to find p_i based on a_i.

Let me try to iterate through the array and keep track of the MEX.

Initialize MEX as 0.

Initialize an empty list for p.

Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.

For each i from 1 to n:

Compute p_i = MEX - a_i.

Check if p_i is valid:

- p_i must be in 0 to n-1.

- p_i must not be used before.

- MEX must be equal to p_i + a_i.

But I need to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated based on the current p.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in the permutation p, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once.

So, perhaps I can consider the positions where each number appears.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the inverse permutation.

No, that might not help.

Another idea: since MEX is involved, perhaps I can keep track of the numbers that are missing so far.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that MEX is the smallest missing number.

Let me try to iterate through the array and for each position, find p_i such that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each i, find p_i that satisfies this equation, making sure that p_i is unique.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that MEX is always >=0.

So, p_i + a_i >=0, which implies p_i >= -a_i.

Given that a_i can be negative, p_i can be less than the MEX.

Wait, in the first example, p_3 =4 and a_3=-2, so MEX=2.

So, p_i can be larger than MEX.

Wait, but in that case, MEX is less than p_i.

Wait, no: p_i + a_i = MEX.

So, p_i = MEX - a_i.

So, if a_i is negative, p_i is MEX - a_i, which is larger.

But I need to ensure that p_i is unique and within 0 to n-1.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to find another way.

Let me consider that the MEX at each step is equal to p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

Let me try to iterate through the array and maintain the MEX.

Initialize MEX as 0.

Initialize an empty list for p.

Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = MEX - a_i.

Check if p_i is valid:

- p_i must be in 0 to n-1.

- p_i must not be used before.

- The MEX of p_1 to p_i should be p_i + a_i.

But I need a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Wait, perhaps I can compute MEX based on the previous MEX and the new p_i.

From the previous analysis:

- If p_i < MEX and p_i not in p_1 to p_i-1, then new MEX = MEX +1.

- Else, new MEX = MEX.

But in this approach, I'm trying to set p_i = MEX - a_i, and then update MEX accordingly.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the MEX at each step is equal to p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

Let me denote MEX_i = p_i + a_i.

Given that, I can compute MEX_i for each i.

Now, I need to find p_i such that MEX_i is the MEX of p_1 to p_i.

Also, p_i must be unique and from 0 to n-1.

Wait, but MEX_i is determined by p_i and a_i.

This seems circular again.

Perhaps I need to find a way to assign p_i such that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i, for all i.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array and for each position, I try to assign the smallest available number that satisfies the condition.

Initialize p as an empty list.

Initialize a set of available numbers from 0 to n-1.

For each i from 1 to n:

Find the smallest available number k such that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = k + a_i.

But how do I know MEX(p_1 to p_i) if I don't know p_i yet?

This seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can compute MEX(p_1 to p_i-1), and then determine what MEX(p_1 to p_i) would be based on the value of p_i.

But again, it's circular.

Maybe I need to consider the properties of MEX more carefully.

Let me consider that MEX(p_1 to p_i) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

So, if p_1 to p_i contains all numbers from 0 to m-1 except for some number, then MEX is that missing number.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the numbers used so far and find the smallest missing one.

But again, I need to find p_i such that MEX = p_i + a_i.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i accordingly, ensuring that p_i are unique and within 0 to n-1.

But I need to ensure that the MEX at each step matches p_i + a_i.

This seems too error-prone.

Perhaps I should look for a different way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that the permutation p is a rearrangement of 0 to n-1.

So, perhaps I can consider the inverse permutation, where for each position i, p_i maps to its position in the permutation.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for each i, p_i is equal to MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

Given that, perhaps I can express p_i in terms of MEX.

But MEX is a function of p_1 to p_i, which includes p_i, so it's still circular.

This seems too tricky.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that in the sample input, for n=5 and a=[1,1,-2,1,2], p=[0,1,4,2,3].

Let's see:

- For i=1: MEX(0)=1, p1=0, a1=1=1-0.

- For i=2: MEX(0,1)=2, p2=1, a2=1=2-1.

- For i=3: MEX(0,1,4)=2, p3=4, a3=-2=2-4.

- For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2)=3, p4=2, a4=1=3-2.

- For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3)=5, p5=3, a5=2=5-3.

So, it works.

Now, perhaps I can find a way to reconstruct p by iterating through a and assigning p_i accordingly.

But I need a systematic way.

Let me consider that MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, I have MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

I need to find p_i such that this holds.

Given that p is a permutation, all p_i are unique.

I need to ensure that the MEX at each step matches p_i + a_i.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i based on the current MEX.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the current MEX and assign p_i accordingly.

Initialize MEX as 0.

Initialize an empty list for p.

Initialize a set for used numbers.

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = MEX - a_i.

Check if p_i is valid:

- p_i must be in 0 to n-1.

- p_i must not be used before.

- The MEX of p_1 to p_i should be p_i + a_i.

But I need a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the MEX based on the current set of p_i's.

But that seems inefficient for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that MEX is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the used numbers and find the smallest missing one.

But in practice, for large n, this could be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can optimize it by keeping a boolean array to mark used numbers.

Initialize a boolean array of size n, all False.

Initialize current_MEX as 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = current_MEX - a_i.

Check if p_i is in 0 to n-1 and not used.

If yes, set p_i to that value, mark it as used.

Then, update current_MEX:

if p_i == current_MEX, then current_MEX +=1.

Else, current_MEX remains the same.

Wait, but in the first example, p1=0, which equals current_MEX=0, so current_MEX becomes 1.

Then p2=1, which equals current_MEX=1, so current_MEX becomes 2.

Then p3=4, which is greater than current_MEX=2, so current_MEX remains 2.

Then p4=2, which equals current_MEX=2, so current_MEX becomes 3.

Then p5=3, which equals current_MEX=3, so current_MEX becomes 4.

This seems to work.

So, perhaps I can implement this logic.

Initialize current_MEX as 0.

Initialize used as a boolean array of size n, all False.

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = current_MEX - a_i.

Check if p_i is in 0 to n-1 and not used.

If yes, set p_i to that value, mark it as used.

Then, if p_i == current_MEX, increment current_MEX by 1.

Else, keep current_MEX the same.

This seems promising.

Let me test this with the first example.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize current_MEX=0

used=[F,F,F,F,F]

i=1:

p1 = 0 -1 = -1. But p_i must be in 0 to 4 and not used. -1 is invalid.

This doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the approach.

Perhaps I need to find p_i such that p_i + a_i = MEX.

Given that, p_i = MEX - a_i.

But in the first step, MEX is not necessarily 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to find MEX first based on a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate and find p_i that satisfies the condition.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that MEX is always equal to p_i + a_i.

So, for each i, MEX_i = p_i + a_i.

I can compute MEX_i for each i.

Then, I need to ensure that MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i accordingly.

But I need to ensure that p_i are unique and within 0 to n-1.

This seems too error-prone.

Maybe I need to consider that p_i = MEX_i - a_i, and MEX_i is the MEX of p_1 to p_i.

But again, this seems circular.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy altogether.

Let me consider that p is a permutation, so each p_i is unique.

I can try to iterate through the array and assign the smallest available p_i that satisfies the condition.

Initialize available numbers as a set from 0 to n-1.

For each i from 1 to n:

Find the smallest number in the available set that satisfies MEX(p_1 to p_i) = p_i + a_i.

But I still need a way to compute MEX(p_1 to p_i).

This seems too slow for large n.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the used numbers and the current MEX.

Initialize used as a set().

Initialize current_MEX as 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = current_MEX - a_i.

If p_i is in 0 to n-1 and not used:

Set p_i to that value.

Add p_i to used.

If p_i == current_MEX:

current_MEX +=1

Else:

current_MEX remains the same.

Wait, let's test this with the first example.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize current_MEX=0, used={}

i=1:

p1 = 0 -1 = -1. Invalid, as p_i must be in 0 to 4.

This doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the approach.

Perhaps I need to find p_i such that p_i = MEX - a_i, and MEX is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i.

This seems too circular.

Maybe I need to consider that MEX is increasing as I add more elements.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the MEX, updating it as I add each p_i.

Initialize used as a set().

Initialize current_MEX as 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

While current_MEX in used:

current_MEX +=1

p_i = current_MEX - a_i

If p_i is in 0 to n-1 and not used:

Set p_i to that value.

Add p_i to used.

Else:

This should not happen, as per the problem statement.

Wait, let's test this with the first example.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize current_MEX=0, used={}

i=1:

While 0 in used? No.

p1 = 0 -1 = -1. Invalid.

This doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the approach.

Perhaps I need to consider that MEX is p_i + a_i, and p_i is unique.

So, perhaps I can iterate through a and assign p_i accordingly.

Let me consider that p_i + a_i is equal to MEX.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i accordingly, ensuring that p_i are unique and within 0 to n-1.

But again, this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign p_i based on the current MEX.

Initialize current_MEX as 0.

Initialize used as a set().

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = current_MEX - a_i.

If p_i is in 0 to n-1 and not used:

Set p_i to that value.

Add p_i to used.

If p_i == current_MEX:

current_MEX +=1

Else:

current_MEX remains the same.

But in the first example, p1 =0 -1=-1, which is invalid.

So, this approach doesn't work.

I need to find a different way.

Let me consider that MEX is equal to p_i + a_i.

So, p_i = MEX - a_i.

But MEX is the smallest missing number in p_1 to p_i.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each i, find p_i such that p_i = MEX - a_i, where MEX is the smallest missing number not in p_1 to p_i.
