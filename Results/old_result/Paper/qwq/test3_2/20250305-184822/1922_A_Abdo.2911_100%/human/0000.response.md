Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template consists of n characters, which can be lowercase or uppercase Latin letters. The rules are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

So, for example, if the template has 'a' at position i, then the string must have 'a' at that position. If the template has 'A' at position i, then the string must have any letter except 'a' at that position.

My task is to find a template t such that both a and b match t, but c does not.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template t. That means, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Additionally, c must not match the template t. That means there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to find a template t that satisfies both conditions: a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Let me consider the possible cases for each position i.

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- If a[i] == b[i], then for both a and b to match t, t[i] must be such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i] (since a[i] == b[i]).

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i]. But since a[i] == b[i], this would require that a[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

- However, since a[i] == b[i], if t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which implies that c[i] must be equal to lowercase(t[i]) for c not to match t.

Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then it's impossible for both a and b to match the same template t at position i.

- Because:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then both a[i] and b[i] must equal t[i], but since a[i] != b[i], this can't happen.

- If t[i] is uppercase, then both a[i] and b[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]). But since a[i] != b[i], at least one of them must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, then both a[i] and b[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]). So, if a[i] != b[i], it's possible that one of them is different and the other is the same, but for both to be different, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- So, in this case, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- This imposes a constraint on what lowercase(t[i]) can be: it must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

- Therefore, t[i] must be an uppercase letter that is not equal to a[i] or b[i] in lowercase.

Now, for c not to match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, in summary, for each position i, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] must be uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, no. Let's think again.

If a[i] != b[i], then for both a and b to match t at position i, t[i] must be uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) must not be equal to a[i] or b[i]. Additionally, for c not to match t, c[i] must be equal to lowercase(t[i]).

But since t[i] is uppercase and lowercase(t[i]) is distinct from a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be equal to lowercase(t[i]), which is different from a[i] and b[i], this seems possible only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but c[i] must be equal to lowercase(t[i]), which is different from both a[i] and b[i]. So, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

In positions where a[i] == b[i], there are two subcases:

1. c[i] == a[i]: In this case, I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i], because c would match t if t[i] is lowercase and c[i] == t[i]. So, I must choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and ensure that c[i] == lowercase(t[i]). But c[i] == a[i], and lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], so this is impossible.

   Wait, c[i] == a[i], and I need c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), but lowercase(t[i]) != a[i]. This is a contradiction. So, in this subcase, it's impossible to find such a template.

2. c[i] != a[i]: In this case, I can choose t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i], since c[i] != a[i], so c doesn't match t.

   Alternatively, I can choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]). But since c[i] != a[i], and lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], this could be possible, but it's more complicated.

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] == a[i], it's impossible to find such a template.

- If c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i], which makes a and b match t, and c does not match t because c[i] != a[i].

In positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- I must choose t[i] as uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- This means c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i], and c[i] is chosen as lowercase(t[i]).

Therefore, for the template to exist, for all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] must be different from a[i].

And for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

If these conditions are satisfied, then such a template exists.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a template t:

For each position i from 1 to n:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions hold, then I can construct the template t as follows:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), since c[i] != a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is c[i], since c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], ensuring that a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i].

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] is different from both, then I can set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is c[i]. This way, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], so a and b match t (since they are different from lowercase(t[i])), and c does not match t because c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Yes, that works.

So, in summary, the template exists if and only if:

- For all positions i where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i].

- For all positions i where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions hold, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the example:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's verify:

First test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

Here, a[1]=a, b[1]=b, c[1]=c

Since a[1] != b[1], we need c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], which is true (c != a and c != b). So, "YES", which matches the output.

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Position 1: a[1]=a, b[1]=b, c[1]=a

Since a[1] != b[1], we need c[1] != a and c[1] != b. But c[1]=a, which equals a[1], so condition fails. Hence, "NO".

Third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

We need to check for each position i from 1 to 10:

If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Let's check:

Position 1: a=m, b=l, c=a -> a != b, so c != m and c != l (a != m and a != l), OK.

Position 2: a=a, b=u, c=d -> a != b, c != a and c != u (d != a and d != u), OK.

Position 3: a=t, b=c, c=h -> t != c, c != t and c != c (h != t and h != c), OK.

Position 4: a=h, b=k, c=o -> h != k, c != h and c != k (o != h and o != k), OK.

Position 5: a=f, b=f, c=c -> a == b, c != f (c != f), OK.

Position 6: a o == b o, c d -> o == o, c != o (d != o), OK.

Position 7: a r == b r, c o -> r == r, c != r (o != r), OK.

Position 8: a c == b c, c d -> c == c, c != c (d != c), OK.

Position 9: a e == b e, c e -> e == e, c != e (e != e), FALSE.

So, in position 9, a[i] == b[i], but c[i] == a[i], which violates the condition. Hence, should be "NO", but the output is "YES". Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, looking back at the third test case output, it's "YES", but according to my analysis, it should be "NO" because at position 9, a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i]. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check:

a = m a t h f o r c e s

b = l u c k f o r c e s

c = a d h o c c o d e r

Position 9: a=e, b=e, c=e -> a == b, but c == a, which violates the condition. So, according to my earlier logic, it should be "NO", but the output is "YES". Hmm, maybe my logic is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to set t[i] in such a way that even if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], we can still make it work. Maybe by choosing t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], but then c[i] == a[i], which is not equal to lowercase(t[i]), which is different from a[i]. Wait, this is confusing.

Let me think again.

If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] == a[i], can I still find a template t where t[i] is uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == a[i] != lowercase(t[i]). So, c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which would mean c matches t, which is not what we want.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == a[i], then c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches t, which is not desired. We want c not to match t.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

But according to the sample output, it's "YES", so my earlier logic must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that t[i] can be chosen independently for each position, and there might be a way to set t[i] such that for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I can set t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

But from the above, it seems impossible. So, maybe my initial logic is correct, and the sample output is "YES" due to other positions.

Wait, in the third test case, position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], which should make it "NO" according to my logic, but the sample output is "YES". So, perhaps my logic is incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that only one position needs to make c not match t, while a and b must match t in all positions.

So, perhaps I can set t[i] in such a way that for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], so that c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), meaning c matches t at that position, which is not desired.

But to make c not match t, I need at least one position where c does not match t.

So, perhaps in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I cannot have t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i], but I can set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which would make c match t at that position.

But I need c to not match t in at least one position.

So, perhaps in other positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i], making c not match t at those positions.

But in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], I have to set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which would make c match t at those positions.

Wait, but c needs to not match t in at least one position.

So, as long as there exists at least one position where c does not match t, while a and b match t in all positions, then it's "YES".

In the third test case, position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], which seems problematic, but maybe there are other positions where c does not match t.

Looking back at position 5: a=f, b=f, c=c. Here, a == b, and c != a, so I can set t[i] as lowercase 'f', making a and b match t, and c does not match t because c[i] != 'f'.

Similarly, position 9 has a == b == e, c == e. If I set t[i] as uppercase 'E' (with lowercase 'e' != e), but c[i] == e, which is equal to lowercase(t[i]), so c does not match t at position 9.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase 'E', then lowercase(t[i]) = 'e'. If c[i] == 'e', then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c does not match t at position 9.

Wait, no. According to the rules:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]) to match t.

- So, if t[i] is 'E', lowercase(t[i]) is 'e'. For c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'e'. Since c[i] == 'e', c does not match t at position 9.

Wait, no. If t[i] is 'E', then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'e'. But c[i] == 'e', so c does not match t at position 9.

So, in this case, c does not match t at position 9.

Therefore, even if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], making c not match t at that position.

Wait, but if t[i] is uppercase 'E', and c[i] == 'e', then c does not match t at position 9, because c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, no. According to the rules:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]) to match t.

- So, for c to match t, c[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

- If c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), then c does not match t.

So, in position 9, if I set t[i] as uppercase 'E', then c[i] == 'e' == lowercase(t[i]), so c does not match t at position 9.

Similarly, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], making a and b match t, and c does not match t at those positions.

Therefore, in the third test case, even though position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase 'E', making c not match t at position 9.

Additionally, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], making a and b match t, and c does not match t at those positions.

Therefore, the template exists, and the output is "YES".

So, my initial logic was incorrect. I need to adjust my approach.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions.

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], and if c[i] != a[i], then c does not match t at this position.

- If c[i] == a[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and set lowercase(t[i]) == some other letter, but then c[i] == a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches t at this position.

- But I need c to not match t in at least one position.

- So, if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i], making c not match t at that position.

- Additionally, for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], making c not match t at that position.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- I must set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], and set lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], making c not match t at this position.

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], making a and b match t (since a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]), and c does not match t because c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot find such a template, because I cannot satisfy the condition that a and b both match t.

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then:

- To have a and b both match t, t[i] must be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i].

- But c[i] == a[i], and I need c not to match t.

- If t[i] is uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], then c[i] == a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so c matches t, which is not desired.

- Therefore, in this case, it's impossible to find such a template.

Similarly, if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == b[i], it's also impossible.

Only if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], can I set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], making a and b match t, and c not match t.

Therefore, the conditions for the existence of such a template are:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- It's always possible to set t[i] appropriately to make c not match t, either by setting t[i] as lowercase a[i] if c[i] != a[i], or setting t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], making c not match t if c[i] == a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- It's possible only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, the template exists if and only if, for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Additionally, for positions where a[i] == b[i], it's always possible to make c not match t, regardless of c[i].

Therefore, in the third test case, even though position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I can still set t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], making c not match t at that position.

Hence, the condition reduces to: for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If this condition holds, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the third test case, position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], but earlier I thought it should be "NO", but according to this, as long as for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it's "YES".

Wait, in the third test case, positions where a[i] != b[i] are positions 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, no:

a = m a t h f o r c e s

b = l u c k f o r c e s

c = a d h o c c o d e r

Positions where a[i] != b[i]:

1: m != l

2: a != u

3: t != c

4: h != k

6: r != r (same)

7: c != c (same)

8: e != e (same)

9: s != s (same)

Wait, no, positions 6,7,8,9,10 have a[i] == b[i].

So, positions where a[i] != b[i] are positions 1,2,3,4.

For these positions, I need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Position 1: a=m, b=l, c=a -> c != m and c != l (a != m and a != l), OK.

Position 2: a=a, b=u, c=d -> c != a and c != u (d != a and d != u), OK.

Position 3: a=t, b=c, c=h -> c != t and c != c (h != t but h == c?), wait, c != c is false because h != c. Wait, c[i]=h, b[i]=c, so h != c is false. Wait, no, c[i]=h, b[i]=c, h != c is true.

Wait, a=t, b=c, c=h -> h != t and h != c, which is true.

Position 4: a=h, b=k, c=o -> o != h and o != k, which is true.

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which holds.

Therefore, "YES", which matches the sample output.

In the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

Here, a != b, so need c != a and c != b, which is c != a and c != b, which holds (c=c), so "YES".

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Position 1: a=a, b=b, c=a -> a != b, need c != a and c != b, but c=a equals a, so condition fails. Hence, "NO".

Third test case:

As above, "YES".

Fourth test case:

n=3

a=acc

b=abd

c=abc

Positions where a[i] != b[i]: positions 1,2,3.

Position 1: a=a, b=a, c=a -> a == b, c == a -> problematic.

Wait, a[1]=a, b[1]=a, c[1]=a.

Here, a == b, c == a.

According to the condition, for positions where a == b, it's okay, as long as there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

But in this case, all positions have a == b, and c == a.

Wait, let's see:

Position 1: a=a, b=a, c=a

Set t[1] as uppercase 'A', so lowercase(t[1])='a'. Then, c[1]=a == lowercase(t[1]), so c does not match t at position 1.

Therefore, "YES".

But according to the sample output, it's "NO". Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

a=acc

b=abd

c=abc

Wait, positions where a != b:

Position 1: a=a, b=a -> a == b

Position 2: a=c, b=b -> c != b

Position 3: a=c, b=d -> c != d

Wait, position 2 and 3 have a != b.

For these positions, need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Position 2: c=c, a=c, b=b -> c != c is false, so condition fails.

Position 3: c=c, a=c, b=d -> c != c is false, so condition fails.

Therefore, "NO", which matches the sample output.

So, in summary, the condition is:

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], it's always possible to make c not match t by appropriately choosing t[i].

Therefore, in the code, I can iterate through all positions where a[i] != b[i], and check if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If this holds for all such positions, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the third test case, position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i], but since there are positions where a[i] != b[i], and for those positions c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it's "YES".

Hence, the condition is sufficient.

Therefore, the code should be:

For each test case:

Read n, a, b, c.

Check for positions where a[i] != b[i]:

If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then "NO".

Else, "YES".

Implementing this should match the sample outputs.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

possible = False

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

This seems to be checking:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], set possible = True.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], set possible = True.

- Finally, if possible is True, print "YES", else "NO".

This aligns with the condition that there exists at least one position where c does not match t, while a and b match t in all positions.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. It's not just that there exists such a position, but that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, the provided code seems to be checking for the existence of at least one position where c does not match t, but it doesn't ensure that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, let's see.

In the code:

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

So, it's setting possible to True if:

- There exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- There exists at least one position where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, if possible is True, it prints "YES", else "NO".

But according to my earlier analysis, the correct condition is:

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- And, there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking for the existence of at least one position where c does not match t, but it's not ensuring that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then "YES", else "NO".

But in the code, it's checking if there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

This seems similar to what I described.

Wait, but in the third test case, where a=i, b=j, c=k, it should be "YES", but according to the sample, it's "YES".

Wait, no, the third test case in the sample is "YES", which matches the code's logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Let me think about the logical condition again.

To have a template t where a and b match t, and c does not match t, we need:

- For all positions i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must equal t[i], and c[i] must not equal t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

But this seems too restrictive.

Alternatively, as per my earlier analysis, the template exists if:

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- And, for positions where a[i] == b[i], it's always possible to make c not match t by choosing t[i] appropriately.

Hence, the code should check that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If this holds, then "YES", else "NO".

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect because it checks for the existence of at least one position where c does not match t, but doesn't ensure that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in the code, it sets possible to True if:

- There exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- There exists at least one position where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, it prints "YES" if possible is True.

But according to the correct condition, I need to ensure that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

I think the correct approach is:

- Iterate through all positions where a[i] != b[i], and ensure that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- If this condition holds for all such positions, then "YES", else "NO".

Hence, the correct code should be:

for each test case:

read n, a, b, c

flag = True

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != b[i]:

if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

flag = False

break

if flag:

print("YES")

else:

print("NO")

This ensures that for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, but string `c` does not.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Matching Rules**:
   - If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` must match it exactly.
   - If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` must be different from its lowercase version.

2. **Conditions for Template Existence**:
   - For positions where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, we can always choose a template that makes `c[i]` not match.
   - For positions where `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `c[i]` must not equal either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for the template to exist.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Check that for all positions where `a[i]` != `b[i]`, `c[i]` != `a[i]` and `c[i]` != `b[i]`.
   - If this condition holds for all such positions, then it's possible to create such a template; otherwise, it's not.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        flag = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    flag = False
                    break
        print('YES' if flag else 'NO')

func_1()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, read `n` (length of strings), and strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Template Existence Check**:
  - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
    - If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, ensure `c[i]` != `a[i]` and `c[i]` != `b[i]`.
    - If this condition fails for any such position, set `flag` to `False`.
- **Output Result**: Print 'YES' if `flag` is `True`, indicating that such a template exists; otherwise, print 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the template constraints are correctly applied and efficiently checked for each test case.
