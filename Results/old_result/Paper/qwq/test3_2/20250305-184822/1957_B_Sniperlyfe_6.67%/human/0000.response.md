Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR-ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to have the bitwise OR of all these n numbers have as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of all the numbers in the sequence. That means I want as many bits set to 1 in the OR result as possible.

Given that OR is a operation that sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result, I need to have as many bit positions as possible where at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

Given that, I should try to spread the 1s across different bit positions among the n numbers.

Wait, but I also need to ensure that the sum of all the numbers is k.

So, I need to distribute k among n numbers such that their sum is k, and the bitwise OR of these numbers has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 3

Possible sequences:

- [1, 2]: sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3, which in binary is 11, having two 1s.

- [0, 3]: sum is 3, and 0 | 3 = 3, which is the same.

- [3, 0]: same as above.

- [1, 2] is already considered.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1s in the OR result is 2.

Another example:

n = 1, k = 5

Sequence: [5], which in binary is 101, having two 1s.

No other sequences since n=1.

Another example from the fourth test case:

n = 6, k = 51

Sequence: [3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]

Let's compute the OR of these numbers:

3 in binary: 00011

1: 00001

1: 00001

32: 100000

2: 00010

12: 01100

OR-ing them together: 11111, which is 31 in decimal, having five 1s.

Apparently, they achieved five 1s in the OR result.

But what's the maximum possible?

Well, the maximum possible number of 1s in the OR result is the total number of bits in the binary representation of the numbers, but realistically, it's limited by the value of k and n.

Wait, no. Since the numbers can be up to k, and n is the number of numbers, the OR result can have up to the number of bits in k, I think.

Wait, actually, the OR result can have up to the maximum number of bits in any of the numbers, but since we're dealing with non-negative integers, and k can be up to 1e9, which is 30 bits, I guess the maximum number of 1s possible is 30.

But in practice, it's limited by the sum k and the number n.

So, the problem is to maximize the number of 1s in the OR of the sequence, given that the sum is k and there are n numbers.

Now, to construct such a sequence, I need a strategy to set as many bits to 1 in the OR result as possible.

One way to do this is to set different bits in different numbers, so that when OR-ed together, those bits are all set to 1.

But I also need to make sure that the sum of the numbers is k.

So, I need to distribute the value k among the n numbers in such a way that as many unique bits as possible are set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

Let me think about how to do that.

One approach could be to assign the smallest possible numbers to the first n-1 numbers, each with a unique bit set, and then assign the remaining value to the last number.

Wait, but the smallest possible numbers with unique bits set would be 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on, up to n-1 numbers.

But if n is large, say n=2*10^5, and k is up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to do this.

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, overall, it's manageable.

So, the plan is:

- For each test case, assign n-1 numbers, each with a unique bit set, starting from the least significant bit.

- Choose the smallest possible bits for the first n-1 numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.

- Then, assign the remaining value to the last number.

- Ensure that the sum is k.

Wait, but if I assign n-1 numbers with unique bits set, starting from the least significant bit, I need to make sure that these bits are not set in the last number, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.

Wait, no. Actually, since OR sets a bit to 1 if any of the numbers has that bit set, I want as many bits as possible to be set in at least one of the numbers.

So, assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set will set those bits to 1 in the OR result.

Then, the last number can have any bits set, but I need to make sure that it doesn't set any new bits unless necessary to reach the sum k.

Wait, but if I assign n-1 numbers with unique bits set, and then assign the last number the remaining value, that remaining value might set additional bits, which could potentially set more bits in the OR result.

But I want to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result, so I need to make sure that as many bits as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

So, perhaps assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set, and then assigning the last number the remaining value, would achieve that.

But I need to verify if this is indeed the optimal approach.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2, k=3.

Assign the first number as 1 (binary 01), the second number as 2 (binary 10), sum is 3, and OR is 3 (binary 11), which has two 1s.

Alternatively, assign the first number as 3 (binary 11), and the second number as 0 (binary 00), sum is 3, and OR is 3 (binary 11), same number of 1s.

Another way is [2,1], which is same as [1,2].

So, in this case, both approaches give the same number of 1s in the OR result.

Another example: n=2, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: 5 in binary is 101, 0 is 000, OR is 101, which has two 1s.

- [4,1]: 4 is 100, 1 is 001, OR is 101, same as above.

- [3,2]: 3 is 011, 2 is 010, OR is 011, which has two 1s.

So, in this case, all these sequences give the same number of 1s in the OR result.

So, it seems that assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value works, and it maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Let me consider another example: n=3, k=7.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2,4]: OR is 1 | 10 | 100 = 111, which has three 1s.

- [3,3,1]: OR is 11 | 11 | 01 = 11, which has two 1s.

- [7,0,0]: OR is 111 | 000 | 000 = 111, same as the first sequence.

So, in this case, both [1,2,4] and [7,0,0] give the same number of 1s in the OR result, which is three.

Another sequence: [5,2,0]: 101 | 10 | 000 = 111, same as above.

So, it seems that assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value works, and it maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

But I need to think about whether there's a better way or if this is indeed optimal.

Let me consider a case where k is smaller than 2^{n-1} - 1.

Wait, no, in the previous examples, k was larger than 2^{n-1} - 1.

Wait, for n=3, k=7, which is larger than 2^{3-1} - 1 = 3.

Wait, 2^{n-1} - 1 is the sum of the first n-1 unique bits set numbers.

In this case, for n=3, 2^{2} - 1 = 3, which is less than k=7.

So, in this case, assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value works.

But what if k is less than 2^{n-1} - 1?

Let me consider n=3, k=3.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2,0]: OR is 1 | 10 | 00 = 11, which has two 1s.

- [3,0,0]: OR is 11 | 00 | 00 = 11, same as above.

- [1,1,1]: OR is 1 | 1 | 1 = 1, which has one 1.

So, in this case, assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value gives two 1s in the OR result, which is better than [1,1,1] which gives only one 1.

Another sequence: [2,1,0], same as above.

So, again, it seems that assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value is a good strategy.

Another example: n=4, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2,4, -2], but negative numbers are not allowed.

Wait, non-negative integers, so k=5, n=4.

Possible sequences:

- [1,1,1,2]: OR is 1 | 1 | 1 | 10 = 11, which has two 1s.

- [1,2,0,2]: OR is 1 | 10 | 00 | 10 = 11, same as above.

- [3,1,1,0]: OR is 11 | 1 | 1 | 00 = 11, same as above.

- [5,0,0,0]: OR is 101 | 000 | 000 | 000 = 101, which has two 1s.

So, in this case, it's not possible to get more than two 1s in the OR result.

Is there a sequence that can give more than two 1s in the OR result?

Let me see: [1,2,1,1]: OR is 1 | 10 | 1 | 1 = 11, same as above.

[3,1,1,0]: same as above.

[4,1,0,0]: OR is 100 | 1 | 00 | 00 = 101, which has two 1s.

[5,0,0,0]: OR is 101, same as above.

So, seems like two is the maximum number of 1s in the OR result for n=4 and k=5.

But according to the strategy, assigning n-1=3 numbers with unique bits set would be [1,2,4], sum=7, which is more than k=5, so that's not possible.

Therefore, in this case, I need to adjust the strategy.

So, when k is less than the sum of the first n-1 unique bits set numbers, I can't assign n-1 numbers with unique bits set.

In this case, for n=4, the sum of [1,2,4] is 7, which is greater than k=5.

So, I need to find another way.

One approach is to assign as many unique bits as possible without exceeding k.

So, start with the smallest unique bits: 1, 2, 4, etc., and keep adding them until the sum exceeds k, then assign the remaining value to the last number.

In this case, for n=4 and k=5:

- Assign [1,2,0,2]: sum is 5, OR is 11, which has two 1s.

- Assign [1,1,1,2]: sum is 5, OR is 11, same as above.

- Assign [3,1,1,0]: sum is 5, OR is 11, same as above.

So, again, two 1s is the maximum achievable.

Another example: n=5, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2,0,0,2]: sum is 5, OR is 11, two 1s.

- [1,1,1,1,1]: sum is 5, OR is 1, one 1.

- [3,1,1,0,0]: sum is 5, OR is 11, two 1s.

- [4,1,0,0,0]: sum is 5, OR is 101, two 1s.

So, again, two 1s is the maximum.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy of assigning n-1 numbers with unique bits set and the last number with the remaining value works when the sum of those n-1 unique bits is less than or equal to k.

When the sum exceeds k, I need to adjust by not assigning all n-1 unique bits, but as many as possible without exceeding k.

So, a better strategy might be:

- Find the largest m <= n such that the sum of the first m unique bits (1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{m-1}) is less than or equal to k.

- Assign these m numbers with 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{m-1}.

- Assign the remaining n - m numbers with 0.

- Assign the remaining value (k - sum of the first m unique bits) to one of the m numbers.

This way, the OR result will have m bits set to 1, plus any additional bits set in the last number if needed.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, even when m < n-1, the maximum number of 1s in the OR result was m.

But in the case where m >= n-1, it's n-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to set m = n-1, and if the sum of the first m unique bits is less than or equal to k, then assign those m numbers and the last number with the remaining value.

If the sum exceeds k, then find the largest m where the sum of the first m unique bits is <= k.

But in practice, since the sum of the first m unique bits is 2^m - 1, I need to find the largest m where 2^m - 1 <= k.

Then assign m numbers with 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{m-1}, and the remaining n - m numbers with 0, and assign the remaining value (k - (2^m - 1)) to one of the m numbers.

This should maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.

Let me verify this with the earlier examples.

For n=2, k=3:

- m=1: sum=1 <=3, assign [1,2], sum=3, OR=3 (11), two 1s.

- m=2: sum=3 <=3, assign [1,2], sum=3, OR=3 (11), two 1s.

Same as before.

For n=3, k=3:

- m=2: sum=3 <=3, assign [1,2,0], sum=3, OR=3 (11), two 1s.

- m=3: sum=7 >3, so m=2.

Same as before.

For n=4, k=5:

- m=2: sum=3 <=5, assign [1,2,0,2], sum=5, OR=3 (11), two 1s.

- m=3: sum=7 >5, so m=2.

Same as before.

Seems consistent.

Another example: n=6, k=51.

From the example, they provided [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51 and OR to 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Let me see what m would be in this case.

m=5: sum=1+2+4+8+16=31 <=51.

m=6: sum=1+2+4+8+16+32=63 >51.

So, m=5.

Assign [1,2,4,8,16,0], sum=31, need to add 20 to one of the first m numbers.

Say, assign [1+20=21,2,4,8,16,0], sum=51.

OR is 21 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 0 = 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Same as the example's sequence.

But in the example, they chose [3,1,1,32,2,12], which also OR to 31.

So, different assignments but same OR result.

So, the strategy seems valid.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- For each test case, find m such that m is the largest integer where sum of first m unique bits (2^0 to 2^{m-1}) is <=k.

- Assign the first m numbers as 1,2,4,...,2^{m-1}.

- Assign the remaining n - m numbers as 0.

- Assign the remaining value (k - (2^m -1)) to one of the first m numbers.

- Output the sequence.

But, in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which is different from [21,2,4,8,16,0], but both achieve the same OR result.

So, multiple sequences are possible, but I just need to output any one that satisfies the conditions.

So, in implementation, I can choose to assign the remaining value to the last of the m numbers, or any other.

I think assigning to the first one is simplest.

Now, to find m, I can find the largest m where 2^m -1 <=k.

This can be done by finding the floor of log2(k+1).

Wait, because 2^m -1 <=k => 2^m <=k+1 => m <= log2(k+1).

So, m = floor(log2(k+1)).

But need to handle cases where k+1 is a power of 2, etc.

Wait, in Python, I can use bit manipulation to find m.

Alternatively, I can iterate to find m.

But for efficiency, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases <=2e5, it's manageable.

So, in code, I can implement func_1 as follows:

- Calculate m as the largest integer where (1 << m) -1 <=k.

- Assign the first m numbers as 1,2,4,...,1<<(m-1).

- Assign the remaining n - m numbers as 0.

- Assign the remaining value (k - ((1<<m)-1)) to the last of the m numbers.

- Return the sequence.

Wait, but in the example, they assigned the remaining value to one of the numbers, but it's flexible.

But to make it simple, assigning to the last of the m numbers is fine.

Wait, but in the example, they assigned to different numbers.

But for simplicity, assigning to the last of the m numbers is fine.

Let me verify with n=6, k=51.

m=5, since (1<<5)-1=31 <=51.

Assign [1,2,4,8,16,0], sum=31.

Remaining value=51-31=20.

Assign to the last of the m numbers: 16+20=36.

So, sequence becomes [1,2,4,8,36,0], sum=1+2+4+8+36+0=51.

OR is 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 36 | 0 = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 32 | 0 = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 32 = 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 = 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Same as before.

So, this works.

Another way is to assign the remaining value to the first number.

For example, [21,2,4,8,16,0], sum=21+2+4+8+16+0=51.

OR is 21 | 2 | 4 | 8 |16 |0 = 31 (11111), same as above.

So, either way is fine.

In the example, they chose [3,1,1,32,2,12], which also sums to 51 and OR to 31.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Hence, in code, I can choose to assign the remaining value to the last of the m numbers.

Now, to implement this, I need to calculate m as the largest integer where (1<<m)-1 <=k.

I can calculate m as floor(log2(k+1)).

In Python, I can use bit_length minus one to find m.

Wait, in Python, integers have a bit_length() method, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.

So, for k+1, bit_length() gives the number of bits needed to represent k+1.

Then, m = (k+1).bit_length() -1.

Because 2^m -1 <=k => m <= log2(k+1), and m = floor(log2(k+1)).

But need to handle the case where k+1 is a power of 2.

Wait, let's see:

For k=3, k+1=4, bit_length=3, m=2.

Sum of first m unique bits is 1+2=3 <=3.

For k=5, k+1=6, bit_length=3, m=2.

Sum of first m unique bits is 1+2=3 <=5.

For k=7, k+1=8, bit_length=4, m=3.

Sum of first m unique bits is 1+2+4=7 <=7.

For k=15, k+1=16, bit_length=5, m=4.

Sum of first m unique bits is 1+2+4+8=15 <=15.

So, seems correct.

Now, in code, I can implement m as (k+1).bit_length() -1.

Then, assign the first m numbers as 1,2,4,...,1<<(m-1).

Assign the remaining n - m numbers as 0.

Then, assign the remaining value (k - ((1<<m)-1)) to the last of the m numbers.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=6, k=51, m=5, sum of first m unique bits is 31, remaining value is 20, assign to the last of m numbers: 16+20=36.

So, sequence is [1,2,4,8,36,0].

But in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which also sums to 51 and OR to 31.

So, their assignment is different, but it's still valid.

Hence, my approach is valid.

Now, in code, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, but sum of n over all test cases <=2e5, it's manageable.

I can read all test cases first, but in Python, it's better to read them one by one.

Implement func_1 to generate the sequence as described.

Now, looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

results = []

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

result = func_1(n, k)

results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))

print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):

nums = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1

k -= nums[i]

nums[-1] += k

return nums

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

In func_1:

- It initializes nums as [0]*n.

- Then, for each i in range(n), it sets nums[i] to (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1.

- Then subtracts that value from k.

- Finally, adds the remaining k to nums[-1].

Wait, this seems incorrect.

Wait, k.bit_length() -1 gives the position of the highest set bit in k.

(1 << (k.bit_length() -1)) -1 gives a number with all bits set below the highest set bit of k.

Wait, let's see with an example.

Take k=5, which is 101 in binary, bit_length=3.

So, (1 << (3-1)) -1 = (1<<2)-1 = 4-1=3.

So, nums[i]=3 for each i.

Then, k -=3, so k=2.

Then, nums[-1] +=2, so nums[-1]=3+2=5.

So, sequence is [3,3,5] if n=3.

Wait, but n=3, k=5.

Sum is 3+3+5=11, which is more than k=5.

Wait, that's wrong.

Wait, in the code, it's subtracting nums[i] from k each time, so for n=3, k=5:

- nums[0]=3, k=5-3=2

- nums[1]=3, k=2-3=-1

- nums[2]=3, k=-1-3=-4

- Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[2]=3 + (-4)=-1, which is invalid.

Wait, but the problem allows non-negative integers, so negative numbers are invalid.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1

Wait, maybe it's (1 << (k.bit_length() -1)) -1.

Due to operator precedence, it's (1 << (k.bit_length() -1)) -1.

But in Python, left shift has higher precedence than subtraction, so it's correct.

But in the earlier example, for k=5, which is 101, bit_length=3.

So, (1 << 2) -1 =4-1=3.

So, nums[0]=3, k=5-3=2.

Then nums[1]= (1 << 2) -1=3, k=2-3=-1.

Then nums[2]= (1 << (-1).bit_length() -1) -1.

Wait, (-1).bit_length() is 0 in Python, I think.

Wait, no, in Python, negative integers have bit_length equal to the bit_length of their absolute value.

Wait, checking documentation: In Python, bit_length() for negative integers is the same as for their absolute value.

Wait, no, actually, for negative integers, bit_length() is the same as for their absolute value.

So, (-1).bit_length() is 1, because -1 in two's complement is all 1s, and the bit_length is the number of bits needed to represent the number, which is infinite for negative numbers, but in Python, it's defined as the bit_length of the absolute value.

Wait, no, in Python, negative integers have bit_length equal to the bit_length of their absolute value.

Wait, checking:

In Python 3.2 and above, bit_length() is defined for integers, including negative ones, and for negative integers, it's the bit_length of their absolute value.

So, (-1).bit_length() is 1.

So, in the second iteration, k=-1, (1 << (-1).bit_length() -1) -1 = (1 << (1 -1)) -1 = (1 << 0) -1 =1 -1=0.

So, nums[1]=0, k=-1-0=-1.

Then, nums[2]=(1 << (-1).bit_length() -1) -1 = (1 <<1 -1)-1=(1<<0)-1=1-1=0.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[2]=0 + (-1)=-1, which is invalid.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

Moreover, in the first iteration itself, when k=5, which is 101, bit_length=3, so (1 <<2)-1=3.

Then, k=5-3=2.

Next iteration, k=2, which is 10, bit_length=2, so (1<<1)-1=1.

Then, nums[1]=1, k=2-1=1.

Next iteration, k=1, bit_length=1, (1<<0)-1=0.

nums[2]=0, k=1-0=1.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[2]=0+1=1.

So, sequence is [3,1,1], sum=5, which is correct.

OR is 3|1|1=3, which is 11, two 1s.

But in earlier examples, for n=3, k=5, we can have [3,1,1], OR=3 (11), two 1s, or [5,0,0], OR=5 (101), which has two 1s.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But in the earlier analysis, I thought that m should be floor(log2(k+1)), which for k=5 is m=3 (since 2^3 -1=7 >5, so m=2).

Wait, earlier I thought m=2 for n=3, k=5.

But in this code, it's assigning m=3, since it's iterating n times, and in each iteration, setting nums[i]=(1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1.

Wait, but in this specific case, it's giving [3,1,1], which sums to 5, and OR is 3 (11), which has two 1s.

But according to my earlier strategy, m=2, assign [1,2,0], sum=3, then add remaining 2 to one of them, say [1,2,2], sum=5, OR is 1|2|2=3 (11), same as above.

So, both approaches give the same number of 1s in the OR result.

Hence, perhaps this approach is also valid.

But I need to verify if this approach always maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

Let me consider another example.

Take n=4, k=5.

According to my earlier strategy, m=2, since (1<<2)-1=3 <=5, and (1<<3)-1=7>5.

So, assign [1,2,0,0], sum=3, add remaining 2 to one of the first m numbers, say [1,4,0,0], sum=5, OR is 1|4|0|0=5 (101), which has two 1s.

Alternatively, [3,1,1,0], sum=5, OR is 3|1|1|0=3 (11), which has two 1s.

According to the given code:

n=4, k=5.

First iteration: k=5, bit_length=3, (1<<2)-1=3, nums[0]=3, k=5-3=2.

Second iteration: k=2, bit_length=2, (1<<1)-1=1, nums[1]=1, k=2-1=1.

Third iteration: k=1, bit_length=1, (1<<0)-1=0, nums[2]=0, k=1-0=1.

Fourth iteration: k=1, bit_length=1, (1<<0)-1=0, nums[3]=0, k=1-0=1.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[3]=0+1=1.

Hence, sequence is [3,1,0,1], sum=5, OR is 3|1|0|1=3 (11), two 1s.

Same as earlier approaches.

So, in this case, it's also achieving two 1s in the OR result.

Another example: n=1, k=5.

According to the code:

nums[0]=(1<<5.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<2)-1=3, k=5-3=2.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[0]=3+2=5.

Sequence is [5], OR=5 (101), two 1s.

Same as direct assignment.

Another example: n=2, k=3.

According to the code:

nums[0]=(1<<3.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<1)-1=1, k=3-1=2.

nums[1]=(1<<2.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<1)-1=1, k=2-1=1.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[1]=1+1=2.

Sequence is [1,2], sum=3, OR=3 (11), two 1s.

Same as expected.

Hence, this approach seems to be working correctly in these examples.

So, perhaps this approach is also valid for maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.

But I need to understand why this works.

In the given code, for each number in the sequence, it sets it to (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1, which is essentially the maximum number less than 2^(k.bit_length()-1).

Wait, no.

Wait, (1 << k.bit_length() -1) -1 is equal to (1 << (k.bit_length() -1)) -1, which is a number with the first (k.bit_length()-1) bits set to 1.

For example, if k=5, bit_length=3, so (1<<2)-1=3, which is 11 in binary.

Then, it subtracts this value from k, and repeats for the next number.

Then, finally adds the remaining k to the last number.

So, in each step, it's assigning the maximum possible value that is less than 2^(k.bit_length()-1).

I'm not entirely sure why this maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

Perhaps it's greedily setting as many low bits as possible in the earlier numbers, and then assigning the remaining to the last number.

But I need to think about whether this always results in the maximum number of 1s in the OR result.

Let me consider a case where n=2, k=6.

According to the code:

nums[0]=(1<<6.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<2)-1=3, k=6-3=3.

nums[1]=(1<<3.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<1)-1=1, k=3-1=2.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[1]=1+2=3.

Sequence is [3,3], sum=6, OR is 3|3=3 (11), two 1s.

But, according to my earlier strategy, m=3 since (1<<3)-1=7>6, so m=2.

Assign [1,2,0], sum=3, add remaining 3 to one of them, say [4,2,0], sum=6, OR is 4|2|0=6 (110), which has two 1s.

Same as the code's approach.

Another sequence: [5,1], sum=6, OR=5|1=5 (101), two 1s.

So, again, two 1s.

Is there a way to get more than two 1s in the OR result?

Well, 6 in binary is 110, which has two 1s.

5 is 101, also two 1s.

3 is 11, two 1s.

So, seems like two is the maximum achievable.

Hence, in this case, it's correct.

Another example: n=3, k=7.

According to the code:

nums[0]=(1<<7.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<2)-1=3, k=7-3=4.

nums[1]=(1<<4.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<2)-1=3, k=4-3=1.

nums[2]=(1<<1.bit_length()-1)-1=(1<<0)-1=0, k=1-0=1.

Then, nums[-1] +=k, so nums[2]=0+1=1.

Sequence is [3,3,1], sum=7, OR is 3|3|1=3 (11), two 1s.

But according to my earlier strategy, m=3 since (1<<3)-1=7<=7.

Assign [1,2,4], sum=7, OR is 1|2|4=7 (111), which has three 1s.

So, in this case, my earlier strategy achieves three 1s, while the code's approach achieves only two 1s.

Hence, the code's approach is not optimal in this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, in the fourth example, they have n=6, k=51, and the sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], which OR to 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

According to my earlier strategy, m=5 since (1<<5)-1=31<=51.

Assign [1,2,4,8,16,0], sum=31, add remaining 20 to one of them, say [1,2,4,8,36,0], OR is 1|2|4|8|36|0=36|8|4|2|1=36|8=44|4=44|2=44|1=45 (101101), which has four 1s.

Wait, 45 in binary is 101101, which has four 1s.

But in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which OR to 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

So, my earlier strategy didn't achieve the maximum possible.

Hence, my earlier strategy might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 3 is 000011

1 is 000001

1 is 000001

32 is 100000

2 is 000010

12 is 001100

OR-ing them: 100000 | 000011 | 000001 | 000001 | 001100 | 000010 = 101111, which is 47 (101111), which has five 1s.

Wait, 47 in binary is 101111, which has five 1s.

But according to my earlier strategy, [1,2,4,8,36,0], OR is 1|2|4|8|36|0=1|2|4|8|32|4=1|2|4|8|32=31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Wait, 36 in binary is 100100, which is 32|4.

So, 1|2|4|8|32|4=1|2|4|8|32=31 (11111), which has five 1s.

So, in this case, it's achieving five 1s.

Earlier, I thought it was four, but actually, it's five.

Hence, my earlier strategy can achieve the same number of 1s as the example.

But in the earlier case with n=3, k=7, my strategy achieved three 1s, while the code's approach achieved only two 1s.

Hence, the code's approach is not optimal.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't always maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
