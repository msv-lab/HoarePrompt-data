Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I need to handle multiple queries. Each query gives me a range [l, r], and I need to find two indices i and j within that range where the elements are different, i.e., a_i ≠ a_j. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 -1.

First, I need to understand the constraints. The array can be up to 2*10^5 elements long, and there can be up to 2*10^5 queries per test case. Since there are up to 10^4 test cases, but the sum of n and q across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably O(n log n) or better.

Let me think about how to approach this. For each query, I need to check if there are at least two different elements in the subarray from l to r. If there are, I need to find any such pair; otherwise, return -1 -1.

One straightforward way is to iterate through the subarray for each query and find the first two elements that are different. But with n and q up to 2*10^5, this would be O(n*q), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way. Maybe I can preprocess the array to find where changes occur, like where consecutive elements are different, and then for each query, check if there's at least one such change within the range.

Let me consider storing the indices where a_i ≠ a_{i+1}. Then, for each query [l, r], I can check if there's at least one such index in that range.

But the problem asks for two specific indices with different values, not just whether such a pair exists. So, I need to not only detect if there's a change but also select appropriate indices.

Wait, perhaps I can group consecutive equal elements together. Like, find runs of the same value and store the start and end indices of each run. Then, for each query [l, r], if there's more than one run within this range, I can pick indices from different runs. If there's only one run, that means all elements are the same within [l, r], so I should return -1 -1.

Yes, that sounds promising.

So, first, I'll iterate through the array and identify the runs of consecutive equal elements. I'll store tuples of (start_index, end_index, value) for each run.

Then, for each query [l, r], I'll find all the runs that fall within this range. If there's more than one run, I can pick one index from the first run and one from the second run. If there's only one run, I'll return -1 -1.

To find the runs within [l, r], I can use binary search on the start indices of the runs since the runs are non-overlapping and sorted by start index.

Let's think about how to implement this.

First, iterate through the array and group consecutive equal elements:

Initialize an empty list for runs.

Set the current value to the first element, and set start index to 1.

Then, iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1:

If a[i] != current value, then add a run from start to i with current value.

Set current value to a[i], and set start to i+1.

After the loop, add the last run from start to n with the last value.

Now, I have a list of runs, each with start, end, and value.

For each query [l, r], I need to find runs that overlap with [l, r].

Since runs are non-overlapping and sorted by start index, I can use binary search to find the first run that starts >= l, and the last run that starts <= r.

Then, check how many runs are in that subset.

If there's more than one run, pick one index from the first run and one from the second run.

If there's only one run, check if its end is within [l, r]. If it is, and it's the only run, return -1 -1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the runs are completely within [l, r]. Actually, since runs are non-overlapping and sorted, I can find the first run where start >= l, and the last run where start <= r.

Then, if there's more than one such run, I can pick indices from the first and second runs.

If there's only one run, I need to check if within that run, there are different elements. But since the run is of consecutive equal elements, there are no different elements within the run. So, return -1 -1.

Wait, but the run is of equal elements, so if there's only one run in [l, r], all elements are the same.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: The entire array has all elements the same.

In this case, there will be only one run. For any query [l, r], since there's only one run, I should return -1 -1.

Edge case 2: The array has all elements different.

Each element is its own run. For any query [l, r] where l < r, there should be multiple runs, so I can pick any two indices.

Edge case 3: The array has alternating elements, like 1,2,1,2,...

Each pair is a different run.

For queries that span multiple pairs, I can pick indices from different pairs.

For queries that span exactly one pair, I need to see if the pair has two different elements. But in this case, each run is of single elements, so [l, r] spanning one run would mean all elements are the same, which isn't true in this pattern. Wait, in this pattern, each run is of length 1, so any [l, r] with l < r would include multiple runs, so I can pick indices from different runs.

Edge case 4: [l, r] of size 1.

In this case, since there's only one index, I can't find two different elements, so I should return -1 -1.

Wait, but according to the problem, l <= i,j <= r, and i and j can be the same index? No, it says i and j are indices in the range [l, r], and a_i ≠ a_j. So, i and j must be different indices where the elements are different.

Hence, for [l, r] of size 1, I can't have two different indices, so I should return -1 -1.

Wait, but the problem allows i and j to be the same index if a_i ≠ a_j, but actually, it says a_i ≠ a_j, and i and j are in [l, r]. But indices i and j must be distinct, as per the problem statement. Wait, let's check the problem statement again.

"find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that:

- l ≤ i ≤ r;

- l ≤ j ≤ r;

- a_i ≠ a_j."

So, i and j are distinct indices within [l, r], and their values are different.

Hence, for [l, r] of size 1, I can't have two different indices, so I should return -1 -1.

Another thing to consider: [l, r] of size 2.

If a_l ≠ a_r, I can pick i=l and j=r.

If a_l == a_r, then I need to check if there are any other indices in between (though in this case, r = l+1, so no in between). Hence, return -1 -1.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I'll need to store the runs as tuples: (start, end, value).

Then, for each query [l, r], I'll use binary search to find all runs where start >= l and start <= r.

Since runs are non-overlapping and sorted by start, I can use bisect_left and bisect_right to find the subset of runs within [l, r].

Then, if there's more than one run, pick i from the first run and j from the second run.

If there's only one run, check if its end is <= r. If so, return -1 -1, since all elements in [l, r] are the same.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the run ends within r.

Wait, actually, the run may start at some position s and end at e, where s >= l and e <= r.

So, for the runs that overlap with [l, r], I need to consider their start and end positions within [l, r].

Wait, maybe it's better to collect all runs that have start >= l and start <= r, and then among those, consider their end positions <= r.

Then, if there's more than one such run, pick i and j from different runs.

If there's only one run, and its end <= r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same, so return -1 -1.

Also, need to handle the case where [l, r] is of size 1, which is already covered by returning -1 -1.

Another consideration: when [l, r] spans multiple runs, I need to make sure that the runs are completely within [l, r], or partially overlapping.

Wait, actually, since runs are non-overlapping and cover the entire array, any run that starts >= l and starts <= r is partially or fully within [l, r].

I need to consider the runs that start >= l and start <= r, and whose end <= r.

Wait, no. If a run starts >= l and starts <= r, and end >= r, it spans beyond r, but I need to consider only up to r.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the runs that start >= l and start <= r, and for each run, take the intersection with [l, r].

But to keep it simple, perhaps I can collect all runs that start >= l and start <= r, and end <= r.

Wait, no, because a run may start within [l, r] but end after r.

In that case, I need to consider only the part of the run that is within [l, r].

But for the purpose of finding different elements, I just need to know if there's more than one run within [l, r].

Because if there's more than one run, that means there are different elements in [l, r].

If there's only one run, all elements in that run are the same.

Hence, I can proceed as follows:

- For each query [l, r], find the number of runs that start >= l and start <= r.

- If there is more than one such run, pick i from the first run and j from the second run.

- If there is only one run, and its end <= r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same, so return -1 -1.

- If there is only one run, but its end > r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same as that run, so return -1 -1.

Wait, no. If there is only one run and its start >= l and start <= r, and end > r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same as that run, so return -1 -1.

Hence, in code, for each query [l, r], find the runs where start >= l and start <= r.

If there is more than one such run, pick i from the first run and j from the second run.

If there is only one run, and its end > r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same, so return -1 -1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the run's start <= r and start >= l.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use bisect_left and bisect_right on the start indices of the runs.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Preprocess the runs:

- Iterate through the array, group consecutive equal elements.

- Store runs as (start, end, value).

- For each query [l, r]:

- Use bisect_left to find the first run where start >= l.

- Use bisect_right to find the position where start > r.

- The runs within [l, r] are arr[first_index : last_index].

- If there is more than one run, pick i from the first run and j from the second run.

- If there is only one run, and its end <= r, then all elements are the same, return -1 -1.

- If there is only one run, and its end > r, then all elements in [l, r] are the same, return -1 -1.

Wait, but in the preprocessing, I need to make sure that the runs cover the entire array.

Also, I need to handle the case where [l, r] is entirely within one run.

Now, considering that, I think my approach is sound.

Let me think about implementing this in code.

I need to be careful with the indexing, as the problem uses 1-based indexing.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that the sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient implementation.

I should read all input at once and process it accordingly.

Now, looking at the given code, I need to evaluate if it's correct.

Let me look at the given code.

It seems that the code attempts to implement the approach I just described.

Let's go through it step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, tc, and then for each test case, calls func_1().

In func_1():

- Reads N, the length of the array.

- Reads the array nums.

- Initializes s and e to 0.

- Sets num to nums[0].

- Initializes an empty list arr.

- Appends -1 to nums.

- Iterates from 0 to N:

- If nums[i] != num, appends (1 + s, i, num) to arr.

- Sets s to i.

- Sets num to nums[i].

- Sets LA to len(arr) - 1.

- Reads the number of queries.

- For each query:

- Reads l and r.

- Computes eli using bisect_left on arr with (l, 0, 0).

- Gets (s, e, _) from arr[min(eli, LA)].

- If s > l:

- If s == 1 or s > r, print -1 -1.

- Else, print (s - 1, s).

- Elif e >= r:

- Print -1 -1.

- Elif e < N or e < l:

- Print (s, e + 1).

- Else:

- Print -1 -1.

This seems somewhat close to the approach I described, but it's a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand what's happening.

It's grouping consecutive elements that are equal, storing the start and end indices of each run.

Then, for each query [l, r], it uses bisect_left to find the first run that starts >= l.

Then, it gets (s, e, _) from arr[min(eli, LA)].

Then, it has several conditions based on s and e.

This seems a bit convoluted.

I think there might be a better way to structure this.

Let me think about a clearer implementation.

Here's what I would do:

- Preprocess the runs:

- Iterate through the array, group consecutive equal elements.

- Store runs as (start, end, value).

- For each query [l, r]:

- Use bisect_left to find the first run where start >= l.

- Use bisect_right to find the first run where start > r.

- The runs within [l, r] are arr[first_index : last_index].

- If len(arr[first_index : last_index]) > 1, pick i from the first run and j from the second run.

- Else, if len(arr[first_index : last_index]) == 1:

- Check if the run's end <= r.

- If so, all elements are the same, print -1 -1.

- Else, the run extends beyond r, but within [l, r], all elements are the same, so print -1 -1.

- Else, no runs, which shouldn't happen.

Now, comparing this to the given code, it seems the given code is trying to do something similar but is a bit messy.

Specifically, in the query handling part, it's not clearly separating the cases.

I think the given code might have some errors.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=5, nums=[1,1,2,1,1], q=3, queries: (1,5), (1,2), (1,3).

Runs:

- (1,2,1)

- (3,3,2)

- (4,5,1)

For query (1,5):

- Find runs where start >=1 and start <=5.

- Runs: (1,2,1), (3,3,2), (4,5,1).

- More than one run, so pick i=1, j=3.

- Which matches the sample output: 2 3

For query (1,2):

- Runs: (1,2,1)

- Only one run, end=2 <=2, so -1 -1

- Which matches the sample output.

For query (1,3):

- Runs: (1,2,1), (3,3,2)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=3.

- Which matches the sample output.

Now, in the code, for s > l:

- If s ==1 or s >r, print -1 -1.

- Else, print (s-1, s).

In the first query (1,5):

- eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

- (s,e,_) = arr[0] = (1,2,1)

- s > l is 1 >1 False, so go to elif e >=r: 2 >=5? No.

- Then elif e < N or e < l: 2 <5 or 2 <1? 2<5 is True, so print (1,3)

Wait, but in the sample, it prints 2 3.

But in the code, it prints (s, e+1) which is (1,4), but in the sample, it's 2 3.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing.

Wait, in the runs, (1,2,1), (3,3,2), (4,5,1)

For query (1,5):

- first run: (1,2,1)

- second run: (3,3,2)

- third run: (4,5,1)

So, if I pick i=2 and j=3, which are different.

But the code picks s=1, e=2 from the first run, and e+1=3, so i=1, j=3.

But in the sample, it's 2 3.

Well, as long as i and j are in [1,5] and a_i ≠ a_j, it's acceptable.

So, 1 and 3 are valid since a_1=1 and a_3=2.

Hence, the code's output is also correct.

Wait, but in the sample, it's 2 3, which is also correct.

So, multiple correct answers are possible.

Hence, the code seems to be producing a correct answer.

Another query (1,2):

- Only one run: (1,2,1), so print -1 -1.

Correct.

Query (1,3):

- Runs: (1,2,1), (3,3,2)

- More than one run, so print (1,3)

Correct.

Hence, in this case, the code seems to work.

Let me check another test case.

Take n=6, nums=[30,20,20,10,10,20], q=5, queries: (1,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,6),(3,5)

Runs:

- (1,1,30)

- (2,3,20)

- (4,5,10)

- (6,6,20)

For query (1,2):

- Runs: (1,1,30), (2,3,20)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Which matches sample output: 2 1

Wait, in the sample output, it's 2 1, which is acceptable since a_2=20 ≠ a_1=30.

So, the code would pick (1,2) from the first and second runs, which is correct.

For query (2,3):

- Runs: (2,3,20)

- Only one run, end=3 <=3, so -1 -1

- Matches sample output.

For query (2,4):

- Runs: (2,3,20), (4,5,10)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=4.

- Sample output is 4 2, which is also correct.

For query (2,6):

- Runs: (2,3,20), (4,5,10), (6,6,20)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=4.

- Sample output is 4 6.

Which is also correct.

For query (3,5):

- Runs: (2,3,20), (4,5,10)

- More than one run, pick i=3, j=4.

- Sample output is 5 3.

Which is also correct.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for these cases.

Let me check another test case.

n=4, nums=[5,2,3,4], q=4, queries: (1,2),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)

Runs:

- (1,1,5)

- (2,2,2)

- (3,3,3)

- (4,4,4)

For query (1,2):

- Runs: (1,1,5), (2,2,2)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output: 1 2

Correct.

For query (1,4):

- Runs: (1,1,5), (2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output: 1 2

Correct.

For query (2,3):

- Runs: (2,2,2), (3,3,3)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=3.

- Sample output: 2 3

Correct.

For query (3,4):

- Runs: (3,3,3), (4,4,4)

- More than one run, pick i=3, j=4.

- Sample output: 3 2

Wait, 3 2, but according to the runs, 3 and 4 are different.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=5, nums=[1,4,3,2,4], q=5, queries: (1,5),(2,4),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)

Runs:

- (1,1,1)

- (2,2,4)

- (3,3,3)

- (4,4,2)

- (5,5,4)

For query (1,5):

- Runs: all of them.

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output:1 3

Which is also correct, since a_1=1 ≠ a_3=3.

For query (2,4):

- Runs: (2,2,4), (3,3,3), (4,4,2)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=3.

- Sample output:2 4

Which is also correct.

For query (3,4):

- Runs: (3,3,3), (4,4,2)

- More than one run, pick i=3, j=4.

- Sample output:3 4

Correct.

For query (3,5):

- Runs: (3,3,3), (4,4,2), (5,5,4)

- More than one run, pick i=3, j=4.

- Sample output:5 3

Which is also correct.

For query (4,5):

- Runs: (4,4,2), (5,5,4)

- More than one run, pick i=4, j=5.

- Sample output:5 4

Correct.

Another test case: n=5, nums=[2,3,1,4,2], q=7, queries: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5)

Runs:

- (1,1,2)

- (2,2,3)

- (3,3,1)

- (4,4,4)

- (5,5,2)

For query (1,2):

- Runs: (1,1,2), (2,2,3)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output:1 2

Correct.

For query (1,4):

- Runs: (1,1,2), (2,2,3), (3,3,1), (4,4,4)

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output:1 2

Correct.

For query (1,5):

- Runs: all of them.

- More than one run, pick i=1, j=2.

- Sample output:1 3

Correct.

For query (2,4):

- Runs: (2,2,3), (3,3,1), (4,4,4)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=3.

- Sample output:2 3

Correct.

For query (2,5):

- Runs: (2,2,3), (3,3,1), (4,4,4), (5,5,2)

- More than one run, pick i=2, j=3.

- Sample output:3 2

Which is correct.

For query (3,5):

- Runs: (3,3,1), (4,4,4), (5,5,2)

- More than one run, pick i=3, j=4.

- Sample output:5 4

Correct.

For query (4,5):

- Runs: (4,4,4), (5,5,2)

- More than one run, pick i=4, j=5.

- Sample output:5 4

Correct.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for all these test cases.

I need to check if there are any edge cases where it might fail.

Edge case 1: All elements are the same.

n=5, nums=[1,1,1,1,1], q=3, queries: (1,5),(2,4),(3,3)

Runs:

- (1,5,1)

For query (1,5):

- Only one run, end=5 <=5, so -1 -1

- Correct.

For query (2,4):

- Only one run, end=5 >4, but within [2,4], all elements are the same, so -1 -1

- Correct.

For query (3,3):

- Only one run, end=5 >3, but within [3,3], it's the same element, so -1 -1

- Correct.

Edge case 2: All elements are different.

n=5, nums=[1,2,3,4,5], q=3, queries: (1,5),(2,4),(3,3)

Runs:

- (1,1,1)

- (2,2,2)

- (3,3,3)

- (4,4,4)

- (5,5,5)

For query (1,5):

- Multiple runs, pick i=1, j=2.

- Correct.

For query (2,4):

- Multiple runs, pick i=2, j=3.

- Correct.

For query (3,3):

- Only one run, end=3 <=3, so -1 -1

- Correct.

Another edge case: n=2, nums=[1,2], q=2, queries: (1,2),(1,1)

Runs:

- (1,1,1)

- (2,2,2)

For query (1,2):

- Multiple runs, pick i=1, j=2.

- Correct.

For query (1,1):

- Only one run, end=1 <=1, so -1 -1

- Correct.

Another edge case: n=2, nums=[1,1], q=2, queries: (1,2),(1,1)

Runs:

- (1,2,1)

For query (1,2):

- Only one run, end=2 <=2, so -1 -1

- Correct.

For query (1,1):

- Only one run, end=2 >1, but within [1,1], it's the same element, so -1 -1

- Correct.

Hence, the code seems to handle these edge cases correctly.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be implementing the correct logic, albeit a bit convoluted in the query handling part.

Hence, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
