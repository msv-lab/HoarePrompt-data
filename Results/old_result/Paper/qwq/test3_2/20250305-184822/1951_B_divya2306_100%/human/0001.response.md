Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, there are n cows with unique ratings, and they are participating in a coding tournament. Each cow has a distinct rating, and they are initially positioned in order from 1 to n. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

The goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, which is cow k, by possibly swapping its position with another cow only once or choosing to do nothing.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses. It's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match advances to the next one.

Let me think about how the matches are conducted:

1. Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2. The one with higher rating wins.

2. Match 2: The winner of Match 1 vs Cow 3.

3. Match 3: The winner of Match 2 vs Cow 4.

...

n-1 matches in total, since one cow is eliminated each time, and finally, one cow remains as the champion.

Now, I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k. That means I want cow k to win as many matches as possible before eventually losing to a stronger cow.

Optionally, I can swap cow k's position with another cow's position exactly once before the tournament starts.

I need to find the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve with this option.

Let me consider the initial setup:

- Positions: 1, 2, 3, ..., n

- Cow k is at position k.

- Ratings: a1, a2, ..., an, all distinct.

Since ratings are unique, there is a clear ordering of strength among the cows.

I need to think about how the tournament bracket works here. It's not a standard bracketed tournament; it's more like a sequence where the winner of each match proceeds to face the next cow in line.

Let me try to simulate the tournament without any swap to see how many wins cow k can achieve.

Suppose I don't swap cow k's position. Then, cow k is at position k.

I need to see how many matches cow k can win in this scenario.

Let me think about the path cow k needs to take to win matches.

Cow k can only participate in matches if it is the winner of the previous matches.

Wait, actually, in this tournament structure, cow k can only participate if it is either the initial winner or if it is the next cow in line to challenge the current winner.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

In the initial setup:

- Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Cow 3.

- Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs Cow 4.

...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs Cow n.

So, the winner progresses through the sequence, facing the next cow in line.

Cow k can only be involved if it is either one of the cows in the sequence or if it becomes the winner at some point.

Wait, actually, cow k is initially at position k, so it will be involved in the match when the winner reaches it.

But, if cow k is not the winner at some point, it won't be able to participate in further matches.

Wait, no. Actually, each cow only participates once in the tournament, because once a cow loses, it's out.

So, cow k will have at most one match where it participates, unless it wins and continues to advance.

Wait, no. Actually, in this tournament structure, each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, cow k can only participate if it is the current winner or if it is the next cow to challenge the current winner.

Wait, perhaps it's clearer to think in terms of who is the current champion after each match.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote the current champion after each match.

Initially, before any matches, there is no champion.

Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2. The one with higher rating wins and becomes the champion.

Match 2: The current champion plays against Cow 3. The winner becomes the new champion.

And so on, until Match n-1: The current champion plays against Cow n.

So, the champion progresses by playing against the next cow in line, and the one with higher rating wins.

Now, I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

That is, I want cow k to be the champion as long as possible, winning as many matches as possible before eventually losing.

I can think of it as: how many consecutive matches can cow k win, starting from some point in the sequence, by possibly swapping its position with another cow.

First, I need to understand, in the original sequence, how many wins cow k can achieve.

Let me consider the original sequence without any swap.

Simulate the tournament:

- Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2. Winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Cow 3.

...

- Match k-1: Winner of Match k-2 vs Cow k.

...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs Cow n.

But, in this setup, cow k only gets to play if it is the winner of the previous match or if it is the next cow in line.

Wait, actually, cow k will only play once, in Match k-1, against the winner of Match k-2.

After that, if cow k wins, it becomes the champion and proceeds to Match k, where it plays against cow k+1, and so on.

So, cow k can win multiple matches if it keeps winning against the next cows in line.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position k that it can defeat before losing to a stronger cow.

Similarly, if I swap cow k with another cow, say cow m, then cow k is now at position m, and I need to see how many wins it can achieve from there.

I need to consider both options: swapping and not swapping, and choose the one that maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, let's consider not swapping.

In this case, cow k is at position k.

The number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

So, starting from position k, count the number of cows from position k+1 to the first cow that has higher rating than cow k.

If no such cow exists, then cow k wins all remaining matches.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, cow k only gets to play if it wins the previous matches.

Wait, actually, in the original sequence, cow k only gets to play in match k-1 against the winner of match k-2.

If cow k wins, it becomes the champion and proceeds to play against cow k+1 in match k, and so on.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k.

In other words, it's the length of the largest suffix starting from position k where cow k's rating is higher than all subsequent cows.

Wait, but not exactly. Because, in each match, cow k has to play against the next cow in line, and if it wins, it proceeds to the next match.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, but actually, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

Because, as soon as it loses to a cow with higher rating, it is eliminated.

So, in the original sequence, the number of wins for cow k is equal to the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with higher rating.

Now, if I choose to swap cow k with another position, say position m, then cow k is now at position m.

Then, I need to see how many wins cow k can achieve from position m.

Similarly, it's the number of cows after position m that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

But, there's a catch: the matches are conducted in a specific order, from position 1 to n, with the champion progressing.

So, if I swap cow k to position m, then the tournament proceeds as before, but now cow k is at position m.

I need to see when cow k gets to play and how many wins it can achieve.

Wait, actually, in the tournament, each match is between the current champion and the next cow in line.

So, if I swap cow k to position m, then the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Cow 3.

...

- Match m-1: Winner of Match m-2 vs Cow m (which is now cow k).

- Match m: Winner of Match m-1 vs Cow m+1.

And so on.

So, cow k gets to play in match m-1, against the winner of match m-2.

If cow k wins, it becomes the champion and proceeds to play against cow m+1 in match m, and so on.

So, similar to before, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position m that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

Therefore, to maximize the number of wins for cow k, I need to choose the position m that allows cow k to win the maximum number of matches.

So, I need to choose m such that the number of cows after position m that have lower ratings than cow k is maximized.

Wait, but it's not just the number of cows with lower ratings; it's also about the order in which they appear.

Because, as soon as cow k encounters a cow with higher rating, it loses and the sequence ends.

So, I need to choose m such that the sequence of cows after m has as many cows with lower ratings as possible, before encountering a cow with higher rating.

Now, to find the optimal m, I need to consider all possible positions m, swap cow k to position m, and compute the number of wins cow k can achieve from there.

Then, choose the m that maximizes this number of wins.

But, since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let's think about how to compute the number of wins for cow k in the original sequence.

I can iterate from position k onwards, count how many consecutive cows have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, but it's not just consecutive cows with lower ratings; it's the number of cows after position k that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with higher rating.

So, in other words, it's the length of the longest suffix starting from position k where cow k's rating is higher than all subsequent cows, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

Similarly, if I swap cow k to position m, I can compute the same thing: the number of cows after position m that have lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

So, for each possible m, I need to compute this value, and choose the maximum among all m, including m = k (i.e., not swapping).

Now, the question is, how to compute this efficiently.

One way is to, for each position m, find the number of cows after m that have lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

This sounds like a sliding window or a prefix computation.

Let me think about it.

First, I need to find, for each m, the maximum number of consecutive cows after m that have lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

This can be done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, a naive approach for each test case would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that all ratings are distinct.

So, for each m, I can find the first position p after m where a[p] > a[k-1], and then the number of wins is p - m.

If there is no such p, then it's n - m.

But computing this for each m would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently for all m.

I recall that there are ways to compute, for each position, the next greater element to the right in O(n) time.

Yes, that's useful here.

So, I can precompute for each position m, the position of the first cow after m that has a higher rating than a[k-1].

Then, the number of wins for cow k at position m is p - m - 1, where p is the position of the first cow with higher rating than a[k-1] after m.

If p doesn't exist, then it's n - m.

So, for each m, I can compute the number of wins for cow k if it's at position m.

Then, I just need to choose the m that maximizes this number.

But, there's an additional constraint: when I swap cow k to position m, I need to make sure that cow k can reach position m in the tournament.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, the champion progresses through the sequence, facing each cow in order.

So, for cow k to participate in the tournament from position m, it needs to either be the champion at that point or be the next cow to challenge the champion.

But, since the tournament is deterministic based on the ratings, I just need to see if cow k can become the champion up to position m.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Actually, when I swap cow k to position m, I can consider that cow k is now at position m, and the tournament proceeds as usual.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is determined by how many cows after position m have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

So, I can precompute for each position m, the number of wins cow k can achieve if it's at position m.

Then, choose the maximum among all m.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I can precompute for each position m, the position of the first cow after m that has a higher rating than a[k-1].

This can be done using a stack to find the next greater element to the right for each position.

Then, for each m, the number of wins is p - m - 1, where p is the position of the first cow with higher rating than a[k-1] after m.

If p doesn't exist, then it's n - m.

Then, I can iterate through all possible m and choose the maximum number of wins.

But, since t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case, I can:

1. Read n, k, and the array a.

2. Find the rating of cow k: a[k-1].

3. Precompute for each position m, the position p of the first cow after m with rating > a[k-1].

4. For each m from 1 to n:

- If m < k, and a[m] < a[k-1], then I can swap cow k to position m.

- Compute the number of wins as p - m - 1, or n - m if p doesn't exist.

- Keep track of the maximum number of wins.

5. Also consider not swapping, i.e., m = k, and compute the number of wins.

Then, output the maximum number of wins.

Wait, but in the swap, I can swap cow k with any other cow, not just with cows before k.

The problem says: "you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, I can swap cow k with any position m, meaning cow k can be placed at any position m, and the cow originally at m is placed at k.

But, in the tournament, only the positions matter, not the specific cows' identities except for cow k.

So, effectively, I can choose to place cow k at any position m, and adjust the array accordingly.

But, to simplify, I can think that I'm moving cow k to position m, and the cows after m are the same, but cow k is now at m.

Then, I need to compute how many cows after m have lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

But, I need to make sure that cow k can actually reach those matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cow k needs to win the matches leading up to position m.

Wait, no. Since I'm swapping cow k to position m, I need to consider that the tournament proceeds from position 1 to n, with the champion progressing.

So, if I swap cow k to position m, then the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Matches 1 to m-1: the champion is determined by the cows from position 1 to m-1, and then cow k at position m challenges the current champion.

- If cow k wins against the current champion, it becomes the new champion and proceeds to play against cow m+1, and so on.

- The number of wins cow k can achieve is the number of cows after m that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

So, to compute this, I need to consider:

- The champion up to position m-1.

- If cow k can defeat the champion up to position m-1.

- If yes, then cow k becomes the champion and proceeds to play against cow m+1, and so on, winning as many matches as possible.

- If no, then cow k loses immediately and cannot win any matches.

Therefore, for each m, the number of wins for cow k is:

- 0, if cow k loses to the champion up to position m-1.

- Otherwise, the number of cows after m that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with higher rating.

So, to compute this efficiently, I need to:

1. Find, for each m, the champion up to position m-1.

2. Check if cow k can defeat that champion.

3. If yes, compute the number of wins as the number of cows after m with lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating.

This seems a bit involved, especially since t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider that all ratings are distinct.

So, there is a unique ordering of cows based on their ratings.

Let me think about the tournament without any swap.

In the original sequence, cow k is at position k.

The champion up to position m is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to m.

Wait, no. In this tournament structure, it's not necessarily the highest rating among positions 1 to m, because it's a specific sequence of matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the tournament to find the champion up to position m.

But that would be too slow for the given constraints.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the champion after match i is the cow with the highest rating among the cows that have participated so far.

But again, in this specific tournament structure, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I need to consider that the champion progresses by winning against the next cow in line, and the winner has the higher rating.

So, effectively, the champion is always the cow with the highest rating among the cows that have participated so far.

Wait, actually, since in each match, the cow with the higher rating wins, the champion at any point is the cow with the highest rating among the cows that have participated up to that point.

Therefore, the champion up to match i is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to i+1.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

In match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2. The one with higher rating wins and becomes the champion.

In match 2: the champion so far vs cow 3. Again, the one with higher rating wins and becomes the new champion.

And so on.

So, effectively, the champion after match i is the cow with the highest rating among cows 1 to i+1.

Because each match is between the current champion and the next cow, and the one with higher rating wins.

Therefore, the champion up to match i is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to i+1.

So, in general, the champion up to match i is the cow with the maximum rating among positions 1 to i+1.

Wait, but it's not necessarily the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to i+1, because the matches are sequential.

Wait, actually, yes.

Because in each match, the current champion is challenged by the next cow, and the one with higher rating wins.

So, the champion progresses by always being the one with the highest rating among the cows that have participated so far.

Therefore, the champion up to match i is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to i+1.

So, in other words, the champion up to match m-1 is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to m.

Now, if I swap cow k to position m, then in match m-1, the champion up to match m-2 (which is the champion up to position m-1) plays against cow k.

If cow k has higher rating than the champion up to position m-1, then cow k becomes the champion and proceeds to play against cow m+1, and so on.

Otherwise, cow k loses immediately.

So, for cow k to win any matches from position m, it must have a higher rating than the champion up to position m-1.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position m that have lower ratings than cow k, until it encounters a cow with higher rating.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose m such that:

1. The champion up to position m-1 has a lower rating than cow k.

2. The sequence of cows after m have as many cows with lower ratings than cow k as possible, before encountering a cow with higher rating.

Given that, I need an efficient way to compute, for each m, whether cow k can defeat the champion up to m-1, and if so, how many cows after m have lower ratings than cow k, until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me try to find a way to compute this efficiently.

First, I can precompute the champion up to each position m-1.

Since the champion up to match m-1 is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to m.

So, I can compute the prefix maximum of the ratings.

Let me define prefix_max[m] = max(a[0] to a[m-1])

Similarly, I can compute the next greater element to the right for cow k's rating.

Let me define next_greater[m] = the position p where a[p] > a[k-1], and p > m, and there is no q with m < q < p and a[q] > a[k-1].

I can compute next_greater[m] for all m in O(n) time using a stack.

Then, for each m, the number of wins if cow k is at position m is:

- 0, if a[k-1] <= prefix_max[m-1]

- next_greater[m] - m - 1, otherwise (or n - m if next_greater[m] doesn't exist)

Then, I need to find the maximum among all m of these values.

This seems correct.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

First, compute prefix_max[m] for all m from 1 to n.

prefix_max[0] = -infinity

for m from 1 to n:

prefix_max[m] = max(prefix_max[m-1], a[m-1])

Then, compute next_greater[m] for all m from 1 to n.

Use a stack to compute the next greater element to the right for a[k-1].

Initialize an array next_greater[m] for m from 1 to n.

Initialize an empty stack.

for m from n downto 1:

while stack is not empty and a[stack.top() - 1] <= a[k-1]:

stack.pop()

if stack is empty:

next_greater[m] = n+1

else:

next_greater[m] = stack.top()

stack.push(m)

Then, for each m from 1 to n:

if a[k-1] > prefix_max[m-1]:

wins = next_greater[m] - m - 1

else:

wins = 0

keep track of the maximum wins.

Finally, output the maximum wins.

This should work in O(n) time per test case.

But, in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the given code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given code:

if __name__ == '__main__':

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

wins = 0

for i in range(n):

if a[i] > a[k - 1]:

break

wins += 1

if wins >= k:

print(wins - 1)

return

win_with_swap = wins + 1

for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):

if a[i] > a[k - 1]:

break

win_with_swap += 1

print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))



So, in func_1:

1. Read n, k, and the array a.

2. Initialize wins = 0.

3. Iterate through the array from i=0 to n-1:

- If a[i] > a[k-1], break.

- Else, increment wins.

4. If wins >= k, print wins - 1 and return.

5. Else, set win_with_swap = wins + 1.

6. Iterate from i = win_with_swap to k-2:

- If a[i] > a[k-1], break.

- Else, increment win_with_swap.

7. Print the maximum of (wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)).

This seems overly complicated and not matching the logic I described earlier.

Let me try to understand what this code is doing.

First part:

- Count the number of cows from position 1 to n that have ratings less than or equal to a[k-1], until a cow with higher rating is encountered.

- Store this count in wins.

- If wins >= k, print wins - 1.

Wait, why wins - 1?

Wait, in the example given:

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

a[k-1] = a[0] = 12

Iterate from i=0 to n-1:

a[0] = 12, which is not > a[0], so wins = 1

a[1] = 10, not > 12, wins = 2

a[2] = 14, > 12, break.

So, wins = 2

Since wins >= k (2 >=1), print wins -1 = 1.

Which matches the first sample output.

Similarly, in the second test case:

6 5

7 2 727 10 12 13

a[k-1] = a[4] = 12

Iterate from i=0 to n-1:

a[0]=7 <=12, wins=1

a[1]=2 <=12, wins=2

a[2]=727 >12, break.

wins=2 >=5? No.

So, proceed to win_with_swap = 2 +1 =3

Then, iterate from i=3 to k-2=4:

i=3:

a[3]=10 <=12, win_with_swap=4

i=4:

a[4]=12 >12, break.

So, win_with_swap =4

Then, print max(wins-1, win_with_swap - wins -1 + (wins !=0)) = max(1,4-2-1 +1)=max(1,2)=2

Which matches the second sample output.

Third test case:

2 2

1000000000 1

a[k-1]=a[1]=1

wins=0 (since a[0]=1000000000 >1)

wins >=2? No.

win_with_swap=0+1=1

Then, iterate from i=1 to 1 (k-1=1):

a[1]=1 <=1, win_with_swap=2

Then, print max(-1, 2-0-1 +1)=max(-1,2)=2

But the sample output is 0.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 0.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the third test case, it's n=2, k=2.

a=[1000000000,1]

So, a[k-1]=1

Iterate from i=0 to n-1:

a[0]=1000000000 >1, break.

So, wins=0

wins >=k? 0 >=2? No.

win_with_swap=0+1=1

Then, iterate from i=1 to k-2=0 (since k-1=1, and range up to k-2=0, which is empty).

So, win_with_swap=1

Then, print max(-1,1-0-1 +1)=max(-1,1)=1

But the sample output is 0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the third test case, the explanation says:

It's optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

Initially, a' = [1000000000, 1]

Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 1000000000 and loses.

In total, your cow wins 0 matches.

So, the correct answer should be 0.

But according to the code, it prints 1.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, cow k, in a coding tournament by optionally swapping its position with another cow only once or choosing to do nothing.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - There are n cows with unique ratings.
    - The tournament is a series of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.
    - We need to maximize the number of wins for cow k by optionally swapping its position with another cow.

2. **Insight**:
    - The champion up to any match is the cow with the highest rating among the cows that have participated so far.
    - To maximize cow k's wins, place it in a position where it can defeat the current champion and then defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
    - Precompute the prefix maximum to determine the champion up to each position.
    - Use a stack to find the next greater element to the right for cow k's rating.
    - For each possible position m, calculate the number of wins cow k can achieve if placed at position m.
    - Choose the position m that maximizes these wins.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        
        # Precompute prefix maximum

### Explanation

1. **Prefix Maximum Calculation**:
    - `prefix_max[m]` stores the highest rating among cows from position 1 to m.

2. **Next Greater Element Using Stack**:
    - For each position m, find the position of the next cow with a rating greater than cow k's rating.

3. **Determine Maximum Wins**:
    - For each possible position m, check if cow k can defeat the current champion up to position m-1.
    - If yes, calculate the number of wins as the number of cows with lower ratings after m until the next greater cow.
    - Track and print the maximum number of wins across all possible positions m.

This approach ensures an efficient solution within the given constraints, achieving O(n) time complexity per test case.
