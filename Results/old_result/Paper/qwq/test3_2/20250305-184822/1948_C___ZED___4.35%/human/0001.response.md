Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right, and no arrow points outside the grid. There's a robot starting at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell. Every second, two things happen: first, the robot moves left, right, up, or down (without going outside the grid), and then it moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

My task is to determine whether the robot can reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell, for multiple test cases. The input consists of t test cases, each with an integer n (even, between 2 and 2*10^5), followed by two strings of length n representing the arrows in rows 1 and 2, respectively.

Looking at the constraints, t can be up to 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

First, I need to understand how the robot moves. Each second, it makes two moves:

1. It moves left, right, up, or down.

2. Then it moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

I need to find a sequence of such moves that gets the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Let me try to model this movement.

Let's consider the grid:

Row 1: a1 a2 a3 ... an

Row 2: b1 b2 b3 ... bn

Where ai and bi are either '<' or '>', representing left and right, respectively.

The robot starts at (1,1). So, its initial position is row=1, col=1.

Each step:

- First, it can choose to move left, right, up, or down.

- Then, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

Since the grid has only two rows, moving up from row 2 brings it to row 1, and moving down from row 1 brings it to row 2. Moving left decreases the column by 1, and moving right increases it by 1, but it can't go outside the grid.

I need to find a sequence of such moves that leads the robot to (2,n).

This seems a bit tricky because of the two-part movement in each step.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the grid, and edges represent possible moves the robot can make in one step.

Given that, I can try to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the starting position to see if I can reach the target position.

However, given the constraints (t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 per test case, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5), I need an O(n) solution per test case, and BFS might not be efficient enough if implemented naively.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the movement rules.

Each step consists of:

1. A choice of direction: left, right, up, or down.

2. Moving according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, effectively, the robot's movement is a combination of these two actions.

I need to see how I can control these movements to reach the target.

Let me consider the possible moves in more detail.

Suppose the robot is at position (r,c).

First, it chooses to move in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.

- If it chooses left, it moves to (r, c-1).

- If it chooses right, it moves to (r, c+1).

- If it chooses up, it moves to (r-1, c).

- If it chooses down, it moves to (r+1, c).

Then, it must move according to the arrow in its new position.

So, if it moves to (r', c'), and the arrow there is '<', it moves to (r', c'-1), provided c' > 1.

Similarly, if the arrow is '>', it moves to (r', c'+1), provided c' < n.

Wait, but after choosing the initial move, it must follow the arrow in the new cell, which might lead to another cell.

So, effectively, each step consists of:

- Choosing a direction.

- Moving to the new cell based on that direction.

- Then moving according to the arrow in that new cell.

Hence, each step involves two consecutive moves.

I need to find a sequence of such steps to reach the target.

This seems complicated to model directly. Maybe I can think in terms of possible positions after each step and see if I can reach the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards from the target position.

Let's try that.

Suppose the robot is at (2,n). I need to see if it can reach this position from (1,1) following the movement rules.

If I can find a sequence of moves that leads to (2,n), then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

Let me consider the possible ways to reach (2,n).

First, think about the last step before reaching (2,n).

Suppose the robot is at some position (r',c') and then, after choosing a direction and following the arrow, ends up at (2,n).

I need to find all possible positions (r',c') from which this is possible.

Let me consider the possible choices in the last step.

Case 1: The robot chooses to move right.

- It moves to (r', c'+1).

- Then, follows the arrow in (r', c'+1).

- To end up at (2,n), the arrow in (r', c'+1) must point in such a way that after following it, it reaches (2,n).

Wait, this seems too vague. Maybe I should think in terms of possible positions before the last move.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent possible moves in one step.

Given that, I can perform a BFS from (1,1) to see if I can reach (2,n).

But considering the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

BFS might not be efficient enough if implemented naively because in the worst case, it could be O(n^2) in terms of time due to the number of edges.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the movement in terms of possible transitions.

Each step, the robot can choose to move in one of four directions, and then follow the arrow in the new cell.

Given that, from each cell, there are up to four possible next positions, depending on the chosen direction and the arrow in the new cell.

But this seems too broad. Maybe I can find some invariant or some property that allows me to simplify the movement.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of possible positions after an even number of steps.

Given that n is even, maybe there's some parity involved.

Wait, n is the number of columns, which is even, but I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Let me consider that the grid has only two rows. Maybe I can model the movement between rows and within rows.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the robot can switch rows only by moving up or down, and within a row, it can move left or right and follow the arrows.

Given that, maybe I can model the movement within each row and see when it's possible to switch rows.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible positions that can be reached from the starting position, considering the movement rules.

But I'm still stuck on how to efficiently determine if the target is reachable.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some ideas.

Sample Input:

4

4

>><<

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

Sample Output:

YES

YES

NO

YES

Looking at the first test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

According to the note, one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '>', so move to (1,3)

- Now at (1,3)

- Choose to move down to (2,3), then follow the arrow in (2,3), which is '<', so move to (2,2)

Wait, but according to the note, it goes to (2,4). Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the note, it's (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

So, from (2,3):

- Choose to move right to (2,4), then follow the arrow in (2,4), which is '>', but since it's the last column, it can't move further, so it stays at (2,4), which is the target.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n=2

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '<', so move to (2,0), but that's outside the grid, so invalid.

Wait, but according to the output, it's YES, so there must be another way.

Wait, perhaps the arrow doesn't allow moving outside, so it stays in place.

But the problem says "no arrow points outside the grid", so if there's a '<' in (2,1), and moving left would go to column 0, which is outside, so it can't move left, perhaps it stays in (2,1).

But according to the sample output, it's YES, so there must be another sequence.

Wait, maybe choosing a different initial move.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing to move right first.

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '>', so move to (1,3), but n=2, so that's outside, invalid.

Wait, n=2, so column 3 doesn't exist.

Alternatively, maybe choosing to move up or down.

Wait, from (1,1), moving up would try to go to row 0, which is invalid, so only options are right or down.

So, moving right to (1,2), then follow '>', which is outside, so invalid.

Moving down to (2,1), then follow '<', which is outside, so invalid.

But according to the sample, it's YES, so there must be another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

Firstly, the robot moves left, right, up, or down (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move);

then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

Key points:

- The first move is a choice of left, right, up, or down, without going outside the grid.

- Then, it moves according to the arrow in the current cell after the first move.

So, in the first test case, n=4:

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

Let's try to simulate the first sample path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '>', so move to (1,3)

- Now at (1,3)

- Choose to move down to (2,3), then follow the arrow in (2,3), which is '<', so move to (2,2)

Wait, that's not matching the note. Maybe I need to choose different initial moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose to move down first.

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '<', so move to (2,0), which is invalid, so stay at (2,1)

This seems stuck.

Alternatively:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow '>', which moves to (1,3)

- Now at (1,3)

- Choose to move down to (2,3), then follow '<', which moves to (2,2)

- Now at (2,2)

- Choose to move right to (2,3), then follow '<', which moves to (2,2)

This seems cyclic.

Wait, perhaps there's another way.

Looking back at the note, it says one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

But according to my simulation, from (1,3), moving down to (2,3), then following '<' moves back to (2,2). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement after following the arrow.

Wait, the problem says "then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, after choosing the initial move and reaching a new cell, it then moves according to the arrow in that cell.

So, in the first step:

- Choose to move right from (1,1) to (1,2)

- Then, follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '>', so move to (1,3)

Now, the robot is at (1,3)

- Choose to move down to (2,3)

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,3), which is '<', so move to (2,2)

Now, the robot is at (2,2)

- Choose to move right to (2,3)

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,3), which is '<', so move to (2,2)

This seems like it's cycling between (2,2) and (2,3)

Wait, but according to the note, it's possible to reach (2,4). Maybe I need to choose different initial moves.

Perhaps choosing to move down first.

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move down to (2,1)

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '<', which would move to (2,0), which is invalid, so it stays at (2,1)

Now, at (2,1)

- Choose to move right to (2,2)

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,2), which is '>', so move to (2,3)

Now, at (2,3)

- Choose to move right to (2,4)

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,4), which is '>', which would move to (2,5), which is invalid, so stays at (2,4)

Which is the target.

Ah, so in this path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

That seems to work.

So, in the note, it mentions another path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

But in my simulation, that seems to cause cycling. Maybe I made a mistake in simulating it.

Let me try again.

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2)

- Follow '>', which moves to (1,3)

- Now at (1,3)

- Choose to move down to (2,3)

- Follow '<', which moves to (2,2)

- Now at (2,2)

- Choose to move right to (2,3)

- Follow '<', which moves to (2,2)

- Now at (2,2)

- Choose to move right to (2,3)

- Follow '<', which moves to (2,2)

This seems like it's stuck in a loop between (2,2) and (2,3)

Wait, but according to the note, it's possible to reach (2,4) via this path.

Perhaps I need to choose different moves.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the note.

Wait, in the note, it says one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

But according to my simulation, from (2,3), moving right to (2,4), then following '>', which would try to move to (2,5), which is outside, so it stays at (2,4), which is the target.

So, perhaps I need to choose moves in a specific sequence to avoid cycling.

Anyway, the sample output is YES, so it's possible.

Looking at the third test case, which is NO, perhaps there's no way to reach the target due to the arrow directions.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

if b[-2] != '>':

print('NO')

elif n == 1:

print('YES')

else:

no_path = True

for k in range(0, n, 2):

if b[k] != '>':

no_path = False

if not no_path:

no_path = True

for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):

print(k)

if a[k] != '>':

no_path = False

if no_path:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

This code seems to have a logic to check certain positions in the second row and, in some cases, the first row, to determine if a path exists.

First, it checks if the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row (b[-2]) is not '>', in which case it prints 'NO'.

Then, if n == 1, it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, it sets no_path to True and checks in the second row at even indices (0-based) if any of them have an arrow that is not '>'. If all are '>', it keeps no_path as True; otherwise, it sets it to False.

If no_path is False, it then sets no_path to True again and checks in the first row at odd indices (1-based) from the second to the second-to-last column if any of them have an arrow that is not '>'. If all are '>', it keeps no_path as True; otherwise, sets it to False.

Finally, if no_path is True, it prints 'YES'; else, 'NO'.

Wait, but in the code, it has print(k) inside the loop, which seems like a debugging statement and should be removed in the final code.

But for analysis, I'll ignore that.

So, the logic seems to be:

- If the arrow in the second row, second-to-last cell is not '>', it's impossible to reach the target, so 'NO'.

- If n == 1, it's directly reachable, so 'YES'.

- Otherwise, check if all arrows in the second row at even columns are '>', or if not, check if all arrows in the first row at odd columns (from column 2 to column n-1) are '>'. If either condition is satisfied, 'YES'; else, 'NO'.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

First test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

Check b[-2], which is b[2] = '<'. So, b[-2] = '<' != '>', so it should print 'NO' according to the code. But in the sample output, it's 'YES'.

Wait, that's contradictory.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=4, Row 2: >>><, so b[-2] is the third character, which is '<', which is not '>', so according to the code, it should print 'NO', but the sample output is 'YES'.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misindexed b[-2].

In Python, negative indexing starts from the end: b[-1] is the last character, b[-2] is the second-to-last.

So, for n=4, b = ">>><", b[-1] = '>', b[-2] = '<'.

So, b[-2] != '>', so print 'NO', but sample output is 'YES'.

Hence, the code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the note, it shows a possible path, so the code is wrong.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

But perhaps there's another way to interpret the code.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking again at the code:

if b[-2] != '>':

print('NO')

elif n == 1:

print('YES')

else:

no_path = True

for k in range(0, n, 2):

if b[k] != '>':

no_path = False

if not no_path:

no_path = True

for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):

print(k)

if a[k] != '>':

no_path = False

if no_path:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, for n=4, b = ">>><", b[-2] = '<' != '>', so print 'NO'

But sample output is 'YES', so incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
