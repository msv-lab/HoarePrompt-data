Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], right?

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Okay, let's think about when such a partition would not exist. If every possible substring of the string is a palindrome, then I couldn't partition it in a way that none of the parts is a palindrome. But wait, that seems too restrictive. Actually, the only time no partition exists is when the string itself is a palindrome and all possible partitions include at least one palindrome.

Wait, no. Even if the string is a palindrome, I might still be able to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. For example, take "abba". It's a palindrome, but if I partition it into "a" and "bba", "a" is a palindrome, but "bba" is not. However, since "a" is a palindrome, this partition is invalid. Another partition could be "abb" and "a", but "abb" is not a palindrome, and "a" is. So this partition also includes a palindrome. If I try "ab", "b", "a", all of these have "b" and "a" as palindromes. So in this case, maybe no valid partition exists.

Wait, but "ab", "ba" is a partition where neither "ab" nor "ba" is a palindrome. So actually, for "abba", a valid partition exists: ["ab", "ba"]. So my earlier thought was incorrect.

Hmm, so even for palindromic strings, there might be ways to partition them into non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about the conditions under which no valid partition exists.

First, if the string is of length 1, it's a palindrome, and there's no way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, so "NO" should be printed.

If the string is of length 2 and both characters are the same, like "aa", then it's a palindrome, and any partition would include at least one palindrome (either "a" or "a"). So "NO" in this case.

If the string is of length 2 and characters are different, like "ab", then it's not a palindrome, so partitioning it as ["ab"] is valid, since "ab" is not a palindrome.

For longer strings, I need to check if I can partition them such that none of the parts is a palindrome.

Wait, but actually, for any string that is not entirely composed of the same character repeated, there might be a way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, take "aaa", which is a palindrome. If I partition it into ["a", "aa"], "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is also a palindrome. If I partition it into ["aaa"], it's a palindrome. So no valid partition exists in this case.

Another example: "aaab". The whole string is not a palindrome, but if I partition it into ["aaa", "b"], "aaa" is a palindrome. If I partition it into ["aa", "ab"], "aa" is a palindrome, but "ab" is not. So this partition includes a palindrome. If I partition it into ["a", "aab"], "a" is a palindrome, "aab" is not. Again, a palindrome is present. If I partition it into ["a", "a", "ab"], all parts except "ab" are single characters, which are palindromes. So no valid partition exists in this case.

Wait, but if I partition "aaab" into ["aaab"], it's not a palindrome, so that's a valid partition. Wait, is "aaab" a palindrome? Let's see: "aaab" reversed is "baaa", which is different, so "aaab" is not a palindrome. Therefore, partitioning it as ["aaab"] is valid, since it's not a palindrome.

So, in this case, a valid partition exists.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for strings like "aaa", no valid partition exists, but for "aaab", a valid partition exists.

So, perhaps the only case where no valid partition exists is when the string is a palindrome and all possible partitions include at least one palindrome.

But, in the example above, "aaab" is not a palindrome, so a valid partition exists.

Wait, perhaps the only case where no valid partition exists is when all possible partitions include at least one palindrome.

In other words, when all possible non-empty substrings are palindromes, which would only happen if the entire string is composed of the same character, like "aaa", "bbbb", etc.

Because, in such cases, any substring would be a palindrome.

Wait, but in "aaa", "aa" is a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, but "aaa" is also a palindrome. So, in this case, no matter how I partition, at least one part is a palindrome.

Whereas, in "aaab", "aaab" is not a palindrome, so partitioning it as ["aaab"] is valid.

Similarly, in "abba", "ab" and "ba" are both not palindromes, so ["ab", "ba"] is a valid partition.

Wait, but "abba" itself is a palindrome, but I can partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps the only case where no valid partition exists is when all possible non-empty substrings are palindromes, which only happens when the string consists of the same character repeated.

Wait, but in "aaa", "aa" is a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, but "aaa" is also a palindrome. So, in this case, no matter how I partition, at least one part is a palindrome.

In "aaab", "aaab" is not a palindrome, so I can partition it as ["aaab"].

In "abba", "abba" is a palindrome, but I can partition it into ["ab", "ba"], where neither is a palindrome.

So, perhaps the only case where no valid partition exists is when the string consists of the same character repeated.

Wait, but in "aaa", it's the same character repeated, and no valid partition exists.

In "aaab", which is not all the same character, a valid partition exists.

In "abba", which has mixed characters, a valid partition exists.

So, perhaps the condition is that if the string consists of the same character repeated, then no valid partition exists, otherwise, a valid partition exists.

Wait, but in "aaa", it's all the same character, no valid partition exists.

In "aaab", which is not all the same character, a valid partition exists.

In "abba", which is not all the same character, a valid partition exists.

In "a", which is all the same character, no valid partition exists.

In "ab", which is not all the same character, a valid partition exists.

So, it seems that if the string consists of the same character repeated, no valid partition exists, otherwise, a valid partition exists.

Is this always true?

Let's consider "aba". It's a palindrome, but if I partition it into ["a", "b", "a"], all parts are palindromes. If I partition it into ["ab", "a"], "ab" is not a palindrome, but "a" is. If I partition it into ["a", "ba"], "ba" is not a palindrome, but "a" is. If I partition it into ["aba"], it's a palindrome. So, no valid partition exists for "aba", even though it's not composed of the same character repeated.

Wait, but "aba" consists of the same characters in a palindromic arrangement.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe the condition is that if the string is a palindrome and its length is odd with the middle character being unique, or something like that.

Wait, in "aaa", it's a palindrome, and all characters are the same, no valid partition exists.

In "aaab", it's not a palindrome, so partitioning it as ["aaab"] is valid.

In "aba", it's a palindrome, and any partition includes at least one palindrome.

In "abba", it's a palindrome, but I can partition it into ["ab", "ba"], which are both not palindromes.

Wait, but "abba" can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps the condition is more complex.

Let me consider the following:

If the string is not a palindrome, I can partition it into one part, which is the entire string, and since it's not a palindrome, it's a valid partition.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to try to partition it into more than one part, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, if all possible partitions include at least one palindrome, then no valid partition exists.

So, for palindromic strings, I need to check if I can partition them into non-palindromic substrings.

Let's consider "abba":

Partition into ["ab", "ba"]: neither is a palindrome, so it's valid.

Another partition: ["a", "bba"]: "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

["ab", "b", "a"]: "b" and "a" are palindromes, invalid.

So, only the first partition works.

Similarly, for "racecar":

Partition into ["rac", "ecar"]: "rac" is not a palindrome, "ecar" is not a palindrome, so it's valid.

Another partition: ["r", "aceca", "r"]: "r" and "r" are palindromes, invalid.

So, in this case, a valid partition exists.

Wait, but "racecar" is a palindrome, and I found a partition into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps for any palindromic string of even length greater than 2, I can partition it into two parts that are mirror images of each other, and if they are not palindromes, it's valid.

Wait, but in "abba", "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

In "racecar", "rac" and "ecar" are not palindromes.

So, perhaps for any palindromic string of length greater than 1, I can partition it into two halves (or almost halves in case of odd length) and check if those parts are not palindromes.

If they are not palindromes, then it's a valid partition.

For example, in "aba", partitioning into "ab" and "a" has "ab" not palindrome and "a" palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "a" and "ba", which has "a" palindrome, invalid.

Or "aba" as a single part, which is a palindrome, invalid.

So, for "aba", no valid partition exists.

Similarly, in "aaa", partitioning into "aa" and "a", both are palindromes.

Or "a" and "aa", both palindromes.

Or "aaa", which is a palindrome.

So, no valid partition exists.

In "aaab", which is not a palindrome, partitioning into ["aaab"] is valid.

In "abba", partitioning into ["ab", "ba"] is valid.

In "abc", which is not a palindrome, partitioning into ["abc"] is valid.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, partition it into a single part.

- If the string is a palindrome, check if it can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.

- If it's a palindrome and its length is even, and both halves are not palindromes, then it's valid.

- If it's a palindrome and its length is odd, and the two halves (one half and the other half excluding the center) are not palindromes, then it's valid.

- Otherwise, no valid partition exists.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's consider "abba":

It's a palindrome of length 4.

Partitioning into "ab" and "ba": both not palindromes, valid.

In "racecar":

Partitioning into "rac" and "ecar": both not palindromes, valid.

In "aba":

Partitioning into "ab" and "a": "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

Partitioning into "a" and "ba": "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

Partitioning into "aba": is a palindrome, invalid.

So, no valid partition exists for "aba".

Similarly, "aaa":

Partitioning into "aa" and "a": both palindromes.

" a" and "aa": same issue.

"aaa": palindrome.

No valid partition.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings, if their length is greater than 2 and they can be split into two non-palindromic substrings, then it's valid.

Otherwise, it's invalid.

But, in "abba", which is length 4, palindrome, and can be split into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes, it's valid.

In "aba", which is length 3, palindrome, any split includes a single character, which is a palindrome, so invalid.

In "aaa", which is length 3, palindrome, any split includes a single character or "aa", which is a palindrome, so invalid.

In "racecar", which is length 7, palindrome, partitioning into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes, valid.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of length greater than 2, if they can be split into two non-palindromic substrings, it's valid.

Otherwise, it's invalid.

But, how do I generalize this?

Maybe, for any string, if it's not a palindrome, partition it into one part.

If it is a palindrome, try to partition it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

If both parts are not palindromes, then it's valid.

Otherwise, it's invalid.

Wait, but in "aba", which is a palindrome, and any partition includes a single character or "ab" and "a", which includes a palindrome, so it's invalid.

In "abba", which is a palindrome, partitioning into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes, so it's valid.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome, any partition includes "a" or "aa", both palindromes, so invalid.

In "racecar", partitioning into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes, so valid.

So, this seems to hold.

Hence, the general approach could be:

- If the string is not a palindrome, partition it into one part.

- If the string is a palindrome, attempt to partition it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If such a partition exists, output "YES" and provide that partition.

- If no such partition exists, output "NO".

Additionally, for strings of length 1, since they are palindromes, and any partition will include that single character, which is a palindrome, so "NO" for length 1.

For strings of length 2:

- If the two characters are different, partition into one part: ["ab"], which is not a palindrome.

- If the two characters are the same, partitioning into ["a", "a"] includes palindromes, or ["aa"], which is a palindrome.

Hence, for strings of length 2 where characters are the same, "NO", otherwise "YES".

Wait, but in "ab", which is not a palindrome, partitioning into ["ab"] is valid.

In "aa", which is a palindrome, partitioning into ["aa"] is invalid, since "aa" is a palindrome.

Partitioning into ["a", "a"] includes single characters, which are palindromes.

Hence, for "aa", "NO".

For "ab", "YES".

For "aab":

It's not a palindrome, so partitioning into ["aab"] is valid.

Another partition could be ["aa", "b"], but "aa" is a palindrome, so invalid.

Hence, the best is to partition into one part when possible.

Wait, but in "aab", partitioning into ["aab"] is valid, since "aab" is not a palindrome.

So, that's fine.

Hence, the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, partition it into one part.

- If the string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If such a partition exists, output "YES" and provide that partition.

- If no such partition exists, output "NO".

Now, how do I check if a string is a palindrome?

I can compare the string with its reverse.

In Python, that would be s == s[::-1].

Then, for palindromic strings, I need to find if there exists at least one i where 1 <= i < n, such that both s[0:i] and s[i:n] are not palindromes.

I need to iterate through possible partition points and check if both parts are not palindromes.

But this could be inefficient for large strings, but since n <= 1e6 and t <= 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases <= 1e6, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Perhaps I can precompute palindromic prefixes and suffixes.

Wait, maybe I can find the smallest i such that s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and then check if s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

If both conditions are satisfied, then it's a valid partition.

Similarly, I can try different i and see if any of them satisfy the condition.

But I need to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome and s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

To optimize, I can find all i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and among those, check if s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

But checking for each i would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e6.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome, then for any i, s[0:i] is a palindrome if and only if s[n-i:n] is a palindrome.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, in a palindrome, s[k] == s[n-1-k] for all k.

So, if I take s[0:i], it's a palindrome only if s[0:i] == s[0:i][::-1].

But since s is a palindrome, s[0:i] being a palindrome would depend on the specific characters.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

To do that, I can compute the longest prefix that is a palindrome.

Then, any i greater than that length would have s[0:i] not being a palindrome.

Wait, but I need to find if there exists at least one i where both s[0:i] and s[i:n] are not palindromes.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[i:n] is equal to the reverse of s[0:n-i].

But since s is a palindrome, s[i:n] == s[0:n-i][::-1].

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s[0:i] is not equal to s[n-i:n][::-1].

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose s is a palindrome.

I need to find i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome and s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

But since s is a palindrome, s[i:n] == s[0:n-i][::-1].

So, s[i:n] is a palindrome if and only if s[0:n-i] is a palindrome.

Wait, no.

If s is a palindrome, s[i:n] == s[0:n-i][::-1].

If s[i:n] is a palindrome, then s[i:n] == s[i:n][::-1] == s[0:n-i].

Hence, s[0:n-i] == s[i:n].

But since s is a palindrome, s[0:n-i] == s[i:n].

So, I'm not sure if that helps.

Let me consider that s is a palindrome.

Then, for any i, s[0:i] and s[i:n] have a relationship based on the palindromic property.

But perhaps it's better to iterate through possible i and check directly.

Given that n can be up to 1e6 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e6, I can afford O(n) per string.

Hence, for each palindromic string, I can iterate through possible i from 1 to n-1 and check if both s[0:i] and s[i:n] are not palindromes.

As soon as I find one such i, I can output "YES" and the partition.

If no such i exists, output "NO".

To optimize, I can precompute the palindromic prefixes and suffixes.

Let me define:

- Compute the longest prefix that is a palindrome.

- Compute the longest suffix that is a palindrome.

Then, if the longest palindromic prefix is less than n-1, and the remaining suffix is not a palindrome, then I can partition after the longest palindromic prefix.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

If the entire string is a palindrome, and the longest palindromic prefix is, say, p, then s[0:p] is a palindrome.

If p < n, then s[p:n] is also a palindrome because s is a palindrome.

Hence, in this case, s[p:n] is a palindrome.

So, if I partition at i = p, then s[0:p] is a palindrome, which is not desired.

Hence, this approach might not help.

Wait, perhaps I need to find an i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

To find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

Then, if i + j < n, then I can partition at max(i, j), and both parts would be not palindromes.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

If I can find i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome, and if i + j < n, then I can choose to partition at max(i, j), and both parts would be not palindromes.

Wait, but I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Let me try with an example.

Take "abba":

It's a palindrome.

Longest palindromic prefix: "a" (length 1), "ab" (not palindrome), "abb" (not palindrome), "abba" (palindrome).

Wait, "abba" is a palindrome, "abb" is not a palindrome, "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Similarly, suffixes:

"a" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome, "bba" is not a palindrome, "abba" is a palindrome.

So, the longest palindromic prefix is length 1 ("a"), and the longest palindromic suffix is length 1 ("a").

Then, i = 1, j = 1.

i + j = 2 < n=4.

Hence, I can partition at max(i, j) = 1.

So, partition into s[0:1] = "a" (palindrome, which is not desired).

Wait, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and minimal j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

Then, if i + j < n, then I can partition at i + j, and both parts would be not palindromes.

Wait, in "abba":

Minimal i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome: i=1 ("a" is palindrome), i=2 ("ab" is not palindrome).

Minimal j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome: j=1 ("ba" is not palindrome), j=2 ("bba" is not palindrome).

Then, i + j = 2 + 1 = 3 < n=4.

Partition at i + j = 3: s[0:3] = "abb" (not palindrome), s[3:4] = "a" (palindrome), which is invalid.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, partition at max(i, j) = 2.

So, s[0:2] = "ab" (not palindrome), s[2:4] = "ba" (not palindrome), which is valid.

So, in this case, it worked.

Another example: "aaa".

Longest palindromic prefix: "a", "aa", "aaa" (all palindromes).

Hence, there is no i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

Hence, no valid partition exists.

Another example: "aba".

Longest palindromic prefix: "a", "ab" (not palindrome), "aba" (palindrome).

Longest palindromic suffix: "a", "ba" (not palindrome), "aba" (palindrome).

So, minimal i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome: i=2 ("ab").

Minimal j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome: j=1 ("ba").

Then, i + j = 2 + 1 = 3 < n=3.

Partition at i + j = 3: s[0:3] = "aba" (palindrome), s[3:3] = "" (empty, invalid).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, partition at max(i, j) = 2.

So, s[0:2] = "ab" (not palindrome), s[2:3] = "a" (palindrome), which is invalid.

Hence, no valid partition exists.

Another example: "racecar".

Longest palindromic prefix: "r" (palindrome), "ra" (not palindrome), "rac" (not palindrome), "race" (not palindrome), "racec" (not palindrome), "raceca" (not palindrome), "racecar" (palindrome).

Longest palindromic suffix: "r" (palindrome), "ar" (not palindrome), "car" (not palindrome), "ecar" (not palindrome), "acecar" (not palindrome), "racecar" (palindrome).

Hence, minimal i where s[0:i] is not palindrome: i=2 ("ra").

Minimal j where s[j:n] is not palindrome: j=1 ("ar").

Then, i + j = 2 + 1 = 3 < n=7.

Partition at i + j = 3: s[0:3] = "rac" (not palindrome), s[3:7] = "ecar" (not palindrome), which is valid.

Hence, it works.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the entire string.

- If the string is a palindrome, find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

- If i + j < n, then partition at max(i, j), and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output "YES" with those parts.

- If no such partition exists, output "NO".

Wait, but in "aba", i=2, j=1, i+j=3 < n=3, partition at max(i,j)=2: s[0:2]="ab" (not palindrome), s[2:3]="a" (palindrome), which is invalid.

Hence, need a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps partition at i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome and s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

To optimize, find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and check if s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

If yes, then partition at i.

If not, try the next i.

But this could be time-consuming for large n.

Hence, perhaps find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, and the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome, and if i + j < n, then partition at some i in [i, n-j), and check if both parts are not palindromes.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Maybe I should implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome, and then for each test case:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the entire string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- Iterate through possible partition points i from 1 to n-1.

- For each i, check if s[0:i] is not a palindrome and s[i:n] is not a palindrome.

- If such an i is found, output "YES" with those parts.

- If no such i is found, output "NO".

To optimize, I can precompute the palindromic prefixes and suffixes.

Define:

- Compute the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

- Compute the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

- If i + j < n, then partition at some point between i and n-j, and check if both parts are not palindromes.

But this still seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can do the following:

- Find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

- Find the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

- If i + j < n, then partition at i + j, and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If yes, output "YES" with those parts.

- If not, try partitioning at other points.

But in "aba", i=2, j=1, i+j=3 < n=3, but partitioning at 3 is out of bounds.

Hence, perhaps I need to partition at max(i, j).

In "abba", i=2, j=1, partition at 2: s[0:2]="ab", s[2:4]="ba", both not palindromes, valid.

In "aba", i=2, j=1, partition at 2: s[0:2]="ab", s[2:3]="a", which is a palindrome, invalid.

Hence, in this case, no valid partition exists.

In "racecar", i=2, j=1, i+j=3 < 7, partition at 3: s[0:3]="rac", s[3:7]="ecar", both not palindromes, valid.

In "aaa", i not found since all prefixes are palindromes, hence "NO".

Hence, this seems to work.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" with one part being s.

- If yes, find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome.

- Find the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

- If i + j < n, partition at max(i, j).

- Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If yes, output "YES" with those parts.

- If no such partition exists, output "NO".

I need to implement this logic efficiently.

To check if a string is a palindrome, I can compare s with s[::-1].

To find the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome, I can iterate from i=1 to n-1 and check for each s[0:i] if it's not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome by iterating from j=1 to n-1 and checking s[j:n].

Then, if i + j < n, partition at max(i, j), and check if both parts are not palindromes.

If yes, output "YES" with those parts.

Otherwise, output "NO".

I need to make sure that this is efficient, as n can be up to 1e6 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e6, so O(n) per string is acceptable.

I should also ensure that the implementation is optimized to handle large inputs within time constraints.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

string = input()

s = list(string)

n = len(s)

done = False

if n == 1:

print('NO')

continue

x = s[0]

if x != s[-1]:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

if s.count(x) == n:

print('NO')

This code seems to be attempting to implement the logic we discussed, but it's a bit convoluted.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

For each test case:

- Read the string and convert it to a list s.

- Get the length n.

- Initialize done = False.

- If n == 1, print 'NO' and continue.

- Set x = s[0].

- If x != s[-1], then the string is not a palindrome, so print 'YES', 1, and the string.

- If all characters in s are x, print 'NO'.

- If exactly n-1 characters are x:

- If n is odd and the middle character is not x, print 'NO'.

- Else, print 'YES', 1, and the string.

- Otherwise, iterate through the first (n+1)//2 characters:

- If s[j] != s[n-1-j], print 'YES', 1, and the string.

- Track counts where characters differ from x and attempt to find a partition point.

- If no such partition is found in the loop, print 'NO'.

This seems to be checking for palindromic properties and attempting to find a partition accordingly.

However, the logic inside the loop for counting and partitioning seems overly complicated and error-prone.

I think a simpler and more straightforward approach would be better.

Here's an alternative implementation based on the earlier reasoning:

def is_palindrome(s):

return s == s[::-1]

def main():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])

current = 1

for _ in range(t):

string = data[current]

current += 1

n = len(string)

if n == 1:

print('NO')

continue

if not is_palindrome(string):

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

# String is a palindrome

# Find smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome

i = 1

while i < n:

if not is_palindrome(string[0:i]):

break

i += 1

if i == n:

print('NO')

continue

# Find smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome

j = 1

while j < n:

if not is_palindrome(string[j:n]):

break

j += 1

if i + j < n:

# Try partitioning at max(i, j)

partition_index = max(i, j)

part1 = string[0:partition_index]

part2 = string[partition_index:n]

if not is_palindrome(part1) and not is_palindrome(part2):

print('YES')

print(2)

print(part1, part2)

else:

print('NO')

else:

print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

This code is more straightforward:

- It checks if the string is not a palindrome; if so, partitions it into one part.

- If the string is a palindrome, it finds the smallest i where s[0:i] is not a palindrome and the smallest j where s[j:n] is not a palindrome.

- If i + j < n, it partitions at max(i, j) and checks if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, it outputs "YES" with those parts; otherwise, "NO".

This seems correct based on the earlier reasoning.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to be attempting something similar but with more complexity.

It checks if the first and last characters are different, in which case the whole string is not a palindrome.

If all characters are the same, it's a palindrome and no partition exists.

If almost all characters are the same (n-1 characters), it checks the middle character in case of odd length.

Otherwise, it iterates through the first half of the string to find differences.

However, the counting logic seems unclear and may not correctly identify the partition points.

Hence, I suspect that the provided program might have errors in handling certain cases.

For example, in "abba", it should correctly identify that it's a palindrome and find a partition into ["ab", "ba"], which are both not palindromes.

In "aba", it should identify that no such partition exists.

In "aaa", it should output "NO".

In "aaab", it should output "YES" with one partition ["aaab"].

Given the complexity of the provided code, I'm not entirely confident that it handles all cases correctly.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
