Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

So, the game is set up with n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. On each player's turn, they have to choose a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile, and then remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

Alice goes first, and both players play optimally. I need to determine who will win each game for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand how the game progresses. Let's consider a simple case where there is only one pile. If there is one pile with, say, 5 stones, Alice can choose k=1, remove 1 stone, leaving 4 stones. Then Bob can choose k=1 again, and so on, until Bob removes the last stone and wins. So in this case, Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the sample input, if there's only one pile with 1000000000 stones, the output is "Alice". That contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe my understanding is incomplete.

Let me think again. If there's only one pile, and it has x stones, Alice can choose k=x, remove x stones, and make all piles empty. But wait, since there's only one pile, and she removes x stones, all piles are empty, and Bob can't make a move. So Alice wins. That makes sense for the last test case.

But in the first test case, with 5 piles each having 3 stones, Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty, and Bob loses. So Alice wins again.

In the second test case, with two piles: 1 and 7. Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has only 1 stone), remove 1 stone from each pile, making the piles 0 and 6. Now, Bob can choose k=6, remove 6 stones from the pile with 6 stones, making both piles empty. Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Hmm, so the key seems to be about the possible choices of k and how they affect the piles.

I need to find a general strategy to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

Let me consider the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games, since the moves available depend only on the position and not on which player is moving.

I recall that in impartial games, the concept of Nimbers or the mex function can be used to determine the winner. Maybe this game can be modeled as a Nim heap or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to reduce this game to a known game like Nim.

Let me think differently. Each move consists of selecting a k that is at most the smallest pile and removing k stones from each nonempty pile. This is equivalent to reducing the height of all nonempty piles by k.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where players remove stones from piles, but in standard Nim, you remove any number of stones from a single pile. Here, you're removing the same number of stones from all nonempty piles.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the differences between the piles.

Let me consider sorting the piles in ascending order. Maybe that will help me see a pattern.

In the second test case, piles are [1,7]. After Alice's move: [0,6]. Then Bob moves k=6, resulting in [0,0]. Alice loses.

In the first test case, piles are [3,3,3,3,3]. Alice moves k=3, resulting in [0,0,0,0,0]. Bob loses.

In the third test case, piles are [1,3,9,7,4,2,100]. Let's sort them: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]. Alice must choose k=1, since the smallest pile is 1. So she removes 1 stone from each nonempty pile: [0,1,2,3,6,8,99]. Now Bob can choose k=1 or higher, but it's getting complicated.

Maybe there's a pattern based on the mex or something related to the exponents in the binary representation, but that seems too vague.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Test case 1: 5 piles of 3 each -> Alice wins by taking k=3.

Test case 2: 2 piles, 1 and 7 -> Alice takes k=1, Bob takes k=6 and wins.

Test case 3: 7 piles: 1,3,9,7,4,2,100 -> Alice wins.

Test case 4: 3 piles: 1,2,3 -> Alice wins.

Test case 5: 6 piles: 2,1,3,4,2,4 -> Bob wins.

Test case 6: 8 piles: 5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2 -> Alice wins.

Test case 7: 1 pile: 1000000000 -> Alice wins.

From these, it seems that when all piles are equal, Alice can win by taking k equal to the pile size. When piles are different, it's more complicated.

Wait, in test case 4, piles are 1,2,3. Alice can take k=1, leaving [0,1,2]. Then Bob can take k=1, leaving [0,0,1]. Alice takes k=1, leaving [0,0,0]. So Bob wins? But the sample output says "Alice". Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's simulate it:

- Initial: [1,2,3]

- Alice takes k=1: [0,1,2]

- Bob takes k=1: [0,0,1]

- Alice takes k=1: [0,0,0]

So Alice makes the last move, leaving no stones. According to the rules, the player who can't make a move loses. Since Bob can't move after Alice's last move, Alice wins. So the sample output is correct.

Hmm, maybe I need to find a way to calculate the number of moves or something.

Another approach: Since each move removes k stones from each nonempty pile, the game ends when all piles are empty. The player who makes the last move wins.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where the player who takes the last stone wins. In standard Nim, the first player wins if the Nim sum is not zero.

But in this game, moves affect multiple piles at once, not just one pile.

Maybe I can model this game as a Nim game with certain transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to count the number of moves or to find the mex of some values.

Let me consider the minimal excludant (mex) function, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a set.

In this game, perhaps the mex of the pile sizes can determine something.

Wait, maybe I should look at the pile sizes after each move and see how they change.

Let's consider the pile sizes sorted in ascending order.

In the second test case:

- Initial: [1,7]

- After Alice: [0,6]

- After Bob: [0,0]

So, after Alice's move, one pile is empty, and the other has 6 stones.

In the first test case:

- Initial: [3,3,3,3,3]

- After Alice: [0,0,0,0,0]

Game over, Bob loses.

In test case 4:

- Initial: [1,2,3]

- After Alice: [0,1,2]

- After Bob: [0,0,1]

- After Alice: [0,0,0]

Bob loses.

Wait, in this case, Alice wins by making the last move.

I need to find a general pattern.

Perhaps, the game can be transformed into a different game that's easier to analyze.

Let me consider the number of nonempty piles after each move.

In the second test case:

- Initial: 2 nonempty piles

- After Alice: 1 nonempty pile

- After Bob: 0 nonempty piles

Alice moves first, Bob moves second.

In the first test case:

- Initial: 5 nonempty piles

- After Alice: 0 nonempty piles

Bob can't move, Alice wins.

In test case 4:

- Initial: 3 nonempty piles

- After Alice: 2 nonempty piles

- After Bob: 1 nonempty pile

- After Alice: 0 nonempty piles

Bob loses.

It seems that the number of moves possible is equal to the number of times you can reduce the number of nonempty piles by some amount.

But it's not clear yet.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the mex of the pile sizes.

In the second test case, initial piles [1,7], mex is 0 (since 0 is not present in the pile sizes). After Alice's move: [0,6], mex is 1. Then Bob moves k=1, removes 1 stone from each nonempty pile: [0,5], mex is 1 again. Then Alice can take k=1, leaving [0,4], and so on, until Bob makes the last move.

This doesn't seem directly helpful.

Let me try to think recursively. Determine who wins from a given position based on the possible moves.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case or better.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to sort the unique pile sizes and check if the smallest pile is not 1, in which case Alice wins immediately. Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, and based on that, determines the winner.

Wait, in the provided program, it reads t test cases, reads n and arr for each test case, and then calls func_1(arr) to determine the winner.

Looking at func_1:

- It initializes A as False.

- It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.

- If the smallest unique pile size is not 1, it returns "Alice".

- Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. If not, sets not_c to False.

- Then toggles A based on the loop.

- Finally, returns "Alice" if A is True, else "Bob".

This seems overly simplistic and likely incorrect.

In the second test case, piles are [1,7]. Unique sorted piles: [1,7].

Since the smallest is 1, it enters the loop:

- i=1: set_[1]=7, set_[0]=1, difference is 6 >1, so not_c=False.

- A is toggled once.

- Then A is not toggled again.

- Since not_c is False, A is not toggled again.

- A was toggled once, so A=True.

- So it should return "Alice", but according to the sample input, the correct output is "Bob".

Hence, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
