Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and the sum of y and the greatest common divisor of x and y (that's gcd(x,y)) is as large as possible. And I need to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x,y) is. It's the largest number that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6,4) is 2 because 2 is the biggest number that divides both 6 and 4.

So, the goal is to pick y (where y < x) such that y + gcd(x,y) is maximized.

Let me think about this. Since y has to be less than x, the maximum y can be is x-1. But does choosing y = x-1 always give me the maximum y + gcd(x,y)?

Let me try with an example. Take x = 10.

Possible y values are from 1 to 9.

Let's compute y + gcd(x,y) for each:

- y=1: 1 + gcd(10,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + gcd(10,2)=2+2=4

- y=3: 3 + gcd(10,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + gcd(10,4)=4+2=6

- y=5: 5 + gcd(10,5)=5+5=10

- y=6: 6 + gcd(10,6)=6+2=8

- y=7: 7 + gcd(10,7)=7+1=8

- y=8: 8 + gcd(10,8)=8+2=10

- y=9: 9 + gcd(10,9)=9+1=10

So, the maximum values are 10, which occurs for y=5, y=8, and y=9.

Now, looking at the provided program, it simply chooses y = x // 2 for each x. For x=10, x//2 is 5, which is one of the y values that give the maximum sum.

Wait, but in this case, y=5 gives the maximum, but y=8 and y=9 also give the same maximum. So, is choosing y = x//2 always giving me a y that maximizes y + gcd(x,y)?

Let me try another example. Let's take x=7.

Possible y values: 1 to 6.

Compute y + gcd(x,y):

- y=1: 1 + gcd(7,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + gcd(7,2)=2+1=3

- y=3: 3 + gcd(7,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + gcd(7,4)=4+1=5

- y=5: 5 + gcd(7,5)=5+1=6

- y=6: 6 + gcd(7,6)=6+1=7

So, the maximum is 7, which occurs for y=6.

According to the program, y = 7//2 = 3. But in this case, y=3 gives y + gcd(x,y) = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not the maximum possible. The maximum is 7, achieved with y=6.

Hmm, so in this case, choosing y = x//2 doesn't give the maximum sum.

Wait, maybe I need to choose y such that it's the largest possible y that is less than x and shares a gcd greater than 1 with x.

In the first example, x=10, y=5 shares a gcd of 5 with x, which is greater than 1.

In the second example, x=7, y=6 shares a gcd of 1 with x, but y=6 is still the one that maximizes the sum because y=6 + gcd(7,6)=6+1=7, which is larger than any other y.

Wait, but y=6 gives gcd(7,6)=1, which is not greater than 1.

Maybe I need to choose y such that y is as large as possible, and then see what gcd(x,y) is.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6 gives y + gcd(x,y)=7, which is better than y=5 + gcd(7,5)=6+1=7, same as y=6.

Wait, actually, y=5 also gives 5 + 1 = 6, no, wait, earlier I calculated y=5 gives 5 + 1 = 6, but y=6 gives 6 + 1 =7.

So, y=6 is better.

Wait, but in the program, for x=7, y=7//2=3, which gives y + gcd(7,3)=3 +1=4, which is less than the maximum possible of 7.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, it says: "if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any."

So, in x=10, y=5,8,9 all give the same maximum sum, so choosing any of them is fine.

In x=7, y=6 gives the maximum sum, so choosing y=3 is not incorrect because the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

Wait, but in this case, y=3 gives a sum of 4, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

So, is the program always choosing a y that achieves the maximum sum?

In x=10, it chooses y=5, which achieves the maximum sum of 10.

In x=7, it chooses y=3, which achieves a sum of 4, but the maximum is 7.

So, in x=7, it's not choosing y that achieves the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a pattern here.

Let me try x=21.

Possible y from 1 to 20.

Compute y + gcd(x,y):

- y=1: 1 + 1 =2

- y=2: 2 + 1=3

- y=3: 3 + 3=6

- y=4:4 +1=5

- y=5:5 +1=6

- y=6:6 +3=9

- y=7:7 +7=14

- y=8:8 +1=9

- y=9:9 +3=12

- y=10:10 +1=11

- y=11:11 +1=12

- y=12:12 +3=15

- y=13:13 +1=14

- y=14:14 +7=21

- y=15:15 +3=18

- y=16:16 +1=17

- y=17:17 +1=18

- y=18:18 +3=21

- y=19:19 +1=20

- y=20:20 +1=21

So, the maximum sum is 21, achieved by y=14, y=18, and y=20.

The program chooses y=21//2=10, which gives y + gcd(x,y)=10 + 1=11, which is less than the maximum possible sum of 21.

So, again, the program is not choosing y that achieves the maximum sum.

Wait, but the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, but the program is choosing y that doesn't achieve the maximum sum.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe for some x, y=x//2 does achieve the maximum sum.

For example, in x=10, y=5 gives y + gcd(10,5)=5 +5=10, which is the maximum.

In x=2, y=1 gives y + gcd(2,1)=1 +1=2, which is the maximum.

In x=6, y=3 gives y + gcd(6,3)=3 +3=6, which seems like a maximum.

Wait, but in x=7, y=3 gives y + gcd(7,3)=3 +1=4, which is not the maximum.

In x=100, y=50 gives y + gcd(100,50)=50 +50=100, which seems like a maximum.

Wait, but in x=21, y=10 gives y + gcd(21,10)=10 +1=11, which is not the maximum.

Wait, in x=1000, y=500 gives y + gcd(1000,500)=500 +500=1000, which seems like a maximum.

But in x=7, y=3 gives only 4, while y=6 gives 7.

Wait, maybe choosing y=x-1 always gives a sum of x-1 +1= x, since gcd(x,x-1)=1.

But in x=7, y=6 gives y + gcd(7,6)=6 +1=7, which is better than y=5 + gcd(7,5)=6 +1=7.

Wait, but in x=100, y=99 gives y + gcd(100,99)=99 +1=100, which seems like a possible maximum.

But in x=21, y=20 gives y + gcd(21,20)=20 +1=21, which is the maximum.

Wait, in x=21, y=20 gives sum=21, which is the maximum.

Similarly, y=14 gives y + gcd(21,14)=14 +7=21, and y=18 gives y + gcd(21,18)=18 +3=21.

So, y=20 also achieves the sum of 21.

So, in this case, choosing y=x-1 gives the maximum sum.

But in x=10, y=9 gives y + gcd(10,9)=9 +1=10, which is the maximum.

Similarly, y=8 gives y + gcd(10,8)=8 +2=10.

And y=5 gives y + gcd(10,5)=5 +5=10.

So, in x=10, y=x-1=9 gives the maximum sum.

In x=7, y=6 gives y + gcd(7,6)=6 +1=7, which is the maximum.

In x=2, y=1 gives y + gcd(2,1)=1 +1=2, which is the maximum.

In x=6, y=5 gives y + gcd(6,5)=5 +1=6, which is the maximum.

Wait, but in x=6, y=3 gives y + gcd(6,3)=3 +3=6, which is also maximum.

So, choosing y=x-1 seems to give the maximum sum.

But in x=100, y=99 gives y + gcd(100,99)=99 +1=100, which is the maximum.

Similarly, in x=1000, y=999 gives y + gcd(1000,999)=999 +1=1000, which is the maximum.

So, perhaps choosing y=x-1 always gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but in x=21, y=20 gives y + gcd(21,20)=20 +1=21, which is the maximum.

Similarly, in x=7, y=6 gives y + gcd(7,6)=6 +1=7, which is the maximum.

In x=10, y=9 gives y + gcd(10,9)=9 +1=10, which is the maximum.

In x=2, y=1 gives y + gcd(2,1)=1 +1=2, which is the maximum.

In x=6, y=5 gives y + gcd(6,5)=5 +1=6, which is the maximum.

So, choosing y=x-1 seems to always give the maximum sum.

But the program chooses y=x//2, which is y=x divided by 2, integer division.

In x=10, x//2=5, which gives y + gcd(10,5)=5 +5=10, which is the maximum.

In x=7, x//2=3, which gives y + gcd(7,3)=3 +1=4, which is not the maximum.

In x=21, x//2=10, which gives y + gcd(21,10)=10 +1=11, which is not the maximum.

In x=100, x//2=50, which gives y + gcd(100,50)=50 +50=100, which is the maximum.

In x=1000, x//2=500, which gives y + gcd(1000,500)=500 +500=1000, which is the maximum.

In x=6, x//2=3, which gives y + gcd(6,3)=3 +3=6, which is the maximum.

Wait, so in some cases, y=x//2 gives the maximum sum, and in others, it doesn't.

But in the cases where x is even, y=x//2 seems to give the maximum sum.

For example, x=10, y=5 gives sum=10.

x=100, y=50 gives sum=100.

x=1000, y=500 gives sum=1000.

x=6, y=3 gives sum=6.

But in x=7, y=3 gives sum=4, while y=6 gives sum=7, which is better.

Similarly, in x=21, y=10 gives sum=11, but y=20 gives sum=21.

So, perhaps for even x, y=x//2 gives the maximum sum, but for odd x, y=x-1 gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but in x=7 (odd), y=x-1=6 gives the maximum sum of 7.

In x=21 (odd), y=x-1=20 gives the maximum sum of 21.

In x=10 (even), y=x//2=5 gives sum=10, which is the maximum.

In x=6 (even), y=x//2=3 gives sum=6, which is the maximum.

In x=2 (even), y=x//2=1 gives sum=2, which is the maximum.

Wait, but in x=4, y=x//2=2, y + gcd(4,2)=2 +2=4, which is the maximum.

But y=3, y + gcd(4,3)=3 +1=4, which is the same.

So, choosing y=x//2 gives the maximum sum.

Similarly, in x=8, y=4 gives y + gcd(8,4)=4 +4=8, which is the maximum.

y=7 gives y + gcd(8,7)=7 +1=8, same as y=4.

So, both y=4 and y=7 give the maximum sum.

So, in even x, y=x//2 gives the maximum sum.

In odd x, y=x-1 gives the maximum sum.

But in the program, it always chooses y=x//2, which is fine for even x, but not for odd x.

In the example where x=7, the program chooses y=3, which gives sum=4, but y=6 gives sum=7, which is better.

Similarly, in x=21, y=10 gives sum=11, but y=20 gives sum=21, which is better.

So, the program is incorrect for odd x.

But in the problem statement, it says that for x=7, the output is 6, which matches the example.

But the program would output y=3 for x=7, which is not the best choice.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

So, if there are multiple y that achieve the maximum sum, any of them is acceptable.

In x=10, y=5,8,9 all achieve the sum of 10.

So, choosing y=5 is fine.

In x=7, y=6 achieves the sum of 7, which is the maximum.

So, choosing y=6 is required.

But the program chooses y=3, which gives sum=4, which is not the maximum.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to look at it.

Let me consider that y + gcd(x,y) can be rewritten as y + gcd(x,y) = y + gcd(x,y).

I need to maximize this sum.

I know that gcd(x,y) divides both x and y.

Let me think about the properties of y and gcd(x,y).

Let d = gcd(x,y).

Then, y can be written as y = d * k, where k is an integer, and k < x/d.

Also, since d divides x, x = d * m, where m is an integer.

So, y = d * k, and y < x implies k < m.

Then, y + d = d * k + d = d * (k + 1).

So, the sum y + d = d * (k + 1).

To maximize this sum, I need to maximize d * (k + 1), given that k < m.

Given that d divides x, and k < m, where m = x / d.

So, for a fixed d, the maximum k is m - 1, so the maximum sum for that d is d * (m - 1 + 1) = d * m = x.

Wait, but y < x, so y = d * (m - 1), which is less than x.

Wait, x = d * m, y = d * (m - 1), which is y = x - d.

So, y = x - d.

Then, y + d = (x - d) + d = x.

So, the sum is x.

Wait, that means that for d = gcd(x,y), y = x - d, and y + d = x.

So, the sum is always x, regardless of d.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6, d=gcd(7,6)=1, y + d =6 +1=7.

Similarly, in x=10, y=9, d=gcd(10,9)=1, y + d=9 +1=10.

In x=10, y=5, d=gcd(10,5)=5, y + d=5 +5=10.

So, in all cases where y = x - d, the sum is x.

So, the maximum sum is x, achieved when y = x - d, where d divides x.

So, to maximize y + gcd(x,y), we need to set y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

But d can be any divisor of x.

So, y = x - d, for some divisor d of x.

Then, y + d = x.

So, the sum is always x, regardless of which divisor d we choose.

But y must be less than x, which it is, since d >=1.

So, y = x - d, for any divisor d of x, will give y + d = x.

Hence, the maximum sum is x, achievable by setting y = x - d, for any divisor d of x.

But among all possible y, which y should I choose?

Well, since y = x - d, and d is a divisor of x, then y must be such that x - y is a divisor of x.

So, to achieve the maximum sum, which is x, I can choose any y such that x - y divides x.

And the problem allows any such y.

So, in the program, it chooses y = x // 2.

In some cases, like x=10, x//2=5, and x - y =5, which is a divisor of 10.

Hence, y=5 gives sum=10.

In x=7, x//2=3, and x - y=4, which is not a divisor of 7.

Hence, y=3 gives sum=4, which is not the maximum.

But, if I choose y=6, then x - y=1, which is a divisor of 7, and y + d=6 +1=7, which is the maximum.

So, the program is incorrect because for x=7, it chooses y=3, which does not achieve the maximum sum.

Similarly, in x=21, y=10 gives x - y=11, which is not a divisor of 21.

Hence, y=10 gives sum=11, which is not the maximum.

But y=20 gives x - y=1, which is a divisor of 21, and y + d=20 +1=21, which is the maximum.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a pattern where y=x//2 gives the maximum sum when x is even, and y=x-1 when x is odd.

In x=10 (even), y=5 gives sum=10, which is maximum.

In x=7 (odd), y=6 gives sum=7, which is maximum.

In x=21 (odd), y=20 gives sum=21, which is maximum.

In x=6 (even), y=3 gives sum=6, which is maximum.

In x=2 (even), y=1 gives sum=2, which is maximum.

So, perhaps choosing y=x-1 when x is odd, and y=x//2 when x is even.

But in x=10, y=5 and y=9 both give sum=10.

So, choosing y=x-1 works for both even and odd x.

In x=10, y=9 gives sum=10.

In x=7, y=6 gives sum=7.

In x=21, y=20 gives sum=21.

In x=6, y=5 gives sum=6.

In x=2, y=1 gives sum=2.

So, choosing y=x-1 always achieves the sum of x, which seems to be the maximum.

Hence, to make the program correct, I should choose y=x-1 for all x.

But in the program, it chooses y=x//2.

Which works for some x, but not for others.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) (\( \gcd(x, y) \)) is maximized.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an integer \( x \).
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and \( y + \gcd(x, y) \) is maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize \( y + \gcd(x, y) \), we should choose \( y \) such that \( y \) is as large as possible and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is also maximized.
   - One effective way is to choose \( y = x - 1 \), because \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1, leading to \( y + \gcd(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x \).

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - For any \( x \), choosing \( y = x - 1 \) will always give \( y + \gcd(x, y) = x \), which is the maximum possible sum.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(t):
        x = int(data[i+1])
        y = x - 1
        print(y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Split the input data into a list of strings.
  - The first element is the number of test cases \( t \).
  - Each subsequent element corresponds to \( x \) for each test case.

- **Choosing \( y \)**:
  - For each \( x \), set \( y = x - 1 \).
  - This choice ensures \( y + \gcd(x, y) = x \), which is the maximum achievable sum.

- **Output**:
  - Print the value of \( y \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that we always achieve the maximum sum \( y + \gcd(x, y) = x \) by selecting \( y = x - 1 \), making it an optimal and efficient solution.
