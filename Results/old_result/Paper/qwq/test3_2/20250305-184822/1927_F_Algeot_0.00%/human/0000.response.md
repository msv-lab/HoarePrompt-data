Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an undirected weighted graph, and I need to find a simple cycle where the lightest edge is as minimal as possible. A simple cycle means no repeated vertices or edges in the cycle.

First, I need to understand what a simple cycle is. It's a path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any vertices or edges in between. So, in graph theory terms, it's a cycle where each vertex and each edge is unique.

The problem asks for the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible. So, among all possible simple cycles in the graph, I need to find one where the smallest edge weight is the smallest possible compared to all other cycles.

Given that the graph can have up to 2*10^5 edges and 10^4 test cases, efficiency is key here. I need an algorithm that can handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.

Let's think about how to approach this.

One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) and look for back edges that connect to an ancestor of the current node in the DFS tree. These back edges indicate cycles.

To find the lightest edge in such cycles, I need to keep track of the edge weights during the DFS traversal.

But since I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible, I should look for cycles where the minimum edge weight is minimized.

An idea comes to mind: sort the edges in descending order of their weights and add them one by one to the graph while keeping track of the cycles formed.

Wait, sorting in descending order? Why not ascending? Let me think.

If I sort the edges in ascending order of weight and add them one by one, I'd be adding lighter edges first. But in terms of finding cycles with the smallest possible lightest edge, maybe descending order makes more sense.

Actually, no. If I sort in ascending order, starting with the smallest edges, the first cycle I find would have the smallest possible edge weights.

Wait, but I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible overall in the graph.

So, perhaps I should consider the minimal edge weight in the graph and see if it's part of any cycle.

But the problem is to find a cycle where the minimal edge in that cycle is as small as possible compared to the minimal edges in other cycles.

Wait, that might not be the best way to think about it.

Let me consider this: I need to find a cycle where the smallest edge in that cycle is minimized across all possible cycles.

So, I need to find a cycle whose lightest edge is smaller than the lightest edges in other cycles.

In other words, among all possible cycles, find one where the minimal edge weight is the smallest possible.

So, to minimize the lightest edge in the cycle, I need to find a cycle that includes the smallest possible edge weights.

One approach could be to sort all edges by their weights in ascending order and then iterate through them, trying to find a cycle that includes these edges.

But that might not be efficient enough for the given constraints.

Another idea: use a union-find structure to keep track of connected components. As I add edges in ascending order of their weights, I can detect cycles.

Yes, that sounds promising.

So, I can sort the edges by weight in ascending order.

Then, I can iterate through the sorted edges and use a union-find data structure to keep track of which vertices are connected.

When I encounter an edge that connects two vertices that are already in the same connected component, adding this edge would form a cycle.

So, whenever I find such an edge, I can consider the cycle formed by this edge and the path connecting the two vertices in the current spanning forest.

Moreover, since I'm processing edges in ascending order of weight, the first cycle I find should have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the cycle I find is a simple cycle.

Given that I'm using a union-find structure, and I'm adding edges one by one, when I find an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, I can find the cycle by combining the path from one vertex to the other in the current spanning tree and then adding the edge that causes the cycle.

But I need to make sure that this cycle is simple, meaning no repeated vertices or edges.

Given that the union-find structure with union by rank and path compression can handle this efficiently, and that the spanning tree formed is acyclic until we add the edge that forms the cycle, I think this approach should work.

So, here's a plan:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

2. Initialize a union-find data structure with all vertices.

3. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v), check if u and v are already connected.

- If they are connected, adding this edge would form a cycle.

- Record this cycle and its lightest edge.

- Since we're processing edges in ascending order of weight, the first cycle found will have the smallest possible lightest edge.

- We can stop here because any other cycle would have a lightest edge that is at least as large as the one we've found.

b. If u and v are not connected, unite them in the union-find structure.

4. Output the lightest edge weight of the found cycle and the cycle itself.

But wait, the problem allows multiple test cases, and the total number of edges across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, with individual test cases having up to 2*10^5 edges. So, efficiency is crucial.

The sorting step would take O(M log M) time per test case, where M is the number of edges, which should be acceptable given M <= 2*10^5 per test case and T <= 10^4, but with T*M <= 2*10^5, it should be fine.

The union-find operations with path compression and union by rank are nearly O(M alpha(N)), which is very efficient.

However, I need to actually find the cycle when I detect a back edge.

To find the cycle, I can keep track of the parent of each vertex in the DFS tree constructed by the union-find.

Then, when I find an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, I can find the path from one vertex to the other in the DFS tree and add the edge to form the cycle.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I need to maintain a way to reconstruct the path between two vertices in the union-find structure.

But union-find doesn't directly provide a way to find the path between two vertices.

Maybe I need to use a different approach.

An alternative approach is to perform a DFS on the graph and keep track of the path from the starting vertex to the current vertex.

When I find a back edge to an ancestor in the DFS tree, I can extract the cycle by following the parent pointers from the current vertex to the ancestor.

This way, I can construct the cycle path explicitly.

Given that, perhaps I should sort the edges in ascending order of weight and build the graph accordingly, then perform a DFS to find the first cycle encountered.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the lightest edge in the cycle is minimized.

So, if I sort the edges in ascending order of weight and add them one by one, the first cycle I find should have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, here's a refined plan:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

2. Initialize a union-find data structure.

3. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v), if u and v are not in the same component, unite them.

b. If u and v are already in the same component, then adding this edge would form a cycle.

- Record the lightest edge in this cycle, which would be the current edge's weight since we're processing in ascending order.

- Reconstruct the cycle by finding the path from u to v in the DFS tree and adding the edge (u, v).

- Output the lightest edge weight and the cycle.

4. Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one simple cycle, and given the constraints, this should work efficiently.

But I need to make sure that the cycle I find is indeed a simple cycle, with no repeated vertices or edges.

Given that I'm using a DFS tree and back edges, and reconstructing the cycle based on the path in the DFS tree and the back edge, this should ensure that the cycle is simple.

Now, considering the implementation details:

- I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

- I need to sort the edges in ascending order of weight for each test case.

- I need to implement a union-find data structure with path compression and union by rank for efficiency.

- I need to perform a DFS to find the path between two vertices when a back edge is found.

- I need to reconstruct the cycle path in the correct order.

- I need to output the lightest edge weight and the cycle path.

Also, I need to make sure that the DFS is implemented efficiently, especially since N and M can be up to 2*10^5.

To optimize, I can precompute the parent pointers during the DFS and use them to reconstruct the cycle quickly.

Let me consider an example to verify this approach.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

6 6

1 2 1

2 3 1

3 1 1

4 5 1

5 6 1

6 4 1

Sorting edges by weight in ascending order:

All edges have weight 1, so the order doesn't change.

Now, initialize union-find with 6 vertices.

Process edges one by one:

- 1-2: unite 1 and 2.

- 2-3: unite 2 and 3 (which are now connected through 1).

- 3-1: 1 and 3 are already connected, so adding this edge forms a cycle.

- Since all edges have weight 1, the lightest edge in this cycle is 1.

- Reconstruct the cycle: path from 3 to 1 is 3->2->1, plus edge 3-1.

- So, cycle is 3,2,1,3.

- But in the sample output, it's 1 2 3, which is another valid cycle in the same test case.

Wait, in this test case, all edges have weight 1, so any cycle will have the lightest edge as 1.

So, the output is correct.

Another test case:

6 6

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

Sorting edges by weight:

6-4 3

3-1 5

2-3 8

1-2 10

4-5 100

5-6 40

Process edges:

- 6-4: unite 6 and 4.

- 3-1: unite 3 and 1.

- 2-3: unite 2 and 3 (which is connected to 1).

- 1-2: 1 and 2 are already connected, so this forms a cycle.

- The lightest edge in this cycle is 5 (from edge 3-1).

- But according to the sample output, the answer is 3 3, which corresponds to cycle 6 4 5.

Wait, how does that cycle have lightest edge 3?

In the edge 6-4, weight 3, and edge 4-5, weight 100, and edge 5-6, weight 40.

So, the lightest edge in cycle 6-4-5-6 is 3.

But in my earlier approach, I found a cycle at edge 1-2, which has a lightest edge of 5.

So, according to the problem, it wants the minimal lightest edge among all possible cycles.

In this case, the cycle 6-4-5 with lightest edge 3 is better than the cycle 1-2-3 with lightest edge 5.

Hence, my earlier approach might be flawed.

Wait, in my earlier plan, I assumed that processing edges in ascending order and finding the first cycle would give the minimal lightest edge.

But in this case, the first cycle found would be at edge 1-2, but there's another cycle with a smaller lightest edge via 6-4.

So, my approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust my strategy.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to find, for each possible lightest edge weight, whether there exists a cycle where the lightest edge is that weight.

Then, find the smallest such weight.

But that sounds too slow for the given constraints.

An alternative idea: find the minimal weight edge that is part of some cycle.

But how do I ensure that in that cycle, there isn't a smaller edge?

Wait, I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible.

So, perhaps I need to find a cycle where no edge in the cycle has a weight smaller than a certain value, and find the smallest such value.

This sounds similar to finding the minimal weight of the heaviest edge in the cycle, but it's not exactly the same.

Wait, no.

I need the minimal weight among the edges in the cycle to be as small as possible.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through all possible edges in ascending order of their weights, and for each edge, check if it's part of a cycle where all edges are at least as heavy as this edge.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of graph components.

If I sort the edges in ascending order of weight and start adding them to the graph, keeping track of the connected components, then when I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

The lightest edge in that cycle would be the weight of the edge I'm trying to add, since all previous edges are lighter and have already been added.

Wait, no.

Actually, the lightest edge in the cycle would be the minimal edge among all edges in the cycle.

But in this approach, when I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, the cycle formed would include the path connecting those two vertices in the current spanning tree and the new edge.

So, the lightest edge in this cycle would be the minimal among the new edge and the edges in the path.

But since I'm adding edges in ascending order, the path between the two vertices in the current spanning tree consists of edges that are at least as heavy as the new edge.

Wait, no.

Actually, since I'm adding edges in ascending order, the spanning tree built so far has edges that are lighter than or equal to the new edge.

But the path between u and v in the spanning tree might include edges that are heavier than the new edge.

Wait, no.

Since I'm adding edges in ascending order, the spanning tree is built with increasingly heavier edges.

But the path between u and v in the spanning tree could include edges that are heavier than some earlier edges not in the path.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a threshold W, and consider only edges with weight at least W.

Then, I can find the connected components in the graph using only these edges.

If there is a cycle in this subgraph, then that cycle has all edges with weight at least W.

So, to find the minimal W such that there is a cycle with all edges at least W, I can binary search on W.

But actually, I need the minimal lightest edge in the cycle over all possible cycles.

Wait, that's not exactly the same.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal W such that there exists a cycle where the minimal edge in the cycle is at least W.

But I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look back at the initial approach.

In the initial approach, sorting edges in ascending order and finding the first cycle, but that didn't work as per the second sample input.

So, perhaps I need to find, for each edge, the minimal cycle that includes that edge and has no lighter edges.

Wait, that sounds too involved.

An alternative idea: find all cycles in the graph and then, for each cycle, find its minimal edge weight, then find the cycle with the minimal minimal edge weight.

But finding all cycles in a graph is not feasible for large graphs.

So, I need a better way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

- Initialize a union-find structure.

- Iterate through the sorted edges:

- For each edge (u, v), if u and v are not in the same component, unite them.

- If u and v are already in the same component, then adding this edge would form a cycle.

- In this case, the lightest edge in this cycle would be the weight of the current edge, because all previous edges are lighter or equal, and they have already been added.

- So, the first such cycle found would have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Wait, but in the second sample input, the first cycle found had lightest edge 5, but there was another cycle with lightest edge 3.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that when I find a cycle, I consider the minimal edge in that cycle, which could be smaller than the current edge's weight.

But in the spanning tree built so far, all edges are lighter than or equal to the current edge's weight.

So, the path between u and v in the spanning tree consists of edges that are lighter than or equal to the current edge's weight.

Hence, the minimal edge in the cycle would be the minimal between the current edge's weight and the maximal edge in the path from u to v in the spanning tree.

Wait, no.

The minimal edge in the cycle would be the minimal among the current edge and the edges in the path from u to v in the spanning tree.

But since the spanning tree's edges are sorted in ascending order, the minimal edge in the path is the smallest edge in the path.

But it's complicated to determine the minimal edge in the path.

Perhaps instead of trying to find the minimal lightest edge in one pass, I need to iterate through the edges in ascending order and keep track of the minimal lightest edge found so far.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the provided code and see what approach it takes.

Looking at the provided code:

- It reads T test cases.

- For each test case, it reads N and M, then reads M edges with weights.

- It sorts the edges in descending order of weight.

- It initializes a union-find structure.

- It iterates through the sorted edges (from highest to lowest weight):

- For each edge (v, w, c), if v and w are already in the same component, it updates the answer with the current weight c and records the vertices v and w.

- Then, it performs a DFS starting from one of these vertices to find the cycle.

- In the DFS, it keeps track of the path and when it finds a back edge to v0, it records the cycle.

- Finally, it prints the lightest edge and the cycle.

Wait, but sorting in descending order seems counterintuitive because we want the smallest possible lightest edge.

But in the code, it sorts edges in descending order of weight, which is opposite to my initial thoughts.

Let me see what's happening here.

By sorting in descending order, it's processing the heaviest edges first.

When it finds an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

But in this case, since it's processing heavy edges first, the cycle it finds might not have the smallest possible lightest edge.

In fact, in the second sample input, sorting in descending order would process edges with weights 10, 8, 5, etc.

When it finds a cycle, it might not be the one with the smallest lightest edge.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But according to the sample input and output, it seems to produce the correct output.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is "3 3" which corresponds to cycle 6,4,5 with lightest edge 3, which is correct.

But according to my earlier reasoning, sorting in descending order shouldn't guarantee finding the cycle with the smallest lightest edge.

However, perhaps it works because regardless of the order, it finds some cycle, and among multiple cycles, it picks one with a smaller lightest edge.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose we have a graph with edges:

1-2 with weight 1

2-3 with weight 2

3-1 with weight 3

Sorting in descending order: 3,2,1

Processing edge 3-1: unite 3 and 1

Processing edge 2-3: unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 1-2: 1 and 2 are already connected, so it forms a cycle.

The cycle is 1-2 and 1-3-2.

The lightest edge in this cycle is 1.

But according to the problem, the minimal lightest edge should be 1, which is correct.

So, in this case, it works.

Another example:

1-2 with weight 1

2-3 with weight 1

3-1 with weight 2

Sorting in descending order: 2,1,1

Processing edge 3-1 (weight 2): unite 3 and 1

Processing edge 2-3 (weight 1): unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 1-2 (weight 1): 1 and 2 are already connected, forming a cycle.

The cycle is 1-2 and 1-3-2.

The lightest edge in this cycle is 1.

Which is correct.

So, perhaps sorting in descending order works because when we find a cycle, the lightest edge in that cycle is the smallest edge in the cycle, and since we're processing heavier edges first, the lightest edge in the cycle is correctly identified.

But I need to think more carefully.

Wait, no. Suppose we have a graph with edges:

1-2 with weight 1

2-3 with weight 2

3-1 with weight 3

4-5 with weight 1

5-6 with weight 2

6-4 with weight 3

In this graph, there are two cycles:

1-2-3-1 with lightest edge 1

4-5-6-4 with lightest edge 1

So, the minimal lightest edge is 1.

If we sort edges in descending order: 3,3,3,2,2,1

Processing edge 3-1: unite 3 and 1

Processing edge 6-4: unite 6 and 4

Processing edge 5-6: unite 5 and 6

Processing edge 2-3: unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 4-5: unite 4 and 5

Processing edge 1-2: 1 and 2 are not connected, unite them.

No cycle is found in this processing.

But according to the problem, there should be at least one cycle.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in the code, it sorts edges in descending order and finds a cycle when two vertices are already connected.

But in this example, all edges are united without forming a cycle, which contradicts the problem's guarantee that there is always at least one cycle.

Wait, perhaps my example is invalid.

Given that M >= N >= 3 and M >= N, the graph is guaranteed to have at least one cycle.

In my example, N=6 and M=6, which is valid.

But according to the code, it should find a cycle when processing edge 1-2, but in my simulation, all vertices are united without forming a cycle.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the example.

Let me set N=3, M=3:

Edges: 1-2 with weight 1, 2-3 with weight 2, 3-1 with weight 3

Sort in descending order: 3,2,1

Processing edge 3-1: unite 3 and 1

Processing edge 2-3: unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 1-2: 1 and 2 are already connected, forming a cycle.

So, it correctly identifies the cycle with lightest edge 1.

Another example: N=4, M=4

Edges: 1-2 with weight 1, 2-3 with weight 1, 3-4 with weight 1, 4-1 with weight 1

Sort in descending order: all weights are 1, so order doesn't matter.

Processing any edge first, then second, third, and when processing the fourth edge, it forms a cycle.

The lightest edge in the cycle is 1.

Which is correct.

So, perhaps sorting in descending order works because when we find a cycle, the lightest edge in that cycle is correctly identified as the current edge's weight, which is the smallest in the cycle.

But I need to confirm this logic.

Wait, in the second sample input, sorting in descending order led to finding a cycle with lightest edge 3, which is correct.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Maybe I need to accept that the approach, despite sorting in descending order, correctly identifies the minimal lightest edge in some cycle.

But I'm still a bit unsure about why it works.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the edges in descending order and add them one by one, keeping track of connected components.

When I find an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

The lightest edge in this cycle would be the minimal among the edges in the cycle.

But since I'm adding heavier edges first, the path between the two vertices in the spanning tree consists of edges that are heavier than or equal to the current edge.

Wait, no.

Actually, when I add edges in descending order, the spanning tree built so far consists of heavier edges.

When I find a back edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, the cycle formed includes the back edge and the path between the two vertices in the spanning tree.

Since the spanning tree's edges are heavier than the back edge (because we're adding edges in descending order), the lightest edge in the cycle is the back edge itself.

Wait, no.

If I add edges in descending order, the spanning tree's edges are heavier than the back edge, so the lightest edge in the cycle is the back edge.

Therefore, when I find a cycle, the lightest edge in that cycle is the back edge's weight.

So, among all such cycles found, the lightest edge would be the back edge's weight.

But in the second sample input, the back edge with weight 5 formed a cycle with lightest edge 5, but there was another cycle with lightest edge 3.

So, according to this logic, the code should have found the cycle with lightest edge 3, since it's added later in the descending order.

Wait, no.

In the second sample input, edges sorted in descending order:

1-2 10

2-3 8

3-1 5

4-5 100

5-6 40

6-4 3

Processing edge 1-2 (10): unite 1 and 2

Processing edge 2-3 (8): unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 3-1 (5): 3 and 1 are not connected, unite them

Processing edge 4-5 (100): unite 4 and 5

Processing edge 5-6 (40): unite 5 and 6

Processing edge 6-4 (3): 6 and 4 are already connected, forming a cycle.

So, it finds the cycle with edge 6-4 (weight 3) and the path from 6 to 4 in the spanning tree.

The path from 6 to 4 is 6-5-4.

So, the cycle is 6-5-4-6, with edges 6-5 (40), 5-4 (100), and 4-6 (3).

The lightest edge in this cycle is 3.

Hence, it correctly identifies the cycle with lightest edge 3.

In contrast, if I had processed edges in ascending order, I might have found a different cycle with a higher lightest edge.

So, perhaps sorting in descending order and finding the first cycle gives the correct minimal lightest edge.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose N=4, M=4

Edges: 1-2 with weight 1, 2-3 with weight 2, 3-4 with weight 3, 4-1 with weight 4

Sorting in descending order: 4,3,2,1

Processing edge 4-1 (4): unite 4 and 1

Processing edge 3-4 (3): unite 3 and 4

Processing edge 2-3 (2): unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 1-2 (1): 1 and 2 are already connected, forming a cycle.

The cycle is 1-2-3-4-1, with edges 1-2 (1), 2-3 (2), 3-4 (3), 4-1 (4).

The lightest edge in this cycle is 1.

So, it correctly identifies the minimal lightest edge as 1.

Another example: N=4, M=4

Edges: 1-2 with weight 2, 2-3 with weight 3, 3-4 with weight 4, 4-1 with weight 1

Sorting in descending order: 4,3,2,1

Processing edge 3-4 (4): unite 3 and 4

Processing edge 2-3 (3): unite 2 and 3

Processing edge 1-2 (2): unite 1 and 2

Processing edge 4-1 (1): 4 and 1 are already connected, forming a cycle.

The cycle is 4-1-2-3-4, with edges 4-1 (1), 1-2 (2), 2-3 (3), 3-4 (4).

The lightest edge is 1.

Which is correct.

So, it seems that sorting in descending order and finding the first cycle gives the correct minimal lightest edge.

I think I was mistaken earlier, and this approach works.

Hence, the provided code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find a simple cycle in a given undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimized. 

## Approach

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components. This helps in identifying cycles efficiently.

2. **Sorting Edges**: Sort the edges in descending order of their weights. This allows us to process heavier edges first.

3. **Finding Cycles**: As we iterate through the sorted edges, we unite vertices that are not already connected. If we encounter an edge connecting two vertices that are already in the same component, adding this edge would form a cycle.

4. **Reconstructing the Cycle**: When a cycle is detected, we perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the path between the two vertices connected by the edge that causes the cycle. This path combined with the current edge forms the cycle.

5. **Output the Result**: Output the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the sequence of vertices in the cycle.

## Explanation

- **Union-Find Initialization**: We initialize a Union-Find structure to manage the components.

- **Edge Sorting**: Edges are sorted in descending order of weights.

- **Cycle Detection**: By processing edges from highest to lowest weight, we detect cycles using the Union-Find structure.

- **DFS for Cycle Path**: When a cycle is detected, a DFS is performed to reconstruct the cycle path.

- **Output**: The minimal lightest edge weight and the cycle vertices are printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find a cycle with the minimal lightest edge weight, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
