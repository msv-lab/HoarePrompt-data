Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Kirill wants to pick mushrooms to make an elixir. Each mushroom has a magic power, and he wants to maximize the strength of the elixir. The strength is calculated as the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. So, if he picks k mushrooms, the strength is k times the smallest magic power among those k mushrooms.

But there's a catch: there's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if he picks k mushrooms, the magic power of the mushrooms at positions p1 to p(k-1) becomes zero. He can't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir.

My task is to help Kirill figure out how to pick the mushrooms to maximize the elixir's strength, and among all options that give the maximum strength, choose the one with the smallest number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the permutation p and how it affects the magic powers.

Let's consider that p is a sequence of indices. If Kirill picks k mushrooms, then the mushrooms at positions p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero. So, he can't use those in his elixir.

Wait, but he can choose which mushrooms to pick, right? So, he needs to decide the order in which he picks them, keeping in mind that picking k mushrooms will zero out the magic of the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

But the problem says that he picks mushrooms sequentially, and the magic power of p1 to p(k-1) becomes zero if he picks k mushrooms. I need to clarify this.

Looking back at the problem statement: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p1 to p(k-1) will become 0." So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

So, the idea is that the permutation p determines which mushrooms lose their magic power based on how many mushrooms he picks.

Wait, so if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero, and he can't use those in his elixir.

But he wants to pick k mushrooms such that the strength is maximized, which is k times the minimum magic power among the mushrooms he picks, but he can't use the mushrooms whose magic power has been set to zero.

So, he needs to pick k mushrooms, but avoid using the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p, because their magic power is zero.

Wait, but he has to pick k mushrooms, and as a result of picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero. Then, he prepares the elixir using the mushrooms he picked, excluding those whose magic power is now zero.

But, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, and the permutation p is fixed.

Wait, but the way it's worded is a bit confusing. Let's think differently.

Suppose he picks k mushrooms. As a result, the mushrooms at positions p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero. So, among the mushrooms he picked, if any of them are among p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero and he can't use them in the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, he picks k mushrooms, and as a result, p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero. Then, he prepares the elixir using the mushrooms he picked, excluding those with zero magic power.

Wait, but he can choose which k mushrooms to pick. So, he can choose to pick certain mushrooms and leave others, but the permutation p determines which mushrooms lose their magic power based on how many he picks.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look at an example.

Let's look at the first example in the input:

3

9 8 14

3 2 1

So, n=3, v=[9,8,14], p=[3,2,1]

So, if he picks k=1 mushroom, then the first k-1=0 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero. So, no mushrooms have their magic power set to zero. So, he picks one mushroom, and uses it for the elixir.

If he picks k=1, say mushroom 1 with power 9, then no mushrooms have zeroed magic, so he uses mushroom 1 with power 9, strength is 1*9=9.

If he picks k=2 mushrooms, then the first k-1=1 mushroom in p, which is p1=3, has its magic power set to zero. So, mushroom 3's magic power becomes zero. Then, among the two mushrooms he picked, if mushroom 3 is among them, he can't use it.

So, possible picks:

- mushrooms 1 and 2: powers 9 and 8, but mushroom 3's power is zeroed, but he didn't pick mushroom 3, so he uses both 1 and 2, min power is 8, strength is 2*8=16.

- mushrooms 1 and 3: powers 9 and 0, since mushroom 3's power is zeroed, he can't use it, so he only uses mushroom 1 with power 9, strength is 1*9=9.

- mushrooms 2 and 3: powers 8 and 0, can only use mushroom 2, strength is 1*8=8.

So, the maximum strength is 16, achieved by picking mushrooms 1 and 2.

Similarly, if he picks k=3 mushrooms, then the first k-1=2 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero. p1=3 and p2=2, so mushrooms 3 and 2 have their magic power set to zero.

So, he picks mushrooms 1,2,3, but mushrooms 2 and 3 have zero magic power, so he can only use mushroom 1 with power 9, strength is 1*9=9.

So, the best option is to pick k=2 mushrooms, achieving strength 16.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, generalizing, for each possible k from 1 to n, we need to determine which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero, and then among the mushrooms he picks, exclude those with zero magic power, and calculate the strength as k times the minimum magic power among the non-zero magic power mushrooms he picked.

But, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, knowing which mushrooms will have their magic power set to zero based on p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p1 to p(k-1) are specific mushrooms whose magic power is set to zero when he picks k mushrooms.

So, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

He then prepares the elixir using the mushrooms he picked, excluding those with zero magic power.

So, to maximize the strength, which is the number of mushrooms used times the minimum magic power among them, he needs to pick k mushrooms such that the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) are not included in the mushrooms he uses for the elixir.

Wait, but he can choose which k mushrooms to pick. So, he can choose to pick k mushrooms, knowing that p1 to p(k-1) will have their magic power set to zero, and among the k mushrooms he picked, he can only use those that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, in other words, for each k, when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero, and among the k mushrooms he picked, he can only use those that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, for each k, he needs to pick k mushrooms, and among those k, some may have their magic power set to zero based on p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, representing the indices of the mushrooms.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

When he picks k mushrooms, the magic power of p1 to p(k-1) is set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them in the elixir.

Therefore, for each k, he picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, but p is a permutation of all n mushrooms.

So, for a given k, when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero, regardless of whether those mushrooms are among the k he picked or not.

Wait, no, the problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p1 to p(k-1) will become 0."

So, irrespective of which k mushrooms he picks, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

But he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, knowing that p1 to p(k-1) will have their magic power set to zero.

So, in the elixir, he can only use the mushrooms he picked that are not in p1 to p(k-1), because those have zero magic power.

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero, but he can pick any k mushrooms, and among those k, if any are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them in the elixir.

So, in the elixir, he uses only the mushrooms he picked that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, for a given k, the strength is k times the minimum magic power among the mushrooms he picked that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

But he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to pick k mushrooms such that as few as possible of them are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p is a fixed permutation.

So, for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed, and he chooses which k mushrooms to pick, knowing that the mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) will have their magic power set to zero.

So, to maximize the strength, he needs to pick k mushrooms, as many as possible of which are not in p1 to p(k-1), and among those that are not in p1 to p(k-1), have the highest possible minimum magic power.

Wait, but he wants to maximize k times the minimum magic power among the mushrooms he picked that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, he needs to pick k mushrooms, maximize k, and among those, maximize the minimum magic power of the mushrooms not in p1 to p(k-1).

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe another way to look at it is: for each possible k, determine which mushrooms will have their magic power set to zero (p1 to p(k-1)), and then choose k mushrooms such that as many as possible of them are not in p1 to p(k-1), and among those, have the highest possible minimum magic power.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Let's say I have a sorted list of mushrooms, sorted by v_i in decreasing order.

Then, for each possible k, I can pick the top k mushrooms in terms of magic power, and see how many of them are not in p1 to p(k-1).

Because p1 to p(k-1) will have their magic power set to zero, so if any of the k mushrooms I pick are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero and I can't use them.

So, for each k, I pick the top k mushrooms by magic power, and see how many of them are not in p1 to p(k-1). Let's say m is the number of mushrooms in the top k that are not in p1 to p(k-1). Then, the strength is m times the magic power of the k-th mushroom.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Because among the k mushrooms I picked, some may be in p1 to p(k-1), and those have their magic power set to zero, so I can only use the ones that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, for a given k, if I pick the top k mushrooms by magic power, and s is the number of them that are not in p1 to p(k-1), then the strength is s times the minimum magic power among these s mushrooms.

But since they are the top k by magic power, the minimum among them is the k-th magic power.

Wait, but s could be less than k, depending on how many of the top k are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

So, p is a fixed permutation, and for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed.

So, for each k, I need to pick k mushrooms, and among them, the ones that are in p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, for each k, I need to pick k mushrooms, and maximize the number of them that are not in p1 to p(k-1), and among those, have the highest possible minimum magic power.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to find a way to model this more concretely.

Let me consider that for each mushroom, I know its position in the permutation p.

Let me assign to each mushroom its position in the permutation p.

So, for each mushroom i, its position in p is pos[i] = p.index(i) + 1

Wait, p is the permutation, so p[j] is the index of the j-th mushroom in the permutation.

Wait, no. p is a list of indices from 1 to n, in some order.

So, p[j] is the index of the j-th mushroom in the permutation.

So, for each mushroom i, its position in the permutation is pos[i] = p.index(i) + 1

Because p is a permutation of 1 to n, p is a list of indices from 1 to n in some order.

So, pos[i] tells me at which position in the permutation mushroom i is.

Now, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation have their magic power set to zero.

So, the mushrooms with pos[i] <= k-1 have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, pos[i] is the position of mushroom i in the permutation p.

So, if pos[i] <= k-1, then when Kirill picks k mushrooms, mushroom i's magic power is set to zero.

So, for any k, if pos[i] <= k-1, then mushroom i's magic power is zero.

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, he can only use the mushrooms among the k he picked that have pos[i] > k-1.

Wait, but pos[i] is fixed for each mushroom.

So, for a fixed k, when he picks k mushrooms, he can only use those among the k that have pos[i] > k-1.

So, to maximize the strength, which is the number of mushrooms he can use times the minimum magic power among them, he needs to pick k mushrooms such that as many as possible of them have pos[i] > k-1, and among those, have the highest possible minimum magic power.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that for each mushroom, I know its position in the permutation p, pos[i].

Then, for any k, if pos[i] <= k-1, then when picking k mushrooms, mushroom i's magic power is zero.

So, for each mushroom i, its magic power is zero if pos[i] <= k-1, for the k mushrooms picked.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, and among those, the ones with pos[i] <= k-1 have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, no, the problem says that if he picks k mushrooms, then the mushrooms with indices p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

So, for the k mushrooms he picks, the mushrooms with indices p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p1 to p(k-1) are specific mushrooms.

So, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them in the elixir.

So, in other words, for any k, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero, and he can only use the mushrooms he picked that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, for a given k, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - x, where x is the number of mushrooms in the k he picked that are in p1 to p(k-1).

But x can be from 0 to k-1.

He wants to maximize (k - x) * min_magic_power, where min_magic_power is the smallest magic power among the k - x mushrooms he can use.

He can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to pick k mushrooms that minimize x, meaning as few as possible of them are in p1 to p(k-1).

So, to minimize x, he should pick k mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1), but that may not always be possible.

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed for each k.

Wait, no, p is a fixed permutation, and for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed for each k.

Wait, but p is a fixed permutation, so p1 to p(k-1) are fixed for each k.

So, for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are specific mushrooms.

So, for each k, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them.

Therefore, to maximize the strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as few as possible of them are in p1 to p(k-1), and among the ones that are not in p1 to p(k-1), have the highest possible minimum magic power.

So, for each k, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - y, where y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picked.

He wants to maximize (k - y) * min_magic_power, where min_magic_power is the smallest magic power among the k - y mushrooms he can use.

He can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to pick k mushrooms that minimize y, meaning as few as possible of them are in p1 to p(k-1).

So, to minimize y, he should pick k mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1), but he might have to pick some that are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed for each k.

Wait, but p is a fixed permutation, so p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are specific mushrooms.

So, for each k, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them.

Therefore, to maximize the strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that as few as possible of them are in p1 to p(k-1), and among the ones that are not in p1 to p(k-1), have the highest possible minimum magic power.

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

So, for a given k, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, for each k, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed.

So, for each k, when he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, if any of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their magic power is zero, and he can't use them.

Therefore, to maximize the strength, he should pick k mushrooms such that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1), if possible.

But, depending on k, that may not be possible, especially if k is large.

Wait, but in the first example, n=3, p=[3,2,1]

So, for k=1, p1 to p0 (no mushrooms) have their magic power set to zero. So, none are zeroed. He picks one mushroom, uses it, strength is 1 * v_i.

For k=2, p1=3's magic power is set to zero. So, if he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, only mushroom 1 and 2 are picked, but mushroom 3's magic power is set to zero, but he didn't pick mushroom 3, so he uses mushrooms 1 and 2, both with non-zero magic power, so strength is 2 * min(9,8)=16.

If he picks mushrooms 1 and 3, mushroom 3's magic power is zeroed, so he can only use mushroom 1, strength is 1*9=9.

If he picks mushrooms 2 and 3, mushroom 3's magic power is zeroed, so he can only use mushroom 2, strength is 1*8=8.

For k=3, p1=3 and p2=2 have their magic power set to zero. So, if he picks mushrooms 1,2,3, he can only use mushroom 1, since mushrooms 2 and 3 have their magic power set to zero, so strength is 1*9=9.

So, the maximum strength is 16 with k=2.

Okay, so in this case, picking k=2 gives the maximum strength.

So, generalizing, for each k from 1 to n, we need to consider the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1), which have their magic power set to zero, and then pick k mushrooms, using only those among the k that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, to maximize the strength, which is the number of mushrooms used times the minimum magic power among them, he should pick k mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1), if possible, and among those, have the highest possible minimum magic power.

But, for larger k, it might not be possible to pick k mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1), especially if k-1 is large.

Wait, for a given k, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are fixed for each k.

So, perhaps I can think of it as, for each possible k, the mushrooms that have their magic power set to zero are p1 to p(k-1), and he picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones that are not in p1 to p(k-1) can be used.

So, for each k, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - y, where y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picked.

But, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to pick k mushrooms that minimize y.

What's the maximum possible k - y?

Well, y can be from 0 to min(k, k-1).

Wait, y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picks.

So, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, when he picks k mushrooms, y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picks.

He wants to minimize y, so he should pick k mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1), but if k-1 is larger than n - (k-1), he might have to pick some from p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion.

For each k, when he picks k mushrooms, y mushrooms are from p1 to p(k-1), and k - y mushrooms are from the remaining mushrooms.

He wants to maximize (k - y) * min_magic_power, where min_magic_power is the smallest magic power among the k - y mushrooms he can use.

He can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to minimize y, meaning pick as few as possible of p1 to p(k-1).

So, the minimal y is max(k - (n - (k - 1)), 0), which is max(2k - n - 1, 0).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.

Suppose he wants to pick k mushrooms, and avoid picking as many as possible from p1 to p(k-1).

The maximum number of mushrooms he can pick from p1 to p(k-1) is y = min(k, k-1).

But he wants to minimize y, so y = min(k, k-1).

Wait, no, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, so he can choose to pick as few as possible from p1 to p(k-1).

The minimal y is max(k + (n - (k - 1)) - n, 0) = max(k - (k - 1), 0) = max(2k - n - 1, 0).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of mushrooms not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, the number of mushrooms not in p1 to p(k-1) is n - (k - 1).

So, he can pick up to min(k, n - (k - 1)) mushrooms that are not in p1 to p(k-1).

So, the maximum number of mushrooms he can use is min(k, n - (k - 1)).

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, and among them, the ones not in p1 to p(k-1) are the ones he can use.

So, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - y, where y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picks.

To maximize k - y, he should minimize y, which means picking as few as possible from p1 to p(k-1).

The minimal y is max(k - (n - (k - 1)), 0).

So, minimal y is max(k - (n - (k - 1)), 0) = max(2k - n - 1, 0).

Therefore, the maximum number of mushrooms he can use is k - max(2k - n - 1, 0).

Wait, but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, the number of mushrooms not in p1 to p(k-1) is n - (k - 1).

So, the maximum number of mushrooms he can pick that are not in p1 to p(k-1) is min(k, n - (k - 1)).

Therefore, the maximum number of mushrooms he can use is min(k, n - (k - 1)).

So, for each k, the maximum number of mushrooms he can use is min(k, n - k + 1).

And among those, he wants to maximize min_magic_power.

So, for each k, he can use up to min(k, n - k + 1) mushrooms with the highest magic powers.

Wait, but he has to pick k mushrooms, and among them, the ones not in p1 to p(k-1) are the ones he can use.

So, perhaps it's better to iterate over the possible number of mushrooms he can use, say m, and find the maximum m * min_magic_power, where min_magic_power is the smallest magic power among the m mushrooms.

But how do I relate m to k?

Wait, for each m, I need to find the minimal k such that k - y >= m, where y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that he picks.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Let's say I have a sorted list of mushrooms, sorted by v_i in decreasing order.

Let's denote this sorted list as v_sorted.

Then, for each possible m, from 1 to n, I can consider using the top m mushrooms in terms of magic power.

Now, for these top m mushrooms, I need to determine the minimal k such that when picking k mushrooms, I can include all these top m mushrooms, and have their magic power not set to zero.

Wait, but some of these top m mushrooms might be in p1 to p(k-1), which would set their magic power to zero.

So, I need to ensure that none of the top m mushrooms are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, for the top m mushrooms, I need to find the smallest k such that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, if I pick k mushrooms that include the top m mushrooms, and none of the top m mushrooms are in p1 to p(k-1), then their magic power is not set to zero.

So, I need to find the smallest k such that the top m mushrooms are not in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p is a permutation, so the positions of the mushrooms are fixed.

So, for each mushroom, I know its position in p.

So, for each mushroom, I know at which position in p it is.

So, for each mushroom, pos[i] = p.index(i) + 1

Then, for a given m, I need to select m mushrooms with the highest magic power, and find the minimal k such that none of these m mushrooms are in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, if I have m mushrooms that I want to use, and I need to ensure that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1), then k-1 must be less than the position of all these m mushrooms in p.

Wait, no.

Actually, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, if I have m mushrooms that I want to use, and I need to ensure that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1), then k-1 must be less than the position of all these m mushrooms in p.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, for the m mushrooms I want to use, their positions in p should all be greater than k-1.

So, the minimal k such that k-1 is less than the positions of all m mushrooms in p.

So, for the m mushrooms, find the minimal position among their positions in p, say min_pos.

Then, k-1 must be less than min_pos, so k <= min_pos.

So, the minimal k is m, but I need to maximize m * v_m, where v_m is the smallest among the top m mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over m from 1 to n, and for each m, find the minimal k such that k >= m and k-1 < min_pos among the top m mushrooms.

Wait, more carefully:

For each m, find the minimal k such that k >= m and k-1 < min(pos[j] for j in top m mushrooms).

So, k-1 < min(pos[j]), which means k <= min(pos[j]).

But k >= m, so k must be at least m.

So, the minimal k is max(m, min(pos[j]) + 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, k must satisfy k >= m and k-1 < min(pos[j]), which is k <= min(pos[j]).

But k must also be at least m.

So, the minimal k is max(m, min(pos[j]) + 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, k must satisfy k >= m and k-1 < min(pos[j]).

So, k >= m and k <= min(pos[j]) + 1 - 1, which is k <= min(pos[j]).

Wait, k-1 < min(pos[j]), so k <= min(pos[j]).

So, k must be in [m, min(pos[j])].

But m can be larger than min(pos[j]).

If m > min(pos[j]), then there is no such k, because k must be >= m and <= min(pos[j]), but m > min(pos[j]), so no solution.

So, in that case, it's impossible to use m mushrooms.

Otherwise, k can be from m to min(pos[j]).

So, for each m, the minimal k is max(m, min(pos[j]) + 1).

Wait, no, k must be >= m and <= min(pos[j]).

Wait, but k must be >= m and <= min(pos[j]) + 1.

Wait, k-1 < min(pos[j]), which is k <= min(pos[j]).

So, k must be in [m, min(pos[j])].

So, the minimal k is max(m, min(pos[j]) + 1).

Wait, but if m <= min(pos[j]), then k can be m.

Otherwise, no solution.

Wait, no, if m <= min(pos[j]), then k can be from m to min(pos[j]).

So, the minimal k is m.

Otherwise, if m > min(pos[j]), then no solution.

Wait, but in the first example, n=3, p=[3,2,1], v=[9,8,14]

So, pos[1]=2, pos[2]=3, pos[3]=1

So, for m=1, top m mushroom is mushroom 3 with v=14, pos=1.

So, min(pos[j])=1.

Then, k must be >=1 and <=1.

So, k=1.

So, pick k=1, but in reality, in the first example, the best is k=2 with strength 16.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, for m=1, k=1 is possible, but m=2, top m mushrooms are mushrooms 3 and 1 with v=14 and 9, pos=1 and 2.

So, min(pos[j])=1.

So, k must be >=2 and <=1, which is impossible.

But in reality, for k=2, he can pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and use mushrooms 1 and 2 with v=9 and 8, strength=16.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for m=2, min(pos[j])=1, and k must be >=2 and <=1, which is impossible.

But in reality, it's possible to pick k=2 and use both mushrooms 1 and 2.

Wait, but mushroom 3 is in p1, which is p1=3, and when k=2, p1=3 has its magic power set to zero.

But mushroom 3 is not among the k=2 mushrooms picked (if he picks mushrooms 1 and 2), so its magic power is set to zero, but he didn't pick it, so it doesn't affect him.

Wait, but in my earlier logic, for m=2, min(pos[j])=1, and k must be >=2 and <=1, which is impossible.

But in reality, it's possible to pick k=2 and use both mushrooms 1 and 2.

So, perhaps my earlier logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when picking k mushrooms, the mushrooms p1 to p(k-1) have their magic power set to zero, but only if they are among the k mushrooms picked.

So, if I pick k mushrooms that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1), then all of them can be used.

So, for m=k.

But in the first example, for k=2, p1=3, which is among the n mushrooms.

If he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, p1=3 is not among them, so none of the picked mushrooms have their magic power set to zero, so he can use both mushrooms 1 and 2.

So, in this case, m=k=2.

So, perhaps for each k, m can be k, if none of the p1 to p(k-1) are among the k mushrooms picked.

So, the maximal m is k - y, where y is the number of mushrooms in p1 to p(k-1) that are picked.

To maximize m, he should pick k mushrooms that have as few as possible from p1 to p(k-1).

The minimal y is max(k - (n - (k - 1)), 0).

So, m = k - y = k - max(k - (n - (k - 1)), 0) = k - max(2k - n - 1, 0)

So, m = min(k, n - k + 1)

So, for each k, the maximal m is min(k, n - k + 1)

So, the strength is m * min_magic_power, where min_magic_power is the smallest magic power among the m mushrooms.

So, for each k from 1 to n, m = min(k, n - k + 1), and we need to choose the top m mushrooms in terms of magic power, and set min_magic_power as v_sorted[m]

Wait, but need to choose m mushrooms among the ones not in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over m from 1 to n, and for each m, find the minimal k such that k >= m and k - y >= m, where y is the number of p1 to p(k-1) that are among the k mushrooms picked.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Let's say I have v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)

Then, for each possible m from 1 to n, I can consider using the top m mushrooms.

Now, for each m, I need to find the minimal k such that I can pick k mushrooms including the top m mushrooms, and among them, at least m are not in p1 to p(k-1).

Wait, but p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, their positions in p are from 1 to k-1.

So, for the top m mushrooms, their positions in p are pos[ top m mushrooms ].

To ensure that none of them are in p1 to p(k-1), their positions must be >=k.

Wait, no, p1 to p(k-1) are positions 1 to k-1 in p.

Wait, p is a permutation, p1 to p(k-1) are the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

So, their positions in p are from 1 to k-1.

So, for the top m mushrooms, their positions in p should be > k-1.

So, pos[j] > k-1 for all j in the top m mushrooms.

So, k-1 < min(pos[j]) for all j in top m mushrooms.

So, k <= min(pos[j])

But k >= m.

So, k must be in [m, min(pos[j])]

So, the minimal k is m, but only if m <= min(pos[j])

Otherwise, no solution.

So, for each m, if m <= min(pos[j]), then k = m.

Otherwise, no
