Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand what's going on here.

So, the game is set up with n piles of stones, and both players take turns. On each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile, and then removes k stones from each non-empty pile. The first player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

Alice goes first, and we need to determine who wins if both play optimally. Optimal play means that both players make the best possible moves to ensure they win if it's possible.

First, I need to understand how the game progresses. Unlike typical Nim games where stones are removed from a single pile per turn, here, stones are removed from all non-empty piles by a certain amount k.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

7

5

3 3 3 3 3

2

1 7

7

1 3 9 7 4 2 100

3

1 2 3

6

2 1 3 4 2 4

8

5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2

1

1000000000

Output:

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

From the first test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

Alice can choose k=3, which removes 3 stones from each pile, emptying all piles. So, Alice wins immediately.

In the second test case:

2

1 7

Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has 1 stone), which removes 1 stone from both piles, resulting in piles of 0 and 6. Now, Bob can choose k=6, removing 6 stones from the pile of 6, making it empty. So, all piles are empty, and Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

From these examples, it seems that the game is about reducing the piles in同步 steps, and the player who can make the last move wins.

I need to find a general strategy to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player is moving.

In standard Nim, the winning strategy is based on the XOR of pile sizes. However, in this game, the moves affect all piles simultaneously, which is different from Nim, where stones are removed from a single pile per turn.

Given that, I need to find a different way to analyze this game.

Let's consider the mex (minimum excludant) concept, which is used in the Sprague-Grundy theorem for impartial games. The Grundy number for a game position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

But first, I need to see if this game can be decomposed into simpler subgames.

In this game, since moves affect all piles at once, it's not immediately clear how to decompose it into independent subgames like in standard Nim.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to sort the piles or consider their differences.

Wait a minute, in the second test case, Alice is forced to choose k=1 because there's a pile of size 1. In general, the choice of k is constrained by the smallest pile.

Let me think differently. Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order.

For example, in the second test case: [1,7] -> sorted: [1,7]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from both piles: [0,6]

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the remaining pile: [0,0]

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

In the first test case: [3,3,3,3,3] -> sorted: [3,3,3,3,3]

Alice chooses k=3, removes 3 from all piles: [0,0,0,0,0]

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

In the third test case: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100] -> sorted: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Alice must choose k=1 (smallest pile is 1), removes 1 from all piles: [0,1,2,3,6,8,99]

Now, Bob faces piles: [1,2,3,6,8,99]

He can choose k up to 1 (the smallest non-empty pile). So, he chooses k=1, removes 1 from each: [0,1,2,5,7,98]

Alice now faces: [1,2,5,7,98]

She can choose k up to 1, so chooses k=1: [0,1,4,6,97]

Bob faces: [1,4,6,97]

Chooses k=1: [0,3,5,96]

Alice faces: [3,5,96]

Chooses k=3: [0,2,93]

Bob faces: [2,93]

Chooses k=2: [0,91]

Alice faces: [91]

Chooses k=91: [0]

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Alice wins this case, which matches.

But this seems tedious. I need a better way to determine the winner without simulating the game.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical property that can help.

In the first test case, all piles are equal, and Alice can choose k equal to that value to win immediately.

In the second test case, there's a pile of size 1, which forces Alice to choose k=1, leading to a position where Bob can win.

In the third test case, even with varied pile sizes including a small one, Alice still wins.

Perhaps, the key is whether there's at least one pile of size 1.

Wait, in the second test case, there is a pile of size 1, and Bob wins.

In the first test case, no pile of size 1, Alice wins.

In the third test case, there is a pile of size 1, and Alice still wins.

Hmm, so having a pile of size 1 doesn't solely determine the winner.

Wait, in the sixth test case:

8

5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2

According to the sample output, Alice wins.

Here, the smallest pile is 2, so Alice can choose k=1 or k=2.

If she chooses k=2, removes 2 from all piles:

[3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0]

Now, Bob faces piles: [1,1,3,4,5,7]

He can choose k=1: removes 1 from each non-empty pile:

[0,0,2,3,4,6]

Alice faces: [2,3,4,6]

Chooses k=2: removes 2 from each: [0,1,2,4]

Bob faces: [1,2,4]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,1,3]

Alice faces: [1,3]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,2]

Bob chooses k=2: removes 2 from the remaining pile: [0,0]

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

But according to the sample output, Alice wins this case. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Starting with [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2]

Alice chooses k=2: removes 2 from each: [3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0]

Bob faces [1,1,3,4,5,7]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,0,2,3,4,6]

Alice faces [2,3,4,6]

Chooses k=2: removes 2 from each: [0,1,2,4]

Bob faces [1,2,4]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,1,3]

Alice faces [1,3]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,2]

Bob chooses k=2: removes 2 from the remaining pile: [0,0]

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

But the sample output says Alice wins, which contradicts my simulation. Maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different strategy that Alice can use to win.

Wait, maybe choosing a different k in the first move would lead to a winning position for Alice.

Let's try again.

Starting with [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2]

Alice can choose k=1 or k=2.

If she chooses k=1:

Removes 1 from each: [4,6,1,8,5,2,2,1]

Now, Bob faces [1,1,2,2,4,5,6,8]

He can choose k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,0,1,1,3,4,5,7]

Alice faces [1,1,3,4,5,7]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,0,2,3,4,6]

Bob faces [2,3,4,6]

Chooses k=2: removes 2 from each: [0,1,2,4]

Alice faces [1,2,4]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,1,3]

Bob faces [1,3]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,2]

Alice chooses k=2: removes 2 from the remaining pile: [0,0]

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Ah, so depending on the choice of k in the first move, Alice can force a win.

So, in this case, choosing k=1 leads to Alice's win, while choosing k=2 leads to Bob's win.

Therefore, Alice needs to choose the right k to win.

This suggests that the strategy is not trivial and requires careful analysis.

I need a better approach to determine the winner without simulating the entire game.

Let me consider the properties of the game.

Key observations:

1. On each move, k must be at least 1 and at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.

2. Removing k stones from all non-empty piles effectively reduces each pile by k stones.

3. The game ends when all piles are empty.

4. The player who makes the last move wins.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, but with a twist because moves affect all piles simultaneously.

Perhaps, I can model this game as a Nim game with certain transformations.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to reduce this game to a known impartial game.

Let me think about the binary representations or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the number of times each pile can be reduced before it becomes zero.

For example, if all piles are equal, the first player can choose k equal to the pile size and win immediately.

If there are piles of different sizes, the game becomes more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the piles in ascending order and consider the differences between them.

Let me try that.

Take the third test case: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

Sort: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Differences between consecutive piles: [1,1,1,3,2,91]

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the mex of the pile sizes.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of moves.

Each move reduces all non-empty piles by k stones, where k is at least 1 and at most the smallest pile.

The game continues until all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the concept of the mex in impartial games, but I need to find a way to compute the Grundy number for this game.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern based on the number of piles and the pile sizes.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Test case 1:

5

3 3 3 3 3

Alice wins by choosing k=3.

Test case 2:

2

1 7

Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=6, Bob wins.

Test case 3:

7

1 3 9 7 4 2 100

Alice wins.

Test case 4:

3

1 2 3

Alice wins.

Test case 5:

6

2 1 3 4 2 4

Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=1, Alice chooses k=2, Bob chooses k=2, Alice chooses k=2, Bob chooses k=4, Alice chooses k=4, Bob wins.

Wait, according to the sample output, Bob wins this case.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, in test case 6, Alice wins, but in test case 5, Bob wins.

Wait, test case 5:

6

2 1 3 4 2 4

So, sorted: [1,2,2,3,4,4]

Alice must choose k=1: removes 1 from each pile: [0,1,1,2,3,3]

Bob faces [1,1,2,3,3]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,0,1,2,2]

Alice faces [1,2,2]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,1,1]

Bob faces [1,1]

Chooses k=1: removes 1 from each: [0,0]

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

This matches the sample output where Bob wins this case.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

Wait, but in test case 6:

8

5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2

As I simulated earlier, if Alice chooses k=1, she can force a win.

So, perhaps in some cases, choosing k=1 is beneficial, while in others, choosing a higher k is better.

This seems complicated.

Is there a general pattern or formula to determine the winner?

Let me consider the minimal pile size.

If the smallest pile is 1, then Alice must choose k=1, and see what happens.

In some cases, this leads to a losing position for Alice, in others, it doesn't.

Wait, in test case 2, where the piles are [1,7], Alice chooses k=1, and Bob wins.

In test case 3, [1,3,9,7,4,2,100], Alice chooses k=1, and apparently wins.

So, having a pile of size 1 doesn't solely determine the winner.

Perhaps, I need to look at the number of piles that are greater than 1.

Wait, in test case 2, there are 2 piles, one with 1.

In test case 3, there are 7 piles, one with 1.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of piles.

But in test case 1, 5 piles, all greater than 1, Alice wins.

Test case 4: 3 piles, one with 1, Alice wins.

Test case 5: 6 piles, one with 1, Bob wins.

Test case 6: 8 piles, at least one with 1, Alice wins.

Test case 7: 1 pile, greater than 1, Alice wins.

So, having at least one pile of 1 doesn't consistently determine the winner.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of piles.

In test case 1: 5 piles, Alice wins.

Test case 2: 2 piles, Bob wins.

Test case 3: 7 piles, Alice wins.

Test case 4: 3 piles, Alice wins.

Test case 5: 6 piles, Bob wins.

Test case 6: 8 piles, Alice wins.

Test case 7: 1 pile, Alice wins.

So, for an odd number of piles, Alice wins (test cases 1,3,4,6,7).

For even number of piles, Bob wins (test cases 2,5).

Wait, but test case 6 has 8 piles, and Alice wins.

Wait, test case 5 has 6 piles, Bob wins.

So, parity doesn't seem to be the determining factor.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the maximum pile size.

But in test case 1, max is 3, Alice wins.

Test case 2, max is 7, Bob wins.

Test case 3, max is 100, Alice wins.

Test case 4, max is 3, Alice wins.

Test case 5, max is 4, Bob wins.

Test case 6, max is 9, Alice wins.

Test case 7, max is 1000000000, Alice wins.

No clear pattern there.

Perhaps, I need to consider the game in terms of the number of moves required to empty all piles.

Each move reduces all non-empty piles by k stones, where k is at least 1 and at most the smallest non-empty pile.

The number of moves needed to empty all piles is equal to the number of times we can subtract k from all piles until all are zero.

This seems related to the number of non-empty piles at each step.

Wait, perhaps it's about the mex of the pile sizes divided by the number of moves.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

On each move, the player chooses k (1 <= k <= a1), removes k from each non-empty pile.

This is equivalent to replacing each ai with ai - k, and removing any piles that become zero.

This continues until all piles are empty.

I need to find out who has the last move.

This seems similar to a variant of Nim game where stones are removed from all piles simultaneously by a certain amount.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this game as a subtraction game on the smallest pile.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider the minimal excludant (mex) concept again.

In standard Nim, the XOR of pile sizes determines the winner.

But in this game, moves affect all piles at once, so it's different.

Perhaps, the XOR of the pile sizes could be relevant here.

Wait, in standard Nim, the XOR is zero if and only if the position is losing for the player about to move.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, the XOR might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this game as equivalent to a standard Nim game with certain transformations.

Let me try to find a way to map this game to standard Nim.

Suppose I have piles a1, a2, ..., an.

Each move consists of choosing k <= min(ai), and subtracting k from each ai.

This is similar to "invertible" moves in some games, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of times I can subtract 1 from all piles, then 2, and so on.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of stones each pile contributes to the game.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a mathematical pattern.

Suppose I have all piles equal to some value m.

Then, the first player can choose k = m, remove m from each pile, and win immediately.

So, in this case, Alice wins.

Now, if there are piles of different sizes, the game is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the piles and consider the differences between them.

Let me try that.

Take test case 3: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

Sort: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Differences: [1,1,1,3,2,91]

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the number of piles that are greater than a certain value.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal pile.

If the minimal pile is 1, then Alice must choose k=1, and see what happens.

In some cases, this leads to a winning position, in others, to a losing position.

Wait, maybe I can think recursively.

Define the game state based on the current pile sizes, and determine if it's a winning or losing position.

But with n up to 2e5 per test case, this is not feasible computationally.

I need a smarter way to determine the winner.

Let me consider the game in terms of " Nimbers" or "Sprague-Grundy numbers."

Each game position can be assigned a Grundy number, which is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

If the overall Grundy number is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move; otherwise, it's winning.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, it's not immediately clear how to compute the Grundy number.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to decompose this game into simpler subgames.

Wait, maybe I can think of this game as equivalent to a single Nim pile.

But how?

Let me consider the minimal pile size.

If the minimal pile size is m, then k can be from 1 to m.

Choosing k equals m is similar to removing m stones from a single pile in standard Nim.

But since it affects all piles, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this game as equivalent to a single Nim pile with a certain size.

If that's the case, then the winner can be determined based on whether this size is zero or not.

But I need to find what that equivalent Nim pile size is.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be transformed into a standard Nim game with certain pile sizes.

Let me try to find such a transformation.

Suppose I have piles a1, a2, ..., an.

After sorting them in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Then, choosing k equals a1 removes a1 from all piles, leaving piles a2 - a1, a3 - a1, ..., an - a1, excluding any zero piles.

This looks similar to the game of Nim, but with a different subtraction.

Wait, perhaps this is a variant of Nim with a subtraction set.

But standard Nim theory might not directly apply here.

Let me try to find a pattern based on the sample inputs.

Test case 1: [3,3,3,3,3] -> Alice wins by choosing k=3.

Test case 2: [1,7] -> Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=6, Bob wins.

Test case 3: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100] -> Alice wins.

Test case 4: [1,2,3] -> Alice wins.

Test case 5: [2,1,3,4,2,4] -> Bob wins.

Test case 6: [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2] -> Alice wins.

Test case 7: [1000000000] -> Alice wins.

Looking at these, it seems that if there is at least one pile of size 1, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Wait, but in test case 3 and 4, there are piles of size 1, and Alice wins.

In test case 2, there is a pile of size 1, and Bob wins.

In test case 6, there are piles of size 2, and Alice wins.

This doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite: if there is at least one pile of size 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

But in test case 2, there is a pile of size 1, and Bob wins.

This contradicts.

Wait, maybe if the minimal pile is 1, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But in test case 1, minimal pile is 3, Alice wins.

Test case 2, minimal pile is 1, Bob wins.

Test case 3, minimal pile is 1, Alice wins.

This doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of piles with size 1.

But in test case 3, there is one pile of size 1, and Alice wins.

In test case 6, there are two piles of size 2, and Alice wins.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Then, the first move is to choose k = a1, which removes a1 from all piles, leaving piles a2 - a1, a3 - a1, ..., an - a1 (excluding zeros).

This looks similar to the original game but with reduced pile sizes.

This seems like a recursive step.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game as having a "height" equal to the minimal pile, and then moving to a position with smaller heights.

But I need a way to compute the Grundy number or determine the winner based on this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the game as equivalent to a single Nim pile with size equal to the number of piles.

Wait, in test case 1, n=5, Alice wins.

Test case 2, n=2, Bob wins.

Test case 3, n=7, Alice wins.

Test case 4, n=3, Alice wins.

Test case 5, n=6, Bob wins.

Test case 6, n=8, Alice wins.

Test case 7, n=1, Alice wins.

So, for n even, Bob wins; for n odd, Alice wins.

Wait, but test case 5 has n=6 (even), Bob wins.

Test case 6 has n=8 (even), Alice wins.

This contradicts.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of piles greater than 1.

In test case 2: [1,7] -> one pile >1, which is odd, Bob wins.

Test case 3: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100] -> six piles >1, even, Alice wins.

Test case 4: [1,2,3] -> two piles >1, even, Alice wins.

Test case 5: [2,1,3,4,2,4] -> five piles >1, odd, Bob wins.

Test case 6: [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2] -> seven piles >1, odd, Alice wins.

Wait, in test case 6, seven piles >1, which is odd, but Alice wins.

This contradicts the earlier pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of piles that are divisible by certain numbers.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal pile again.

If the minimal pile is 1, then Alice must choose k=1, which reduces all piles by 1.

This effectively removes any pile that was of size 1, and decreases the rest by 1.

Then, the next player faces a new set of piles, with the minimal pile being at least 1 less than before.

This seems like the game progresses by reducing the pile sizes step by step.

But determining the winner based on this seems too involved.

Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or property that can determine the winner directly.

Let me consider the mex concept again.

In standard Nim, the XOR of pile sizes determines the winner.

Maybe in this game, there's a similar operation that can be applied to the pile sizes to determine the winner.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the binary representations or some other properties.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times each pile can be reduced before becoming zero.

For example, a pile of size m can be reduced m times.

But since each reduction affects all piles, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the game as equivalent to a Nim pile with size equal to the minimal pile.

In test case 1, minimal pile is 3, Alice chooses k=3, wins.

In test case 2, minimal pile is 1, Alice chooses k=1, leads to Bob winning.

In test case 3, minimal pile is 1, Alice chooses k=1, leads to Alice winning.

This doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of piles that are multiples of certain numbers.

This seems too speculative.

Let me try to think about the game in terms of its binary operations.

Wait, perhaps considering the binary XOR of the pile sizes could be relevant.

In standard Nim, XOR of pile sizes determines the winner.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, perhaps XOR has some role.

Let me compute the XOR of the pile sizes for each test case.

Test case 1: 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 3 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 3 = 3 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 3 = 3

Alice wins.

Test case 2: 1 XOR 7 = 6

Bob wins.

Test case 3: 1 XOR 3 XOR 9 XOR 7 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 100 = Let's compute step by step:

1 XOR 3 = 2

2 XOR 9 = 11

11 XOR 7 = 12

12 XOR 4 = 8

8 XOR 2 = 10

10 XOR 100 = 110

Alice wins.

Test case 4: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

Alice wins.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 = 3, 3 XOR 3 = 0

Bob should win, but according to the sample output, Alice wins.

Wait, no, test case 4: [1,2,3], Alice wins.

But 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which would suggest Bob wins in standard Nim.

But in this game, Alice wins.

So, XOR doesn't directly apply here.

Perhaps, I need to consider something else.

Let me consider the number of piles that are not divisible by certain numbers.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of piles that are powers of two.

But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of piles that are odd.

In test case 1: [3,3,3,3,3], all odd, Alice wins.

Test case 2: [1,7], both odd, Bob wins.

Test case 3: [1,3,9,7,4,2,100], four odd, three even, Alice wins.

Test case 4: [1,2,3], two odd, one even, Alice wins.

Test case 5: [2,1,3,4,2,4], four even, two odd, Bob wins.

Test case 6: [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2], four odd, four even, Alice wins.

Test case 7: [1000000000], even, Alice wins.

No clear pattern here.

I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the problem.

Given the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 per test case, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5, an efficient solution is needed.

This suggests that there's a O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Given that, it's unlikely that a simulation-based approach is feasible.

Therefore, there must be a direct way to determine the winner based on the pile sizes.

Perhaps, the solution lies in determining if the minimal pile size is 1.

Wait, in the provided program, it checks if 1 is in the list of piles.

If 1 is in the list, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, "Alice".

But, as we saw in the sample inputs, in test case 3, there is a pile of size 1, and Alice wins.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
