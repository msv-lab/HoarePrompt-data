Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a "beautiful" array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if, through a series of specific operations, I can make all its elements the same. The operation allowed is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and then replace a[i] with a[i-1]. Essentially, it's making a[i] the same as its neighbors if they match.

So, the array is beautiful if, by applying this operation any number of times, I can make all elements equal. My task is to remove the fewest elements possible to make it so that no matter how I apply these operations, I can't make all elements equal.

Looking at the examples:

1. For n=3 and array [2,2,2], it's already all equal, and no matter how I remove elements, it remains beautiful. So, output is -1.

2. For n=5 and array [1,2,1,2,1], removing one element can make it not beautiful.

3. For n=1, it's just one element, which is already beautiful, and I can't make it not beautiful by removing elements. So, output is -1.

4. For n=7 and array [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing the first three elements leaves [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

From these examples, it seems that if the array consists of all the same elements, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, hence output -1. Otherwise, there might be a way to remove some elements to disrupt the beauty.

But, I need a general approach. Let's think about what makes an array beautiful. The operation allows me to fix elements that are different from their neighbors, provided their neighbors are equal. So, if there are sections of the array where elements are different but their neighbors are the same, I can fix them to make all equal.

Wait, actually, the operation is to choose an index i where a[i-1] == a[i+1], and set a[i] to a[i-1]. So, if a[i] is different from its neighbors, and its neighbors are equal, I can make a[i] equal to them. But if a[i] is already equal to its neighbors, then setting it to a[i-1] doesn't change anything.

So, the key is that, through these operations, I can propagate the values of the ends towards the center, making sequences where the ends are equal and the middle elements can be adjusted to match.

Given that the array is beautiful, meaning I can make all elements equal through these operations, I need to remove elements in such a way that this is no longer possible.

One way to think about it is to look for the smallest subset of elements whose removal disrupts the ability to make all elements equal.

But that sounds a bit vague. Maybe I can look for patterns or specific structures in the array that allow it to be beautiful, and then find a way to break those structures with minimal removals.

Let me consider that the array is divided into segments where each segment has the same value, and between these segments are points where the value changes.

For example, in the second test case: [1,2,1,2,1]

Segments:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1]

- 4: [2]

- 5: [1]

Wait, but actually, segments are continuous runs of the same value. So, in this array, it's alternating 1 and 2, so each element is a separate segment.

In the first test case: [2,2,2], there's only one segment.

In the third test case: [1], only one segment.

In the fourth test case: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], there are two segments: [3,3,3] and [5], and then [3,3,3].

Wait, no, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]: segments are [3,3,3], [5], [3,3,3].

So, perhaps the number of segments is important.

Let me think about how the operations can be applied across these segments.

If I have segments of the same value, I can apply the operation within those segments to make elements equal to their neighbors.

But between segments of different values, I can't directly apply the operation to make them equal, unless I can propagate values from one segment to another.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the run lengths of consecutive equal values.

Let me consider that the array is divided into runs of consecutive equal values.

For example:

- [2,2,2]: one run of length 3.

- [1,2,1,2,1]: five runs, each of length 1.

- [1]: one run of length 1.

- [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]: three runs, lengths 3,1,3.

Now, in the first case, since there's only one run, it's already all equal, and removing any element still keeps it all equal.

In the second case, there are five runs, each of length 1. Removing one element could potentially merge two runs if they become neighbors and equal.

Wait, but in this case, all runs are of length 1, and values alternate. So, removing one element might break the pattern.

Wait, but according to the sample output, removing one element makes it not beautiful.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the key is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array cannot be made into a single value through the operations.

Another way to think about it is: after removals, is it possible to make all elements equal using the given operations?

If I can make all elements equal, it's still beautiful; otherwise, it's not.

So, I need to prevent the array from being made uniform.

Looking back at the first test case: [2,2,2]. No matter how I remove elements, it remains uniform. So, output is -1.

In the second test case: [1,2,1,2,1]. If I remove one element, for example, remove the last element, I get [1,2,1,2]. Now, can I make all elements equal?

Looking at the array [1,2,1,2]:

- I can choose i=2 (a[1]=1, a[3]=1), so set a[2]=1, resulting in [1,1,1,2].

- Then, choose i=4 (a[3]=1, a[5]=nothing, since length is 4), but wait, i can only be from 2 to n-1, so i=2 and i=3.

After first operation, [1,1,1,2]:

- Choose i=3 (a[2]=1, a[4]=2), but a[2] != a[4], so can't operate.

So, it's stuck at [1,1,1,2], which is not all equal. Hence, it's not beautiful.

Therefore, removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the third test case: [1]. It's already uniform; removing the only element isn't allowed, I guess, since n=1 is the minimum. So, output -1.

In the fourth test case: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]. If I remove the first three elements, I get [5,3,3,3]. Now, can I make all elements equal?

Looking at [5,3,3,3]:

- All operations require a[i-1] == a[i+1].

- Here, a[1]=5, a[2]=3, a[3]=3, a[4]=3.

- For i=2: a[1]=5 != a[3]=3, so can't operate.

- For i=3: a[2]=3 == a[4]=3, so set a[3]=3 (no change).

- So, the array remains [5,3,3,3]. It's not possible to make all elements equal.

Hence, removing three elements makes it not beautiful.

So, in this case, the minimum number of elements to remove is 3.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 3, which matches.

Now, I need a general approach to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

Let me consider that the array is divided into runs of consecutive equal values.

If there is only one run, meaning all elements are equal, then it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so output -1.

If there are multiple runs, then I need to remove elements in such a way that I disrupt the ability to make all elements equal.

I need to find the smallest number of elements to remove so that after removal, the remaining array cannot be made uniform through the operations.

Perhaps, the key is to remove elements that connect different runs, or to break the sequences in a way that prevents uniformity.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of runs.

If there are multiple runs with different values, removing elements to separate the runs might help.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

3

2 2 2

-1 (impossible to make not beautiful)

Sample Input 2:

5

1 2 1 2 1

1 (remove one element to make it not beautiful)

Sample Input 3:

1

1

-1 (only one element)

Sample Input 4:

7

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

3 (remove three elements to make it not beautiful)

Looking at Sample Input 2: [1,2,1,2,1]

If I remove one element, say the last one, I get [1,2,1,2]. As shown earlier, this is not beautiful.

Similarly, in Sample Input 4: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

Removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Wait, but is there a better way? Maybe removing fewer elements.

Wait, in Sample Input 4, is it possible to remove fewer than 3 elements to make it not beautiful?

Let's see: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

If I remove one element, say the 4th element (5), I get [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

If I remove two elements, say the first and the fourth: [3,3,3,3,3], still beautiful.

If I remove three elements, say the first three: [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

So, indeed, 3 is the minimum.

Is there another way to remove three elements to achieve the same?

For example, removing the first, second, and fourth: [3,3,3], which is beautiful. Wait, no.

Wait, removing the first, third, and fifth: [3,3,3], again beautiful.

Wait, actually, removing any three elements that include the '5' and at least two '3's seems to work.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says removing the first three elements: [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Wait, but [5,3,3,3]: can I make all elements 5 or all elements 3?

If I try to make all elements 5:

- Start with [5,3,3,3]

- Choose i=2: a[1]=5 != a[3]=3, can't operate.

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3 == a[4]=3, set a[3]=3 (no change).

So, it's stuck as [5,3,3,3], which is not uniform.

If I try to make all elements 3:

- Choose i=1: not possible since i must be 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

- Choose i=2: a[1]=5 != a[3]=3, can't operate.

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3 == a[4]=3, set a[3]=3 (no change).

Again, can't make all elements 3.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

So, removing three elements is necessary.

Is there a pattern here?

Looking back, in Sample Input 2: [1,2,1,2,1]

Removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In Sample Input 4: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

Removing three elements makes it not beautiful.

What's the commonality?

Perhaps, the minimum number of elements to remove is related to the number of times the most frequent run appears.

Wait, in Sample Input 2, runs are [1],[2],[1],[2],[1]. The most frequent run is [1], appearing three times.

In Sample Input 4, runs are [3,3,3],[5],[3,3,3]. The most frequent run is [3], appearing two times with lengths 3 and 3.

Wait, but in Sample Input 2, the minimum is 1, and in Sample Input 4, it's 3.

Not sure if that directly correlates.

Wait, maybe it's the length of the shortest run.

In Sample Input 2, the shortest run is 1 (all runs are length 1), and the minimum removal is 1.

In Sample Input 4, the shortest run is 1 (the [5]), but removing one element doesn't make it not beautiful.

Wait, no, in Sample Input 4, removing one element, say the '5', results in [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

Removing two elements, say two '3's, might still leave [3,3,5,3,3,3], which is still beautiful if you can make all '3's.

Wait, no, in that case, [3,3,5,3,3,3]:

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3 == a[4]=5? No, can't operate.

- Choose i=4: a[3]=5 != a[5]=3, can't operate.

- So, it's [3,3,5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Wait, but according to the sample, it requires removing three elements to make it not beautiful, but in this case, removing two elements seems to make it not beautiful.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the sample explanation for the fourth test case, it says removing the first three elements leaves [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

But according to my previous thought, removing two elements could also make it not beautiful.

Wait, but in my previous thought, removing two elements (specific elements) might make it not beautiful, but perhaps not in all cases.

Wait, perhaps the minimum number is the length of the shortest run.

In Sample Input 2, shortest run is 1, and minimum removal is 1.

In Sample Input 4, shortest run is 1 (the [5]), but removing one element doesn't make it not beautiful, as shown.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum length among the most frequent run.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have runs of different lengths.

To make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removals, there is no way to make all elements equal.

One way to achieve this is to have at least two different values that cannot be changed to each other.

But the operations allow changing a[i] to a[i-1] or a[i+1] if they are equal.

So, perhaps, if I can isolate sections of the array where different values cannot be changed to match each other.

Wait, perhaps the number of removals needed is equal to the length of the shortest run of the most frequent value.

Wait, in Sample Input 2, the most frequent value is 1 and 2, each appearing three times, runs of length 1.

Removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In Sample Input 4, the most frequent value is 3, with runs of length 3 and 3, and one run of length 1 (5).

The shortest run of 3 is length 3.

Removing three elements makes it not beautiful.

Is this a general pattern?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the array is [1,1,2,2,1,1].

Runs: [1,1],[2,2],[1,1].

The most frequent run is [1,1] and [2,2], lengths 2.

What is the minimum number of removals to make it not beautiful?

If I remove one element, say the third element, I get [1,1,2,1,1].

Is this beautiful?

Can I make all elements equal?

- Choose i=3: a[2]=1 == a[4]=1, set a[3]=1. Now array is [1,1,1,1,1].

- All elements are equal. So, still beautiful.

If I remove two elements, say the third and fourth: [1,1,1,1].

All elements are equal. Still beautiful.

If I remove three elements, say the third, fourth, and fifth: [1,1,1].

Still beautiful.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, the shortest run of the most frequent value is 2, but removing up to three elements still keeps it beautiful.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Let me try removing different elements.

If I remove the second and fourth elements: [1,2,1,1].

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1 == a[3]=1, set a[2]=1. Now [1,1,1,1].

- All equal. Still beautiful.

If I remove the first, third, and fifth: [1,2,1].

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1 == a[3]=1, set a[2]=1. Now [1,1,1].

- All equal. Still beautiful.

It seems that no matter which elements I remove, I can't make it not beautiful.

But according to the earlier logic, it should be possible.

Wait, maybe I need to remove elements in a different way.

If I remove the first and last elements: [1,2,2,1].

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1 != a[3]=2, can't operate.

- Choose i=3: a[2]=2 == a[4]=1? No.

- So, [1,2,2,1] cannot be made uniform.

Wait, but according to the operations, I can't operate, so it's not beautiful.

Hence, by removing two elements, I can make it not beautiful.

But according to the earlier assumption, the shortest run is 2, and removing two elements makes it not beautiful.

Wait, but in Sample Input 4, the shortest run of 3 is 3, and I had to remove three elements.

So, perhaps the minimum number of removals is equal to the length of the shortest run of the most frequent value.

In this case, runs of 1 are [1,1], [1,1], and [2,2].

Wait, no, runs are [1,1], [2,2], [1,1].

So, for value 1, runs are length 2 and 2; for value 2, run is length 2.

So, the shortest run of the most frequent value is 2.

And indeed, removing two elements makes it not beautiful.

This seems to align with Sample Input 4, where the shortest run of the most frequent value is 3, and removing three elements makes it not beautiful.

So, perhaps the general approach is to find the shortest run length of the most frequent value and remove that many elements.

But wait, in Sample Input 2, the most frequent value has runs of length 1, and removing one element makes it not beautiful.

This seems to fit.

In Sample Input 1, only one run, so output -1.

In Sample Input 3, only one element, output -1.

In Sample Input 4, shortest run of the most frequent value is 3, and removing three elements makes it not beautiful.

So, perhaps the answer is the length of the shortest run of the most frequent value, or -1 if there's only one run.

But, in the example I constructed, [1,1,2,2,1,1], the most frequent value is 1 and 2, each with runs of length 2.

Removing two elements makes it not beautiful.

So, perhaps it's the length of the shortest run among all runs.

Wait, but in Sample Input 2, shortest run is 1, and removing one element works.

In Sample Input 4, shortest run is 1 (the [5]), but removing one element doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in Sample Input 4, runs are [3,3,3], [5], [3,3,3].

So, runs have lengths 3,1,3.

The shortest run is 1.

But removing one element doesn't make it not beautiful, as shown earlier.

Wait, maybe it's the minimum run length of the most frequent run value.

In Sample Input 4, the most frequent run value is 3, with runs of length 3.

So, minimum run length of 3 is 3.

Hence, remove 3 elements.

In Sample Input 2, the most frequent run value is 1 and 2, each with runs of length 1.

So, minimum run length is 1.

Hence, remove 1 element.

In Sample Input 1, only one run, output -1.

In Sample Input 3, only one element, output -1.

This seems consistent.

So, the approach is:

- Find the most frequent value(s).

- Find the runs of these most frequent values.

- Find the shortest run among these runs.

- The minimum number of elements to remove is equal to the length of this shortest run.

- If there's only one run and it's the only value, output -1.

This seems to work for the sample inputs.

Let me verify with the example I constructed earlier: [1,1,2,2,1,1].

Most frequent values are 1 and 2, each with runs of length 2.

Shortest run among these is 2.

Hence, minimum removals should be 2, which matches my earlier finding.

Another example: [1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1].

Most frequent value is 1, with runs of length 3,3.

Shortest run is 3.

Hence, removing three elements should make it not beautiful.

Let's see: removing three elements, say the first three: [2,2,2,1,1,1].

This is still beautiful, as all 2's and 1's can be made uniform.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, it should be not beautiful.

Wait, no, [2,2,2,1,1,1]: this is two runs, [2,2,2] and [1,1,1].

If I try to make all elements 2:

- Choose i=4: a[3]=2 != a[5]=1, can't operate.

- Choose i=2: a[1]=2 == a[3]=2, set a[2]=2 (no change).

- Choose i=5: a[4]=1 != a[6]=1, can't operate.

- So, stuck with [2,2,2,1,1,1], which is not uniform.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, removing three elements should make it not beautiful, but in this case, it does.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove the minimum number of elements such that the remaining array has at least two distinct runs that cannot be made uniform.

But in this case, [2,2,2,1,1,1] has two distinct runs, and it's not beautiful.

So, perhaps the approach is correct.

Hence, the general solution is:

- Identify the most frequent value(s).

- Find the runs of these values.

- Find the shortest run among these runs.

- The minimum number of elements to remove is equal to the length of this shortest run.

- If there's only one run and it's the only value, output -1.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic.

Looking at the code:

```python

from math import inf

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        n = int(input())

        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

        same = 1

        num = ar[0]

        minn = inf

        i = 1

        while i < len(ar):

            if ar[i] == num:

                same += 1

            else:

                i += 1

                num = ar[i]

                minn = min(minn, same)

                same = 1

            i += 1

        minn = min(minn, same)

        if minn == inf:

            print(-1)

        else:

            print(minn)

```

This code seems to be trying to find the minimum run length of the most frequent value.

Wait, but actually, it's iterating through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, and keeping track of the minimum count of such runs.

But, it sets `num = ar[i]` when it finds a different element, and then updates `minn` with the length of the previous run.

But, this doesn't necessarily correspond to the runs of the most frequent value.

For example, in Sample Input 2: [1,2,1,2,1]

It starts with `num = 1`, `same = 1`.

Then, `ar[1]=2 != 1`, so `i +=1`, `num = ar[2]=1`, `minn = min(inf,1)`, `same=1`.

Then, `ar[2]=1 == num=1`, `same=2`.

Then, `ar[3]=2 != 1`, so `i +=1`, `num=ar[4]=1`, `minn = min(1,2)=1`, `same=1`.

Then, `ar[4]=1 == num=1`, `same=2`.

Then, loop ends, `minn = min(1,2)=1`.

Hence, output is 1, which matches the sample.

In Sample Input 4: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

Start with `num=3`, `same=1`.

`ar[1]=3 == num`, `same=2`.

`ar[2]=3 == num`, `same=3`.

`ar[3]=5 != 3`, so `i +=1`, `num=ar[4]=5`, `minn = min(inf,3)=3`, `same=1`.

`ar[4]=5 == num`, `same=2`.

`ar[5]=3 != 5`, so `i +=1`, `num=ar[6]=3`, `minn = min(3,1)=1`, `same=1`.

Then, loop ends, `minn = min(1,1)=1`.

But according to the sample, the answer should be 3.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 3.

But according to the code, it's outputting 1.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, the code would set `minn = min(inf,3)=3`, then when it encounters the next run of 3's, it sets `num=3`, and at the end, `minn = min(3,3)=3`.

Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, it seemed to set `minn = min(3,1)=1`.

Wait, let's trace it again.

Initialize:

- `same =1`, `num=3`, `minn=inf`, `i=1`.

- `ar[1]=3 == num`, `same=2`, `i=2`.

- `ar[2]=3 == num`, `same=3`, `i=3`.

- `ar[3]=5 != num`, so `i +=1` to 4, `num=ar[4]=5`, `minn = min(inf,3)=3`, `same=1`, `i=5`.

- `ar[4]=5 == num`, `same=2`, `i=5`.

- `ar[5]=3 != num`, so `i +=1` to 6, but `i=6 < n=7`, `num=ar[6]=3`, `minn = min(3,2)=2`, `same=1`, `i=7`.

- Loop ends, `minn = min(2,1)=1`.

Wait, but according to the code, it's `minn = min(minn, same)`, which would be `min(3,1)=1`.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Wait, maybe the code is finding the minimum run length of any value, not necessarily the most frequent one.

In the fourth test case, runs are [3,3,3], [5], [3,3,3].

Run lengths: 3,1,3.

The minimum run length is 1, but according to the sample, it's 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 3, but according to the code's logic, it should output 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back, the code sets `minn = min(minn, same)` when it encounters a different element.

But in the fourth test case, it should be considering the runs of the most frequent value, which is 3, with runs of length 3 and 3.

Hence, the minimum run length of 3 is 3.

But the code is considering all runs, including the run of 5 of length 1, leading to `minn=1`.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix this, I need to modify the code to consider only the runs of the most frequent value.

So, I need to first find the most frequent value(s), then find the runs of these values, and find the minimum run length among them.

If there's only one run and it's the only value, output -1.

Otherwise, output the minimum run length.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful. If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removals, we should output -1.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Beautiful Arrays**:
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` for indices where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   
2. **Key Insight**:
   - The array can be divided into runs of consecutive identical elements.
   - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that after removals, it's impossible to make all elements equal using the allowed operations.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Identify the most frequent value(s) in the array.
   - Find the runs (consecutive sequences) of these most frequent value(s).
   - Determine the length of the shortest run among these most frequent values.
   - The minimum number of removals required is equal to the length of this shortest run.
   - If there is only one run and it consists of identical elements, output -1.

### Solution Code

```python
def find_min_removals():
    import sys
    from collections import Counter

    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the array length `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array.
   - If there is only one unique element, output -1 since it's impossible to make it not beautiful.

3. **Identifying Most Frequent Values**:
   - Determine the most frequent value(s) in the array.

4. **Finding Runs of Most Frequent Values**:
   - Traverse the array and group consecutive elements that are among the most frequent values.
   - Track the length of these runs and find the minimum run length.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - If no runs are found, output -1.
   - Otherwise, output the length of the shortest run among the most frequent values.
