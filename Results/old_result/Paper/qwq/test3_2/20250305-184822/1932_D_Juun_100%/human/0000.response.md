Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are two players playing a card game with a 32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. Suits are clubs (C), diamonds (D), hearts (H), and spades (S), and ranks are from '2' to '9'. So, each card is represented by two characters: the rank and the suit, like '8H' for 8 of Hearts.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit. In each round, the first player plays a card, and the second player must beat it with one of their cards, following specific rules. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.

The task is to reconstruct the sequence of n rounds based on the discard pile, which contains 2n cards, shuffled. I need to find any possible sequence of n rounds that could have been played, given the trump suit and the list of cards in the discard pile.

Input:

- t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16): number of rounds.

- trump suit: one character, 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'.

- Third line: descriptions of 2n cards, each a two-character string with rank and suit. All cards are unique.

Output:

- For each test case, print n lines, each containing two cards: the first card played by the first player and the card used by the second player to beat it.

- If no solution exists, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

If multiple solutions exist, any one is acceptable.

Example is provided, but I need to focus on understanding the problem and devising a strategy.

First, I need to understand the rules for one card to beat another:

1. If both cards have the same suit:

- The higher rank beats the lower rank.

2. If the suits are different:

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- Trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, in summary:

- Trump cards are powerful and can beat any non-trump card.

- Between two trump cards, the higher rank beats the lower.

- For non-trump suits, only cards of the same suit can beat each other based on rank.

Given that, I need to reconstruct n rounds from the discard pile.

Approach:

1. **Classify the cards:**

- Separate trump cards from non-trump cards.

- For non-trump cards, group them by their suits.

2. **Match non-trump cards within their suits:**

- For each suit, sort the ranks and pair them such that a higher rank beats a lower rank.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, it can't be paired within the suit and must be paired with a trump card.

3. **Use trump cards to beat remaining non-trump cards:**

- Trump cards can beat any non-trump card.

- Trump cards should be used to beat non-trump cards that couldn't be paired within their suits.

4. **Pair trump cards among themselves:**

- Higher-ranked trump cards beat lower-ranked trump cards.

5. **Check for impossibility:**

- If there are not enough trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards after pairing within suits, it's impossible.

- If there are an odd number of trump cards after pairing within suits, and no non-trump cards left to pair them with, it's impossible.

Let's think about how to implement this.

First, read the input: t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the trump suit.

- Read the list of 2n cards.

Then, separate the cards into trump and non-trump.

For non-trump cards, group them by their suits.

For each suit, sort the ranks and try to pair them in ascending order, so that the higher rank beats the lower rank.

If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest-ranked card in that suit must be paired with a trump card.

Then, use the trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards.

Finally, pair the remaining trump cards among themselves, higher beating lower.

If at any point there aren't enough trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards, or if there's an odd number of trump cards left without a pair, it's impossible.

Otherwise, output the pairs.

Let's consider the example to see if this makes sense.

Example Input:

8

3

S

3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

2

C

3S 5D 9S 6H

1

H

6C 5D

1

S

7S 3S

1

H

9S 9H

1

S

9S 9H

1

C

9D 8H

2

C

9C 9S 6H 8C

Example Output:

3C 4C

6D 9S

3S 7S

IMPOSSIBLE

IMPOSSIBLE

3S 7S

9S 9H

9H 9S

IMPOSSIBLE

6H 9C

9S 8C

Looking at the first test case:

n=3, trump='S', cards: 3C,9S,4C,6D,3S,7S

Separate into trump and non-trump:

Trump: 9S,3S,7S

Non-trump: 3C,4C,6D

Group non-trump by suit:

C: 3C,4C

D: 6D

For suit C, pair 3C and 4C: 4C beats 3C

For suit D, only one card: 6D, so it needs to be paired with a trump card.

So, pairs so far:

4C beats 3C

Now, remaining cards:

Trump: 9S,3S,7S

Non-trump: 6D

Pair 6D with the lowest available trump card, which is 3S (since trumps are sorted in some order).

So, 3S beats 6D.

Now, remaining trump cards: 9S,7S

Pair them: 9S beats 7S

So, final pairs:

4C beats 3C

3S beats 6D

9S beats 7S

But in the sample output, it's:

3C 4C

6D 9S

3S 7S

Which is essentially the same, just ordered differently.

So, my approach seems valid.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n=2, trump='C', cards: 3S,5D,9S,6H

Separate into trump and non-trump:

Trump: none, since trump is 'C' and there are no 'C' suits in the cards.

Non-trump: 3S,5D,9S,6H

Group by suit:

S: 3S,9S

D: 5D

H: 6H

Pair within suits:

S: 9S beats 3S

Now, remaining: 5D,6H

No trump cards to pair them with, and they can't pair within their suits since they are different suits.

Hence, IMPOSSIBLE, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=1, trump='H', cards:6C,5D

Separate:

Trump: none, since trump is 'H' and there are no 'H' suits in the cards.

Non-trump:6C,5D

Group by suit:

C:6C

D:5D

Can't pair within suits, no trump cards to pair them with.

Hence, IMPOSSIBLE, matching the sample.

Another test case:

n=1, trump='S', cards:7S,3S

Separate:

Trump:7S,3S

Non-trump: none

Pair trump cards:7S beats 3S

Output:3S 7S, matching the sample.

Another test case:

n=1, trump='H', cards:9S,9H

Separate:

Trump:9H

Non-trump:9S

Pair 9H (trump) beats 9S (non-trump)

Output:9S 9H, matching the sample.

Another test case:

n=1, trump='S', cards:9S,9H

Separate:

Trump:9S

Non-trump:9H

Wait, trump is 'S', so 9S is trump, 9H is non-trump.

Pair 9S beats 9H

Output:9S 9H, matching the sample.

Another test case:

n=1, trump='C', cards:9D,8H

Separate:

Trump: none, since trump is 'C'

Non-trump:9D,8H

Group by suit:

D:9D

H:8H

Can't pair within suits, no trump cards.

Hence, IMPOSSIBLE, matching the sample.

Last test case:

n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,9S,6H,8C

Separate:

Trump:9C,8C

Non-trump:9S,6H

Group non-trump by suit:

S:9S

H:6H

Pair within suits: can't.

So, pair non-trump cards with trump cards.

But there are two non-trump cards and two trump cards.

Assign the lowest trump card to beat the lowest non-trump card.

But need to define what "lowest" means.

Assuming trump cards are sorted in descending order:9C,8C

Non-trump cards:9S,6H

Assign 8C to beat 6H, and 9C to beat 9S.

Then, no trump cards left, and all non-trump cards are paired.

Output:6H 8C and 9S 9C, matching the sample.

Good.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases and processes each one by calling func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n (number of rounds), trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

- Initialize trumps list and answers list.

- Initialize a dictionary suits with keys 'C','D','H','S' and values set to None.

- Iterate through each card in the input list:

- If the card's suit is the trump suit, add its rank to trumps list.

- If the suit is not trump and suits[suit] is not None, meaning there's already a card in that suit:

- Append to answers the two cards in that suit, sorted by rank.

- Set suits[suit] to None, indicating that this suit has been paired.

- Else, set suits[suit] to the rank of this card.

- After processing all cards, iterate through the suits dictionary:

- If a suit has a rank (i.e., it's not None and not paired):

- If there are trumps available, pair this non-trump card with a trump card.

- Pop a trump card and create a pair with the non-trump card.

- If no trumps are left, print "IMPOSSIBLE" and return.

- Sort the remaining trumps in descending order.

- Pair the remaining trumps in pairs, with higher beating lower.

- Print all the pairs in answers.

Seems logical.

But let's check if it handles all cases correctly.

Consider a case where there are multiple suits with an even number of cards, and no trumps.

For example:

n=2

trump='C'

cards: 2D,3D,4H,5H

Processing:

- trumps: empty

- suits: 'D':2, 'H':4

- For card 2D: suits['D']=2

- For card 3D: suits['D'] is not None, so append '2D 3D' to answers, set suits['D']=None

- For card 4H: suits['H']=4

- For card 5H: suits['H'] is not None, so append '4H 5H' to answers, set suits['H']=None

- After processing, all suits are paired, no trumps needed.

- Print the answers: '2D 3D' and '4H 5H'

Good.

Another case: n=1, trump='S', cards:7S,3S

Processing:

- trumps: ['7','3']

- suits: all None for non-trump suits.

- No non-trump cards.

- After processing, trumps=['7','3']

- Sort trumps descending: ['7','3']

- Pair them: print '7S 3S'

Good.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=1, trump='S', cards:7S,3S, the output is '3S 7S'. Order doesn't matter as long as the higher rank beats the lower.

Another case: n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,8C,7C,6C

Processing:

- trumps: ['9','8','7','6']

- suits: all None for non-trump suits.

- After processing, trumps=['9','8','7','6']

- Sort descending: ['9','8','7','6']

- Pair them: '9C 8C' and '7C 6C'

Good.

Another case: n=1, trump='H', cards:9H,9S

Processing:

- trumps: ['9']

- suits: 'S':9

- For card 9H: trumps.append('9')

- For card 9S: suits['S']='9'

- After processing suits, 'S' has '9', and trumps have ['9']

- Pair '9S' with '9H'

- answers.append('9S 9H')

- Print '9S 9H'

Good.

Another case: n=1, trump='H', cards:9S,9H

Same as above.

Another case: n=1, trump='C', cards:9D,8H

Processing:

- trumps: empty

- suits: 'D':'9', 'H':'8'

- After processing suits, both suits have ranks, and no trumps to pair them with.

- For 'D':'9', try to pair with trumps, but trumps are empty, so print "IMPOSSIBLE"

Correct.

Seems the program handles these cases correctly.

But let's think about a more complex case.

n=3, trump='S', cards:2S,3S,4S,5S,6C,7H

Processing:

- trumps: ['2','3','4','5']

- suits: 'C':'6', 'H':'7'

- For '2S': trumps.append('2')

- For '3S': trumps.append('3')

- For '4S': trumps.append('4')

- For '5S': trumps.append('5')

- For '6C': suits['C']='6'

- For '7H': suits['H']='7'

- After processing suits, 'C':'6' and 'H':'7'

- trumps: ['2','3','4','5']

- Pair '6C' with '2S', '7H' with '3S', leaving '4S' and '5S'

- Sort trumps: ['5','4']

- Pair '5S' and '4S'

- answers: ['6C 2S', '7H 3S', '5S 4S']

- Print these pairs.

Seems correct.

Another case: n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,8C,7S,6S

Processing:

- trumps: ['9','8']

- suits: 'S':'7', 'S':'6'

- For '9C': trumps.append('9')

- For '8C': trumps.append('8')

- For '7S': suits['S']='7'

- For '6S': suits['S'] is '7', so append '6S 7S' to answers, set suits['S']=None

- After processing suits, 'S' is None, trumps=['9','8']

- No remaining non-trump cards, so pair trumps: '9C 8C'

- answers: ['6S 7S', '9C 8C']

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Seems the program handles these cases correctly.

But let's consider a case where there are multiple suits with odd numbers of cards.

n=3, trump='S', cards:2S,3S,4S,5H,6H,7D

Processing:

- trumps: ['2','3','4']

- suits: 'H':'5', 'H':'6', 'D':'7'

- For '2S': trumps.append('2')

- For '3S': trumps.append('3')

- For '4S': trumps.append('4')

- For '5H': suits['H']='5'

- For '6H': suits['H'] is '5', so append '5H 6H' to answers, set suits['H']=None

- For '7D': suits['D']='7'

- After processing suits, 'D':'7', trumps=['2','3','4']

- Pair '7D' with '2S', leaving '3S' and '4S'

- Sort trumps: ['4','3']

- Pair '4S' and '3S'

- answers: ['5H 6H', '7D 2S', '4S 3S']

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Another case: n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,8C,7H,6H

Processing:

- trumps: ['9','8']

- suits: 'H':'7', 'H':'6'

- For '9C': trumps.append('9')

- For '8C': trumps.append('8')

- For '7H': suits['H']='7'

- For '6H': suits['H'] is '7', so append '6H 7H' to answers, set suits['H']=None

- After processing suits, no remaining non-trump cards, trumps=['9','8']

- Pair '9C' and '8C'

- answers: ['6H 7H', '9C 8C']

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Seems consistent.

Now, a case where there are not enough trumps to pair with remaining non-trump cards.

n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,7H,6H,5D

Processing:

- trumps: ['9']

- suits: 'H':'7', 'H':'6', 'D':'5'

- For '9C': trumps.append('9')

- For '7H': suits['H']='7'

- For '6H': suits['H'] is '7', so append '6H 7H' to answers, set suits['H']=None

- For '5D': suits['D']='5'

- After processing suits, 'D':'5', trumps=['9']

- Pair '5D' with '9C', no trumps left

- answers: ['6H 7H', '5D 9C']

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Another case: n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,7H,6H,5H

Processing:

- trumps: ['9']

- suits: 'H':'7', 'H':'6', 'H':'5'

- For '9C': trumps.append('9')

- For '7H': suits['H']='7'

- For '6H': suits['H'] is '7', so append '6H 7H' to answers, set suits['H']='5'

- For '5H': suits['H'] is '5', so append '5H' with a trump card.

- But only one trump '9C' left.

- Pair '5H' with '9C'

- answers: ['6H 7H', '5H 9C']

- No trumps left, so no more pairs.

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Another case: n=2, trump='C', cards:9C,7H,6H,5H,4S,3S

Wait, n=2, but 2n=4 cards, but here I have 6 cards. Doesn't fit.

Ignore that.

Another case: n=3, trump='C', cards:9C,8C,7H,6H,5H,4H

Processing:

- trumps: ['9','8']

- suits: 'H':'7', 'H':'6', 'H':'5', 'H':'4'

- For '9C': trumps.append('9')

- For '8C': trumps.append('8')

- For '7H': suits['H']='7'

- For '6H': suits['H'] is '7', so append '6H 7H' to answers, set suits['H']='5'

- For '5H': suits['H'] is '5', so append '5H' with a trump card.

- For '4H': suits['H'] is '5', so append '4H 5H' to answers, set suits['H']=None

- After processing suits, 'H' is None, trumps=['9','8']

- Pair trumps: '9C 8C'

- answers: ['6H 7H', '4H 5H', '9C 8C']

- Print these pairs.

Good.

Seems correct.

Another tricky case: n=1, trump='H', cards:2H,2D

Processing:

- trumps: ['2']

- suits: 'D':'2'

- For '2H': trumps.append('2')

- For '2D': suits['D']='2'

- After processing suits, 'D':'2', trumps=['2']

- Pair '2D' with '2H'

- answers: ['2D 2H']

- Print this pair.

Good.

Another case: n=1, trump='H', cards:2H,3H

Processing:

- trumps: ['2','3']

- suits: all None

- After processing, trumps=['2','3']

- Pair '3H' and '2H'

- answers: ['3H 2H']

- Print this pair.

Good.

Seems the program handles these cases correctly.

I think the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the sequence of rounds played in a card game based on the discard pile, given the trump suit and the list of cards in the discard pile.

## Approach

1. **Classify the cards:** Separate the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards. For non-trump cards, group them by their suits.
2. **Match non-trump cards within their suits:** For each suit, sort the ranks and pair them such that a higher rank beats a lower rank.
3. **Use trump cards to beat remaining non-trump cards:** If there are an odd number of cards in a suit, the highest-ranked card in that suit must be paired with a trump card.
4. **Pair trump cards among themselves:** Higher-ranked trump cards beat lower-ranked trump cards.
5. **Check for impossibility:** If there are not enough trump cards to beat the remaining non-trump cards or if there's an odd number of trump cards left without a pair, it's impossible to reconstruct the rounds.

## Solution Code

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input()  # Read and ignore n as it's not used in the function
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        (rank, suit) = card
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while len(trumps) >= 2:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    if trumps:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.
2. **Classify Cards:** Separate cards into trump and non-trump categories. For non-trump cards, group them by their suits.
3. **Pair Non-trump Cards:** For each suit, pair cards such that higher ranks beat lower ranks.
4. **Use Trumps to Pair Remaining Non-trump Cards:** If there are unpaired non-trump cards, use trump cards to pair them.
5. **Pair Remaining Trumps:** Pair remaining trump cards among themselves, with higher ranks beating lower ranks.
6. **Output the Pairs:** Print the pairs for each round. If at any point it's not possible to form the pairs, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
