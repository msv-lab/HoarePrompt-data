Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. Each letter has a position in the alphabet from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26. He encoded the word by summing up the positions of its letters. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. But this encoding is ambiguous because different words can have the same sum, like "ava" also sums to 24.

My task is to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded for a given sum. So, for each test case with a given sum, I need to find the smallest possible 3-letter word whose letters' positions sum up to that number.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible words that satisfy the sum condition, I have to choose the one that would come first in a dictionary. For example, "aav" comes before "ava" because 'a' is smaller than 'v' in the alphabet.

Given that, I need a strategy to generate the smallest possible word for a given sum. The word consists of three letters, so I need to assign values to three variables (representing the letters) that sum up to the given number, and among all possible combinations, choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.

One approach is to minimize the first letter as much as possible, then the second, and so on. So, start with the smallest possible value for the first letter, then the smallest possible for the second letter given the first, and finally set the third letter to whatever is left.

But I need to make sure that all letters are between 1 and 26, inclusive.

Let me think about the constraints:

- Each letter is between 1 and 26.

- The sum of the three letters is n, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.

So, the minimal sum is 3 (all 'a's) and the maximal sum is 78 (all 'z's).

Given that, for each test case, I need to output the smallest possible word that sums to n.

Let's consider an example from the problem: n = 24.

Possible words:

- "cat": 3 + 1 + 20 = 24

- "ava": 1 + 22 + 1 = 24

But the smallest lexicographically is "aav" because 'a' is smaller than 'c' and 'v' is smaller than 't'.

So, how can I generate "aav" from the sum 24?

I need to minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, start with the first letter as small as possible, which is 1 ('a'). Then, set the second letter as small as possible, which is also 1 ('a'). Then, the third letter is n - 1 - 1 = 22 ('v'). So, "aav".

Another example: n = 3.

The smallest possible word is "aaa" since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Another example: n = 78.

The only possible word is "zzz" since 26 + 26 + 26 = 78.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

I need to assign values to three variables, say a, b, c, such that a + b + c = n, and a, b, c are between 1 and 26, inclusive.

To get the lexicographically smallest word, I should minimize a first, then b, then c.

So, set a to its minimum value, which is 1, and then set b to its minimum value, which is 1, and then c = n - a - b.

But I need to ensure that c is between 1 and 26.

If c is less than 1 or greater than 26, I need to adjust b accordingly.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of assigning the smallest possible value to a, then to b given a, and then c is determined.

So, set a = max(1, n - 26 - 26), because b and c can be at most 26 each.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

I need to set a to the smallest possible value, which is 1, as long as the remaining sum for b and c is achievable with b and c between 1 and 26.

So, set a = 1, then b can be from 1 to 26, and c = n - a - b.

I need to ensure that c is between 1 and 26.

So, c = n - 1 - b >=1 and <=26.

Which implies that b <= n - 1 - 1 = n - 2, and b >= n - 1 - 26.

But need to ensure that b is between 1 and 26.

So, b should be max(1, n - 1 - 26) <= b <= min(26, n - 1 - 1).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe there is a better way.

Let me consider that to minimize the word lexicographically, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and so on.

So, for the first letter, set it to the smallest possible value, which is 1 ('a'), as long as the remaining sum can be achieved with the next two letters.

So, set a = 1, then b + c = n - 1.

But b + c = n - 1, and b and c are between 1 and 26.

So, n - 1 must be between 2 and 52 (since 1 <= b <=26 and 1 <= c <=26).

Wait, 1 <= b <=26 and 1 <= c <=26, so 2 <= b + c <=52.

But n is between 3 and 78, so n -1 is between 2 and 77.

But to have b + c = n -1 with 2 <= b + c <=52, I need to ensure that n -1 <=52, which means n <=53.

Wait, but n can be up to 78.

Wait, no, n <=78, but n -1 <=52 implies n <=53.

But if n >53, then it's impossible to set a=1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if n=54, then a=1, b+c=53.

But b and c can be at most 26 each, so b+c <=52.

So, for n=54, a cannot be 1.

So, a must be at least n -52.

Wait, let's think differently.

To set a to its smallest possible value, a must be at least max(1, n -52).

Because if a is smaller than n -52, then b + c would be more than 52, which is impossible.

Similarly, a can be at most min(26, n -2).

Because if a is larger than n -2, then b + c would be less than 2, which is impossible since b and c are at least 1 each.

So, a's range is max(1, n -52) <= a <= min(26, n -2).

Similarly, for b, given a, b's range is max(1, n - a -26) <= b <= min(26, n - a -1).

And then c = n - a - b.

But this seems too complicated to implement.

Is there a simpler way?

Wait, perhaps I can set a as small as possible, then set b as small as possible given a, and then c is determined.

So, set a = max(1, n -52).

Then, set b = max(1, n - a -26).

Then, c = n - a - b.

This should work.

Let me test this with n=24.

a = max(1, 24 -52) = max(1, -28) =1

b = max(1, 24 -1 -26) = max(1, -3) =1

c =24 -1 -1=22

So, a=1, b=1, c=22 → "aav"

Good.

Another test: n=3.

a = max(1, 3-52)=1

b = max(1, 3-1-26)= max(1, -24)=1

c=3-1-1=1 → "aaa"

Good.

Another test: n=78.

a = max(1, 78-52)=26

b = max(1, 78-26-26)= max(1, 26)=26

c=78-26-26=26 → "zzz"

Good.

Another test: n=77.

a = max(1, 77-52)=25

b = max(1, 77-25-26)= max(1, 26)=26

c=77-25-26=26 → "zzy"

Wait, no, 25 is 'y', 26 is 'z', so "yzz"

But according to the earlier logic, a should be 25, b=26, c=26 → "yzz"

But according to the problem, n=78 is "zzz", n=77 should be "yzz".

Wait, but in the earlier logic, a = max(1, n-52), which for n=77 is 25.

Then b = max(1, 77-25-26)= max(1, 26)=26

c=77-25-26=26 → "yzz"

Seems correct.

Another test: n=53.

a = max(1, 53-52)=1

b = max(1, 53-1-26)= max(1, 26)=26

c=53-1-26=26 → "azz"

Seems correct.

Another test: n=52.

a = max(1, 52-52)=1

b = max(1, 52-1-26)= max(1, 25)=25

c=52-1-25=26 → "ayz"

Seems correct.

Wait, but I think there might be a better word.

Wait, "abz": 1 + 2 + 26 = 29, which is less than 52.

Wait, no, "abz" sums to 1+2+26=29, which is less than 52.

Wait, for n=52, "ayz" seems correct: 1 + 25 + 26 = 52.

But is there a smaller word than "ayz"?

Wait, "baz": 2 + 1 + 26 = 29, which is less than 52.

Wait, no, "baz" is for n=29.

Wait, for n=52, "ayz" seems correct.

Alternatively, "byz": 2 + 25 + 26 = 53, which is more than 52.

Wait, no, "ayz" is correct.

Seems like "ayz" is the smallest for n=52.

So, my earlier logic seems correct.

Now, let's see what the given program does.

def func():

cases = int(input())

for i in range(cases):

arr = []

lex = int(input())

for j in range(2):

if lex <= 26:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex - 1

elif lex < 52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

else:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

for k in range(3):

print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n (lex), initializes an empty list arr, and then has a loop for j in range(2):

- if lex <=26: append 1 to arr and subtract 1 from lex

- elif lex <52: append 26 to arr and subtract 26 from lex

- else: append 26 to arr and subtract 26 from lex

Then, append the remaining lex to arr, sort arr, and print the corresponding letters.

Wait, this seems different from my earlier approach.

Let me see what it does for n=24.

lex=24

j=0:

24 <=26 → append 1, lex=24-1=23

j=1:

23 <=26 → append 1, lex=23-1=22

arr=[1,1,22], sorted=[1,1,22] → "aav"

Correct.

n=3:

j=0:

3 <=26 → append 1, lex=3-1=2

j=1:

2 <=26 → append 1, lex=2-1=1

arr=[1,1,1], sorted=[1,1,1] → "aaa"

Correct.

n=78:

j=0:

78 <=26? No.

78 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=78-26=52

j=1:

52 <=26? No.

52 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=52-26=26

arr=[26,26,26], sorted=[26,26,26] → "zzz"

Correct.

n=77:

j=0:

77 <=26? No.

77 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=77-26=51

j=1:

51 <=26? No.

51 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=51-26=25

arr=[26,26,25], sorted=[25,26,26] → "yzz"

Correct.

n=53:

j=0:

53 <=26? No.

53 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=53-26=27

j=1:

27 <=26? No.

27 <52? Yes.

So, append 26, lex=27-26=1

arr=[26,26,1], sorted=[1,26,26] → "azz"

Wait, but earlier I thought n=53 should be "azz", but in my earlier manual calculation, I thought it should be "az z", but according to the program, it's "azz".

Wait, no, "azz" is correct: 1 + 26 + 26 = 53.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought for n=53, it should be "azz", not "az z". Wait, "az z" is not a valid 3-letter word. It should be "azz".

Yes, "azz" is correct: 1 + 26 + 26 = 53.

So, the program outputs "azz", which is correct.

Another test: n=52.

j=0:

52 <=26? No.

52 <52? No.

So, append 26, lex=52-26=26

j=1:

26 <=26? Yes.

Append 1, lex=26-1=25

arr=[26,1,25], sorted=[1,25,26] → "ayz"

Which matches my earlier manual calculation.

Correct.

So, it seems that the program is correctly generating the smallest possible word for the given sum.

Let me see if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Edge case 1: n=3.

Already tested, "aaa" is correct.

Edge case 2: n=78.

Already tested, "zzz" is correct.

Edge case 3: n=26.

j=0:

26 <=26 → append 1, lex=26-1=25

j=1:

25 <=26 → append 1, lex=25-1=24

arr=[1,1,24], sorted=[1,1,24] → "aab"

Wait, but is there a smaller word than "aab"?

Let's see, "aaa" sums to 3, "aab" sums to 2+1+1=4, up to "aaz" sums to 1+1+26=28.

Wait, n=26 is between 3 and 28, so "aaz" sums to 28, but n=26 should be "abz": 1+2+26=29, which is more than 26.

Wait, no, "abz" is 1+2+26=29.

Wait, what word sums to 26?

"app": 1 + 16 + 16 = 33, too much.

"ado": 1 + 4 + 15 = 20, too low.

"add": 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, too low.

"zab": 26 + 1 + 2 = 29, too high.

Wait, it seems difficult to find a 3-letter word that sums to 26.

Wait, maybe "ab Y", but "y" is 25: 1 + 2 + 25 = 28, still too high.

"aaa" is 3, "aab" is 4, up to "aaz" is 28.

So, perhaps n=26 is impossible with three letters.

Wait, but according to the constraints, n is between 3 and 78, and with n=26, maybe there are multiple solutions.

Wait, perhaps "acd": 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, too low.

"acz": 1 + 3 + 26 = 30, too high.

"abb": 1 + 2 + 2 = 5, too low.

"abz": 1 + 2 + 26 = 29, too high.

"abb": 1 + 2 + 2 =5, too low.

"azz": 1 + 26 + 26 =53, too high.

Wait, maybe n=26 is impossible with three letters.

But according to the program, for n=26:

arr = [1,1,24], sorted=[1,1,24] → "aab"

But "aab" sums to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is less than 26.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Wait, in the program, for n=26:

j=0:

26 <=26 → append 1, lex=26-1=25

j=1:

25 <=26 → append 1, lex=25-1=24

arr=[1,1,24], sorted=[1,1,24]

But 1 + 1 + 24 = 26, which corresponds to "aab".

But "aab" sums to 1 + 1 + 2 =4, which is not 26.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the arr values.

Wait, no, arr contains the positions, so 1,1,24 correspond to 'a','a','x' (since 24 is 'x'), so "aax", which sums to 1 + 1 + 24 =26.

Wait, yes, "aax" sums to 26.

Is there a smaller word than "aax" that sums to 26?

Let's see, "a a y" is 1 + 1 + 25 =27, which is more than 26.

So, "aax" is correct.

Another test: n=25.

Similarly, arr=[1,1,23], sorted=[1,1,23] → "aaw"

Since 1 + 1 + 23 =25.

Seems correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for these cases.

Let me see how the program works in general.

It seems to be trying to minimize the first two letters as much as possible, and then assigning the remaining value to the third letter.

But in the loop, it's only iterating j from 0 to 1 (range(2)), and appending two values based on lex, and then appending the remaining lex to arr.

Wait, no, it appends two values in the loop, and then appends the remaining lex after the loop.

So, it's assigning two letters first, and the third letter is whatever is left.

Then, it sorts arr to ensure the smallest possible word.

Wait, but why does it sort arr? Because it wants the smallest possible word, so sorting ascendingly ensures that.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=26, arr=[1,1,24], sorted=[1,1,24], which corresponds to "aax".

But is there a smaller word than "aax" for n=26?

Let's see, "a a y" is 1 + 1 + 25 =27, which is more than 26.

" a a x" is 1 + 1 + 24=26.

" a a w" is 1 + 1 + 23=25, which is less than 26.

Wait, but n=25 is "aaw", which is correct.

Wait, for n=26, "aax" is correct.

Another test: n=27.

arr=[1,1,25], sorted=[1,1,25] → "aay"

Which sums to 1 + 1 + 25 =27.

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Another perspective: the program tries to minimize the first two letters as much as possible, given the constraints.

In the loop for j in range(2):

- if lex <=26: append 1 and set lex -=1

- elif lex <52: append 26 and set lex -=26

- else: append 26 and set lex -=26

Then, append the remaining lex to arr.

Wait, but in the case n=26:

- j=0: 26 <=26 → append 1, lex=25

- j=1: 25 <=26 → append 1, lex=24

- append 24 to arr

- arr=[1,1,24], sorted=[1,1,24] → "aax"

Which is correct.

Another example: n=50.

- j=0: 50 <=26? No, 50<52? No (50<52 is True) → append 26, lex=50-26=24

- j=1: 24 <=26 → append 1, lex=23

- arr=[26,1,23], sorted=[1,23,26] → "acz"

Check: a + c + z =1 + 3 + 26 =30, which is not 50.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, arr=[26,1,23], sorted=[1,23,26] → 'a', 'w', 'z' → "awz"

Sum: 1 + 23 + 26 =4 +23+26=50. Wait, 1 + 23 + 26 =49.

Wait, 1 + 23 +26=50.

Yes, correct.

Wait, 1 + 23 +26=50.

Yes, "awz" is correct.

Another test: n=49.

- j=0:49 <=26? No, 49<52? Yes → append 26, lex=49-26=23

- j=1:23 <=26 → append 1, lex=22

- arr=[26,1,22], sorted=[1,22,26] → "avz"

Check: a + v + z =1 +22+26=49. Correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but earlier I thought for n=26, "aax" is correct.

Wait, x is 24, so 1 +1 +24=26.

Yes, correct.

I think the program is correctly generating the smallest possible word for the given sum.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that corresponds to a given sum of positions of letters in the alphabet.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each letter from 'a' to 'z' has a position from 1 to 26.
   - We need to find three letters (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = n, where n is the given sum.
   - We have to ensure that a, b, and c are between 1 and 26.
   - Among all possible combinations, we need the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Strategy:**
   - To get the smallest word lexicographically, minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
   - We achieve this by:
     - Setting the first letter as small as possible.
     - Setting the second letter as small as possible given the first letter.
     - The third letter is then determined by the remaining value needed to reach the sum n.

3. **Implementation:**
   - For each test case:
     - Read the sum n.
     - Use a loop to assign the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
     - Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
     - Sort the letters to ensure the smallest combination.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for _ in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append
