Alright, so I've got this problem here. It's about determining whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top of the tower.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Initially, there are no cubes in the tower. Each move can either add one cube or remove one cube from the top. So, at each step, the height of the tower can either increase by one or decrease by one, provided there is at least one cube to remove.

The question is, after n moves, can the tower have exactly m cubes? I need to check this for multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers n and m.

Let me think about how the number of cubes in the tower changes with moves. If I denote adding a cube as +1 and removing a cube as -1, then the total number of cubes after n moves would be the sum of these +1 and -1 operations.

Let's say x is the number of times I add a cube, and y is the number of times I remove a cube. Then, x + y = n (total moves), and the final number of cubes is x - y. Because each add operation increases the count by 1 and each remove operation decreases it by 1.

So, m = x - y, and n = x + y. I can solve these two equations to find x and y.

Adding the two equations: m + n = 2x => x = (m + n)/2

Subtracting the two equations: m - n = -2y => y = (n - m)/2

For x and y to be non-negative integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, and both x and y must be non-negative.

So, the conditions are:

1. (m + n) is even.

2. (n - m) is even.

3. x = (m + n)/2 >= 0

4. y = (n - m)/2 >= 0

But since n and m are both positive integers starting from 1, and n can be greater than, equal to, or less than m, I need to consider these cases.

Wait, but n is the number of moves, and m is the final number of cubes. Since you can't have negative cubes, m should be at least 0, but the problem states 1 <= m <= 100, so m is at least 1.

Also, you can't remove a cube if there are none, so the sequence of moves matters. For example, if you try to remove a cube when the tower is empty, that move is invalid. However, the problem probably assumes that you can only remove a cube if there is one available.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that the inputs are valid as per the description, so I don't need to handle invalid states.

Looking back at the equations:

x = (m + n)/2

y = (n - m)/2

For x and y to be integers, both (m + n) and (n - m) must be even, as you've already stated.

Also, since x and y represent the number of times you add or remove a cube, they must be non-negative integers.

So, the conditions simplify to:

- (n - m) is even

- (n - m) >= 0

Because if (n - m) is negative, it would imply y is negative, which isn't possible.

Wait, but m can be greater than n, meaning you end up with more cubes than the number of moves, which seems impossible unless you have some initial cubes, but in this problem, you start with zero cubes. So, m cannot be greater than n.

For example, if n=3 and m=3, it's possible by adding three times.

If n=2 and m=4, it's impossible because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves.

Wait, but actually, if you add and remove cubes in a certain order, you might end up with m > n, but in this problem, since you start from zero and each add operation increases by one and remove decreases by one, the maximum m you can have is n, by adding every move.

Wait, no, if you add a cube and then remove it, you end up with the same number as before. So, to maximize m, you should add in every move, giving m = n.

To minimize m, you can remove cubes as much as possible, but you can't remove more than you have.

So, m can range from max(0, n - m) to n, in steps of 2, because each add and remove operation changes the count by 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each add operation increases the cube count by 1, and each remove operation decreases it by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

Given that, the final number of cubes is x - y, where x is the number of add operations and y is the number of remove operations, with x + y = n.

So, m = x - y, and x + y = n.

Solving, x = (m + n)/2, y = (n - m)/2.

For x and y to be integers, (m + n) and (n - m) must be even, i.e., m and n must be either both even or both odd.

Also, y cannot exceed x, because you can't remove more cubes than you have added.

Wait, no, y can be up to x, but the sequence matters.

For example, if you remove a cube before adding one, it's invalid.

But perhaps the problem assumes that you can only remove a cube if there is one available.

In that case, the number of remove operations y cannot exceed the current number of cubes.

This seems complex.

Looking back at the reference solution:

kreker = int(input())

for i in range(kreker):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, the reference solution checks if (n - m) is even and non-negative.

From my earlier analysis, x = (m + n)/2 and y = (n - m)/2, both need to be integers and non-negative.

So, (n - m) being even ensures that y is an integer, and (n - m) >= 0 ensures that y is non-negative.

Also, since x = (m + n)/2, and m + n is even (because n - m is even implies m + n is even), x is also an integer.

Therefore, the reference solution seems correct.

Let me verify with some examples.

Example 1:

n = 3, m = 3

(n - m) = 0, which is even and >=0.

So, output should be "Yes", which matches the example.

Example 2:

n = 2, m = 4

(n - m) = -2, which is even but <0, so "No", matches the example.

Another example:

n = 4, m = 0

(n - m) = 4, which is even and >=0, so "Yes".

Indeed, you can add and remove alternately to end up with 0 cubes.

Another example:

n = 5, m = 1

(n - m) = 4, even and >=0, so "Yes".

Possible sequence: +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, ending with 4 -1 = 3, wait, no, that's 5 moves: +1 five times to get m=5, but m=1 is achievable by other sequences.

Wait, is m=1 achievable with n=5?

Let's see:

x + y = 5

x - y = 1

Solving, x=3, y=2.

So, add 3 times, remove 2 times, in some order where removes don't exceed the current cube count.

Yes, possible.

So, the reference solution seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves, where each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top of the tower.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Moves**:
   - Each add operation increases the cube count by 1.
   - Each remove operation decreases the cube count by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - Let `x` be the number of add operations.
   - Let `y` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have two equations:
     - `x + y = n` (total moves)
     - `x - y = m` (final cube count)

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - Adding the equations: `2x = n + m => x = (n + m)/2`
   - Subtracting the equations: `2y = n - m => y = (n - m)/2`
   - For `x` and `y` to be valid, `(n + m)` and `(n - m)` must be even, and `y` must be non-negative.

4. **Conditions for Feasibility**:
   - `(n - m)` must be even.
   - `(n - m)` must be non-negative.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `T`.
  - For each test case, read the pair `(n, m)`.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Check if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
  - If both conditions are satisfied, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves by verifying the necessary conditions derived from the equations.
