Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. It's about a game between Anna and Sasha, where they manipulate a list of numbers in specific ways, and based on the final number, one of them wins. I need to determine who wins for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand the game rules clearly.

Anna's move:

- She chooses one element from the list and reverses its digits, removing leading zeros.

Sasha's move:

- He chooses two elements from the list, concatenates them in any order, and inserts the result back into the list. This reduces the list size by one.

Players take turns, with Anna going first. The game ends when there's only one number left in the list, and based on whether this number is at least 10^m, Sasha wins if it is, otherwise Anna wins.

I need to determine, for each test case, who wins if both play optimally.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for y in range(int(input())):

rev_val = []

rev_res = ''

(list_len, max_power) = input().split()

operational_list = input().split()

for x in operational_list:

x_rev = int(x[::-1])

if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):

rev_res = rev_res + x

else:

rev_val.append(x[::-1])

rev_val.sort()

for x in range(len(rev_val)):

if x % 2 == 0:

val_in = int(rev_val[x])

rev_res += str(val_in)

else:

val_in = rev_val[x]

rev_res += val_in[::-1]

if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):

print('Sasha')

else:

print('Anna')

I need to assess if this code correctly determines the winner for each test case.

Let me try to understand the logic behind this code.

It seems like the code is trying to simulate the game in some way, but I need to verify if it accurately represents the game mechanics and the optimal play.

First, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n (number of elements) and m (the exponent for comparison).

It reads the list of numbers as strings.

Then, it processes each number in the list:

- Reverses the digits and converts to int.

- Checks if the length of the reversed number (as int, so leading zeros are removed) is the same as the original length.

- If yes, appends the original number to rev_res.

- If not, appends the reversed string to rev_val.

Then, it sorts rev_val and iterates through it, alternating between converting even-indexed elements to int and adding them to rev_res, and for odd-indexed elements, reversing them again before adding to rev_res.

Finally, it compares the integer value of rev_res with 10^m and decides the winner based on that.

This seems overly complicated and doesn't clearly reflect the game's rules or optimal strategies.

Let me think about the game more carefully.

The game alternates between Anna and Sasha, with Anna starting.

Anna reverses one number each turn, while Sasha concatenates two numbers and inserts the result back.

The game ends when only one number remains, and based on its value compared to 10^m, Sasha wins if it's at least 10^m, else Anna wins.

I need to find out who wins with optimal play.

First, I need to understand the effect of the players' moves.

Anna reverses one number each turn, which can change its value.

Sasha concatenates two numbers, which generally increases the value significantly.

The game ends when only one number is left, and its value determines the winner.

I need to consider the sequence of moves and how the list evolves.

Given that Sasha is concatenating two numbers into one, which reduces the list size by one, and Anna is just reversing one number without changing the list size, the number of moves Sasha can make depends on the current list size.

Wait, but in the problem, it says that after Sasha's move, the number of elements decreases by one, since he removes two and adds one.

Anna's move doesn't change the list size; she just reverses one element.

So, the game proceeds with Anna reversing one number, then Sasha concatenating two numbers, and so on, until only one number remains.

Wait, but the problem says: "Players take turns. Anna makes the first move. On her turn, Anna reverses one element. On his turn, Sasha extracts two elements, concatenates them, and inserts the result back into the list."

So, the sequence is:

- Anna reverses one element.

- Sasha removes two elements, concatenates them, and adds the result back.

- Repeat until only one element remains.

Wait, but each time Sasha removes two and adds one, reducing the list size by one.

Anna's move doesn't change the list size.

So, the game progresses as follows:

- Start with n elements.

- Anna reverses one element.

- Sasha removes two elements, concatenates them, and adds one back, reducing the list size by one.

- Repeat until only one element remains.

Wait, but the problem says: "The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e., after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list."

So, the game ends when there's only one number left, and Sasha can't make a move because he needs at least two numbers to concatenate.

At that point, the remaining number is compared to 10^m to decide the winner.

I need to model this game to see who can influence the final number to be greater than or equal to 10^m.

Given that Sasha wants the final number to be large, and Anna wants it to be small.

I need to think about the optimal strategies for both players.

First, consider that Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order he chooses, and Anna reverses one number per turn.

I need to consider the effects of these operations on the final number.

This seems complex, so maybe I can look for a pattern or a way to simplify the game.

Let me consider the total number of moves.

Each time Sasha moves, the list size decreases by one.

Anna can reverse any number at any time.

But since Anna moves first, and then Sasha, and so on, alternating turns.

The game ends when there's only one number left, meaning Sasha's last move reduces the list from two to one.

I need to consider the parity of the number of Sasha's moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a game where Anna can reverse any number any number of times, but Sasha's moves are constrained by the list size.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that Anna can reverse any number any number of times during the game, but Sasha's moves are to concatenate two numbers into one, reducing the list size by one each time.

Since Anna moves first, and then Sasha, and so on, alternating turns, until only one number remains.

I need to consider the sequence of moves and how they affect the final number.

This seems too involved, so maybe I can look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Anna can reverse any subset of the numbers an odd number of times, since each reversal is its own inverse.

Wait, reversing a number twice returns it to its original form.

But since Anna can choose which number to reverse each time, and she can reverse the same number multiple times, but it would just toggle its state between original and reversed.

Wait, but since reversing twice returns to original, effectively Anna can choose a subset of numbers to be reversed at the end.

But it's not clear how this interacts with Sasha's concatenations.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose n=1.

If n=1, then Anna reverses the single number, and the game ends.

So, the final number is the reversed version of the original number.

If this reversed number is >= 10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Simple enough.

For n=2:

- Anna reverses one of the two numbers.

- Sasha concatenates the two numbers in some order.

- The final number is the concatenation of the potentially reversed numbers.

- Sasha can choose the order of concatenation.

So, Sasha can choose the order that maximizes the final number.

Anna chooses which one to reverse to minimize the final number.

I need to consider their optimal choices.

For n=3:

- Anna reverses one number.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers, adding their concatenation back to the list.

- Now, there are two numbers: the new concatenated one and the remaining one.

- Anna reverses one of these two.

- Sasha concatenates the two remaining numbers.

- The final number is this concatenation.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the winner without simulating all moves.

Let me think about the parity of n.

Each time Sasha moves, he reduces the list size by one.

Anna's moves don't change the list size.

The game ends when there's only one number left.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is n-1.

Anna's moves are interleaved with Sasha's moves, but she has one more move if n is even.

Wait, let's think in terms of total moves.

Starting with n numbers.

Each Sasha's move reduces the list by one.

So, Sasha will make n-1 moves.

Anna makes moves in between.

Wait, but Anna moves first, then Sasha, then Anna, then Sasha, and so on.

The game ends after Sasha's last move, which is the (n-1)-th move.

Wait, no.

Wait, with n=2:

- Anna moves (reverses one number), list is still 2 numbers.

- Sasha moves (concatenates two numbers into one), list is now 1 number.

- Game ends.

Total moves: Anna once, Sasha once.

With n=3:

- Anna moves (reverses one number), list is still 3 numbers.

- Sasha moves (concatenates two numbers into one), list is now 2 numbers.

- Anna moves (reverses one number), list is still 2 numbers.

- Sasha moves (concatenates two numbers into one), list is now 1 number.

- Game ends.

Total moves: Anna twice, Sasha twice.

Wait, in general, for n elements:

- Anna makes k moves, where k is equal to the number of Sasha's moves plus one, since she moves first and the game ends after Sasha's last move.

Wait, more carefully:

- Anna moves first.

- Then Sasha moves.

- Then Anna moves again.

- And so on, until Sasha's last move.

- The game ends after Sasha's (n-1)-th move.

So, Anna makes n-1 moves, and Sasha makes n-1 moves.

Wait, no.

Wait, with n=2:

- Anna moves once.

- Sasha moves once.

- Total moves: Anna 1, Sasha 1.

With n=3:

- Anna moves once.

- Sasha moves once.

- Anna moves again.

- Sasha moves again.

- Total moves: Anna 2, Sasha 2.

Wait, in general, it seems that Anna makes n-1 moves, and Sasha makes n-1 moves.

Wait, but with n=1:

- Anna moves once.

- Game ends.

So, number of Anna's moves is n, and Sasha's moves are n-1.

Wait, n=1: Anna 1, Sasha 0.

n=2: Anna 1, Sasha 1.

n=3: Anna 2, Sasha 2.

So, in general, Anna makes ceil(n/2) moves, and Sasha makes floor(n/2) moves.

Wait, no, from above, with n=1: Anna 1.

n=2: Anna 1.

n=3: Anna 2.

n=4: Anna 2.

Wait, seems like Anna makes ceil(n/2) moves.

But perhaps I'm getting side-tracked.

I need to find a way to determine the final number's value after all moves.

Given that Anna can choose which numbers to reverse, and Sasha can choose the order of concatenation, I need to consider their optimal choices.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse any subset of the numbers, and Sasha can arrange their concatenation order to maximize the final number.

But Anna wants to minimize the final number.

So, it's a minimax problem.

Anna chooses which numbers to reverse to minimize the maximum number Sasha can achieve by arranging the concatenations.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can consider that reversing a number is equivalent to choosing between the original and the reversed version of each number, and Sasha will arrange them in the best possible order to maximize the final number.

Anna wants to choose the reversals to minimize this maximum.

This still seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think of it as Anna choosing for each number whether to use it original or reversed, and Sasha arranging them in the best order.

Given that, the problem reduces to Anna choosing a version (original or reversed) for each number, and Sasha arranging them to form the largest possible number.

Anna wants to choose the versions such that, no matter how Sasha arranges them, the number is less than 10^m.

Or, more precisely, Anna wants to minimize the maximum number Sasha can achieve.

This is still complicated.

Let me consider that Anna can choose for each number whether to reverse it or not, and Sasha can arrange them in any order to form the largest possible number.

So, for each possible subset of numbers that Anna chooses to reverse, Sasha will arrange them in descending order to maximize the final number.

Anna needs to choose the reversals such that the maximum number Sasha can achieve is less than 10^m.

Wait, but Anna doesn't know in advance how Sasha will arrange them, but she can anticipate that Sasha will arrange them optimally.

So, Anna needs to choose the reversals such that even with the best arrangement by Sasha, the number is less than 10^m.

This seems too restrictive for Anna.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose the reversals to minimize the maximum possible number Sasha can achieve.

But determining the exact value seems difficult.

Maybe I can look for a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of digits in the final number.

Each concatenation combines two numbers into one, reducing the count by one.

Eventually, only one number remains.

The length of this number could give an idea of its value.

If the total number of digits in all numbers is less than m, then the final number is less than 10^m, and Anna wins.

But wait, if the sum of the lengths of all numbers is less than m, then indeed the final number is less than 10^m.

But if the sum is equal to or greater than m, Sasha might be able to arrange them to make the number at least 10^m.

Wait, but this might not always be the case.

For example, if all numbers are small, even if the total number of digits is m, the actual value might be less than 10^m.

Wait, no, if the total number of digits is less than m, the number is less than 10^m.

If the total number of digits is equal to m, the number could be less than or equal to 10^m, depending on the digits.

If the total number of digits is greater than m, the number is at least 10^m.

Wait, 10^m has m zeros following a 1, so it has m+1 digits.

Wait, 10^m is the smallest number with m+1 digits.

So, if the final number has more than m digits, it's at least 10^m.

If it has m digits, it could be less than 10^m.

Wait, but in programming terms, 10^m is a number with m zeros following a 1.

So, if the final number is greater than or equal to 10^m, Sasha wins.

So, if the final number has more than m digits, it's definitely greater than or equal to 10^m.

If it has m digits, it could be less than or equal to 10^m, depending on the digits.

Wait, but 10^m has m zeros and a 1 at the front.

Wait, for example, 10^2 is 100, which has 3 digits.

So, in general, 10^m has m+1 digits.

Wait, no, 10^m has m zeros and a 1, so it has m+1 digits.

Wait, but in the problem, it's 10^m, which is 1 followed by m zeros.

So, it has m+1 digits if m >= 1.

But 10^0 is 1, which has 1 digit.

Wait, I need to be careful.

But for m=0, 10^0=1, so any number >=1 means Sasha wins.

For m=1, 10^1=10, which has 2 digits.

So, in general, 10^m has m+1 digits.

Therefore, if the final number has more than m digits, it's greater than or equal to 10^(m), so Sasha wins.

If it has m digits or fewer, it's less than 10^m, so Anna wins.

Wait, but this is only true if the final number is the largest possible.

But Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to make the final number smaller.

So, perhaps if Anna can arrange it so that the final number has at most m digits, she wins.

But Sasha tries to maximize the number.

So, it's a game of minimizing the maximum number.

This seems like a minimax problem.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider that Anna can choose to reverse any subset of the numbers, and Sasha will arrange them in the best possible order to maximize the final number.

Anna wants to choose the reversals such that the maximum number Sasha can achieve is less than 10^m.

Alternatively, if Anna can ensure that the final number has at most m digits, she wins.

But she has to consider that Sasha will arrange the numbers to maximize the value.

So, perhaps the key is to look at the maximum possible value Sasha can achieve for any subset of reversals by Anna.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse numbers to minimize the maximum possible concatenation.

But I need a better approach.

Let me think about the game in terms of who has the controlling move.

Since Anna moves first and can reverse one number, and Sasha then concatenates two numbers, perhaps the parity of n plays a role.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me consider small values of n.

For n=1:

- Anna reverses the single number.

- If the reversed number is >=10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

This is straightforward.

For n=2:

- Anna reverses one number.

- Sasha concatenates the two numbers in the best possible order to maximize the final number.

- If the maximum possible concatenation is >=10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

So, Anna chooses which number to reverse to minimize the maximum concatenation.

This seems manageable for small n, but for larger n, it's not practical.

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^5, which is too large for any naive approach.

So, I need a smarter way to determine the winner without simulating the game.

Perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse any subset of the numbers, and Sasha arranges them to form the largest possible number.

Anna wants to minimize that largest possible number.

This sounds like Anna is choosing a configuration of the numbers (original or reversed), and Sasha is arranging them in the best order to maximize the number.

Anna wants to choose the configurations such that the maximum number Sasha can achieve is less than 10^m.

Alternatively, if Anna can ensure that no matter how Sasha arranges them, the number is less than 10^m, she wins.

But this seems too restrictive.

Perhaps instead, I can think in terms of the minimal maximum number that Anna can achieve.

But this is getting too abstract.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Anna reverses some numbers, and Sasha arranges them in descending order to maximize the final number.

So, Anna needs to choose which numbers to reverse to minimize this maximum possible number.

But even then, it's not clear how to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse numbers to make the largest possible arrangement less than 10^m.

To do this, she needs to ensure that the arrangement of the numbers, after choosing which to reverse, results in a number less than 10^m.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me consider that the final number's value depends on the order of concatenation and which numbers are reversed.

Anna wants the final number to be less than 10^m, and Sasha wants it to be at least 10^m.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the minimal maximum number that Anna can achieve and compare it to 10^m.

But this seems computationally intensive.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that Anna can choose to reverse any subset of the numbers, and Sasha arranges them in the best order.

So, Anna wants to choose the reversals such that the maximum possible arrangement is less than 10^m.

Alternatively, Anna wants to ensure that the final number is less than 10^m, regardless of Sasha's arrangement.

But this is too strong; perhaps there's a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the sum of the lengths of the numbers.

If the sum of the lengths of all numbers is less than or equal to m, then the final number is less than 10^m, and Anna wins.

But this isn't always true, because if the sum of lengths equals m, the number could still be >=10^m depending on the digits.

For example, if all numbers are 9's, even with sum of lengths equal to m, the number could be >=10^m.

Wait, no.

Wait, 10^m has m zeros following a 1, so it's the smallest number with m+1 digits.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me clarify:

- 10^m has m+1 digits if m >= 1.

- For m=0, 10^0=1, which has 1 digit.

So, if the final number has more than m digits, it's >=10^m, and Sasha wins.

If it has m digits or fewer, it's <10^m, and Anna wins.

Wait, but if m=0, 10^0=1, so any number <10^0=1 would be 0, but since all a_i >=1, the smallest possible number is 1, which is equal to 10^0, so Sasha wins.

Wait, but a_i >=1, so the smallest possible final number is 1, which is equal to 10^0.

So, for m=0, Sasha always wins.

Wait, but according to the problem, a_i >=1, so the smallest possible final number is 1, which is equal to 10^0.

Hence, for m=0, Sasha always wins.

For m>=1, it depends on the number of digits in the final number.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of digits in the final number.

Let me think about it.

Each number has a certain number of digits.

When Sasha concatenates two numbers, he adds their digits together.

So, the total number of digits in the final number is the sum of the digits of all the numbers.

Wait, but that's only if Sasha concatenates in a way that preserves the total number of digits.

Wait, no, concatenating two numbers always combines their digits without loss.

So, the total number of digits in the final number is the sum of the digits of all individual numbers.

Wait, but that's only if no leading zeros are removed.

But in this problem, when Anna reverses a number, leading zeros are removed.

So, reversing a number can change its number of digits.

Wait, yes, reversing a number and removing leading zeros can make it shorter.

So, the number of digits in the final number depends on which numbers Anna chooses to reverse.

So, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to make them shorter, thereby reducing the total number of digits in the final number.

Sasha, on the other hand, wants to maximize the final number, but since Anna chooses the reversals, he has to work with whatever Anna chooses.

Wait, but Anna chooses which numbers to reverse, and reversing a number can make it shorter or longer.

Wait, no, reversing a number can make it shorter if it had leading zeros, but in this problem, all a_i >=1, so no leading zeros to begin with.

Wait, but after reversing, if the number has leading zeros, they are removed.

But since all a_i >=1, reversing them won't introduce leading zeros.

For example, 10 reversed is 01, but leading zeros are removed, so it becomes 1.

So, reversing some numbers can make them shorter.

Anna can choose to reverse numbers to minimize the total number of digits in the final number.

Sasha wants to maximize the final number, but since Anna can make some numbers shorter, it affects the total number of digits.

So, Anna's goal is to minimize the total number of digits in the final number, and if it's <=m, she wins.

Sasha wants the final number to have >m digits.

Wait, but actually, Sasha wants the final number to be >=10^m.

Given that, if the final number has more than m digits, it's >=10^m, and Sasha wins.

If it has m digits or fewer, it's <10^m, and Anna wins.

So, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to make them shorter, thereby reducing the total number of digits in the final number.

Sasha wants to maximize the number, but Anna gets to choose the reversals.

So, Anna wants to choose the reversals such that the total number of digits in the final number is <=m.

Wait, but it's not just about the total number of digits; the actual value matters.

For example, even if the total number of digits is equal to m, if the number is >=10^m, Sasha wins.

So, Anna needs to ensure that the final number has fewer than m digits or, if it has m digits, that it's less than 10^m.

But 10^m is the smallest number with m+1 digits.

Wait, m+1 digits for m >=1.

For m=0, 10^0=1, which has 1 digit.

So, in general:

- If the final number has more than m digits, Sasha wins.

- If it has m digits and is >=10^m, Sasha wins.

- Otherwise, Anna wins.

But Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to make them shorter, thereby reducing the total number of digits.

So, the key is to find the minimal total number of digits Anna can achieve by reversing some numbers.

Then, compare that to m.

Wait, but it's not just about the total number of digits; the actual value matters in cases where the total number of digits equals m.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should consider that Anna can choose to reverse any subset of the numbers, and the total number of digits in the final number is the sum of the digits of the chosen configurations.

Anna wants this sum to be <=m, or if sum equals m, the number should be <10^m.

But determining the exact value is tricky.

Perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse numbers to minimize the total number of digits, and if that's <=m, she wins.

Otherwise, Sasha wins.

But this might not always be the case, because even with minimal total digits, the number could be >=10^m.

So, perhaps I need to compute the minimal total digits and see if it's less than m, or if it's equal to m, check if the minimal possible number is less than 10^m.

But this seems too involved.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first test case:

2 2

14 2

Anna can reverse one number.

Options:

- Reverse 14 to 41, then Sasha concatenates 41 and 2 in either order: 412 or 241, both have 3 digits, which is more than m=2, so Sasha wins.

- Reverse 2 to 2, which is the same, so concatenates 14 and 2 to make 142 or 214, both have 3 digits, Sasha wins.

So, no matter what Anna does, Sasha wins.

Second test case:

3 5

9 56 1

Anna reverses one number.

Options:

- Reverse 9 to 9, then Sasha concatenates two numbers. For example, concatenate 9 and 56 to make 956, then Anna reverses one number, say reverse 1 to 1, then Sasha concatenates 956 and 1 to make 9561, which has 4 digits, less than m=5, so Anna wins.

- Other choices lead to similar results, but Anna can make sure the final number has <=5 digits, so she wins.

Third test case:

4 10

1 2007 800 1580

Anna reverses one number.

Then Sasha concatenates two, reducing to three, Anna reverses one, Sasha concatenates two, reducing to one.

The final number's digit sum needs to be <=10 for Anna to win.

But in this case, it's possible to have a final number with <=10 digits, so Anna wins.

Looking at the sample outputs:

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Anna

Anna

Sasha

So, in some cases Sasha wins, in others Anna wins.

But I need a general approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse numbers to minimize the total number of digits in the final number.

If the minimal total digits are <=m, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me define for each number a_i:

- Original number has len(str(a_i)) digits.

- Reversed number has len(str(int(str(a_i)[::-1]))) digits, since leading zeros are removed.

So, for each number, Anna can choose between two possible digit lengths.

She wants to choose for each number the option that minimizes the total digit sum.

Then, if the minimal total digit sum is <=m, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

But wait, even if the total digit sum is <=m, if the actual number is >=10^m, Sasha wins.

So, I need to consider not just the sum of digits but also the actual value.

This complicates things.

Perhaps I can consider that if the minimal total digit sum is <m, Anna wins.

If it's equal to m, I need to check if the minimal possible number is <10^m.

If it is, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

If the minimal total digit sum is >m, Sasha wins.

This seems plausible.

So, the approach would be:

1. For each number a_i, compute the original digit length and the reversed digit length.

2. For each number, choose the minimum of these two lengths.

3. Sum these minimal lengths over all numbers.

4. If this sum is less than m, Anna wins.

5. If the sum equals m, check if the minimal possible number is less than 10^m. If yes, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

6. If the sum is greater than m, Sasha wins.

But I need to verify this logic.

Let's consider the first test case:

n=2, m=2

Numbers: 14, 2

For 14:

- Original: 2 digits

- Reversed: 41, 2 digits

For 2:

- Original: 1 digit

- Reversed: 2, 1 digit

Minimal lengths: 2 and 1, sum=3 >2, so Sasha wins.

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=3, m=5

Numbers: 9,56,1

For 9:

- Original: 1 digit

- Reversed: 9, 1 digit

For 56:

- Original: 2 digits

- Reversed: 65, 2 digits

For 1:

- Original: 1 digit

- Reversed: 1, 1 digit

Minimal lengths: 1,2,1, sum=4 <5, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

n=4, m=10

Numbers:1,2007,800,1580

Minimal lengths:

1:1

2007:4

800:3

1580:4

Sum=1+4+3+4=12 >10, so Sasha wins.

Wait, but the sample output is "Anna".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to make their digit lengths shorter.

For 1: original 1, reversed 1, both 1 digit.

For 2007: original 4, reversed 7002, which is 4 digits.

For 800: original 3, reversed 008, which is 1 digit (leading zeros removed).

For 1580: original 4, reversed 0851, which is 3 digits.

So, Anna can choose to reverse 800 to make it 1 digit and reverse 1580 to make it 3 digits.

So, total digits:1 (1)+4 (2007)+1 (reversed 800)+3 (reversed 1580)=9 <10, so Anna wins.

Yes, that matches the sample output.

So, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to minimize the total digit sum.

Hence, the approach should be:

For each number, find the minimal digit length between original and reversed.

Sum these minimal lengths.

If the sum <m, Anna wins.

If sum >m, Sasha wins.

If sum ==m, check if the minimal possible number is <10^m. If yes, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

But in the case where sum==m, I need to ensure that the minimal possible number is less than 10^m.

Wait, but if sum==m, and the minimal possible number is less than 10^m, Anna wins; otherwise, Sasha wins.

But constructing the minimal possible number is still complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal possible number is obtained by arranging the numbers in ascending order, after choosing their configurations (original or reversed).

Anna wants this minimal number to be less than 10^m.

So, she chooses the configurations to minimize the number, and Sasha arranges them in ascending order to minimize the number.

Wait, but Sasha wants to maximize the number, but since Anna chooses the configurations, she can choose them in a way that even with Sasha's arrangement, the number is less than 10^m.

This is getting too involved.

Perhaps I can consider that if the sum of the minimal digits is less than m, Anna wins.

If sum equals m, Anna can choose configurations such that the number is less than 10^m, otherwise Sasha wins.

But determining whether the minimal number is less than 10^m seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimal possible number and compare it to 10^m.

But with n up to 2*10^5, this would be too slow.

So, perhaps the initial approach in the code is trying to construct such a minimal number.

But looking back at the code, it seems flawed.

In the code:

- It reverses each number and checks if the length remains the same.

- If yes, appends the original number to rev_res.

- If not, appends the reversed number to rev_val.

- Then sorts rev_val and alternates between converting even-indexed elements to int and adding them to rev_res, and for odd-indexed elements, reversing them again before adding.

This seems incorrect because it doesn't properly model the game or the optimal strategies.

Given the time constraints, I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Anna can choose to reverse numbers to minimize the total digit sum.

If the total digit sum is less than m, Anna wins.

If it's equal to m, Anna can choose configurations such that the number is less than 10^m.

If it's greater than m, Sasha wins.

So, in code, for each number, choose the minimal digit length between original and reversed, sum them up.

If sum <m, Anna wins.

If sum >m, Sasha wins.

If sum ==m, check if the minimal possible number is less than 10^m.

To check the minimal possible number when sum==m:

- Anna chooses for each number whether to reverse it or not.

- Then, arrange them in ascending order to form the smallest possible number.

- If this number <10^m, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

But implementing this for large n is inefficient.

Perhaps I can optimize it.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, for each number, store the original and reversed versions, with their digit lengths.

Then, choose for each number the version with the smaller digit length.

Sum these minimal lengths.

If sum <m, Anna wins.

If sum >m, Sasha wins.

If sum ==m, choose for each number the version that makes the number as small as possible, then arrange them in ascending order to form the minimal number, and compare it to 10^m.

If it's less, Anna wins; else, Sasha wins.

This seems correct.

Now, let's see if this matches the sample inputs.

First test case:

n=2, m=2

Numbers:14,2

Original lengths:2,1

Reversed:2,1

Minimal lengths:2,1 sum=3 >2, so Sasha wins.

Second test case:

n=3, m=5

Numbers:9,56,1

Original lengths:1,2,1

Reversed:1,2,1

Sum=1+2+1=4 <5, Anna wins.

Third test case:

n=4, m=10

Numbers:1,2007,800,1580

Original lengths:1,4,3,4

Reversed:1,4,1,3

Minimal lengths:1,4,1,3 sum=9 <10, Anna wins.

Fourth test case:

n=4, m=5

Numbers:5000,123,30,4

Original lengths:4,3,2,1

Reversed:4,3,1,1

Minimal lengths:4,3,1,1 sum=9 >5, Sasha wins.

Fifth test case:

n=10, m=10

Numbers:6,4,6,2,3,1,10,9,10,7

Original lengths:1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1

Reversed:1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1

Sum=1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+2+1=11 >10, Sasha wins.

Wait, but the sample output is "Sasha", but according to this, sum=11>10, Sasha wins.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "Sasha", which matches.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "Sasha", but according to this, sum=11>10, Sasha wins.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "Sasha", which matches.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "Sasha", but according to this, sum=11>10, Sasha wins.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's "10 10" and the numbers are 6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7.

Sum of minimal lengths is 1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+2+1=11 >10, so Sasha wins.

Which matches the sample output "Sasha".

Sixth test case:

n=1, m=1

Number:6

Original length:1

Reversed:1

Sum=1 ==1, need to check if minimal number <10^1=10.

Minimal number is min(6,6)=6 <10, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output "Anna".

Seventh test case:

n=1, m=1

Number:10

Original length:2

Reversed:1, length 1

Minimal length:1 <1, but wait, m=1, sum=1 ==1.

Need to check if minimal number <10^1=10.

Minimal number is min(10,01=1)=1 <10, so Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output "Anna".

Eighth test case:

n=8, m=9

Numbers:1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2

Original lengths:1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1 sum=1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=10 >9, Sasha wins.

But sample output is "Anna", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let's see:

For each number:

1: original 1, reversed 1, both length 1.

2: original 1, reversed 1, both length 1.

9: original 1, reversed 1, both length 1.

10: original 2, reversed 01=1, length 1.

10: original 2, reversed 01=1, length 1.

2: original 1, reversed 1, both length 1.

10: original 2, reversed 01=1, length 1.

2: original 1, reversed 1, both length 1.

So, minimal lengths:1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 sum=8 <9, Anna wins.

Wait, but sample output is "Anna", which matches.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Sum=8 <9, Anna wins.

Ninth test case:

n=4, m=5

Numbers:10,10,10,10

Original lengths:2,2,2,2

Reversed:01=1,1,01=1,1 lengths:1,1,1,1

Sum=1+1+1+1=4 <5, Anna wins.

But sample output is "Sasha", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, sum=4 <5, Anna wins, but sample output is "Sasha".

Wait, perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, for numbers:10,10,10,10

Original lengths:2,2,2,2

Reversed:1,1,1,1

Minimal lengths:1,1,1,1 sum=4 <5, Anna wins.

But sample output is "Sasha", which doesn't match.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps in this case, even though the sum is 4, which is less than m=5, the minimal number could still be >=10^5=100000, which has 6 digits.

Wait, 10^5=100000, which is 6 digits.

But our sum is 4 digits, which is less than 6 digits, so it should be less than 10^5.

Hence, Anna wins.

But the sample output is "Sasha", which suggests that in this case, Sasha wins.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, 10^5 is 100000, which is 6 digits.

If the final number has 4 digits, it's less than 100000.

But according to the sample output, Sasha wins.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output or in my understanding.

Wait, m=5, 10^5=100000, which is 6 digits.

If the final number has 4 digits, it's less than 100000, so Anna wins.

But the sample output is "Sasha", which suggests that in this case, Sasha wins.

Wait
