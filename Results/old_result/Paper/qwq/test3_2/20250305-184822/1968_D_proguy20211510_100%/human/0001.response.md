Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Bodya and Sasha, who are playing a game with a permutation and an array. They start at certain positions in the permutation and make moves for a fixed number of turns. Each turn, they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation, and they gain points based on the array value at their current position. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores after a fixed number of turns.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. Both players make moves simultaneously, and each turn consists of two parts: gaining points based on their current position and then choosing to stay or move to another position as defined by the permutation.

Given that they make moves simultaneously, their choices don't affect each other directly. Each player's strategy is independent of the other's moves. So, I can consider each player's path separately and then compare their maximum possible scores.

The problem is to determine who wins if both players play optimally, meaning they both try to maximize their own scores.

Let's look at the input format. Each testcase starts with four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. n is the length of the permutation and the array, k is the number of turns, and P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

Then, there's the permutation p, which is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n, and all are distinct. Following that is the array a, which contains n integers representing the points that each position holds.

The first thing I need to do is to model the game for each player. Since both players make moves independently, I can model their paths separately.

Each player has a current position, and each turn, they can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation p.

So, for each player, at each turn, they have two choices: stay or move.

But since they make this choice simultaneously and independently, I need to find the optimal path for each player that maximizes their score over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each player, I need to keep track of their position and the turn number, and compute the maximum score they can achieve from that state.

However, given the constraints, n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, so a straightforward DP approach would be too slow because it would be O(n*k), which is not feasible for large n and k.

I need a smarter way to model this.

Let me think about the permutation p. Since p is a permutation, it forms a collection of cycles. In permutation theory, any permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles.

For example, if p = [2, 1, 4, 3], then there are two cycles: 1 -> 2 -> 1 and 3 -> 4 -> 3.

This cycle structure is important because if a player moves according to p, they will eventually get stuck in a cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can model the path of each player as a sequence of positions where they either stay or move according to p.

But considering that k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the maximum score efficiently, possibly in logarithmic time or better.

Let me consider the possible paths for each player.

At each turn, the player can choose to stay or move. If they stay, their position remains the same, and they gain a_x points. If they move, they go to p_x and gain a_{p_x} points, but actually, since they gain points based on the current position before moving, it's a bit different.

Wait, let's read the problem statement again carefully.

"On each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, the scoring happens before the move. So, in each turn, the player is at some position x, scores a_x, and then chooses to stay at x or move to p_x.

Therefore, in the next turn, their position is either x (if they stayed) or p_x (if they moved).

This is a Markov decision process, where each state is the current position, and at each step, they choose to stay or move.

Given that, to find the optimal path for each player, I need to find a sequence of choices (stay or move) over k turns that maximizes their total score.

Given the large constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider modeling the possible paths for each player.

Since the permutation forms cycles, if a player keeps moving, they will cycle through the cycle they are in.

But they can choose to stay at any point, which breaks the cycle.

So, perhaps I can find the cycle that each player is in and then compute the optimal way to stay or move within that cycle.

Wait, but they can choose to stay at any time, so it's not just about the cycle; they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider a single player. They start at position x. Each turn, they can choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

If they stay, their position remains x, and they score a_x.

If they move, their position becomes p_x, and in the next turn, they can choose to stay at p_x or move to p_{p_x}, and so on.

So, their path is a sequence of positions where at each step, they choose to stay or move.

Given that, the path can be represented as a sequence of positions where some positions are repeated if they choose to stay.

But with k up to 1e9, it's impossible to simulate each turn individually.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that if a player keeps moving, they will eventually enter a cycle.

But they can choose to stay at any position, which allows them to accumulate additional points.

So, perhaps I can find the cycle that the player is in if they keep moving, and then consider the points they can accumulate by staying at certain positions along the way.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there is an edge from x to p_x.

Since p is a permutation, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Within each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position or move along the cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can compute, for each cycle, the maximum score a player can achieve in k steps.

But since k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, if a player keeps moving, they will return to the starting position after m steps.

But they can choose to stay at any position, which effectively allows them to loop around the cycle and accumulate additional points.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the cycle and the path leading up to the cycle.

First, I need to find the cycle that each player is in.

But actually, in a permutation, every element is part of exactly one cycle.

So, for each player, I can find their cycle and then compute the optimal way to stay or move within that cycle.

But I need to consider that they can choose to stay at any position, which allows them to accumulate extra points at those positions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that once a player enters a cycle, their path repeats every m steps, where m is the cycle length.

But because they can choose to stay, they can accumulate additional points by staying at certain positions.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and try to compute their maximum possible score in k steps.

At each step, they have two choices: stay or move.

This sounds like a binary decision tree with depth k.

But with k up to 1e9, that's not feasible.

I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the maximum score efficiently.

Let me consider that if a player keeps moving, they will traverse the permutation cycle.

But if they choose to stay at some position, they can accumulate additional points.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

For a player starting at position x, their path can be represented as a sequence of positions: x, p_x, p_{p_x}, ..., up to k steps.

But since at each step, they can choose to stay or move, their actual path can be any subsequence of this sequence, where they may repeat positions by staying.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the player's position at step t depends on their decisions in previous steps.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the player's score is the sum of a_{x_t} over k steps, where x_t is their position at step t.

Their position at step t is determined by their decisions to stay or move at each previous step.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.

Let me define dp[t][x] as the maximum score achievable after t steps, starting from position x.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the permutation p defines a directed graph where each node has out-degree 1.

Since p is a permutation, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

In such a graph, if a player keeps moving, they will eventually enter a cycle and loop forever.

But they can choose to stay at any position, which allows them to accumulate additional points.

Perhaps I can find the maximum score by considering the cycle and the paths leading to it.

Wait, but in this case, since they can choose to stay at any time, it's not just about the cycle; they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle.

Let me try to think in terms of the cycle and the scores.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m.

If they keep moving, they will cycle through the cycle, scoring the sum of the cycle's a values every m steps.

But they can choose to stay at any position, effectively allowing them to score additional a_x at those positions.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a_x in the cycle, repeatedly.

Wait, but they can stay at any position, not just one.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a_x as many times as possible.

But they have to move along the cycle at some points to get back to that position.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times, but they have to respect the cycle structure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

For a cycle of length m, with positions c1, c2, ..., cm, and corresponding a values a1, a2, ..., am.

The player can choose, in each step, to stay or move, so their path is a sequence of positions where they can repeat positions by staying.

Given that, in k steps, they can choose to stay at certain positions multiple times.

This seems too vague to model directly.

Let me consider that if a player stays at a position, they accumulate a_x points without moving, and if they move, they accumulate a_x points and then move to p_x.

So, in terms of scoring, staying at x gives them a_x, and moving gives them a_x plus moving to p_x.

Wait, no: moving means they score a_x and then move to p_x.

Staying means they score a_x and stay at x.

So, in both cases, they score a_x, but moving changes their position to p_x, while staying keeps them at x.

Given that, perhaps the decision at each step is whether to stay or move, but in either case, they score a_x.

Wait, but moving involves scoring a_x and then moving to p_x, whereas staying involves scoring a_x and staying at x.

So, in terms of total score, it's about choosing, at each step, whether to stay and score a_x again, or to move and score a_x but then be at p_x in the next step.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a_x for as many steps as possible.

But in a cycle, they can choose to stay or move at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the average score per cycle.

If a player is in a cycle, their average score per step is the sum of a_x over the cycle divided by the cycle length.

But since they can choose to stay at any position, they can increase their average score by staying at positions with higher a_x.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position.

I need to find the maximum possible score they can achieve in k steps, given that at each step, they can choose to stay or move.

Let me try to model this as a graph where each node represents a position, and there is an edge from x to x (staying) and from x to p_x (moving).

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible sum of a_x over a path of length k in this graph.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can find the structure of the graph and exploit it.

Given that p is a permutation, the graph consists of cycles where each node has exactly one outgoing edge (to p_x) and one incoming edge (from the node that maps to x).

But in this graph, each node also has a loop (staying), so it's a graph with cycles and self-loops.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Let me consider that in such a graph, the player can choose to stay or move at each step, so their path can be any sequence of choices of stay or move.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a weighted graph where the weight of each edge is a_x, and I need to find the path with the maximum total weight in k steps.

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times, but they can also choose to move along the cycle.

Perhaps I can compute the maximum possible score by considering the cycle and the possibility of staying at certain positions.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the cycle's a sum and the possibility of staying.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m, with positions c1, c2, ..., cm, and corresponding a values a1, a2, ..., am.

If the player keeps moving, they will cycle through the cycle, scoring sum(a1 to am) every m steps.

But they can choose to stay at any position, which allows them to score additional a_x at those positions.

So, in k steps, they can choose to stay at certain positions, effectively adding extra a_x for those stays.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me consider that in k steps, the player can choose to stay at certain positions, and move at others.

Each time they stay, they score a_x without changing position.

Each time they move, they score a_x and then move to p_x.

So, their path can be represented as a sequence of positions where they may repeat positions by staying.

This is getting too complicated to model directly.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position.

I can compute the maximum possible score they can achieve in k steps by considering that they can choose to stay or move at each step.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.

Let me define dp[t][x] as the maximum score achievable after t steps, starting from position x.

The recurrence would be:

dp[t][x] = a_x + max(dp[t-1][x], dp[t-1][prev_x])

where prev_x is the position that maps to x (since if they move from prev_x to x, they score a_x).

But in a permutation, each x has exactly one prev_x, except for the starting position.

This seems messy, and with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, it's not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay or move at each step, and I need to maximize the sum of a_x over k steps.

Perhaps I can model this as a binary decision at each step: stay or move.

But with k up to 1e9, I can't simulate it.

I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Let me consider that if a player keeps moving, they will traverse the cycle, scoring the sum of the cycle's a values every m steps.

But they can choose to stay at any position to accumulate additional a_x.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

Wait, but they have to move along the cycle to get back to that position.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times, but they have to move to progress in the cycle.

This is still too vague.

Let me try to think about the cycle and the scores.

Suppose a cycle has positions c1, c2, ..., cm with a values a1, a2, ..., am.

If the player keeps moving, they score sum(a1 to am) every m steps.

But they can choose to stay at any position, which allows them to score additional a_x.

So, in k steps, they can choose to stay at certain positions, effectively adding extra a_x for those stays.

But how to maximize this?

Wait, perhaps I can compute the maximum possible score by considering that in k steps, they can choose to stay at the position with the highest a_x as many times as possible, while moving when necessary to return to that position.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Let me find the position in the cycle with the highest a_x, say max_a.

Then, in k steps, the player can choose to stay at this position as much as possible.

But to return to this position, they have to follow the cycle.

So, the number of times they can stay at this position is floor(k / cycle_length), assuming the cycle_length divides k.

But cycles may not divide k evenly, so I need to handle the remainder steps.

Wait, perhaps I can compute how many full cycles they can complete in k steps and add the corresponding score, then handle the remaining steps.

But this seems too simplistic, as they can choose to stay at other positions as well.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times, but they have to move along the cycle at some points.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position.

I can model their possible positions over time.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

Let me consider that the player's position at step t depends on their decisions in previous steps.

This is too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a finite automaton, where the states are the positions, and the transitions are stay or move.

But again, with n up to 2e5, this is not feasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay or move at each step, and I need to maximize the sum of a_x over k steps.

Perhaps I can find the position with the highest a_x in the cycle and choose to stay there as much as possible.

But to get back to that position, they have to follow the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the cycle and find the position with the highest a_x, then compute how many times they can return to that position in k steps.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of the number of times they can visit each position in the cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum possible score by considering the cycle and the possibility of staying at certain positions.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some insight.

Looking at the first sample input:

4 2 3 2

4 1 2 3

7 2 5 6

So, n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

From the explanation, Bodya starts at 3, scores 5, stays at 3, scores another 5, total 10.

Sasha starts at 2, moves to 1, scores 2 + 7 = 9.

Bodya's score is higher, so Bodya wins.

So, in this case, Bodya chose to stay at position 3 both times, accumulating a_x=5 each time.

Sasha chose to move from 2 to 1, then stay at 1, accumulating a_x=2 + a_x=7 = 9.

But Sasha could have chosen to stay at 2 both times, accumulating a_x=2 + a_x=2 = 4, which is worse.

So, Sasha's best strategy is to move to 1 and stay there, scoring 2 + 7 = 9.

Bodya's best strategy is to stay at 3 both times, scoring 5 + 5 = 10.

Hence, Bodya wins.

So, in this case, it seems that staying at the position with the highest a_x is the optimal strategy.

But in cycles, it might be different.

Wait, in this example, the cycle is 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4.

It's a single cycle of length 4.

Bodya starts at 3, can choose to stay or move.

If he moves, he goes to 2, then to 1, and so on.

But in this case, staying at 3 is better than moving to 2.

Similarly, Sasha starts at 2, and moving to 1 gives him a higher score than staying at 2.

Hence, the optimal strategy seems to be to stay at the position with the highest a_x in the cycle.

In Bodya's case, position 3 has a_x=5, and position 2 has a_x=2, position 1 has a_x=7, position 4 has a_x=6.

So, in the cycle, position 1 has the highest a_x=7.

But Bodya can only reach position 1 by moving through position 2.

But in k=2 steps, he can't reach position 1 from position 3.

Wait, let's see:

From position 3, moving to 2, then to 1.

But in k=2 steps, starting from 3:

- Stay at 3 both times: score 5 + 5 = 10

- Move to 2 first step, then stay at 2: score 5 (first step) + 2 (second step) = 7

- Move to 2 first step, then move to 1: score 5 (first step) + 2 (second step moving to 1) = 7

- But according to the explanation, Sasha moves from 2 to 1 and stays at 1, scoring 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, but Bodya can't reach position 1 in k=2 steps from position 3.

Because:

Step 1: stay at 3, score 5

Step 2: move to 2, score 5 + 2 = 7

Or

Step 1: move to 2, score 5

Step 2: move to 1, score 5 + 2 = 7

Or

Step 1: move to 2, score 5

Step 2: stay at 2, score 5 + 2 = 7

So, Bodya's maximum score is 10 by staying at 3 both times.

Sasha starts at 2.

Option 1: stay at 2 both times, score 2 + 2 = 4

Option 2: move to 1 first step, stay at 1 second step, score 2 + 7 = 9

Option 3: move to 1 first step, move to 4 second step, score 2 + 7 = 9

Hence, Sasha's maximum score is 9.

Therefore, Bodya wins with 10 vs Sasha's 9.

So, in this case, the optimal strategy for Bodya is to stay at position 3, which has a_x=5, repeating it k times.

For Sasha, the optimal strategy is to move to position 1, which has a_x=7, and stay there for the remaining steps.

Hence, in cycles, the optimal strategy seems to be to reach the position with the highest a_x in the cycle and stay there for as many steps as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can model the maximum score for each player as follows:

- Find the cycle that the player is in.

- Find the position in the cycle with the highest a_x.

- Compute the maximum score by staying at that position as much as possible in k steps.

But, to reach that position, the player may need to move through other positions.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the distance from the starting position to the position with the highest a_x in the cycle.

Then, the player can reach it in d steps, and then stay there for the remaining k - d steps, accumulating (k - d) * a_max.

But this assumes that the cycle allows reaching the maximum position and staying there.

However, in reality, the player may need to cycle through other positions to return to the maximum position.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay or move at each step.

If they choose to stay at a position, they accumulate a_x for that step.

If they choose to move, they accumulate a_x and then move to p_x.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum path sum in this graph in k steps.

But again, with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each player, their path is determined by a sequence of stay or move decisions.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a decision to stay or move.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need to find a mathematical formula or pattern that allows me to compute the maximum score efficiently.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times.

Hence, the maximum score would be achieved by staying at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

So, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the highest a_x in the cycle and then stay there for the remaining steps.

Hence, for each player, I can find the maximum a_x in their cycle and compute the score as (k - d) * max_a + sum of a_x for the path to reach the maximum position.

Here, d is the number of steps needed to reach the maximum position.

But this may not be accurate, as they might need to cycle through other positions to return to the maximum position.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the cycle and find the position with the highest a_x, then compute how many times they can visit that position in k steps.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position x.

I can simulate their path by choosing to stay or move at each step.

But with k up to 1e9, simulation is not possible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the player's path can be represented as a sequence of positions where they may repeat positions by staying.

Given that, perhaps I can group the positions into cycles and compute the maximum score based on the cycle's structure.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times.

Hence, in k steps, they can choose to stay at the position with the highest a_x floor(k / m) times, and handle the remaining steps accordingly.

But this is still not precise.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming, but optimize it for large k.

Perhaps I can find a repeating pattern in the cycle and compute the score based on that pattern repeating floor(k / pattern_length) times, plus the remaining steps.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position, which effectively allows them to insert additional stays in the cycle.

Hence, the cycle can be thought of as a loop where they can choose to stay at any position any number of times.

Given that, perhaps the maximum score is achieved by staying at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the highest a_x and then stay there for the remaining steps.

So, for each player, I can find the maximum a_x in their cycle and compute the score as (k - d) * max_a + sum of a_x for the path to reach the maximum position.

Here, d is the number of steps needed to reach the maximum position.

But in reality, the player might need to cycle through other positions to return to the maximum position.

Hence, this approach might overestimate the score.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it as a repeating cycle where the player can choose to stay at the maximum position for as many steps as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum a_x in the cycle and compute the score as ceil(k / m) * sum_a + (k % m) * max_a, where sum_a is the sum of a_x in the cycle.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position x.

I can find the cycle that x is in by following p_x until I return to x.

Then, I can represent the cycle as a list of positions.

Then, I can consider that in k steps, the player can choose to stay at any positions in the cycle any number of times.

Hence, the maximum score would be achieved by staying at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

So, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the highest a_x and then stay there for the remaining steps.

Hence, for each player, I can find the maximum a_x in their cycle, compute the distance from their starting position to that position, and then compute the score as (k - d) * max_a + sum of a_x for the path to reach the maximum position.

But I need to handle the case where d > k, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the shortest path to the maximum position and then stay there.

But in a cycle, there might be multiple paths to the maximum position.

Wait, in a cycle, from any position, there is exactly one path to any other position without repeating positions.

Hence, I can find the distance from the starting position to the maximum position in the cycle.

Then, in k steps, the player can reach the maximum position in d steps and then stay there for k - d steps.

Hence, the total score would be sum of a_x for the path to the maximum position plus (k - d) * max_a.

But I need to make sure that k - d is non-negative.

If k < d, then the player cannot reach the maximum position within k steps.

Hence, in that case, the player cannot achieve the maximum a_x in all remaining steps.

This seems a bit messy.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each player:

1. Find the cycle that their starting position is in.

2. Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a_x, say max_a.

3. Find the distance from the starting position to this position, say d.

4. If k >= d, then the player can reach the position with max_a in d steps and stay there for k - d steps, accumulating sum of a_x for the path plus (k - d) * max_a.

5. If k < d, then the player cannot reach the position with max_a, so they have to choose the best path within k steps.

This seems like a possible approach, but I need to handle it carefully.

Moreover, in the cycle, the player might be able to reach the maximum position multiple times in k steps.

Hence, perhaps I need to compute how many times they can reach the maximum position in k steps and accumulate the corresponding score.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position any number of times, which allows them to accumulate additional a_x at those positions.

Hence, the maximum score would be achieved by staying at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach that position and stay there for as many steps as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum a_x in the cycle and compute the score as ceil(k / m) * sum_a + (k % m) * max_a, where m is the cycle length and sum_a is the sum of a_x in the cycle.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position x.

I can find the cycle that x is in by following p_x until I return to x.

Then, I can represent the cycle as a list of positions: x, p_x, p_{p_x}, ..., back to x.

Let's say the cycle has length m.

Then, in k steps, the player can choose to stay or move at each step.

Given that, perhaps I can model the player's path as a sequence of positions where they can repeat positions by staying.

Hence, the total score would be the sum of a_x for each step in the sequence.

To maximize this sum, the player should stay at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the highest a_x in the cycle and then stay there for the remaining steps.

Hence, for each player, I can:

1. Find their cycle.

2. Find the position in the cycle with the highest a_x, say max_a.

3. Find the distance from the starting position to this position in the cycle, say d.

4. If k >= d, then the player can reach the position with max_a in d steps and stay there for k - d steps.

Hence, their total score would be sum of a_x for the path to the maximum position plus (k - d) * max_a.

5. If k < d, then the player cannot reach the position with max_a, so they have to choose the best path within k steps.

In this case, they can choose to stay at their starting position for k steps, accumulating k * a_x.

Alternatively, they can choose to move to other positions, but since k < d, they cannot reach the maximum position.

Hence, their maximum score would be the maximum of:

- k * a_x for the starting position.

- sum of a_x for any path they can take within k steps.

But since k < d, they cannot reach the maximum position, so their best option is to stay at the position with the highest a_x reachable within k steps.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider that in the cycle, the player can choose to stay or move at each step, so their path can be any sequence of positions where they can repeat positions by staying.

Hence, their path can be represented as a sequence of positions where they can stay at any position any number of times.

Given that, the maximum score would be achieved by staying at the position with the highest a_x as much as possible.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach that position and stay there for as many steps as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum a_x in the cycle and compute the score as ceil(k / m) * sum_a + (k % m) * max_a.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about a small example.

Consider n=3, k=5, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2, 3, 1]

a = [1, 2, 3]

So, the cycle is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

The maximum a_x in the cycle is 3.

The distance from P_B=1 to the maximum position 3 is 2 steps: 1 -> 2 -> 3.

Hence, d=2.

If k=5 >= d=2, then the player can reach position 3 in 2 steps and stay there for 3 steps, accumulating sum of a_x for the path (1 + 2) + 3 * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12.

But let's see what the actual optimal path is.

Starting at 1:

Option 1: stay at 1 for 5 steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Option 2: move to 2, stay at 2 for 4 steps: 1 (move to 2) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9

Option 3: move to 2, move to 3, stay at 3 for 3 steps: 1 (move to 2) + 2 (move to 3) + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

Option 4: move to 2, move to 3, move back to 1, etc.

But in this case, option 3 gives the highest score of 12.

Hence, the formula seems to hold: sum of a_x for the path to the maximum position (1 + 2 = 3) + (k - d) * max_a = 3 + 3 * 3 = 12.

Hence, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 2:

Distance to maximum position 3 is 1 step: 2 -> 3.

Hence, d=1.

Then, sum of a_x for the path to maximum position is 2.

Then, (k - d) = 4.

Hence, total score = 2 + 4 * 3 = 14.

But let's see:

Starting at 2:

Option 1: stay at 2 for 5 steps: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10

Option 2: move to 3, stay at 3 for 4 steps: 2 (move to 3) + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14

Hence, the formula holds.

Hence, for each player, I can compute:

- Find their cycle.

- Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a_x, say max_a.

- Find the distance from their starting position to this position in the cycle, say d.

- If k >= d, then their maximum score is sum of a_x for the path to the maximum position + (k - d) * max_a.

- If k < d, then their maximum score is the sum of a_x for the best path they can take within k steps, which would be staying at the position with the highest a_x reachable within k steps.

But in practice, since d can be up to n, which is up to 2e5, and k can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Hence, perhaps I can precompute for each player the cycle they are in, find the maximum a_x in their cycle, and find the distance from their starting position to this maximum position.

Then, use the formula above to compute their maximum score.

Finally, compare the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine who wins.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

1. Find the cycle for each player's starting position.

To do this, I can start from the starting position and follow p_x until I return to the starting position, recording the path.

This will give me the cycle that the starting position is in.

2. Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a_x.

3. Find the distance from the starting position to this maximum position in the cycle.

4. Compute the maximum score based on the formula above.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t (number of testcases) up to 1e4, I need to optimize this.

To handle multiple testcases efficiently, I can preprocess the cycles and maximum a_x for all positions.

But since each testcase has different starting positions and k, I need to handle each testcase separately.

However, to optimize, I can precompute for each position the cycle it is in and the maximum a_x in that cycle.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient.

Hence, perhaps I can precompute for each position the cycle members and the maximum a_x in the cycle.

Then, for each testcase, I can find the cycle for P_B and P_S, find the maximum a_x in their cycles, find the distance from their starting positions to the maximum positions, and compute their scores using the formula.

But even better, perhaps I can precompute for each position the maximum a_x in its cycle and the distance to that position.

Then, for each testcase, I can directly use these precomputed values to compute the scores.

But I need to make sure that this can be done efficiently.

Given time constraints, I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that in a permutation, the cycles are disjoint.

Hence, I can perform a graph traversal (like DFS) to find all cycles.

Then, for each cycle, I can find the maximum a_x in that cycle.

Then, for each position in the cycle, I can find the distance to the position with the maximum a_x.

Hence, in preprocessing:

- Perform DFS to find all cycles.

- For each cycle, find the position with the maximum a_x.

- For each position in the cycle, compute the distance to the maximum position.

Then, for each testcase, I can look up the precomputed values for P_B and P_S and compute their scores using the formula.

This seems efficient, as DFS on n=2e5 nodes is feasible.

But in reality, since p is a permutation, I
