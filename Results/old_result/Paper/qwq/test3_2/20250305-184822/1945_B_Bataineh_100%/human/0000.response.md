Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework stays in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the time of launch.

I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Sounds like a problem involving timing and overlaps.

First, I need to understand how the launches and visibility periods overlap. Since both installations start at the same time, I need to consider their launch schedules and how the visibility periods of their fireworks intersect.

Let's think about the launches:

- Installation 1 launches at times: 0, a, 2a, 3a, ...

- Installation 2 launches at times: 0, b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each firework from these installations is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, so for any launch at time t, it's visible from t to t + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

I should consider different scenarios based on the values of a, b, and m.

Let's start by considering the simplest case where a and b are equal. If a = b, then both installations are launching fireworks at the same intervals, so their launch times coincide.

In this case, at time 0, both installations launch a firework. Each firework is visible from 0 to m.

At time a (which is the same as time b), both installations launch again. So at time a, the firework launched at time 0 is still visible if m >= a, because it would be visible up to time m.

So, the number of visible fireworks at time a would be:

- The firework launched at time 0, still visible if m >= a

- The firework launched at time a, visible from a to a + m

- If m >= a, then the firework launched at time 0 overlaps with the one launched at time a.

So, at time a, there would be 2 fireworks visible if m >= a.

Similarly, at time 2a, there would be:

- Firework launched at time 0, visible if m >= 2a

- Firework launched at time a, visible if m >= a

- Firework launched at time 2a, visible from 2a to 2a + m

So, the number of visible fireworks would depend on how m compares to a.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think in terms of the number of fireworks launched by each installation that are visible at a certain time.

For installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of launches before t + m, minus the number of launches before t.

Wait, no. More precisely, for installation 1, the fireworks visible at time t are those launched in the interval [t - m, t], because a firework launched at time x is visible from x to x + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the number of fireworks visible at time t is:

- For installation 1: number of launches in [t - m, t]

- For installation 2: number of launches in [t - m, t]

Since the launches are periodic, I need to calculate how many launches occur in an interval of length m + 1.

But I need to maximize the total number of visible fireworks from both installations at any time t.

So, I need to find t where the sum of fireworks from both installations is maximized.

Let me consider the launch schedules:

Installation 1: 0, a, 2a, 3a, ...

Installation 2: 0, b, 2b, 3b, ...

I need to find, for a given t, how many launches from each installation fall within [t - m, t].

Let me define:

- For installation 1: number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a)

- Similarly for installation 2: floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

Then, the total visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these two.

I need to maximize this sum over all possible t.

But this seems a bit complicated to compute directly, especially since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks can change.

The number of visible fireworks can change only at times when a firework is launched or when a firework's visibility ends.

But since the visibility period is m minutes, and launches happen every a and b minutes, it's tricky to track.

Maybe I can consider the launch times and find overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM of a and b would be the time after which the launch patterns repeat.

But given that a and b can be up to 10^18, calculating LCM might not be feasible directly.

Moreover, m can be up to 10^18, so I need an efficient way to compute the maximum number without iterating through all possible t.

Let me consider the possible number of launches from each installation that can be visible at the same time.

For installation 1, the number of launches in an interval of length m + 1 is floor((t + m)/a) - floor(t/a), but I need to maximize this over t.

Actually, for installation 1, the maximum number of launches visible at any time t is ceil((m + 1)/a).

Similarly, for installation 2, it's ceil((m + 1)/b).

But since the installations might launch at the same time, I need to consider if there's any overlap in their launch times.

If a and b are multiples of each other, then their launch times might coincide at certain points.

Wait, if a and b are multiples, then some launches will happen at the same time.

In that case, the overlapping launches should be counted only once.

Wait, no. Each installation launches its own firework, so even if they launch at the same time, it's two different fireworks.

So, overlaps in launch times mean more fireworks in the sky.

Wait, but if both installations launch at the same time, then at that time, there are two fireworks launched simultaneously, and both will be visible for m + 1 minutes.

But I need to consider how many fireworks are visible at any given time t, not just at launch times.

I think I need to consider the density of launches within the visibility window.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a time t and want to compute the number of fireworks visible at that time from both installations.

For installation 1, the number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly, for installation 2, it's floor((t)/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize the sum of these two.

I need to find t such that this sum is maximized.

But calculating this directly is not feasible for large t and m.

Perhaps I can find a mathematical expression to find the maximum without iterating over t.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks changes.

The number of visible fireworks can change only when t crosses a launch time or a visibility boundary.

Specifically, the number changes at multiples of a, b, and m.

But given the large values, this approach is not practical.

Let me consider the asymptotic behavior.

If m is much larger than a and b, then the number of visible fireworks from each installation would be roughly floor(m / a) + 1 for installation 1 and floor(m / b) + 1 for installation 2.

But since m can be up to 10^18 and a and b can be as small as 1, I need to handle large values carefully.

Wait, actually, for m >= a and m >= b, the maximum number of visible fireworks would be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

The "+2" accounts for the initial launches at time 0 from both installations.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider an example.

Take a = 6, b = 7, m = 4.

According to the formula, floor(4/6) + floor(4/7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.

And according to the first sample input, the output is 2.

Okay, that matches.

Another sample: a = 3, b = 4, m = 10.

floor(10/3) + floor(10/4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: a = 7, b = 8, m = 56.

floor(56/7) + floor(56/8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the sample.

Another sample: a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896.

floor(78123459896/5) + floor(78123459896/6) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the sample.

Seems correct.

Wait, but let's check the case where m < a or m < b.

Take a = 6, b = 7, m = 4, as in the first sample.

According to the formula, floor(4/6) + floor(4/7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

Another case: a = 1, b = 1, m = 1.

floor(1/1) + floor(1/1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample.

Another case: a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000.

floor(1000000000000000000/1) + floor(1000000000000000000/1) + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 always gives the correct answer.

Wait, but why is that?

Let me try to understand why this formula works.

For installation 1, the number of launches in the interval [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

To maximize the sum, I need to choose t such that both floor(t / a) and floor(t / b) are maximized, while minimizing floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor((t - m - 1)/b).

Wait, actually, to maximize the number of launches in [t - m, t], I need to choose t such that t is just after a multiple of a and b, so that more launches fall into the interval [t - m, t].

But in practice, choosing t = m seems a good candidate, because then the interval is [0, m], which includes the initial launch at time 0.

But in the samples, t = m seems to work.

Wait, in the first sample, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4.

At t = 4, the interval is [0, 4].

Installation 1: launches at 0, 6, 12, ... Only the launch at t=0 is within [0,4].

Installation 2: launches at 0, 7, 14, ... Only the launch at t=0 is within [0,4].

But according to the sample, at t=7, there are two fireworks visible: one from each installation.

Wait, perhaps t = LCM(a, b) or something like that.

But LCM might be too large.

Wait, maybe I need to find the time when the number of launches from both installations in the interval [t - m, t] is maximized.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is achieved when t is such that both installations have launched as many times as possible in the interval [t - m, t].

Wait, perhaps the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 accounts for the launches in [0, m], including the launch at t=0.

Wait, floor(m / a) is the number of launches before m for installation 1, but including the launch at t=0.

Wait, actually, floor(m / a) is the number of launches at times 0, a, 2a, ..., floor(m / a) * a, all of which are within [0, m].

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the total number of launches in [0, m] from both installations is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b).

But at t = m, the fireworks launched in [0, m] are visible, plus possibly fireworks launched at t = m from both installations.

Wait, but at t = m, the fireworks launched at t = m are just starting to be visible.

Wait, the firework launched at t = m is visible from t = m to t = m + m = 2m.

So, at t = m, the fireworks launched in the interval [0, m] are visible.

Therefore, the number of visible fireworks at t = m is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b).

But according to the sample, for a=6, b=7, m=4, floor(4/6) + floor(4/7) = 0 + 0 = 0, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to include the launches at t=0.

Wait, in the first sample, at t=0, both installations launch, so two fireworks are visible from t=0 to t=4.

At t=7, installation 2 launches another firework, which is visible from t=7 to t=11.

But at t=7, the firework from installation 1 launched at t=0 is still visible until t=4, but t=7 is after that.

Wait, at t=7, only the firework launched at t=7 from installation 2 is visible, and possibly the firework launched from installation 1 at t=6, if m >= 7 - 6 = 1.

Wait, m = 4, so the firework launched at t=6 is visible from t=6 to t=10.

So, at t=7, the firework launched at t=6 from installation 1 and the firework launched at t=7 from installation 2 are both visible.

Hence, two fireworks are visible.

So, in this case, the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 matches.

But why is there a "+2"?

Wait, perhaps the "+2" accounts for the initial launches at t=0 from both installations.

But in the general case, it seems that floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the correct answer, as per the samples.

Wait, but in the second sample, a=3, b=4, m=10.

floor(10/3) + floor(10/4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample.

Similarly, in the third sample, a=7, b=8, m=56.

floor(56/7) + floor(56/8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches.

In the fourth sample, a=5, b=6, m=78123459896.

floor(78123459896/5) + floor(78123459896/6) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches.

In the fifth sample, a=1, b=1, m=1.

floor(1/1) + floor(1/1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches.

In the sixth sample, a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000.

floor(1000000000000000000/1) + floor(1000000000000000000/1) + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 always gives the correct answer.

But why does it work in all cases?

Let me try to derive it properly.

For installation 1, the number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to choose t such that floor(t / a) and floor(t / b) are maximized, while floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor((t - m - 1)/b) are minimized.

The maximum value of floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is floor(m / a) + 1, because the interval [t - m - 1, t] can contain up to floor(m / a) + 1 launches.

Similarly for installation 2.

Therefore, the maximum sum would be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

This seems to align with the samples.

Hence, the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the maximum number of visible fireworks.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
