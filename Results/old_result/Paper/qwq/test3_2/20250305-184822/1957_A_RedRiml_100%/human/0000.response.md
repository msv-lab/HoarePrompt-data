Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with different lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with each stick used in at most one polygon. Regular polygons mean all sides are equal, like equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, and so on.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a regular polygon. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal. So, for sticks of the same length, I can form a polygon with that many sides, provided I have enough sticks.

For example, with three sticks of the same length, I can make a triangle. With four, a square, and so on. But, can I mix different lengths for different polygons? Yes, as long as each polygon has all sides equal and no stick is used more than once.

So, my goal is to group the sticks into sets where each set has all sticks of the same length and has at least as many sticks as the number of sides required for that polygon.

Now, thinking about it, the minimal number of sides for a polygon is 3 (a triangle). So, for any group of sticks of the same length, I can make as many polygons as the floor division of the number of sticks by the number of sides required.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the minimum number of sides. It just says "equal-sided polygons," which could include triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. So, for each group of sticks of the same length, I need to decide what kind of polygon to make, but I want to maximize the number of polygons.

Hmm. To maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many small polygons as possible, since smaller polygons require fewer sticks. For example, triangles require 3 sticks each, squares require 4, and so on. So, for a given number of sticks of the same length, I can make more polygons if I choose smaller polygons.

Wait, but that might not always be optimal. Let's consider an example.

Take the third test case from the example:

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

Here, we have two sticks of length 2 and four sticks of length 3. According to the explanation, we can make one square with the four sticks of length 3, which is a polygon with four sides.

But, if I were to make triangles with the sticks of length 3, I could make one triangle with three sticks, and have one stick left over. So, in that case, making a square is better because it uses all four sticks, whereas making triangles would leave one stick unused.

But the problem is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily to use all sticks. So, in this case, making one square is better than making one triangle, because 1 > 1, but actually they are equal. Wait, no, one square is still just one polygon, same as one triangle.

Wait, but if I make one triangle with three sticks of length 3, and have one stick left over, that's one polygon, and I have one stick not used. If I make a square with four sticks, that's one polygon and no sticks left over. So, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same.

But perhaps in other cases, it might be different. Let's consider another example.

Suppose I have seven sticks of length 3. If I make triangles, I can make two triangles with six sticks and have one stick left over. If I make squares, I can make one square with four sticks and have three sticks left over, which isn't enough for another square. So, in this case, making triangles allows me to make two polygons, while making squares allows only one.

Therefore, to maximize the number of polygons, I should倾向于 make smaller polygons, starting from triangles.

Wait, but in the first example, with only one stick, I can't make any polygon, which is fine. With two sticks, still not enough to make any polygon, as the smallest polygon is a triangle requiring three sticks.

In the third example, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is fine, but making one square gives me one polygon, same as making one triangle and having one stick left over.

But in the fourth test case:

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Here, we have sticks: four 2's and five 4's.

According to the explanation, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 (five sides), but we only have four sticks of length 2, which is not enough for a pentagon. Wait, but in the note, it says we can make a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4.

Wait, but with four sticks of length 2, we can make a square, and with five sticks of length 4, we can make a pentagon. But that would be two polygons.

Wait, but in the output, it's 2, which matches this.

But according to my earlier reasoning, to maximize the number of polygons, I should make smaller polygons.

So, with four sticks of length 2, I could make one square (one polygon), or two triangles with three sticks each, but I only have four sticks, so I can't make two triangles (that would require six sticks). Wait, no, triangles require three sticks each, so with four sticks, I can make one triangle and have one stick left over, which isn't enough for another triangle.

So, in this case, making one square is better in terms of using more sticks, but in terms of the number of polygons, making one square is the same as making one triangle.

But, according to the note, they made a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4.

Wait, but a pentagon with side length 2 would require five sticks of length 2, but in the fourth test case, there are only four sticks of length 2. So, that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the note. Let me check the note again.

"In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a square of side length 4 ."

But in the input, for the fourth test case:

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

So, sticks: [4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4]

Count of each length:

Length 2: four sticks

Length 4: five sticks

So, to make a pentagon with side length 2, I would need five sticks of length 2, but there are only four. So, that seems impossible.

Wait, maybe it's a typo in the note. Perhaps they meant to make a square with side length 2 and another square with side length 4.

Wait, but with four sticks of length 2, I can make one square, and with five sticks of length 4, I can make one square (four sticks) and have one stick left over.

Alternatively, with five sticks of length 4, I could potentially make a pentagon, but I'm not sure if that's allowed since the problem doesn't specify the minimum number of sides.

Wait, but in the note, they mentioned making a pentagon with side length 2, which isn't possible with only four sticks of that length.

I think there might be a mistake in the note. Anyway, moving forward, I need to figure out the correct approach.

So, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many small polygons as possible.

Given that, for each group of sticks of the same length, I should divide the number of sticks by the smallest possible number of sides for a polygon, which is 3 (triangle).

So, for each group, calculate the floor division of the number of sticks by 3, and sum this up across all groups.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, with four sticks of length 2, floor division by 3 is 1 (since 4 // 3 = 1), and with five sticks of length 4, floor division by 3 is 1 (since 5 // 3 = 1), so total polygons would be 2, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, floor division by 3 is 1, which matches the output.

In the second test case, with two sticks of length 1, which is less than 3, so can't make any polygon, hence 0.

In the first test case, only one stick, which is less than 3, so can't make any polygon, hence 0.

This seems consistent.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 4, if I make one square (four sticks), I have one stick left over, which isn't enough for another polygon. So, total polygons are one.

But according to the earlier approach, floor division of 5 by 3 is 1, and floor division of 4 by 3 is 1, total 2.

But in reality, with five sticks of length 4, I can only make one square, and have one stick left over, which isn't enough for another polygon.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Maybe I need to consider that for each group, I can only make one polygon, using as many sticks as the number of sides of that polygon.

So, for example, with four sticks of length 2, I can make one square (four sides), or one triangle (three sides) and have one stick left over, which isn't enough for another polygon.

Similarly, with five sticks of length 4, I can make one pentagon (five sides), or one square (four sides) and have one stick left over.

In both cases, I can only make one polygon per group, using as many sticks as the number of sides of the polygon I choose.

But according to the note in the fourth test case, they made two polygons, a pentagon and a square, but that would require five sticks of one length and four of another, which is possible if the polygons have different side lengths.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, they have sticks of two different lengths: length 2 and length 4.

So, they can make one polygon with sticks of length 2 and another with sticks of length 4.

For sticks of length 2: four sticks, can make one square (four sides), using all four sticks.

For sticks of length 4: five sticks, can make one pentagon (five sides), using all five sticks.

Thus, total polygons: two.

Alternatively, they could make one square with four sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4, but they have only five sticks of length 4, so they could make one square with four sticks of length 4 and have one stick left over.

But in the note, they mentioned making a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4.

Wait, but in the input, for the fourth test case, sticks are: [4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4], so four sticks of length 2 and five sticks of length 4.

So, making one square with four sticks of length 2 and one pentagon with five sticks of length 4 is possible, totaling two polygons.

Alternatively, making one square with four sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4, using eight sticks in total, and having one stick of length 4 left over.

In this case, making two squares would also use eight sticks, but the note suggests making a pentagon and a square.

So, perhaps in the program, it's considering making polygons with the minimal number of sides possible, which is triangles, but in reality, to maximize the number of polygons, I need to make polygons with the smallest possible number of sides for each group.

Wait, but in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, it's better to make one square (four sides) than one triangle (three sides) and have one stick left over.

But in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same: one polygon.

In the fourth test case, with four sticks of length 2 and five sticks of length 4, making one square with four sticks of length 2 and one pentagon with five sticks of length 4 gives two polygons.

Alternatively, making one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4, totaling two polygons, with one stick of length 2 left over.

So, in this case, it's the same number of polygons.

But, if I had, say, seven sticks of length 3, I could make two triangles (using six sticks) and have one stick left over, or make one hexagon with six sticks, again two polygons.

So, perhaps the number of polygons is limited by the floor division of the number of sticks by the minimal number of sides for a polygon, which is 3.

Hence, for each group, the maximum number of polygons is floor(number of sticks / 3).

In the third test case: floor(4/3) = 1

In the fourth test case: floor(4/3) + floor(5/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

Which matches the output.

So, perhaps that's the approach the program is taking.

Now, looking at the program:

def func():

w = int(input())

for _ in range(w):

ln = int(input())

palka = list(map(int, input().split()))

pl = []

d = {}

for i in palka:

if d.get(i) == None:

d[i] = 1

else:

d[i] += 1

if i not in pl:

pl.append(i)

shapes = 0

for j in pl:

if d[j] >= 3:

shapes += d[j] // 3

print(shapes)



So, the program reads the number of test cases, w.

For each test case:

- Read the number of sticks, ln.

- Read the list of stick lengths, palka.

- Initialize an empty list pl and a dictionary d.

- For each stick length i in palka:

- If i is not in d, set d[i] = 1

- Else, increment d[i] by 1

- If i is not in pl, append it to pl.

- Initialize shapes = 0

- For each unique stick length j in pl:

- If d[j] >= 3, add floor(d[j] / 3) to shapes

- Print shapes

So, the program is grouping the sticks by their lengths, counting the number of sticks for each length, and then for each group with at least 3 sticks, it adds floor(count / 3) to the total number of shapes.

This seems consistent with my earlier reasoning.

But, considering the fourth test case, with four sticks of length 2 and five sticks of length 4:

- For length 2: d[2] = 4, floor(4/3) = 1

- For length 4: d[4] = 5, floor(5/3) = 1

- Total shapes = 2, which matches the output.

In the third test case:

- Length 2: d[2] = 2 (but less than 3, so not considered)

- Length 3: d[3] = 4, floor(4/3) = 1

- Total shapes = 1, which matches the output.

In the second test case:

- Length 1: d[1] = 2, which is less than 3

- Total shapes = 0

In the first test case:

- Length 1: d[1] = 1, which is less than 3

- Total shapes = 0

So, it seems that this approach is correct.

But earlier, I was confused because in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 4, floor(5/3) = 1, and with four sticks of length 2, floor(4/3) = 1, totaling two polygons, which matches the output.

Alternatively, if I were to make a square with four sticks of length 4 and a triangle with three sticks of length 2, that would be two polygons, using seven sticks in total, but I have only four sticks of length 2, so that's not possible.

Wait, no, with four sticks of length 2, I can make one square, and with five sticks of length 4, I can make one pentagon, totaling two polygons.

So, the program's approach seems to be working correctly in this case.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See the program above}} \]

**Correctness: True**
