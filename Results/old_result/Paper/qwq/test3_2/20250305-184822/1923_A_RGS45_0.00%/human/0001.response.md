Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either has a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block with no free cells between them, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking. I have a sequence of cells, some with chips and some empty. I can only move chips to the left, to the nearest empty cell. I need to arrange all the chips into a contiguous block with no gaps between them.

Let me think about what a block without any free cells between them looks like. It means all the chips are together, one after another, with no empty cells in between. So, if I have chips at positions, say, 2, 3, 5, and 6, moving the chip at 5 to position 4 would make them all contiguous from 2 to 5.

Now, the problem is to find the minimum number of moves to achieve this. I need to figure out a strategy that minimizes the number of operations.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

5

8

0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

6

0 1 0 0 0 0

6

1 1 1 1 1 1

5

1 0 1 0 1

9

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output:

1

0

0

2

3

Looking at the first input:

n=8, arr=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

After one operation, move the chip from position 7 to position 5, resulting in [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0], which is a single block from position 2 to 6.

In the second input:

n=6, arr=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

All chips are already in a single block (only one chip at position 2), so no operations needed.

Third input:

n=6, arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

Already a single block, so no operations needed.

Fourth input:

n=5, arr=[1,0,1,0,1]

Need to move the chips at positions 3 and 5 to positions 2 and 3, respectively, to form a block from 1 to 3.

Fifth input:

n=9, arr=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Need to move the chips at positions 7 and 8 to positions 4 and 5, and possibly another move to make them contiguous.

Okay, so I need a general approach to solve this for any given n and arr.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip. Between these two, all the chips should be placed without any gaps.

So, find the leftmost '1' and the rightmost '1'. Let's call their positions L and R.

Now, in the range from L to R, there should be no '0's, meaning all cells should be '1's.

So, the number of operations needed would be equal to the number of '0's in this range.

Wait, but in the first example, after moving one chip, all chips form a block from position 2 to 6, and there is one '0' in position 1, but we didn't include position 1 in the block. So, maybe my approach is not correct.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip, and then count the number of '0's between them.

But in the first example, L=2, R=7, and between them, positions are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

arr[2 to 7]: 1,1,1,0,1,1

Number of '0's is 1, which matches the output.

In the second example, L=2, R=2, no '0's between them.

Third example, L=1, R=6, no '0's.

Fourth example, L=1, R=5, arr[1 to 5]: 1,0,1,0,1, which has two '0's, matching the output.

Fifth example, L=2, R=8, arr[2 to 8]:1,1,0,0,0,1,1, which has three '0's, matching the output.

Okay, this seems consistent.

So, the strategy is:

1. Find the leftmost chip (first '1' from the left).

2. Find the rightmost chip (first '1' from the right).

3. Consider the substring from leftmost to rightmost chip inclusive.

4. Count the number of '0's in this substring.

5. This count is the number of operations needed.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Now, let's see the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input(''))

arr = str(input(''))

x = arr.find('1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1')

z = arr[x:n - y]

print(z.count('0'))

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, the number of cells.

b. Read arr, which is a string of n integers (0 or 1) separated by spaces.

c. Find the position of the first '1' from the left, stored in x.

d. Find the position of the first '1' from the right, stored in y.

e. Extract the substring z from arr[x:n - y].

f. Count the number of '0's in z and print it.

Wait a minute, in step e, z = arr[x:n - y]. Is this correct?

Let's see with the first example:

arr = '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0'

x = arr.find('1') = position 2 (since arr[0] = '0', arr[1] = ' ', arr[2] = '1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = reverse of arr is '0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ', position of first '1' is 1 (indexing from 0), so y=1

Then z = arr[2:n - 1] = arr[2:8 - 1] = arr[2:7] = '1 1 1 0 1'

count of '0's is 1, which matches the output.

In the fourth example:

arr = '1 0 1 0 1'

x = 0 (first '1' at position 0)

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = reverse is '1 0 1 0 1', first '1' at position 0, so y=0

z = arr[0:5 - 0] = arr[0:5] = '1 0 1 0 1'

count of '0's is 2, which matches the output.

In the fifth example:

arr = '0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0'

x = 1 (first '1' at position 1)

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = reverse is '0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0', first '1' at position 1, so y=1

z = arr[1:9 - 1] = arr[1:8] = '1 1 0 0 0 1 1'

count of '0's is 3, which matches the output.

Seems correct.

But wait, in the first example, arr.find('1') returns the position of the first '1', which is position 2 (since arr = '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0', positions are 0:'0', 1:' ', 2:'1', etc.).

But actually, the positions are based on the indices of the string, not the cell numbers. The cells are numbered from 1 to n, but the string arr is a space-separated string.

This might cause an issue if the string has varying lengths between numbers.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1)", so likely, arr is a string like "0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0".

So, arr.split() would give a list of integers.

But in the code, it's reading arr as a string and using find('1') directly on it.

This could be problematic because '1's can be separated by spaces.

Let's see:

In the first example, arr = '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0'

find('1') will return the position of the first '1', which is position 2.

Then, arr[::-1] is '0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0', find('1') returns position 1.

Then z = arr[2:8 - 1] = arr[2:7] = '1 1 1 0 1'

count of '0's is 1, correct.

But, if arr had different spacing, like '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0', it's fine.

But what if arr is '01110110', without spaces? Then find('1') would return position 1, y=arr[::-1].find('1')=1, z=arr[1:8-1]=arr[1:7]='111011', count of '0's is 1, which is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, arr is a string of n integers separated by spaces.

So, it should be '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0'.

But, in the code, arr is read as a string directly, spaces included.

So, find('1') will correctly find the first '1', considering the spaces.

But, when slicing z = arr[x:n - y], it might include spaces, which could affect the count('0').

Wait, in the first example, z = arr[2:7] = '1 1 1 0 1', which includes spaces.

Then z.count('0') would count both '0' and spaces, but in this case, there's only one '0'.

Wait, but spaces are ' ', which is not '0', so count('0') would only count '0's.

In '1 1 1 0 1', count('0') is 1, which is correct.

In the fourth example, z = '1 0 1 0 1', count('0') is 2, correct.

In the fifth example, z = '1 1 0 0 0 1 1', count('0') is 3, correct.

So, it seems to work.

But is this a general solution?

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose n=4, arr='1 0 0 1'

Leftmost '1' at position 0, rightmost '1' at position 3.

z = arr[0:4-0] = arr[0:4] = '1 0 0 1', count('0') is 2, which is correct, as we need to move one chip from position 1 to position 2, and another chip from position 4 to position 3, but actually, in this problem, we can only move to the left.

Wait, in this case, the leftmost '1' is at position 1 (cell 1), rightmost '1' is at position 4 (cell 4).

We need to form a block from position 1 to 4 with no '0's in between.

Current arr: cell 1:1, 2:0, 3:0, 4:1

We need to move the chip from position 4 to position 3, making arr: 1,0,1,0

Then move the chip from position 3 to position 2, making arr: 1,1,0,0

So, total operations: 2, which matches count('0') in z.

So, it seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, arr='1 0 1'

z = arr[0:3-0] = '1 0 1', count('0') is 1, which is correct, as we can move the chip from position 3 to position 2.

So, seems correct.

One more test case: n=2, arr='1 1'

z = arr[0:2-0] = '1 1', count('0') is 0, correct.

Another test case: n=2, arr='1 0'

z = arr[0:2-0] = '1 0', count('0') is 1, but in this case, all chips are already in a block, since there's only one chip.

Wait, according to the problem, "at least one cell contains a chip", so in this case, it's already a block, so output should be 0.

But according to the code, it would output 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, this is a problem.

So, for n=2, arr='1 0', leftmost '1' at position 0, rightmost '1' at position 0 (only one '1'), so y=arr[::-1].find('1')=1 (since reverse is '0 1', first '1' at position 1).

Then z = arr[0:2-1] = arr[0:1] = '1', count('0') is 0, which is correct.

Wait, in arr='1 0', reverse is '0 1', find('1')=1.

So, y=1.

Then z = arr[0:2-1] = arr[0:1] = '1', which has 0 '0's, which is correct, as the block is already contiguous (only one chip).

So, in this case, it works.

Another test case: n=3, arr='1 0 1'

As before, z='1 0 1', count('0')=1, which is correct, as one operation is needed.

Wait, but in the previous incorrect case, n=2, arr='1 0', it gave the correct output.

Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in n=2, arr='1 0', x=0, y=1, z=arr[0:2-1]=arr[0:1]='1', count('0')=0, which is correct, as the single chip is already in a block.

So, it seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, arr='1 0 0 1'

x=0, y=1, z=arr[0:4-1]=arr[0:3]='1 0 0', count('0')=2, which is correct, as two operations are needed.

Seems consistent.

Let me think about another aspect.

Is there any case where this logic fails?

Suppose n=5, arr='1 1 0 1 1'

Leftmost '1' at position 0, rightmost '1' at position 4.

z=arr[0:5-0]=arr[0:5]='1 1 0 1 1', count('0')=1, which is correct, as one operation is needed to move the chip from position 5 to position 3.

Yes, that works.

Another case: n=5, arr='1 0 1 0 1'

x=0, y=1, z=arr[0:5-1]=arr[0:4]='1 0 1 0', count('0')=2, which matches the sample input.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=5, arr=[1,0,1,0,1], output is 2, which matches.

So, I don't see any issues with this approach.

It seems that counting the number of '0's between the leftmost and rightmost '1's gives the minimum number of operations needed.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
