Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. We have an array of numbers, and I need to divide this array into segments such that certain conditions are met, and I have to maximize the number of such segments.

First, let's make sure I understand all the conditions:

1. The first segment must start at index 1.

2. The last segment must end at index n.

3. Each segment's left index must be less than or equal to its right index.

4. The segments must be consecutive, meaning the next segment starts right after the previous one ends.

5. The bitwise OR of the XORs of each segment should be less than or equal to a given number x.

Okay, so I need to split the array into as many segments as possible, following these rules, and ensure that the OR of all the segment XORs is <= x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do in this context.

XOR (^) of a segment: It's the bitwise exclusive OR of all elements in that segment.

OR (|): It's the bitwise OR of the XOR values of all segments.

I need the OR of these XOR values to be <= x.

I need to maximize the number of segments, k, under these constraints.

If I can't find any way to segment the array to satisfy the condition, I should return -1.

Alright, let's consider an example to understand better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 3, x = 1

a = [1, 2, 3]

Possible segments:

- [1,1]: XOR = 1

- [2,3]: XOR = 2 ^ 3 = 1

OR of these XORs: 1 | 1 = 1, which is <= x=1.

So, k=2 is possible.

Is k=3 possible?

- [1,1]: XOR =1

- [2,2]: XOR=2

- [3,3]: XOR=3

OR: 1 | 2 | 3 = 3, which is > x=1.

So, k=3 is not possible.

Hence, the maximum k is 2.

Another example:

n=2, x=2

a=[1,1]

Possible k=2:

- [1,1]: XOR=1

- [2,2]: XOR=1

OR: 1 | 1 = 1 <=2.

So, k=2 is possible.

What about k=1?

- [1,2]: XOR=1^1=0

OR: 0 <=2.

But k=2 is larger, so k=2 is better.

But the problem is to maximize k, so k=2 is acceptable.

Another example where k=1 is better:

n=2, x=2

a=[1,3]

If k=2:

- [1,1]: XOR=1

- [2,2]: XOR=3

OR: 1 | 3 = 3 >2.

So, k=2 is not possible.

k=1:

- [1,2]: XOR=1^3=2

OR:2 <=2.

So, k=1 is possible.

Hence, maximum k=1.

From these examples, it seems that sometimes splitting into more segments is possible, but sometimes it's better to have fewer segments to meet the OR condition.

I need a way to maximize k while ensuring that the OR of all segment XORs is <= x.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR.

XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter.

OR is also associative and commutative.

If I have segments that are consecutive and cover the entire array, the XOR of each segment can be combined via OR to get the final value.

I need to maximize the number of segments, k, such that the OR of their XORs is <= x.

I need an efficient way to do this because n can be up to 1e5 per test case, and t can be up to 1e4, but the total n across all test cases is <=1e5.

So, overall time complexity should be O(N), where N is 1e5.

I need an O(N) per test case solution, but since t can be up to 1e4, but total n is 1e5, it's manageable.

But I need an efficient approach.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR.

First, observe that OR is a monotonic operation. Adding more bits to the OR can only keep the value the same or increase it.

Similarly, XOR can flip bits based on the number of 1s in that bit position across the segment.

I need to consider each bit position independently because XOR and OR are bitwise operations.

Maybe I can consider each bit from 0 to 29 (since a_i < 2^30) and see how they contribute to the final OR.

Let me consider the bits one by one.

For each bit position i (from 0 to 29), I can look at the bit i in x, and see what's required for the OR of the segment XORs to satisfy the condition.

Let me denote:

- x_i: the i-th bit of x.

- a_j_i: the i-th bit of a_j.

First, consider a single segment covering the entire array. Its XOR is the XOR of all a_j.

Then, if I split into multiple segments, the OR of their XORs needs to be <= x.

I need to maximize the number of segments, k, under this constraint.

I need to find a way to split the array into k segments such that the OR of their XORs is <= x.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the maximum k for the first i elements.

But I'm not sure how to transition between states efficiently.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and OR.

I need to maximize k, which means I want as many segments as possible, but the OR of their XORs should be <= x.

I need to ensure that for each bit position, the OR of the XORs of the segments doesn't exceed the corresponding bit in x.

So, for each bit position, I need to ensure that in the final OR, that bit doesn't exceed x's bit in that position.

But since x's bit can only be 0 or 1, and OR is involved, it's either allowed to have that bit set or not.

Specifically, for bit i:

- If x_i = 0, then the OR of the segment XORs must have 0 in that bit position. Meaning, none of the segment XORs can have bit i set to 1.

- If x_i = 1, then at least one segment XOR can have bit i set to 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, since OR is involved, for bit i:

- If x_i = 0, then all segment XORs must have bit i as 0.

- If x_i = 1, then at least one segment XOR has bit i as 1.

Wait, more precisely:

- For bits where x_i = 0: the OR of all segment XORs must have bit i as 0, meaning that for all segments, the XOR of that segment must have bit i as 0.

- For bits where x_i = 1: the OR of all segment XORs must have bit i as 1, meaning that at least one segment has its XOR with bit i as 1.

But actually, OR is a bit tricky here.

Wait, OR is a bit-wise operation where a bit in the result is 1 if at least one of the operands has that bit set to 1.

So, for the OR of multiple XORs:

- For a bit position i, if any of the segment XORs has bit i set to 1, then the overall OR will have bit i set to 1.

- If all segment XORs have bit i set to 0, then the overall OR will have bit i set to 0.

Given that, let's look back at x.

For each bit i in x:

- If x_i = 0: then all segment XORs must have bit i as 0. Because if any segment XOR has bit i as 1, the OR would have bit i as 1, which is > x_i = 0.

- If x_i = 1: then at least one segment XOR must have bit i as 1.

Wait, no.

If x_i = 1, then the OR of the segment XORs can have bit i as 1, which means at least one segment XOR has bit i as 1.

But the condition is that the OR of the segment XORs should be <= x.

Wait, actually, for the OR to be <= x, for each bit i:

- If x_i = 0, then the OR must have bit i = 0, meaning all segment XORs must have bit i = 0.

- If x_i = 1, then the OR can have bit i = 1, meaning at least one segment XOR has bit i = 1.

But the overall OR must be <= x, meaning that for bits where x_i = 0, the OR must have 0, and for x_i = 1, the OR can have either 0 or 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, for the OR to be <= x, for each bit position i:

- If x_i = 0, then the OR must have bit i = 0.

- If x_i = 1, then the OR can have bit i = 0 or 1.

But in our case, since OR is involved, for bits where x_i = 0, none of the segment XORs can have bit i = 1.

For bits where x_i = 1, at least one segment XOR must have bit i = 1.

Wait, actually, for x_i = 1, the OR can be either 0 or 1, but to satisfy OR <= x, for bits where x_i = 0, OR must be 0, and for x_i = 1, OR can be 0 or 1.

But in our problem, we need OR <= x.

So, for each bit i:

- If x_i = 0: OR must have bit i = 0, meaning all segment XORs have bit i = 0.

- If x_i = 1: OR can have bit i = 0 or 1.

But if OR has bit i = 0 for some x_i = 1, it's still <= x, but we might need to ensure that for x_i = 1, at least one segment XOR has bit i = 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, for OR <= x, for each bit i:

- If x_i = 0: all segment XORs must have bit i = 0.

- If x_i = 1: there is no restriction on segment XORs for bit i; they can be 0 or 1.

But to satisfy OR <= x, for bits where x_i = 1, it's allowed for some segment XOR to have bit i = 1, but it's not required.

Wait, actually, for OR <= x:

- For bits where x_i = 0: no segment XOR can have bit i = 1.

- For bits where x_i = 1: segment XORs can have bit i = 0 or 1, but to achieve OR <= x, it's allowed to have some segment XORs with bit i = 1, but it's not mandatory.

Hence, for bits where x_i = 1, it's okay if some segment XORs have bit i = 1, but it's also okay if all segment XORs have bit i = 0 for that bit position.

The overall OR for those bits would be 0, which is still <= x_i =1.

But in that case, it's still acceptable.

Hence, for bits where x_i =1, there is no constraint beyond what's already imposed by x_i=0 bits.

But in our problem, we need to maximize k, the number of segments, under the constraint that OR of segment XORs <=x.

Hence, for bits where x_i=0, we need to ensure that in all segment XORs, bit i=0.

For bits where x_i=1, we have more flexibility.

I need to handle these bits differently.

I think I need to process the bits from the highest to the lowest or vice versa.

Wait, maybe I can process the bits from the most significant to the least significant.

Let me consider processing the bits from bit 29 down to bit 0.

For each bit, I can consider the current state and make decisions accordingly.

Let me try to outline an algorithm.

Initialize t as an empty list.

For each bit i from 29 downto 0:

u = (x >> i) & 1  # Get the i-th bit of x

v = sum( (a[j] >> i) & 1 for j in 0..n-1 )  # Sum of i-th bits in a

Case 1: u == 0 and v == 0

In this case, for bit i, x_i=0 and the sum of a_j_i is 0.

This means all a_j have bit i=0, and x_i=0.

So, no issue, we can proceed without any action for this bit.

Case 2: u == 0 and v != 0

Here, x_i=0 but the sum of a_j_i is non-zero, meaning at least one a_j has bit i=1.

But since x_i=0, all segment XORs must have bit i=0.

Given that, we need to group the elements such that in each segment, the XOR of the elements' bit i is 0.

This means that within each segment, the number of 1s in bit i must be even.

So, we can merge elements into segments where the cumulative XOR of bit i is 0.

We can do this by keeping track of the cumulative XOR up to each position and split segments where the cumulative XOR changes.

Wait, more precisely:

- Compute the prefix XOR for bit i.

- Whenever the prefix XOR changes, it means the XOR of the current segment is 1, which is not allowed since x_i=0.

- Hence, we need to split the segment at that point.

So, we can split the array into segments where the XOR of each segment's bit i is 0.

This can be done by finding runs where the cumulative XOR for bit i remains 0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recompute a as the segments where the XOR of bit i is 0.

This way, we can merge segments where the XOR is 0 and split where it's 1.

But since x_i=0, no segment can have XOR bit i=1.

Hence, we need to ensure that all segments have XOR bit i=0.

To maximize k, we need to make segments as small as possible, but ensuring that each segment's XOR bit i=0.

Hence, we can split the array into segments where the cumulative XOR up to that point is 0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the array, keep a running XOR for bit i, and whenever it becomes 1, split the segment there and reset the running XOR.

This way, each segment will have XOR bit i=0.

After doing this for bit i, we can set t as the new a, which are the XORs of these segments.

Then, proceed to the next bit.

Case 3: u == 1 and v % 2 ==1

Here, x_i=1 and the sum of a_j_i is odd.

Wait, sum of a_j_i is the sum, not the XOR.

Wait, sum of a_j_i being odd means that the XOR of the array for bit i is 1.

Since x_i=1, we need to ensure that the OR of segment XORs has bit i=1.

But in this case, since the total XOR is 1, there must be at least one segment with XOR bit i=1.

Given that, we can proceed without splitting, as the total XOR has bit i=1, which will be included in the OR.

Hence, we can set t as the current a.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, actually, since x_i=1 and the total XOR for bit i is 1, which means that if we take the entire array as one segment, its XOR for bit i=1, which satisfies the OR <=x since x_i=1.

Hence, k=1 is possible.

But we need to maximize k.

So, perhaps we can try to split the array into segments where each segment's XOR for bit i=1, but we need to ensure that the OR of all segment XORs has bit i=1.

Wait, it's a bit complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that for bits where x_i=1, we have more flexibility, and we can group elements in a way that allows for more segments, as long as at least one segment has XOR bit i=1.

But this seems tricky to handle directly.

An alternative idea is to iterate through the bits from high to low, and for each bit, handle the constraints imposed by x_i.

If x_i=0, we need to ensure that all segment XORs have bit i=0.

If x_i=1, we need to ensure that at least one segment XOR has bit i=1.

But enforcing the "at least one segment has bit i=1" while maximizing k is non-trivial.

An alternative approach is to consider that for bits where x_i=0, we need to group elements to ensure that within each segment, the XOR for that bit is 0.

For bits where x_i=1, we can be more flexible.

Perhaps, for bits where x_i=0, we can compute the minimal number of segments required to satisfy that bit's constraint.

Then, for other bits, we can adjust k accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can compute for each bit where x_i=0, the minimal number of segments required to make each segment's XOR for that bit 0.

Then, the overall k would be the maximum of these minimal segment counts across all such bits.

But this might not be directly applicable, as bits are independent but combined via OR.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for bits where x_i=0, the segments must have XOR bit i=0, and for bits where x_i=1, there is no restriction beyond what's already imposed by x_i=0 bits.

Hence, the most restrictive part is the bits where x_i=0.

Hence, to maximize k, I need to maximize the number of segments while ensuring that for each bit where x_i=0, each segment's XOR for that bit is 0.

Additionally, for bits where x_i=1, at least one segment must have XOR bit i=1.

Wait, no, for x_i=1, there is no requirement on the segments beyond what's already required by x_i=0 bits.

Wait, actually, for x_i=1, the OR of segment XORs can be either 0 or 1, but to satisfy OR <=x, it's allowed to have OR bit i=1.

Hence, for x_i=1, it's sufficient that the OR of segment XORs for that bit is <=1, which is always true since OR bit i can be 0 or 1.

Hence, the main constraints come from bits where x_i=0, which require that all segment XORs for that bit are 0.

Hence, to maximize k, I need to maximize the number of segments while ensuring that for each bit where x_i=0, each segment's XOR for that bit is 0.

For bits where x_i=1, there are no additional constraints beyond that.

Hence, the most restrictive part is the bits where x_i=0.

Hence, I can consider the bits where x_i=0 as constraints that must be satisfied, and for bits where x_i=1, I can be more flexible.

Hence, an approach could be:

- For each bit where x_i=0, compute the minimal number of segments required to make each segment's XOR for that bit 0.

- Then, among all these minimal segment counts for x_i=0 bits, take the maximum, and that will be the maximum k that satisfies all x_i=0 bits.

- For x_i=1 bits, since they impose no additional constraints, this k will automatically satisfy the OR <=x condition for those bits.

Hence, the maximum k is the maximum over all x_i=0 bits of the minimal number of segments required to make each segment's XOR for that bit 0.

If no such segmentation exists for any bit, output -1.

Wait, but in the example where n=3, x=1, a=[1,2,3], k=2 is possible.

Let's see:

x=1 in binary is 001.

Hence, bit 0 of x is 1, bits 1 and above are 0.

Hence, the constraint is:

- For bit 0 (x_0=1): at least one segment has XOR bit 0=1.

- For bits 1 and above (x_i=0): each segment's XOR for those bits is 0.

In the example:

k=2:

- Segment 1: [1,1], XOR=1 (bit 0=1, bits 1 and above=0)

- Segment 2: [2,3], XOR=1 (bit 0=1, bits 1 and above=0)

OR of XORs: 1 | 1 =1 <=x=1.

Hence, it satisfies.

Another way, k=1:

- Segment: [1,3], XOR=0 (bit 0=0, which is < x=1).

But we can have k=2, which is larger.

Hence, k=2 is better.

But according to my earlier approach, for x_i=0 (bits 1 and above), I need each segment's XOR for those bits to be 0.

In this case, for bit 1 and above, all segment XORs have those bits as 0, since the XOR of the segments is 1 and 1, which in binary is 1 and 1, so bits 1 and above are 0.

Hence, it satisfies the constraints for x_i=0 bits.

For x_i=1 (bit 0), at least one segment has XOR bit 0=1, which is satisfied since both segments have XOR bit 0=1.

Hence, it's acceptable.

Another example:

n=2, x=2, a=[1,3]

x=2 in binary is 10.

Hence, bit 1 of x is 1, and bit 0 is 0.

Hence, constraints:

- For bit 0 (x_0=0): each segment's XOR bit 0=0.

- For bit 1 (x_1=1): at least one segment has XOR bit 1=1.

Let's see k=1:

- Segment: [1,2], XOR=1^3=2 (bit 0=0, bit 1=1)

- OR=2 <=x=2.

Hence, k=1 is possible.

k=2:

- Segment 1: [1,1], XOR=1 (bit 0=1, bit 1=0)

- Segment 2: [2,2], XOR=3 (bit 0=1, bit 1=1)

- OR=1 | 3 =3 >x=2.

Hence, k=2 is not possible.

Hence, maximum k=1.

According to my earlier approach, for x_i=0 (bit 0), each segment must have XOR bit 0=0.

In this case, for k=1: XOR=2, bit 0=0, which satisfies.

For k=2: both segments have XOR bit 0=1, which does not satisfy x_i=0 constraint.

Hence, k=1 is the maximum.

Another example:

n=2, x=2, a=[1,1]

x=2 in binary is 10.

Hence, bit 1=1, bit 0=0.

Constraints:

- For bit 0 (x_0=0): each segment's XOR bit 0=0.

- For bit 1 (x_1=1): at least one segment has XOR bit 1=1.

Let's see k=2:

- Segment 1: [1,1], XOR=1 (bit 0=1, bit 1=0)

- Segment 2: [2,2], XOR=1 (bit 0=1, bit 1=0)

- OR=1 | 1 =1 <x=2.

But according to the constraints for bit 0 (x_0=0), each segment's XOR bit 0 must be 0, but here both segments have XOR bit 0=1, which violates the constraint.

Hence, k=2 is not acceptable.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, it was said that k=2 is possible with OR=1 <=x=2.

But according to the constraints for x_i=0, it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in this case, for bit 0 (x_0=0), each segment's XOR bit 0 must be 0.

But in k=2, both segments have XOR bit 0=1, which violates the constraint.

Hence, k=2 is invalid.

Wait, but in the initial explanation, it was considered acceptable because OR=1 <=x=2.

But according to the constraints, it's invalid.

Hence, k=2 is invalid.

Only k=1 is valid.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for this test case, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the output for the second test case is 2.

But according to the constraints, it should be invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, in the second test case:

n=2, x=2

a=[1,1]

Possible k=2:

- Segment 1: [1,1], XOR=1

- Segment 2: [2,2], XOR=1

OR:1 |1=1 <=2.

Hence, acceptable.

But according to my earlier logic, it's invalid because for bit 0 (x_0=0), each segment's XOR bit 0 must be 0, but here both segments have XOR bit 0=1.

Hence, it should be invalid.

But the problem accepts it as valid.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the constraints.

Wait, re-reading:

"The bitwise OR of the XORs of each segment should be less than or equal to a given number x."

So, OR of segment XORs <=x.

In this case, OR=1 <=x=2 is true.

Hence, it's acceptable.

But according to my earlier logic, for bits where x_i=0, all segment XORs must have that bit=0.

But in this case, for bit 0 (x_0=0), segment XORs have bit 0=1, but the OR still satisfies OR <=x because OR bit 0=1 <=x bit 0=0.

Wait, no.

Wait, for OR <=x, for each bit i:

- If x_i=0, then OR_i must be 0.

- If x_i=1, OR_i can be 0 or 1.

In this case, OR=1 in binary is 01, x=2 is 10.

For bit 0: x_0=0, OR_0=1, which is not <=x, since 1 >0.

Wait, but 1 in binary is 01, x=2 is 10.

OR <=x means that for each bit, OR_i <=x_i.

But in binary, 01 <=10 is true because bit 0:1<=0 is false, but in bitwise comparison, OR <=x should be considered in terms of binary values, not bit by bit.

Wait, no.

In terms of integer values, 1 <=2 is true.

But in terms of bit positions, for OR to be <=x, for each bit position i, OR_i <=x_i.

But in this case, OR bit 0=1, x bit 0=0, which is invalid.

Hence, the condition should be that OR <=x in integer value.

But in the problem, it's likely that OR <=x in integer value, not considering each bit independently.

Wait, but the problem says:

"(a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x"

So, the OR of the XORs of the segments should be <=x.

Hence, it's the integer value OR compared to x.

In the second test case, OR=1 <=x=2 is true, so it's acceptable.

Hence, my earlier logic is flawed.

I cannot treat each bit independently in terms of x_i=0 and x_i=1 constraints.

Instead, I need to ensure that the OR of the segment XORs is <=x as integer values.

Hence, I need a different approach.

Perhaps I need to consider the bits in decreasing order of significance and make decisions accordingly.

Let me think differently.

An alternative approach is to iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and maintain a mask that represents the OR of the segment XORs.

I can try to maximize k by splitting the array into as many segments as possible while ensuring that the OR of their XORs is <=x.

To do this efficiently, I can process the array while keeping track of the current XOR up to each position and see where to split segments.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach inspired by the reference solution.

I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant.

For each bit, I can handle the constraints imposed by x_i.

I can maintain a list t that represents the current segments based on the constraints of the higher bits.

Then, for the current bit, I can further split these segments if necessary to satisfy the constraints for this bit.

Finally, I can update t for the next bit.

At the end, the maximum k is the maximum number of segments that satisfy all the constraints.

Now, let's see how this works in code.

Looking at the reference solution:

- It reads t and x.

- It reads the array a.

- It initializes t as an empty list and ans as -1.

- Then, it loops through bits from 29 to 0.

- For each bit i:

- It computes u = (x >> i) &1

- It computes v = sum( (a[j] >>i)&1 for j in range(n) )

- If u==v==0, it continues to the next bit.

- If u==0 and v %2 ==1, it returns ans.

- Else, if u==0:

- It processes the array to split segments where the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0.

- It updates t with these segments' XORs.

- Sets a to t and t to empty.

- Else (u==1):

- If v %2 ==1:

- Continue.

- Else, if v:

- It counts the number of times the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0.

- Updates ans with this count.

- Else:

- Break.

- Finally, it returns the maximum of ans and the number of segments in the current a.

This seems to be implementing the approach I thought of earlier.

Let me try to understand this code step by step.

First, it processes bits from 29 to 0.

For each bit i:

- u = (x >> i) &1: the i-th bit of x.

- v = sum( (a[j] >>i)&1 for j in range(n) ): the sum of the i-th bits of all a[j].

Case 1: u==v==0

- Continue to the next bit.

Case 2: u==0 and v %2 ==1

- Return ans.

Case 3: u==0 and v %2 ==0 and v !=0

- Process the array to split segments where the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0.

- Update t with these segments' XORs.

- Set a to t and t to empty.

Case 4: u==1 and v %2 ==1

- Continue.

Case 5: u==1 and v %2 ==0 and v !=0

- Count the number of times the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0.

- Update ans with this count.

Case 6: u==1 and v ==0

- Break.

Finally, return the maximum of ans and the number of segments in the current a.

Let me try to understand why this works.

First, for bits where x_i=0:

- If v (sum of a_j_i) is odd (v %2 ==1), but x_i=0, it's impossible to have all segment XORs for this bit equal to 0, because the total XOR would be 1, which cannot be split into segments with XOR 0 for this bit.

Hence, in this case, return ans=-1.

- If v is even (v %2 ==0) and v !=0, then it's possible to split the array into segments where each segment's XOR for this bit is 0.

Hence, process the array to find such segments and update a to these segments' XORs.

- If v==0, continue to the next bit.

For bits where x_i=1:

- If v is odd (v %2 ==1), it's acceptable because the OR can have bit i=1.

- If v is even (v %2 ==0) and v !=0, then at least one segment must have XOR bit i=1 to satisfy OR bit i=1.

But since v is even, it's possible that some segments have XOR bit i=1.

In this case, count the number of times the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0, which gives the number of segments where the XOR is 0.

But since x_i=1 requires at least one segment with XOR bit i=1, this count might be used to update ans.

- If v==0, break because there's no contribution to OR for this bit.

Finally, return the maximum of ans and the number of segments in the current a.

This seems to be a way to handle the constraints for each bit and maximize k accordingly.

I need to verify this with the sample inputs.

Take the first sample:

n=3, x=1, a=[1,2,3]

x=1 in binary: 001

Bits:

- Bit 0: x_0=1, v=sum(a_j_0)=1+0+1=0 (since 1=1, 2=0, 3=1)

Wait, 1 in binary: 001 -> bit 0=1

2 in binary: 010 -> bit 0=0

3 in binary: 011 -> bit 0=1

Hence, v=1+0+1=2, which is even.

Hence, for bit 0, x_i=1 and v %2 ==0.

Hence, u==1 and v %2 ==0 and v !=0.

Hence, count the number of times cumulative XOR for bit 0 is 0.

Let's compute the cumulative XOR for bit 0:

a=[1,0,1]

Cumulative XOR:

- pos 0: 1

- pos 1: 1^0=1

- pos 2: 1^1=0

Hence, cumulative XOR is 0 at pos 2.

Hence, cnt=1 (since it's 0 at the end).

Hence, ans=max(ans, cnt)=max(-1,1)=1.

Then, since it's the last bit, return max(ans, len(a))=max(1,3)=3.

But in the sample, the output is 2.

Hence, something is wrong with this logic.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the code, for u==1 and v %2 ==0 and v !=0:

- It counts the number of times the cumulative XOR for bit i is 0.

- In this case, cnt=1.

- Then, ans=max(ans, cnt)=1.

- But len(a)=3.

- So, max(1,3)=3, but the sample output is 2.

Hence, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Looking back at the code:

In func_5():

(t, ans) = ([], -1)

for i in range(29,-1,-1):

u = x >>i &1

v = sum( val >>i &1 for val in a )

if u==v==0:

continue

if u==0:

if v %2:

return ans

else:

op=ai=0

for val in a:

op ^= val >>i &1

ai ^= val

if not op:

t.append(ai)

ai=0

(a,t)=(t,[])

elif v %2:

continue

elif v:

op=cnt=0

for val in a:

op ^= val >>i &1

if not op:

cnt +=1

ans = max(ans, cnt)

else:

break

return max(ans, len(a))

In the first sample:

n=3, x=1, a=[1,2,3]

For bit 29 to bit 1 are all 0 in x, so u=0.

But v for bit 1:

a=[1(001),2(010),3(011)]

bit 1: 0+1+1=2, which is even.

Hence, u=0, v even, v !=0.

Hence, process the array to split where op=0.

Compute op and ai:

Initialize op=0, ai=0.

For val=1: op ^=1>>i&1, but i=1, 1>>1&1=0.

So, op^=0 -> op=0

ai ^=1 (since ai ^=val)

ai=1

if not op (op=0):

t.append(ai=1)

ai=0

For val=2: op ^=2>>1&1=1

ai^=2=1^2=3

if not op (op=1): no

For val=3: op ^=3>>1&1=1

op=1^1=0

ai^=3=3^3=0

if not op (op=0): t.append(ai=0)

ai=0

Hence, t=[1,0]

Then, set a=t=[1,0], t=[]

Next bit i=0:

u=1, v= sum(a_j_0 for a=[1,0]) =1+0=1, which is odd.

Hence, u==1 and v %2 ==1

Continue to next bit.

No more bits to process.

Hence, return max(ans, len(a))=max(-1,2)=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier I miscounted because after processing bit 1, a becomes [1,0], and len(a)=2.

Hence, final max(-1,2)=2.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Hence, the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to divide an array into the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to a given value `x`. The solution provided is implemented in Python and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Bitwise Analysis**:
   - We analyze each bit position from the most significant to the least significant bit.
   - For each bit, we handle constraints imposed by the corresponding bit in `x`.

2. **Processing for Each Bit**:
   - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum of that bit in the array is 0, we skip to the next bit.
   - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum of that bit in the array is odd, it's impossible to satisfy the condition, so we return the current best answer.
   - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum is even, we split the array into segments where the XOR of the segment for this bit is 0.
   - If the bit in `x` is 1 and the sum is odd, we continue to the next bit.
   - If the bit in `x` is 1 and the sum is even but non-zero, we count possible segmentations.

3. **Updating the Answer**:
   - We keep track of the best possible segmentation count and update it as we process each bit.
   - Finally, we return the maximum of the tracked answer and the number of segments in the current configuration.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def func_2():
    return int(input())

def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_4():
    return input().strip()

def func_5():
    (n, x) = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    (t, ans) = ([], -1)
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u = x >> i & 1
        v = sum(val >> i & 1 for val in a)
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                (a, t) = (t, [])
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i &1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
    return max(ans, len(a))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())
```

### Explanation

- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - We use bitwise XOR (`^`) to compute the XOR of segments and bitwise OR (`|`) to combine these XOR values.
  
- **Efficient Segmentation**:
  - By processing bits from the most significant to the least significant, we ensure that higher bits' constraints are satisfied first, allowing us to build upon these constraints for lower bits.
  
- **Dynamic Adjustment of Segments**:
  - We dynamically adjust the segments based on the constraints of each bit, ensuring that the final segmentation meets the condition for all bits.

This approach ensures that we handle the constraints efficiently and find the maximum number of segments possible under the given conditions.
