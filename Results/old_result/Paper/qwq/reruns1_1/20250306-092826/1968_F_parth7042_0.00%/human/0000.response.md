Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into K parts, where K is greater than 1, and the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they're the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. Given a subarray from index L to R, I need to check if it can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR values.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to consider the XOR of the entire subarray and see if it can be divided into segments where each segment's XOR equals some value.

Wait, but the segments need to have the same XOR value. So, if the total XOR from L to R is X, and I want to split it into K parts each with XOR X, then the XOR of the entire subarray should be equal to X XOR X XOR ... K times. But since XOR is associative and commutative, if K is even, the total XOR would be 0, and if K is odd, it would be X.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think differently.

I recall that the XOR of a subarray from L to R can be computed using prefix XOR arrays. If I have a prefix XOR array where pf[i] is the XOR from index 1 to i, then the XOR from L to R is pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

So, pf[R] XOR pf[L-1] gives me the XOR of the subarray from L to R.

Now, for the subarray from L to R to be interesting, I need to split it into K parts where K > 1, and each part has the same XOR value.

Let's denote the desired XOR value for each part as X. Then, for the entire subarray, the XOR should be equal to X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even. But this seems messy.

Another approach: Suppose I can find at least one index M where L <= M < R, such that the XOR from L to M is equal to the XOR from M+1 to R. Then, I can split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR, and each part would have XOR X.

But wait, the problem allows K > 1, so it could be split into more than two parts, all with the same XOR.

But if I can split it into two parts with equal XOR, then potentially, each of those parts could be further split into parts with the same XOR, and so on.

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the total XOR from L to R as X. If X is 0, then it's easy: I can split the subarray into any number of parts, and as long as each part has XOR 0, which is possible if the subarray can be split into parts where each part's XOR is 0.

But in general, if X is not zero, I need to find a way to split the subarray into K parts where each part has XOR X.

Wait, here's an idea: If I can find at least one index M where L <= M < R, such that the XOR from L to M is equal to X, and the XOR from M+1 to R is also equal to X, then I can split it into two parts, each with XOR X.

And if I can do this recursively, I can split further.

But how do I efficiently check this for many queries?

Computing the XOR for every possible split point M for each query would be too slow, especially since N and Q can be up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about prefix XOR values again. If I have the prefix XOR array pf[], then the XOR from L to R is pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

Suppose I want the XOR from L to M to be X, which means pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] = X, so pf[M] = pf[L-1] XOR X.

Similarly, the XOR from M+1 to R should be X, which means pf[R] XOR pf[M] = X, so pf[R] XOR (pf[L-1] XOR X) = X.

Simplifying that: pf[R] XOR pf[L-1] XOR X = X, which simplifies to pf[R] XOR pf[L-1] = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that pf[R] = pf[L-1], which means the XOR from L to R is 0.

But in that case, X would be 0, and the subarray can be split into any number of parts with XOR 0.

But the problem allows K > 1, so if the total XOR is 0, then it's possible to split it into two parts with XOR 0, assuming each part has XOR 0.

But this seems too simplistic. Let's see with an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Query: L=1, R=5

The XOR from 1 to 5 is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 is 0, 0 XOR 2 is 2, 2 XOR 3 is 1, 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, X = 1.

Now, I need to see if I can split this into K > 1 parts, each with XOR 1.

For example, split into [1], [1,2,3,0], where [1] has XOR 1, and [1,2,3,0] has XOR 1.

Yes, that works.

Another split: [1,1], [2,3,0], where [1,1] has XOR 0, which is not equal to X=1, so that's invalid.

Wait, no, the XOR of [1,1] is 0, not 1, so it doesn't match.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says [1], [1], [2,3,0], which are XOR 1, 1, and 1 respectively.

So, in this case, K=3, and each part has XOR 1.

How can I generalize this?

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R to be split into K parts with XOR X, the total XOR from L to R should be equal to X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

Wait, no. Because XOR is not additive in that way.

Wait, actually, in XOR, if you have K parts each with XOR X, then the total XOR is X XOR X XOR ... K times.

If K is even, X XOR X is 0, and so on.

So, the total XOR from L to R should be:

- If K is even: 0

- If K is odd: X

But in the first example, X=1, and the total XOR is 1, which matches X when K is odd.

But in this case, K=3, which is odd, and total XOR is X=1.

Wait, but in the second query of the first test case:

L=2, R=4

Subarray [1,2,3]

XOR from 2 to 4 is a[2]=1, a[3]=2, a[4]=3

1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

So, X=0

Can I split it into K >1 parts, each with XOR 0?

For example, [1,2], [3], where 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is not 0, so invalid.

Or [1], [2,3], where [1] has XOR 1, [2,3] has XOR 1, both are not 0.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's possible to split [1,2,3] into [1,2],[3], because 1 XOR 2 = 3, which equals 3.

Wait, but 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 XOR 3 is 0, which is X=0.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

If the total XOR from L to R is X, and I want to split it into K parts each with XOR X, then:

- If K is 2, then the total XOR would be X XOR X = 0

- If K is 3, total XOR would be X XOR X XOR X = X

- If K is 4, total XOR would be X XOR X XOR X XOR X = 0

And so on.

So, for the total XOR to be consistent with K parts each having XOR X, the total XOR should be:

- 0 if K is even

- X if K is odd

But in the first example, X=1, and total XOR is 1, which matches X when K is odd.

In the second query, X=0, and it's possible to split into K=2 parts, each with XOR 0.

Wait, but in that case, the total XOR would be 0 XOR 0 = 0, which matches the total XOR.

So, in general, for a subarray from L to R with total XOR X, it's possible to split it into K parts with each part having XOR X, if:

- If K is even, total XOR is 0

- If K is odd, total XOR is X

But the problem allows any K >1, so I need to check if there exists at least one K >1 that satisfies this condition.

Wait, but in the first query, X=1, and K=3 (odd) works, because total XOR is X.

In the second query, X=0, and K=2 (even) works, because total XOR is 0.

In the third query, X=2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, which is not 0, so can't be split into K=2 parts with XOR 1 each, because total XOR would be 0, but actual is 1.

Wait, no, for K=2, total XOR should be 0, but actual is 1, so it's not possible.

Wait, but in the first query, X=1, and K=3 (odd) works because total XOR is X=1.

But in the third query, X=1, and perhaps K=3 is possible, but according to the output, it's NO.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that K >1 and the subarray must be split into K consecutive segments, each with XOR X, and the entire subarray's XOR is X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

But in the third query, L=3, R=5, subarray [2,3,0], XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 =1.

If K=3 (odd), total XOR should be X=1, which matches.

But according to the output, it's NO.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the first test case's queries:

1. L=1, R=5: YES (K=3)

2. L=2, R=4: YES (K=2)

3. L=3, R=5: NO

4. L=1, R=3: NO

5. L=3, R=4: NO

Wait, for L=3, R=5, subarray [2,3,0], XOR is 1.

If K=3, total XOR should be X=1, which matches.

But why is it NO?

Perhaps because there's no way to split [2,3,0] into 3 parts with each XOR=1.

Let's see:

Possible splits:

- [2], [3], [0]: XORs are 2, 3, 0 – not all 1

- [2,3], [0]: XORs are 1, 0 – not both 1

- [2], [3,0]: XORs are 2, 1 – not both 1

So, indeed, there's no way to split [2,3,0] into parts where each part has XOR=1.

Hence, even though the total XOR is 1, which matches X for K=3, it's still not possible because no split yields parts with XOR=1.

So, my earlier condition is necessary but not sufficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R to be interesting, there must exist at least one way to split it into K >1 parts, each with the same XOR value.

To achieve this, I can look for repeated patterns in the XOR values.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of periodicity in the prefix XOR array.

If the prefix XOR repeats at certain intervals, that could indicate that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

Let me think about prefix XOR values.

Define pf[i] as the XOR of elements from index 1 to i.

Then, the XOR from L to R is pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

Now, suppose I want to split the subarray from L to R into K parts, each with XOR X.

Then, for each split point M1, M2, ..., MK-1, the XOR from L to M1, M1+1 to M2, and so on, up to MK-1+1 to R, should all be equal to X.

This implies that:

pf[M1] XOR pf[L-1] = X

pf[M2] XOR pf[M1] = X

...

pf[R] XOR pf[MK-1] = X

Which implies that:

pf[M1] = pf[L-1] XOR X

pf[M2] = pf[M1] XOR X = pf[L-1] XOR X XOR X = pf[L-1]

pf[M3] = pf[M2] XOR X = pf[L-1] XOR X

...

So, the prefix XOR values at the split points alternate between pf[L-1] and pf[L-1] XOR X.

But since X is the same for all parts, and the total XOR from L to R is X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R to be interesting, the following must hold:

- The total XOR from L to R is X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

- There exists at least one way to split the subarray into K parts with each part's XOR equal to X.

But determining K is part of the problem, so I need a way to check if such a K exists for a given subarray.

An alternative approach is to note that if the XOR from L to R is X, and there exists at least one index M where L <= M < R such that the XOR from L to M is X and the XOR from M+1 to R is X, then I can split it into two parts, each with XOR X.

Moreover, if I can find multiple such M's, I can split it into more parts.

But checking this directly for each query would be too slow for the constraints.

I need a way to preprocess the array to answer queries efficiently.

Let me consider precomputing the prefix XOR array pf[].

Then, for each query from L to R, I can compute X = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

Now, if X == 0, then it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

But I need to check if there's at least one way to split it into K >1 parts with equal XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there's any M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == X and pf[R] XOR pf[M] == X.

Wait, let's see:

If pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == X, then pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR X.

Similarly, pf[R] XOR pf[M] == X implies pf[R] == pf[M] XOR X == (pf[L-1] XOR X) XOR X == pf[L-1].

So, pf[R] == pf[L-1].

But that would imply that the total XOR from L to R is pf[R] XOR pf[L-1] == pf[L-1] XOR pf[L-1] == 0.

So, in this case, X == 0.

But in the general case, pf[R] == pf[L-1] XOR (X XOR X) == pf[L-1].

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to rephrase.

Given X = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1], I need to find if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR X and pf[R] == pf[M] XOR X.

But pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR X, and pf[R] == pf[M] XOR X, which substitutes to pf[R] == (pf[L-1] XOR X) XOR X == pf[L-1].

So, pf[R] == pf[L-1], which implies that X == 0.

Therefore, if X != 0, it's impossible to find such an M.

But in the first example, X=1, and yet it's possible to split it into parts with XOR=1.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R to be interesting, there must be at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, for K=2, I need to find M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == pf[R] XOR pf[M].

Let me set pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == pf[R] XOR pf[M].

Let me solve for M:

pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == pf[R] XOR pf[M]

Bring pf[M] to one side:

pf[M] XOR pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == pf[R]

Which simplifies to pf[L-1] == pf[R], meaning pf[R] == pf[L-1].

So, only if pf[R] == pf[L-1], which implies that the XOR from L to R is 0, can I find such an M.

But in the first example, pf[R] XOR pf[L-1] = 1, not 0.

So, in that case, I cannot split it into two parts with equal XOR.

But the first example shows that it's possible to split into three parts with equal XOR=1.

So, my earlier approach for K=2 doesn't cover higher K values.

I need a better way to handle K >1 in general.

Let me think about the total XOR.

If I split the subarray into K parts, each with XOR X, then the total XOR is X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

So, for a given subarray with total XOR S, I need to find if there exists a K >1 such that S == X if K is odd, or S == 0 if K is even.

But X is the XOR of each part, which is also equal to S if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

Wait, that seems circular.

Perhaps I need to consider that X can be any value, and I need to find if there exists a K >1 and an X such that the subarray can be split into K parts with each part's XOR equal to X.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to realize that for the subarray to be interesting, the XOR of the subarray must be achievable by splitting it into multiple parts with equal XOR.

I recall that in XOR properties, if I have a subarray with XOR S, and I want to split it into K parts with each part's XOR equal to X, then S must be equal to X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

But I need to find if there exists such a K >1.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if the total XOR S is 0, then it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with each part's XOR being 0.

But in reality, for XOR, splitting into parts with equal XOR isn't straightforward.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix X, the XOR value for each part, and then see if the subarray can be split into multiple parts with each part's XOR equal to X.

But X isn't given; it's determined by the subarray and the way it's split.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in some problems involving XOR, using the property of prefix XOR sums can help in determining subarrays with certain XOR properties.

Perhaps I can precompute the prefix XOR array and then, for each query, compute the XOR of the subarray and then check if it can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR.

But how?

Wait, here's an idea:

- Compute the prefix XOR array pf[] where pf[i] is the XOR of elements from index 1 to i.

- For a query from L to R, the XOR of the subarray is S = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

- Now, if S == 0, then it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

- If S != 0, then it's only possible to split it into an odd number of parts, each with XOR S.

But, to confirm if such a split exists, I need to check if there are at least two parts.

For S == 0:

- I need to check if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == 0 and pf[R] XOR pf[M] == 0.

Which simplifies to pf[M] == pf[L-1], and pf[R] == pf[M], meaning pf[R] == pf[L-1].

So, if pf[R] == pf[L-1], then S == 0, and I can split it into two parts, each with XOR 0.

For S != 0:

- I need to check if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == S and pf[R] XOR pf[M] == S.

From earlier, this would require pf[R] == pf[L-1], but that would imply S == 0, which contradicts S != 0.

So, perhaps it's impossible to split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR if S != 0.

But in the first example, S=1, and it's possible to split into three parts with each part's XOR equal to 1.

So, my approach is incomplete.

I need a better way to handle splits into more than two parts.

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R with XOR S, and I want to split it into K parts with each part's XOR equal to X.

Then, S must be equal to X if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

Moreover, K must be at least 2.

So, for S == 0:

- K must be even.

- Each part must have XOR 0.

- So, I need to find at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] XOR pf[L-1] == 0 and pf[R] XOR pf[M] == 0, which requires pf[M] == pf[L-1] and pf[R] == pf[M], i.e., pf[R] == pf[L-1].

For S != 0:

- K must be odd and at least 3.

- S must be equal to X.

- I need to find at least two M's where L <= M1 < M2 < R such that pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR X and pf[M2] == pf[L-1].

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me try a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to check if a subarray can be split into parts with equal properties, we can look for repeating patterns in the prefix sums or, in this case, prefix XORs.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the positions where certain prefix XOR values occur and see if those positions allow for splits into multiple parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider that for a subarray from L to R to be split into K parts with equal XOR X, the prefix XOR values at the split points must follow a certain pattern.

Specifically, starting from pf[L-1], the next split point M1 should have pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR X.

Then, the next split point M2 should have pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR X, and so on, until pf[R] == pf[MK-1] XOR X.

So, in other words, the prefix XOR values at the split points should form a sequence where each step is XOR X.

Therefore, to check if such a split exists, I need to see if there are enough split points with pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR X within the subarray from L to R.

But determining this for each query seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all positions where pf[i] equals certain values and then, for each query, check if there are sufficient such positions within the subarray.

Let me think about it.

If I precompute for each possible pf value, the list of positions where pf[i] equals that value.

Then, for a query from L to R, with S = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1], I can:

- If S == 0, check if pf[R] == pf[L-1], which would allow splitting into an even number of parts with XOR 0.

- If S != 0, check if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S.

But earlier, I saw that for S != 0, pf[R] must equal pf[L-1], which would make S == 0, but that contradicts S != 0.

So perhaps this approach is still flawed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider multiple split points.

For S != 0, to split into K parts with each part's XOR equal to S, I need to have pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S, pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR S, and so on, up to pf[R] == pf[MK-1] XOR S.

Given that, perhaps I can check if there are enough M's within the subarray that satisfy pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S.

But I need to ensure that these M's are in the correct order and positions.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I fix L and R, and compute S = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

If S == 0, then I need to split the subarray into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

This is possible if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] == pf[L-1], meaning the XOR from L to M is 0, and pf[R] == pf[M], meaning the XOR from M+1 to R is also 0.

This is equivalent to pf[M] == pf[L-1] and pf[R] == pf[L-1].

So, if pf[R] == pf[L-1], then I can split the subarray into two parts, each with XOR 0.

Similarly, I can split it into more even parts if there are multiple M's satisfying pf[M] == pf[L-1].

For S != 0, it's only possible to split into an odd number of parts, each with XOR S.

In this case, I need to find at least two M's where pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S and pf[M] == pf[R] XOR S, but this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to find M's such that pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S, and then ensure that pf[R] == pf[M] XOR S.

Given that, pf[R] == (pf[L-1] XOR S) XOR S == pf[L-1].

But this again implies that pf[R] == pf[L-1], which would make S == 0, contradicting S != 0.

So, perhaps it's impossible to split the subarray into multiple parts with equal XOR if the total XOR is not consistent with the required pattern.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in some problems involving splits into subarrays with equal sums, we can use dynamic programming or other techniques to check for possible splits.

But with XOR, the properties are different, and such approaches might not directly apply.

Another idea: For a subarray from L to R to be interesting, there must be at least one way to split it into K >1 parts with equal XOR.

This is equivalent to finding a sequence of split points where the XOR between consecutive points is equal.

This sounds similar to finding a periodic pattern in the prefix XOR array.

If the difference (in terms of XOR) between certain prefix values is equal, then such splits are possible.

But I need a way to efficiently check this for each query.

Let me consider precomputing for each possible XOR value the positions where the prefix XOR equals that value.

Then, for a query from L to R, with S = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1], I can:

- If S == 0, check if pf[R] == pf[L-1]. If so, it's possible to split into an even number of parts with XOR 0.

- If S != 0, check if there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S and pf[R] == pf[M] XOR S.

But, as before, pf[R] == pf[L-1], which would imply S == 0, contradicting S != 0.

So, perhaps for S != 0, it's impossible to split the subarray into multiple parts with equal XOR.

But that can't be right, because in the first example, S=1, and it's possible to split into three parts with each XOR=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple split points.

Let me consider that for S !=0, to split into K parts with each XOR S, the following must hold:

- pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S

- pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR S

- ...

- pf[R] == pf[MK-1] XOR S

So, in the first example, L=1, R=5, S=1.

I need to find M1, M2, ..., MK-1 such that:

pf[M1] == pf[0] XOR 1 = 0 XOR 1 = 1

pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR 1 = 1 XOR 1 = 0

pf[R] == pf[MK-1] XOR 1

Wait, in the first example, pf[0]=0, pf[1]=1, pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2, pf[4]=1, pf[5]=1.

So, for K=3, M1=1, M2=2:

pf[M1] = pf[1] = 1 == pf[0] XOR 1 = 1

pf[M2] = pf[2] = 0 == pf[1] XOR 1 = 0

pf[5] = 1 == pf[2] XOR 1 = 0 XOR 1 = 1

This works.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But how to generalize this for any query?

It seems that for S !=0, I need to find a sequence of M's where pf[Mi] alternates between pf[L-1] and pf[L-1] XOR S.

In the above example, pf[L-1]=0, S=1, so pf[M1]=1, pf[M2]=0, pf[M3]=1, and so on.

Given that, I need to ensure that within the subarray from L to R, there are enough M's with pf[M] equal to pf[L-1] or pf[L-1] XOR S, in the correct order.

This seems too involved to implement efficiently for large N and Q.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray from L to R to be interesting, the total XOR S must be achievable by splitting into K parts with each part's XOR equal to X, where X is S if K is odd, or 0 if K is even.

So, for S == 0:

- K must be even.

- Each part must have XOR 0.

- There must be at least one way to split the subarray into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

For S != 0:

- K must be odd and at least 3.

- Each part must have XOR S.

- There must be at least two split points where pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S.

But I'm still stuck on how to efficiently check this for each query.

Perhaps I can simplify the condition.

Let me consider that for S == 0, it's possible to split into any even number of parts with XOR 0, provided that there exists at least one M where L <= M < R such that pf[M] == pf[L-1].

In other words, there exists a point M where the XOR from L to M is 0, and the XOR from M+1 to R is also 0.

This can be checked by seeing if there's any M in [L, R-1] where pf[M] == pf[L-1] and pf[R] == pf[L-1].

Wait, but pf[R] == pf[L-1] implies that the total XOR is 0.

So, for S ==0, I just need to check if pf[R] == pf[L-1], which is equivalent to S ==0.

Then, within the subarray, I need at least one M where pf[M] == pf[L-1].

If such an M exists, then I can split the subarray into two parts: [L, M] with XOR 0 and [M+1, R] with XOR 0.

If no such M exists, then it's impossible to split into two parts with XOR 0.

For S !=0, it's more complicated.

I need to find at least two split points M1 and M2 such that pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S, pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR S, and pf[R] == pf[M2] XOR S.

Given that, for K=3, I need M1 and M2 where:

pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S

pf[M2] == pf[M1] XOR S == pf[L-1] XOR S XOR S == pf[L-1]

pf[R] == pf[M2] XOR S == pf[L-1] XOR S

But pf[R] == pf[L-1] XOR S, which should be equal to S, since S = pf[R] XOR pf[L-1].

So, pf[R] == pf[L-1] XOR S => pf[R] == pf[L-1] XOR (pf[R] XOR pf[L-1]) => pf[R] == pf[R], which is always true.

Hence, for S !=0, as long as there exists at least one M1 where L <= M1 < R and pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S, and at least one M2 where M1 < M2 < R and pf[M2] == pf[L-1], and pf[R] == pf[M2] XOR S, which is always true, then it's possible to split into K=3 parts.

But in practice, this might not be possible because the positions of M1 and M2 need to be within the subarray and satisfy the order.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that for S !=0, it's possible to split the subarray into K=3 parts if there exists at least one M1 where L <= M1 < R and pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S, and at least one M2 where M1 < M2 < R and pf[M2] == pf[L-1].

So, in other words, in the subarray from L to R, there must be at least one M1 where pf[M1] == pf[L-1] XOR S and at least one M2 where pf[M2] == pf[L-1], with M1 < M2.

But this seems too vague to implement efficiently.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for any subarray with total XOR S:

- If S ==0, it's possible to split into an even number of parts with XOR 0, provided there exists at least one M where L <= M < R and pf[M] == pf[L-1].

- If S !=0, it's possible to split into an odd number of parts with XOR S, provided there exists at least one M where L <= M < R and pf[M] == pf[L-1] XOR S.

But in the first example, S=1, and pf[L-1]=0, so pf[M] ==0 XOR 1=1.

Looking at pf[]: [0,1,0,2,1,1]

For L=1, R=5:

pf[M] ==1, and M must be in [1,4].

There are M=1, M=4, M=5.

But M must be <R=5, so M=1 and M=4.

Then, pf[1]=1 and pf[4]=1, which satisfy pf[M]==1.

Hence, it's possible to split into K=3 parts.

Similarly, for L=2, R=4:

pf[L-1]=pf[1]=1

S=pf[4] XOR pf[1]=1 XOR 1=0

So, S==0, and pf[R]=pf[4]=
