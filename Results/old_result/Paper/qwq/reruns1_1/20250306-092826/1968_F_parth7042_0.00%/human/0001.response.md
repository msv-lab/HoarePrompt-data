Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what XOR means. XOR, or exclusive or, is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is asking whether a subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to approach this. I know that XOR has some properties that might be useful here. For instance, the XOR of a subarray from l to r can be calculated using prefix XOR arrays. A prefix XOR array is where each element at index i is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.

So, if I have a prefix XOR array, pf, then the XOR of elements from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Given that, I need to find if there's a way to split the subarray from l to r into at least two parts where each part's XOR is equal.

Let's consider an example to understand this better. Suppose the subarray is [1, 1, 2, 3, 0], and we need to split it into parts where each part's XOR is equal.

From the problem statement, one possible split is [1], [1], [2, 3, 0], and indeed, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 is also 0.

Another split could be [1,1],[2,3,0], and again, both parts have XOR 0.

So, in this case, the subarray is interesting.

Now, how can I generalize this?

I need a way to check, for a given subarray from l to r, whether it can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

One way to think about this is to look for points in the subarray where the cumulative XOR up to that point is equal to the target XOR value.

Wait, but the target XOR value is not given directly. It's the XOR of one of the parts.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the subarray from l to r, if I can find at least one point i, where l <= i < r, such that the XOR from l to i is equal to the XOR from i+1 to r.

But actually, since I need at least two parts, and potentially more, it's a bit trickier.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the entire subarray's XOR from l to r as X.

If I can find at least one point i, where l <= i < r, such that the XOR from l to i is equal to X, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also X, then that would mean both parts have XOR X.

Wait, but if the XOR from l to i is X, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also X, then the XOR of the entire subarray would be X XOR X, which is 0.

So, for this to hold, the total XOR from l to r must be 0.

But in the example given, the total XOR from l to r is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 is 0, 0 XOR 2 is 2, 2 XOR 3 is 1, 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, in this case, the total XOR is 1, which is not 0.

Wait, but in the example, it's possible to split it into parts with equal XOR.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to rethink this approach.

Let me consider that if the total XOR from l to r is X, and I want to split the subarray into k parts where each part has XOR X, then the XOR of all parts combined should be X if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But wait, actually, no.

Because XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of multiple parts' XORs would not necessarily follow that pattern.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose the total XOR from l to r is X.

If I can split the subarray into k parts where each part has XOR X, then the overall XOR would be X if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

Given that, for the subarray to be interesting, k must be at least 2.

So, if k is 2, the total XOR would be 0.

If k is 3, total XOR would be X.

If k is 4, total XOR would be 0.

And so on.

Wait, that seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let's consider that if I can find at least one point i in the subarray where the XOR from l to i is equal to X, then the remaining part from i+1 to r should have XOR X as well, because XOR from l to i is X, and from i+1 to r is X, so total XOR is X XOR X which is 0.

But in the example, the total XOR is 1, not 0.

I'm getting confused here.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that in problems involving XOR and subarrays, prefix XOR arrays are very useful.

So, let's define pf[i] as the prefix XOR up to index i.

Then, the XOR of any subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, I need to split it into k parts where k > 1, and each part has the same XOR value.

Let me denote the desired XOR value for each part as Y.

So, each part should have XOR Y.

Then, the total XOR from l to r would be Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y, k times.

If k is even, then total XOR is 0.

If k is odd, total XOR is Y.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the total XOR is either 0 or Y.

But in the problem, the total XOR from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] is 0, then k must be even, and Y can be any value that divides the subarray into even parts with equal XOR.

If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] is Y, then k must be odd.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider that the XOR of each part is Y.

Then, for k parts, the total XOR would be Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y.

If k is even, this is 0.

If k is odd, this is Y.

So, for the subarray from l to r, if its total XOR is 0, then k must be even.

If its total XOR is Y, then k must be odd.

But I don't know Y in advance.

Wait, but Y is the XOR of each part.

Given that, perhaps I can set Y to be the total XOR divided by some k.

But XOR isn't divisible in the traditional sense.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Y is the total XOR, and k is the number of parts.

This is getting messy.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in some problems, to check if a subarray can be split into parts with equal sums, you can look for occurrences of prefix sums.

Maybe something similar applies here with XOR.

Let me consider that.

If I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into parts with equal XOR, maybe I can look for points where the prefix XOR up to that point minus the prefix XOR at l-1 is equal to Y.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the prefix XOR and see if there are multiple points where the prefix XOR minus pf[l-1] is equal to Y.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I found that in some XOR problems, using the property that if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, then the subarray from l to r has XOR 0.

In this case, if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, then the subarray from l to r can be split into an even number of parts, each with equal XOR.

So, in this case, the answer is YES.

Wait, is that always true?

In the first query of the example, the subarray from 1 to 5 has XOR 1, which is not 0, and it's still considered interesting.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that for the first query, it's possible to split it into parts with equal XOR, even though the total XOR is not 0.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, if the total XOR is X, and I want to split it into k parts where each part has XOR X, then k must be odd if X != 0, and k can be any even number if X == 0.

Wait, perhaps.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider the total XOR of the subarray is X.

If k is odd, then the total XOR would be X.

If k is even, the total XOR would be 0.

So, for the subarray to be interesting:

- If X == 0, then k must be even.

- If X != 0, then k must be odd.

But I need to confirm if this is sufficient.

Wait, no.

Because in the first example, X == 1, which is not 0, and k can be odd (like k=3: [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR 1).

So, it seems that if X != 0, k must be odd.

And if X == 0, k must be even.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in the first example, k=3 (odd), and X=1.

If k=2, total XOR would be 1 XOR 1 = 0, which doesn't match X.

If k=3, total XOR would be 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which matches X.

So, it works for odd k when X != 0.

Similarly, if X == 0, k must be even to make the total XOR 0.

So, this seems to hold.

Therefore, for the subarray from l to r:

- Compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

- If X == 0, then it's possible to split into even number of parts with XOR 0.

- If X != 0, it's possible to split into odd number of parts with XOR X.

Hence, in both cases, it's possible to split, so the answer is always YES.

But that can't be right because in the example, some queries have NO as the answer.

Wait, there must be more to it.

Let me think again.

Suppose X == 0.

Then, to split into even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

Is that always possible?

Consider a subarray with XOR 0.

For example, [1,1], which has XOR 0.

Can I split it into two parts, each with XOR 0?

Yes, [1],[1], both have XOR 0.

Another example, [1,1,1,1], which has XOR 0.

I can split it into [1,1],[1,1], both with XOR 0.

So, seems possible.

But what if the subarray is [1,0], which has XOR 1 XOR 0 = 1.

I need to split it into odd number of parts, each with XOR 1.

Possible splits:

- [1],[0]: XOR 1 and 0, which are not equal.

- [1,0]: XOR 1, which is just one part.

Can't split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Hence, it's not possible.

So, in this case, even though X != 0, and k needs to be odd, it's not always possible to split.

Hence, simply knowing X and the required k parity is not sufficient.

I need a way to check if there exists at least one split that satisfies the condition.

Let me think about how to check for the existence of such a split.

Suppose I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

I can iterate through the subarray, calculating the cumulative XOR, and look for points where the cumulative XOR equals X, where X is the target XOR for each part.

Wait, but I don't know X in advance.

Wait, I do know X, because X is the XOR of the entire subarray divided by k, but since XOR isn't divisible, I need another way.

Wait, perhaps I can fix X as the XOR of the entire subarray, and then look for points where the cumulative XOR equals X, 2X, 3X, etc., but since XOR isn't additive, this doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for the subarray from l to r, with total XOR X, I need to find points where the cumulative XOR up to that point is equal to X, meaning that the part before that point has XOR X, and then continue this process.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, using maps to store prefix XOR values can help in determining the number of subarrays with a particular XOR.

Maybe I can use that here.

Let me define a prefix XOR array pf, where pf[i] is the XOR of elements from index 1 to i.

Then, the XOR of any subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, I need to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider that each part has XOR Y.

Then, the total XOR is Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y.

If k is even, total XOR is 0.

If k is odd, total XOR is Y.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the total XOR is either 0 or Y.

Given that, for the subarray from l to r:

- If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] == 0, then k must be even.

- If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] == Y, then k must be odd.

But I don't know Y in advance.

Wait, but Y is the XOR of each part.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible k and see if such a split exists.

But with q up to 2e5, and n up to 2e5, iterating through all possible k isn't efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if the total XOR is X, and I want to split it into k parts with each part having XOR Y, then Y must be equal to X if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true.

Because, as I saw earlier, for k even, total XOR is 0, and for k odd, total XOR is Y.

Hence, Y must satisfy that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y equals X, depending on k.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try another angle.

Suppose I fix the subarray from l to r.

I need to find if there exists at least one way to split it into k parts, where k > 1, and all parts have equal XOR.

Let me consider that between parts, the cumulative XOR should be equal to Y.

So, if I have splits at positions i1, i2, ..., ik, then pf[i1] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, pf[i2] XOR pf[i1] = Y, and so on.

This seems like I need to find positions where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, for some Y.

But again, I don't know Y.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I found a hint in the problem that says that for the subarray to be interesting, it's possible to divide it into k > 1 parts with equal XOR.

I need to find a way to check this efficiently for many queries.

Let me consider precomputing some data to answer the queries quickly.

Given that, perhaps I can precompute all possible XOR values for subarrays and store them in some structure.

But that seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can store the positions where a certain prefix XOR value occurs.

Yes, that sounds familiar.

Let me define pf[i] as the prefix XOR up to index i.

Then, for a subarray from l to r, its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, if I want to split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR, then for each split point, the cumulative XOR up to that point should be equal to some value.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the number of times a certain XOR value appears in the prefix XOR array within the subarray range.

Let me consider that.

If I have pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X, and I want to split the subarray into k parts with each part having XOR Y, then X should be equal to Y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: X = 0.

Then, to have k parts with equal XOR, k must be even, and each part must have XOR 0.

In this case, I need to find if there are at least one or more points in the subarray where the cumulative XOR up to that point is 0.

Wait, no.

Actually, for each part to have XOR 0, the cumulative XOR at each split point should be equal to the XOR up to the previous split point.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for a subarray with XOR 0, it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with each part having XOR 0.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

Take, for example, subarray [0,0], which has XOR 0.

I can split it into [0],[0], both with XOR 0.

Another example, [1,1], which has XOR 0.

I can split it into [1],[1], both with XOR 0.

Seems possible.

Now, for subarrays with XOR != 0, I need to check if it's possible to split them into an odd number of parts, each with XOR equal to the total XOR.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about another approach.

I recall that in some problems, to check if a subarray has a certain property, you can look for the frequency or occurrence of prefix sums/XORs.

In this case, perhaps I can store the positions where a certain prefix XOR value occurs and then check for each query if there are enough positions to form the required splits.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me precompute the prefix XOR array pf.

Then, for each query from l to r, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR, where k > 1.

Let me consider that the XOR of the entire subarray is X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, if X == 0, then I need to split the subarray into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

If X != 0, then I need to split it into an odd number of parts, each with XOR X.

So, for X == 0:

- I need to find at least one point i in [l, r) where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] == 0, and pf[r] XOR pf[i] == 0.

This would mean that both parts from l to i and i+1 to r have XOR 0.

Similarly, for X != 0:

- I need to find at least one point i in [l, r) where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] == X, and pf[r] XOR pf[i] == X.

Wait, but pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] is the XOR of the subarray from l to i, and pf[r] XOR pf[i] is the XOR from i+1 to r.

So, if both are equal to X, then the total XOR would be X XOR X = 0 if k is even, or X if k is odd.

But this seems inconsistent with earlier thoughts.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for X == 0, it's possible to split the subarray into any even number of parts with XOR 0.

Similarly, for X != 0, it's possible to split it into any odd number of parts with XOR X.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

Wait, perhaps not.

In the first example, for the subarray [1,1,2,3,0], X = 1.

It's split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], which are three parts with XOR 1,1,1 respectively.

So, k=3, which is odd, and total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which matches X.

In another query, [1,2,3], X = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

It can be split into [1,2],[3], both with XOR 3, but wait, 1 XOR 2 = 3, and 3 = 3, so yes.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches X == 0.

Wait, but in this case, k=2, which is even, and X == 0.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If X == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with XOR 0.

- If X != 0, then it's possible to split into any odd number of parts with XOR X.

Hence, for any subarray with X == 0, answer is YES if it can be split into even parts with XOR 0.

For X != 0, answer is YES if it can be split into odd parts with XOR X.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

In the first example, for [1,2,3], X=0, and it's split into [1,2],[3], both with XOR 0.

Wait, no, in this case, [1,2] has XOR 3, and [3] has XOR 3, which are equal, but X=0.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches X.

So, it's consistent.

Another query is [2,3,0], X=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1.

Can it be split into odd number of parts with XOR 1?

For example, [2],[3,0], where [2] has XOR 2, [3,0] has XOR 3, which are not equal.

Another way, [2,3],[0], where [2,3] has XOR 1, [0] has XOR 0, not equal.

Another way, [2],[3],[0], where XORs are 2,3,0, not equal.

Hence, it's not possible, and the answer is NO.

Wait, but according to the example, the answer is NO for this query.

So, the condition is that for X != 0, it's possible to split into odd parts with XOR X, but only if there exists at least one such split.

Hence, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR, where k > 1.

This seems tricky to implement directly.

Let me consider that for X == 0, I need to find at least two points where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1], meaning that the subarrays between these points have XOR 0.

Similarly, for X != 0, I need to find points where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR X.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try to formalize this.

For X == 0:

- I need to find at least one point i in [l, r) where pf[i] == pf[l
