Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the binary representation of the result has as many 1's as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, if n is 1, it's straightforward. I just output k itself because there's only one number, and its bitwise OR is itself.

But when n is greater than 1, I need to distribute k into n numbers such that their sum is k and their bitwise OR has as many 1's in its binary representation as possible.

I need to maximize the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

Let me consider what affects the number of 1's in the bitwise OR.

Each bit in the OR result is 1 if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

Given that, I should try to spread the 1's across different bit positions among the numbers.

Wait, but I also need to ensure that the sum of the numbers is k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2 and k=3.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2]: sum is 3, OR is 1|2=3, which has two 1's in binary (11).

- [0,3]: sum is 3, OR is 0|3=3, which also has two 1's.

- [3,0]: same as above.

- [1,2] is already considered.

So, in this case, both options give the same number of 1's in the OR.

Another example: n=2, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [1,4]: sum is 5, OR is 1|4=5 (101 in binary, two 1's).

- [5,0]: sum is 5, OR is 5|0=5, same as above.

- [3,2]: sum is 5, OR is 3|2=3|2=3 (11 in binary, two 1's).

- [4,1]: sum is 5, OR is 4|1=5 (101 in binary, two 1's).

So, in this case, all options seem to give the same number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, is that always the case?

Let me try n=3, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [1,1,3]: sum is 5, OR is 1|1|3=3 (two 1's).

- [1,2,2]: sum is 5, OR is 1|2|2=3 (two 1's).

- [0,0,5]: sum is 5, OR is 0|0|5=5 (two 1's in binary 101).

Again, seems like the number of 1's in the OR is the same.

Is there a pattern here?

It seems like, for these small values, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is limited by the number of set bits in k itself, but that doesn't seem to be the case here because in the example with n=2, k=3, the OR is 3, which has two 1's, and k=3 also has two 1's.

Wait, but in the fourth test case in the example, n=6, k=51, and the output is [3,1,1,32,2,12], whose OR is 3|1|1|32|2|12 = 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12.

Let's compute that step by step:

3 in binary: 00011

1: 00001

1: 00001

32: 100000

2: 00010

12: 01100

OR'ing them all together:

Start with 00011 OR 00001 = 00011

OR 00001: still 00011

OR 100000: 100011

OR 00010: 100011

OR 01100: 11111

Which is 31 in decimal, which has five 1's in binary.

But 51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1's.

So, by choosing numbers whose OR covers more bit positions than k alone, we can get more 1's in the OR.

That's an important insight.

So, the goal is not just to match the bits in k, but to cover as many bit positions as possible, even if that means covering bits beyond those in k.

Wait, but how is that possible? If I have numbers that have bits set beyond what's in k, but their sum is k, how does that work?

Wait, in the example, n=6, k=51, and the output is [3,1,1,32,2,12].

Sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12 = 51.

OR: 3|1|1|32|2|12 = 31 (11111 in binary), which has five 1's.

But 51 is 110011 in binary, which has four 1's.

So, by choosing numbers that cover more bit positions, even if individually they might have bits beyond those in k, their sum still adds up to k.

That's clever.

So, the strategy seems to be: to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, we need to cover as many bit positions as possible in the OR, even if that means some numbers have bits set higher than those in k.

But, we need to ensure that their sum is exactly k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One idea is to use as many numbers as possible to cover different bit positions, while keeping the sum equal to k.

Given that, perhaps I can start by assigning 1 to as many numbers as possible, and then assign the remaining value to one number.

Wait, but 1 in binary is 1, and OR'ing multiple 1's still gives 1.

That doesn't maximize the number of 1's.

Wait, no, if I have multiple numbers with different bits set to 1, their OR will have all those bits set to 1.

So, perhaps I should assign numbers with single bits set, covering different bit positions, until I run out of n or k.

Wait, but I need to sum to k.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the maximum number of distinct bit positions that can be covered with n numbers, such that their sum is k.

- To do this, I can select n-1 numbers to be as small as possible, ideally 0, but since they need to be non-negative, I can set some to 0 and the rest to cover the required bits.

Wait, but setting numbers to 0 doesn't help because their OR won't cover any bits.

Wait, no, I need to think differently.

Another idea: to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, I need to have as many unique bit positions set to 1 across the n numbers as possible.

So, I should assign each number to cover a unique set of bit positions, but overlapping is allowed as long as the OR covers more positions.

But I need to optimize this.

This seems complex.

Looking back at the provided code, let's see what it's doing.

The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

If n is 1, it simply prints k, which is correct.

Otherwise, it initializes an array arr, but in the code provided, it seems like arr is not used, and instead, a list ans is used.

Let me look at the code carefully.

It has:

if n == 1:

print(k)

else:

arr = []

k0 = k

i = 0

ans = []

temp = 1

while True:

if temp * 2 < k:

temp *= 2

i += 1

else:

break

ans.append((1 << i) - 1)

ans.append(k - sum(ans))

ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, for n >= 2, it tries to find the largest i such that (1 << i) - 1 < k.

Wait, (1 << i) - 1 is equivalent to 2^i - 1, which is a number with i bits set to 1.

Then, it appends this to ans, and appends k minus the sum of current ans to ans, and then pads the rest with zeros.

Wait, let's see with an example.

Take n=2, k=5.

It will enter the else clause.

Initialize arr = [], k0 = 5, i=0, ans=[], temp=1.

While loop:

if 1*2=2 < 5: temp=2, i=1

if 2*2=4 < 5: temp=4, i=2

if 4*2=8 < 5: no, break

So, i=2.

ans.append((1<<2)-1) = 3

ans.append(5 - 3) = 2

So, ans = [3,2]

Then, n - len(ans) = 0, so no padding.

Print 3 2.

In the example, [3,2] gives OR 3|2=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1's.

But earlier, I saw that [5,0] also gives OR 5|0=5, which is 101 in binary, two 1's.

So, both are equally good.

Hence, the code seems correct for this case.

Another example: n=2, k=3.

Following the code:

temp starts at 1.

1*2=2 < 3: temp=2, i=1

2*2=4 < 3: no, break

ans.append((1<<1)-1)=1

ans.append(3-1)=2

So, ans=[1,2]

Which matches the example.

Now, for n=6, k=51.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <51: temp=2, i=1

2*2=4 <51: temp=4, i=2

4*2=8 <51: temp=8, i=3

8*2=16 <51: temp=16, i=4

16*2=32 <51: temp=32, i=5

32*2=64 <51: no, break

ans.append((1<<5)-1)=31

ans.append(51-31)=20

Then, ans += [0]* (6-2)=4 zeros.

So, output would be 31 20 0 0 0 0

But in the example, the output is 3 1 1 32 2 12, whose OR is 31 (11111), which has five 1's.

But in the code's output, 31|20|0|0|0|0 = 31|20.

31 is 11111 and 20 is 10100.

OR'ing them gives 11111, which is 31, same as the example's OR.

So, in terms of the OR, it's the same.

But the example provided a different sequence that also achieves the same OR.

Hence, the code seems to be producing a correct sequence, though not necessarily the same as in the example.

So, as long as the OR is the same and the sum is k, it's acceptable.

Now, is the code correct in general?

Let me try to understand the logic.

The code tries to find the largest i such that (1<<i)-1 < k.

(1<<i)-1 is a number with i bits set to 1, i.e., 2^i -1.

Then, it appends this number to ans and appends k minus this number.

Then, pads the rest with zeros.

So, the OR of the sequence will be the OR of (1<<i)-1 and (k - (1<<i)-1).

Since (1<<i)-1 has the first i bits set to 1, OR'ing it with any number that has higher bits set will result in those higher bits being set.

Wait, but (1<<i)-1 is a number with the first i bits set, like 111... up to i bits.

If k has higher bits set, then OR'ing with (1<<i)-1 will set those higher bits anyway.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the number of 1's in the OR.

The OR will have a 1 in a bit position if at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, I need to have as many bit positions covered as possible.

The code chooses (1<<i)-1, which covers the first i bits, and then assigns the remaining value to another number.

This ensures that the first i bits are set in the OR, and the remaining value might set higher bits.

But is this the optimal way?

In the example with n=6, k=51, the code would output [31,20,0,0,0,0], whose OR is 31|20=31, which has five 1's.

In the example provided, [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is also 31, which has five 1's.

So, both achieve the same OR.

Is there a better way to get more 1's in the OR?

Let's see.

If I can have an OR that has more bits set to 1, that would be better.

But in this case, OR is 31, which is 11111, having five 1's.

Is it possible to get more than five 1's in the OR for n=6, k=51?

Let's see.

51 in binary is 110011, which is six bits, with the first, second, fifth, and sixth bits set.

Wait, 51 is 110011 in binary.

But 31 is 11111, which is five 1's.

Wait, 31 is 011111, and 51 is 110011.

Wait, no:

31 is 00011111

51 is 00110011

Wait, in 6 bits.

Wait, 31 is 00011111, which is 5 bits set.

51 is 00110011, which is four bits set.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is six bits: 110011.

So, it has the 6th, 5th, 3rd, and 2nd bits set, totaling four 1's.

Whereas 31 is 011111, which has the 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st bits set, totaling five 1's.

So, the OR of any numbers that include 31 and 51 would have at least those bits set.

But, is it possible to have more than five 1's in the OR?

Well, if I can have a sequence where the OR has more bits set to 1, that would be better.

But, considering that k=51, which has the 6th, 5th, 3rd, and 2nd bits set, and to achieve a higher OR, I need to have numbers in the sequence that set additional bits beyond these.

For example, if I include a number with the 7th bit set, but that would require that number to be at least 64, which is larger than k=51, but since we can have zeros in other numbers, it's possible.

Wait, but if I have a number with the 7th bit set, say 64, and other numbers summing to 51-64, which is negative, which is not allowed because numbers are non-negative.

Wait, no, if I have a number with the 7th bit set, but its value exceeds k, and since other numbers are non-negative, their sum can't make up for it.

Wait, no, if I have one number as 64, and the remaining numbers sum to 51-64=-13, which is invalid because numbers are non-negative.

Hence, I can't have any number exceeding k unless the remaining numbers can compensate, which in this case they can't because negative numbers are not allowed.

Hence, in this case, it's impossible to have a number with the 7th bit set without making the sum exceed k or requiring negative numbers.

Therefore, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is five, as achieved by the code's output.

Hence, for this test case, the code is correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=5.

As we saw earlier, the code outputs [3,2], whose OR is 3|2=3 (11 in binary, two 1's).

But is there a better sequence where the OR has more than two 1's?

Let's see.

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: OR is 5|0=5 (101 in binary, two 1's).

- [4,1]: OR is 4|1=5 (101 in binary, two 1's).

- [3,2]: OR is 3|2=3 (11 in binary, two 1's).

- [1,4]: OR is 1|4=5 (101 in binary, two 1's).

- [2,3]: OR is 2|3=3 (11 in binary, two 1's).

Seems like no matter how I distribute, the OR has at most two 1's.

Hence, the code's output is correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=5.

Simply output 5.

Correct.

Another test case: n=4, k=10.

Let's see.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <10: temp=2, i=1

2*2=4 <10: temp=4, i=2

4*2=8 <10: temp=8, i=3

8*2=16 <10: no, break

ans.append((1<<3)-1)=7

ans.append(10-7)=3

ans += [0]*(4-2)=2 zeros

So, output is [7,3,0,0]

OR is 7|3|0|0=7|3=7 (111 in binary, three 1's).

Is there a better sequence?

Let's see:

- [7,3,0,0]: OR=7|3|0|0=7 (111), three 1's.

- [4,3,3,0]: sum=10, OR=4|3|3|0=7 (111), three 1's.

- [1,1,1,7]: OR=1|1|1|7=7 (111), three 1's.

- [8,2,0,0]: OR=8|2|0|0=10 (1010), two 1's.

- [5,5,0,0]: OR=5|5|0|0=5 (101), two 1's.

So, the code's output is better than these alternatives.

Hence, it seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=1.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <1: no, break

ans.append((1<<0)-1)=0

ans.append(1-0)=1

ans += [0]*(3-2)=1 zero

So, output is [0,1,0]

OR is 0|1|0=1 (1 in binary, one 1).

Is there a better sequence?

- [1,0,0]: OR=1|0|0=1, one 1.

- [0,1,0]: same as above.

- [1,0,0]: same.

Seems like no better sequence exists.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=5, k=15.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <15: temp=2, i=1

2*2=4 <15: temp=4, i=2

4*2=8 <15: temp=8, i=3

8*2=16 <15: no, break

ans.append((1<<3)-1)=7

ans.append(15-7)=8

ans += [0]*(5-2)=3 zeros

So, output is [7,8,0,0,0]

OR is 7|8|0|0|0=15 (1111 in binary, four 1's).

Is there a better sequence?

- [1,2,4,8,0]: sum=15, OR=1|2|4|8|0=15 (1111), four 1's.

- [3,5,7,0,0]: OR=3|5|7|0|0=7, which is less good.

- [15,0,0,0,0]: OR=15|0|0|0|0=15, four 1's.

So, same as code's output.

Hence, correct.

Seems like the code is producing correct outputs for the test cases I tried.

Now, let's see if there are any edge cases where the code might fail.

Edge case 1: n=2, k=1.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <1: no, break

ans.append((1<<0)-1)=0

ans.append(1-0)=1

ans += [0]*(2-2)=0

Output: [0,1]

OR is 0|1=1 (1 in binary, one 1).

Is there a better sequence?

- [1,0]: OR=1|0=1, one 1.

- [0,1]: same as above.

Hence, correct.

Edge case 2: n=100000, k=1.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <1: no, break

ans.append((1<<0)-1)=0

ans.append(1-0)=1

ans += [0]*(100000-2)=99998 zeros

OR is 0|1|0|0|...=1 (one 1).

Is there a better sequence?

No, because only one number can be 1, others are 0.

Hence, correct.

Edge case 3: n=2, k=2.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <2: no, break

ans.append((1<<0)-1)=0

ans.append(2-0)=2

ans += [0]*(2-2)=0

Output: [0,2]

OR is 0|2=2 (10 in binary, one 1).

Is there a better sequence?

- [1,1]: OR=1|1=1 (1 in binary, one 1).

- [2,0]: same as code's output.

- [0,2]: same as code's output.

Hence, correct.

Edge case 4: n=3, k=7.

Following the code:

temp=1

1*2=2 <7: temp=2, i=1

2*2=4 <7: temp=4, i=2

4*2=8 <7: no, break

ans.append((1<<2)-1)=3

ans.append(7-3)=4

ans += [0]*(3-2)=1 zero

Output: [3,4,0]

OR is 3|4|0=7 (111 in binary, three 1's).

Is there a better sequence?

- [1,2,4]: OR=1|2|4=7 (111, three 1's).

- [3,4,0]: same as code's output.

- [7,0,0]: OR=7|0|0=7 (111, three 1's).

Hence, correct.

Seems like the
