Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vasya has an array `a` and he wants to add a permutation `p` to it, where `p` is a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n. After adding the permutation to the array, he wants to find out the maximum number of elements in the array that become equal to the same number.

Okay, so the task is to choose a permutation `p` such that when we add it to `a`, the resulting array has as many elements as possible that are all the same.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

So, for each test case, I'm given the length n of the array a, and then the array itself. I need to process multiple test cases, up to 2*10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which means I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of elements that become equal after adding the permutation. So, for each element a_i in the array, after adding p_i, it becomes a_i + p_i. I need to choose p such that as many a_i + p_i as possible are equal.

One way to think about this is to fix a target sum, say s, and see how many a_i + p_i can be equal to s. Then, I need to choose s such that this number is maximized.

But iterating over all possible s would be inefficient because a_i can be up to 10^9, and n can be up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the difference between the target s and a_i, which is p_i = s - a_i. Since p_i has to be a permutation from 1 to n, p_i has to be an integer between 1 and n, and all p_i have to be distinct.

So, for each a_i, p_i = s - a_i, and p_i must be unique and between 1 and n.

This means that for a given s, the p_i's are s - a_i, and they must all be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, to maximize the number of elements that can be set to s, I need to find how many a_i's can have p_i = s - a_i, where all p_i's are distinct and between 1 and n.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can look at it differently.

Let's consider the values a_i + p_i. I want as many of these as possible to be equal to some s.

So, for each a_i, p_i = s - a_i.

But p_i has to be a permutation of 1 to n, meaning all p_i are distinct and in 1 to n.

So, for each possible s, I can try to see how many a_i's allow p_i = s - a_i to be a unique value between 1 and n.

But checking this for every possible s would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal possible p_i.

The smallest p_i is 1, and the largest is n.

So, s - a_i should be between 1 and n.

That means s should be between a_i + 1 and a_i + n.

Wait, but p_i = s - a_i, and p_i should be between 1 and n.

So, s should be in the range a_i + 1 to a_i + n.

For each a_i, s has to be in [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

But s needs to be the same for multiple a_i's.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for the overlap of these intervals for different a_i's.

The more a_i's that have overlapping intervals, the more possible to choose s that satisfies multiple a_i's.

Wait, but even if intervals overlap, the p_i's have to be distinct.

This is getting messy.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I sort the array a.

Then, if I sort p as well, I can try to pair them in some way.

But p has to be a permutation, so I can't arbitrarily order p.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and then assign p_i's in a way that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the minimal possible p_i, which is 1, and the maximal is n.

If I sort a in ascending order, and assign p in ascending order, then a_i + p_i would be minimized for small a_i and small p_i.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I should look at the differences a_i - i.

Wait, perhaps I should consider assigning p_i's such that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to some central value.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix s, and try to see how many a_i's can have p_i = s - a_i, with p_i being distinct and in 1 to n.

To maximize the number of a_i's that can achieve this, I need to maximize the number of a_i's for which s - a_i is unique and within 1 to n.

This sounds like finding how many a_i's have distinct s - a_i, and s - a_i is between 1 and n.

But iterating over all possible s is not feasible due to the large range of a_i.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the equation p_i = s - a_i.

Since p_i has to be distinct for different i, s - a_i has to be distinct.

That means a_i + p_i = s, and all s are the same.

So, to have as many a_i + p_i = s as possible, I need as many a_i's as possible to have s - a_i being distinct and in 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the frequency of s - a_i.

But again, s can be anything.

Let me try to find the value of s that maximizes the number of a_i's for which s - a_i is unique and in 1 to n.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can look at it from the perspective of p_i.

Since p is a permutation of 1 to n, p contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

So, p_i's are all distinct and cover 1 to n.

Therefore, s - a_i should cover a subset of 1 to n, with no duplicates.

So, for a given s, the set {s - a_1, s - a_2, ..., s - a_k} should be a subset of 1 to n, with no duplicates.

I need to choose s such that as many a_i's as possible have s - a_i in 1 to n, and all s - a_i are distinct.

This seems complicated to maximize directly.

Perhaps I can look for the number of a_i's that satisfy s - a_i is in 1 to n, and all s - a_i are distinct.

To maximize this, I need to find how large such a subset can be.

Wait, maybe I can look at the frequency of a_i + p_i = s.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the array a.

Then, assign p_i's in a way that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

But p_i's have to be a permutation of 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and then assign p_i's in a specific order.

For example, sort a in ascending order and assign p_i's in descending order.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can find the frequency of a_i + p_i for all possible p and find the maximum frequency.

But that's not efficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of matching.

For each a_i, p_i can be any number from 1 to n, but all p_i's must be distinct.

So, it's like assigning unique p_i's to a_i's such that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to some common value s.

This sounds like a matching problem, but it's still not clear.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the differences between a_i and a_j.

But that might not help directly.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Possible permutations p:

[1,2]: a becomes [2,4], frequencies: 2:1, 4:1

[2,1]: a becomes [3,3], frequencies: 3:2

So, maximum is 2.

In this case, it's possible to make both elements equal to 3.

Another test case:

n = 4

a = [7,1,4,1]

Possible p:

Say p = [2,3,1,4]: a becomes [9,4,5,5], frequencies: 9:1,4:1,5:2

p = [4,1,3,2]: a becomes [11,2,7,3], frequencies: all unique

p = [1,4,2,3]: a becomes [8,5,6,4], frequencies: all unique

p = [3,2,4,1]: a becomes [10,3,8,2], frequencies: all unique

So, the maximum is 2.

From this, it seems that the maximum frequency is 2 in this case.

Looking for a pattern.

In the third test case:

n = 3

a = [103,102,104]

Possible p:

p = [1,2,3]: a becomes [104,104,107], frequencies: 104:2, 107:1

p = [2,1,3]: a becomes [105,103,107], frequencies: all unique

p = [3,1,2]: a becomes [106,103,106], frequencies: 106:2, 103:1

So, maximum frequency is 2.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 3 in some cases.

Wait, in the third test case, the output is 3.

Wait, let's check the third test case again.

n = 3

a = [103,102,104]

Possible p:

p = [1,2,3]: a becomes [104,104,107]

p = [1,3,2]: a becomes [104,105,106]

Wait, in this case, frequencies: 104:1,105:1,106:1

p = [2,1,3]: a becomes [105,103,107]

p = [2,3,1]: a becomes [105,105,105]

Wait, p = [2,3,1]: a becomes [105,105,105], frequencies: 105:3

So, maximum frequency is 3.

Ah, so in this case, it's possible to make all elements equal to 105.

So, perhaps the maximum frequency is equal to the number of a_i's that can be set to the same value s, given that p_i's are a permutation of 1 to n.

So, in this case, p = [2,3,1], a + p = [105,105,105]

So, p_i's are distinct and between 1 and n.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=2, a=[1,2], p=[2,1], a+p=[3,3]

In the second test case, n=4, a=[7,1,4,1], p=[2,3,1,4], a+p=[9,4,5,5], frequency 2.

So, in general, I need to maximize the number of a_i's that can be set to the same s, with p_i's being a permutation of 1 to n.

How can I find this efficiently?

Let me consider that p_i's are distinct and range from 1 to n.

So, for each a_i, p_i = s - a_i, and p_i must be unique and in 1 to n.

So, for a given s, the p_i's are s - a_i, and they must all be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a given s, the number of a_i's for which s - a_i is in 1 to n, and all such s - a_i are distinct, is the maximum frequency.

I need to find the maximum such frequency over all possible s.

But iterating over all possible s is not feasible due to the large range of a_i.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that s - a_i must be unique and in 1 to n.

So, for each a_i, s - a_i must be unique.

So, s must be a_i + p_i, where p_i is unique and in 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the a_i's and see how many of them can have p_i's assigned such that s - a_i are unique and within 1 to n.

This seems similar to assigning p_i's to a_i's such that a_i + p_i = s, and p_i's are distinct.

Wait, maybe I can think about the differences a_i - p_i, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, a_i + p_i = s, so p_i = s - a_i.

Since p_i's must be distinct and form a permutation of 1 to n, s - a_i must be distinct and in 1 to n.

So, for a given s, the set {s - a_1, s - a_2, ..., s - a_k} must be a subset of 1 to n with no duplicates.

I need to maximize k, the number of a_i's for which s - a_i is unique and in 1 to n.

This sounds like finding the largest subset of a_i's such that s - a_i are distinct and in 1 to n.

But s is the same for all a_i's in this subset.

So, I need to choose s such that as many a_i's as possible have s - a_i in 1 to n, and all s - a_i are distinct.

Wait, but s is the same for all a_i's in the subset, so s - a_i must be distinct, which implies that a_i's are distinct, because s is fixed.

Wait, no, a_i's can be the same, but s - a_i must be distinct.

Wait, but s is fixed, so s - a_i depends only on a_i.

So, if two a_i's are the same, then s - a_i would be the same for both, which violates the uniqueness of p_i's.

Therefore, in order for s - a_i to be unique for each i, a_i's must be unique.

Wait, no, if two a_i's are the same, s - a_i would be the same, which would violate the uniqueness of p_i's.

Therefore, in order for p_i's to be unique, a_i's must be unique.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

If two a_i's are the same, but s - a_i is different because s is the same, but p_i's would be the same if a_i's are the same.

Wait, let's see.

If a_i = a_j for i ≠ j, then p_i = s - a_i and p_j = s - a_j = s - a_i, so p_i = p_j, which violates the uniqueness of p_i's.

Therefore, in order for p_i's to be unique, a_i's must be unique.

Wait, but in the third test case, a = [103,102,104], which are all unique, and we can set s=105, and p_i's are [2,3,1], which are unique.

Similarly, in the first test case, a=[1,2], which are unique, and s=3, p_i's=[2,1].

In the second test case, a=[7,1,4,1], here a_i's are not all unique, since 1 appears twice.

In this case, we can only have at most 2 a_i's with unique p_i's, because there are two 1's.

So, in general, the maximum frequency is equal to the number of unique a_i's, provided that s can be chosen such that s - a_i are in 1 to n and unique.

Wait, but in the second test case, there are three unique a_i's: 7,1,4, but one of the 1's would have to have p_i = s -1, and the other 1 would have to have p_i = s -1, which would not be unique unless s -1 is assigned twice, which is not allowed.

Therefore, in cases where a_i's are not unique, the maximum frequency is limited by the number of unique a_i's.

Wait, but in the third test case, all a_i's are unique, and we can set all p_i's uniquely to make a_i + p_i = s.

So, perhaps the maximum frequency is equal to the number of unique a_i's, provided that for some s, s - a_i are all in 1 to n and unique.

But I need to maximize the frequency, so perhaps I need to find the largest subset of a_i's that can have s - a_i unique and in 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the unique a_i's and try to assign p_i's in a sorted order.

Let me try.

Suppose I take the unique a_i's, sort them, and then assign p_i's in ascending or descending order.

For example, in the third test case, unique a_i's are [102,103,104], sort them: [102,103,104], assign p_i's [1,2,3], so s = a_i + p_i = 103, but 102 + 2 = 104, 103 + 2 = 105, 104 + 1 = 105, which doesn't make all a_i + p_i equal.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign p_i's such that a_i + p_i are equal.

So, s = a_i + p_i, so p_i = s - a_i.

To have p_i's unique and in 1 to n, s - a_i must be unique and in 1 to n.

So, for a given s, the p_i's are s - a_i, and they must be unique and in 1 to n.

Therefore, for the a_i's that are chosen, their corresponding p_i's must be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, to maximize the number of such a_i's, I need to choose s such that as many a_i's as possible have s - a_i unique and in 1 to n.

This seems tricky to maximize directly.

Let me consider that s - a_i must be in 1 to n, so s must be in a_i +1 to a_i +n.

For each a_i, s must be in [a_i +1, a_i +n].

So, to have multiple a_i's overlapping in their possible s ranges.

This sounds like finding the intersection of these intervals.

The more a_i's that have overlapping intervals, the more possible to choose an s that satisfies multiple a_i's.

So, perhaps I can model this as interval overlapping.

Each a_i defines an interval [a_i +1, a_i +n].

I need to find the s that is in the maximum number of these intervals.

This is a classic interval overlapping problem, where I need to find the point with the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

To solve this, I can sort the start and end points of all intervals and find the point where the most intervals overlap.

But in this problem, n can be up to 2*10^5, so I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each a_i, I have an interval [a_i +1, a_i +n].

I can collect all the start points (a_i +1) and end points (a_i +n +1, since the interval is inclusive).

Then, I can sort these points and keep a counter of the current number of overlapping intervals.

As I iterate through the sorted points, I can keep track of the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

Wait, but in this case, all intervals have the same length, since a_i +n - (a_i +1) +1 = n.

But I need to find the s that is in the maximum number of intervals.

So, I can collect all start points and end points, sort them, and keep a counter to see how many intervals are active at any point.

Then, the maximum value of this counter will be the maximum number of overlapping intervals, which corresponds to the maximum frequency.

Let me try this with the third test case.

n=3

a=[103,102,104]

Intervals:

For a=103: [104,106]

For a=102: [103,105]

For a=104: [105,107]

So, start points: 104,103,105

End points: 107,106,105

Sort all points:

103 (start), 104 (start), 105 (start), 105 (end), 106 (end), 107 (end)

Now, iterate through these points:

At 103: start, count=1

At 104: start, count=2

At 105: start, count=3

At 105: end, count=2

At 106: end, count=1

At 107: end, count=0

So, the maximum overlapping is 3, which matches the sample output for this test case.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n
