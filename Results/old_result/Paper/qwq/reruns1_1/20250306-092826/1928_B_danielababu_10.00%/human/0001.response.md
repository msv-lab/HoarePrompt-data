Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vasya has an array `a` and he wants to add a permutation `p` to it, where `p` is a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n. After adding the permutation to the array, he wants to find out the maximum number of elements in the array that become equal to the same number.

Okay, so for each test case, I'm given the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. I need to choose a permutation `p` such that when I add `p_i` to `a_i` for each i, the resulting array has as many elements as possible that are equal.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n. So, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Given that, I need to choose one such permutation and add it to the array `a`, element-wise, and then see how many elements in the resulting array are the same.

The goal is to maximize this count for each test case.

Looking at the example:

Input:

7

2

1 2

4

7 1 4 1

3

103 102 104

5

1 101 1 100 1

5

1 10 100 1000 1

2

3 1

3

1000000000 999999997 999999999

Output:

2

2

3

2

1

1

2

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=[1,2]. The optimal permutation is p=[2,1], resulting in a'=[3,3], so the maximum count is 2.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[7,1,4,1]. With p=[2,3,1,4], a' becomes [9,4,5,5], so the maximum count is 2.

I need to find a general way to solve this for any given array `a` and length `n`.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to choose a permutation `p` such that as many `a_i + p_i` as possible are equal to some value.

Let's consider that `p` is a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n]. So, each `p_i` is unique and lies between 1 and n.

I need to maximize the frequency of some number in the array after addition.

One way to think about this is to fix a target sum `s`, and see how many `a_i + p_i` can equal `s`. Then, choose the `s` that maximizes this count.

But iterating over all possible `s` might not be efficient, especially since `a_i` can be up to 10^9 and `n` can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, with a total of up to 2*10^4 test cases.

I need a smarter way to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

Let me consider the difference between the target `s` and each `a_i`. That is, for each `a_i`, p_i should be equal to `s - a_i`.

But p_i must be a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n], and all p_i must be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for each possible `s`, the p_i = s - a_i must form a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n].

But checking this for every possible `s` would be too slow.

Alternatively, I can think about sorting the array and assigning p_i values accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and assign p_i in a way to make as many a_i + p_i equal as possible.

Let's consider sorting the array `a` in ascending order.

Then, assign p_i in such a way that p_i is larger for larger a_i, to try to make a_i + p_i equal.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the differences between the elements.

Let me consider that I want to make a_i + p_i equal to some s for as many i as possible.

So, for each i, p_i = s - a_i.

But p_i must be a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n], so s - a_i must be unique and within 1 to n.

Therefore, for a fixed s, the set {s - a_i} must be a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n].

But I can turn this around: for each i, p_i = s - a_i, and p_i must be unique and in [1,n].

So, for each possible s, I can count how many a_i's satisfy s - a_i is in [1,n], and all s - a_i are distinct.

But checking this for every possible s is not efficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the equation p_i = s - a_i.

Rearranged, s = a_i + p_i.

So, for each i, p_i = s - a_i.

Since p_i must be a permutation of [1,2,3,...,n], the values of s - a_i must be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a fixed s, the set {s - a_i} must be a subset of [1,n], with no duplicates.

I need to choose s such that as many s - a_i as possible are distinct and within [1,n].

Wait, but I need exactly n distinct p_i's, but some of them might be out of [1,n].

But since p_i must be a permutation of [1,n], all p_i's must be in [1,n], and all must be distinct.

So, for a fixed s, I can count how many a_i's have s - a_i in [1,n], and ensure that all s - a_i are distinct.

But again, checking for all possible s is not efficient.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of a_i's for which s - a_i is in [1,n], and all s - a_i are distinct.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array a in ascending order.

Then, assign p_i in such a way that the smallest a_i gets the largest possible p_i, to try to balance a_i + p_i.

Wait, maybe matching the smallest a_i with the smallest p_i, or the largest p_i.

I need to experiment.

Let me consider that to maximize the frequency of a particular sum, I need to make as many a_i + p_i equal to that sum as possible.

So, I need to choose p_i's such that a_i + p_i is equal to some s for as many i as possible.

Given that p_i's are a permutation of [1,n], their sum is fixed: n(n+1)/2.

So, the sum of a_i + p_i over all i is sum(a) + n(n+1)/2.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can look into the frequency of a_i + p_i for different p_i assignments.

But that seems too broad.

Let me consider the problem in another way.

Suppose I fix a target sum s.

Then, for each a_i, p_i must be s - a_i.

For p_i to be a valid permutation element, s - a_i must be an integer between 1 and n, inclusive, and all s - a_i must be distinct.

So, for a fixed s, I can count how many a_i's satisfy s - a_i is in [1,n], and ensure that all s - a_i are distinct.

I need to choose s such that this count is maximized.

But iterating over all possible s is not feasible because a_i can be up to 10^9.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the possible values of s.

Since p_i ranges from 1 to n, s must be in the range a_i + 1 to a_i + n for each i.

But across all i, s must satisfy this for as many i as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the intersection of these ranges.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the array a in ascending order.

Let's sort a: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

Now, assign p_i in such a way to maximize the frequency of a certain sum.

What if I assign p_i in ascending order as well?

So, p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, ..., p_n = n.

Then, a_1 + 1, a_2 + 2, ..., a_n + n.

But I need to make as many of these sums equal as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can shift the p_i's to align more a_i + p_i to a certain sum.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the difference between the elements.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order.

Then, to make a_i + p_i equal for as many i as possible, I need p_i to be such that p_i = s - a_i.

Since p_i must be distinct and in [1,n], s - a_i must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for a fixed s, the number of i where s - a_i is in [1,n] and all s - a_i are distinct is the count of i where p_i = s - a_i is valid.

I need to maximize this count over all possible s.

But iterating over all possible s is not efficient.

I need a smarter way to find the best s.

Let me consider that s can range from min(a_i) + 1 to max(a_i) + n.

Because for s < min(a_i) + 1, s - a_i would be less than 1 for all i, which is invalid.

Similarly, for s > max(a_i) + n, s - a_i would be greater than n for all i, which is also invalid.

So, s can be in [min(a_i) + 1, max(a_i) + n].

But even then, this range can be large, up to 10^9.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem from the perspective of matching a_i's to p_i's such that a_i + p_i is equal to some s.

This is similar to matching a_i to p_i where p_i = s - a_i, and p_i must be a permutation of [1,n].

This sounds like matching in bipartite graphs, where one set is a_i and the other is p_i, and edges exist where p_i = s - a_i.

But again, this seems too slow for the constraints.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of matches where p_i = s - a_i, with p_i being a permutation of [1,n], for some s.

Let me think about the frequency of s - a_i.

For each a_i, s - a_i must be an integer between 1 and n, and all must be distinct.

So, for a fixed s, the number of valid i is the number of i where s - a_i is in [1,n], and these s - a_i must be distinct.

This seems tricky to maximize directly.

Wait, perhaps I can look at it differently.

Let me consider that p_i can be any permutation of [1,n], and I need to maximize the number of a_i + p_i that are equal to some s.

This is equivalent to maximizing the frequency of s in the multiset {a_i + p_i}.

But since p is a permutation, the p_i's are distinct and in [1,n].

I need to choose p to maximize the frequency of some s in {a_i + p_i}.

This seems similar to assigning p_i to maximize collisions in a_i + p_i.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider sorting the array a.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

Now, assign p_i in some order to maximize the number of a_i + p_i that are equal.

One idea is to assign the smallest p_i to the largest a_i, so that a_i + p_i is as small as possible.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, assign p_i in such a way to make a_i + p_i as close as possible to some target s.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that to have a_i + p_i equal for different i, the differences between a_i and a_j should be compensated by the differences between p_i and p_j.

So, if a_i - a_j = p_j - p_i.

Wait, if a_i + p_i = a_j + p_j, then p_j - p_i = a_i - a_j.

So, the differences in p_i and p_j should be equal to the negative of the differences in a_i and a_j.

This seems complicated to work with directly.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of frequency counts.

Suppose I fix a target sum s, and see how many a_i's can have p_i = s - a_i, where s - a_i is in [1,n], and all p_i's are distinct.

To maximize the number of a_i's that satisfy this, I need to choose s such that as many s - a_i as possible are in [1,n], and these s - a_i's are all distinct.

But since p_i's must be a permutation of [1,n], the s - a_i's must form a subset of [1,n], with no duplicates.

So, for each s, I can count how many a_i's have s - a_i in [1,n], and ensure that these s - a_i's are all distinct.

I need to maximize this count over all possible s.

But again, iterating over all possible s is not efficient.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that s - a_i is in [1,n], so s is in [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

For each a_i, s must be in [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

So, to have multiple a_i's contributing to the same s, their intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n] must overlap.

I need to find an s that is in the intersection of as many of these intervals as possible.

This sounds like finding the s that is in the maximum number of intervals.

This can be solved using a sweep line algorithm.

I can keep track of the start and end points of these intervals and find the s that maximizes the number of overlapping intervals.

Once I have the maximum number of overlapping intervals, that would be the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each a_i, define an interval where s can be from a_i + 1 to a_i + n.

Then, find the s that is in the maximum number of these intervals.

This can be done by sorting the start and end points and keeping a counter.

Let's try to implement this idea.

First, collect all intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n] for each a_i.

Then, sort all the start and end points.

As I sweep through the number line, I keep track of how many intervals are active at each point.

The maximum number of overlapping intervals will be the answer.

But considering the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 and a_i up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to do this.

I need to sort 2*n points (start and end points), which is manageable since 2*n is up to 4*10^5.

Then, as I iterate through these points, I can keep a counter of active intervals and track the maximum.

This should work efficiently.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For each a_i, define the interval [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

2. Collect all start points a_i + 1 and end points a_i + n.

3. Sort all these points.

4. Iterate through the sorted points:

a. If it's a start point, increment the counter.

b. If it's an end point, decrement the counter.

c. Keep track of the maximum counter value.

5. The maximum counter value is the answer.

Wait, but I need to ensure that s is chosen such that all s - a_i are distinct and in [1,n].

In this sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals gives me the maximum number of a_i's that can have s in their respective intervals [a_i + 1, a_i + n].

However, I need to ensure that for these a_i's, the p_i's assigned are distinct.

In the sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals gives me the potential maximum count, but I need to confirm that the p_i's are distinct.

Wait, in the sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals is the maximum number of a_i's for which s - a_i are distinct and in [1,n], because each interval corresponds to a unique p_i for that a_i.

Wait, no. Multiple a_i's can have the same s - a_i if a_i + p_i = s, but p_i must be distinct for each i.

Actually, in the sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals gives the maximum number of a_i's for which their intervals contain s.

But I need to ensure that for these a_i's, the p_i's assigned are distinct, which they would be because p_i = s - a_i, and s is fixed.

So, as long as s - a_i are distinct for these a_i's, which they would be if s is in their intervals and p_i's are assigned as s - a_i, then the p_i's will be distinct.

Wait, no. If s is fixed, then p_i = s - a_i must be distinct for different a_i's.

But if two a_i's have the same s - a_i, that would mean p_i is the same for both, which is not allowed since p must be a permutation.

So, in reality, for a fixed s, the p_i's must be distinct for different a_i's.

In the sweep line approach, the maximum number of overlapping intervals gives the maximum number of a_i's for which s - a_i is in [1,n], but I need to ensure that these s - a_i's are distinct.

The sweep line approach doesn't directly account for the distinctness of s - a_i's across different a_i's.

So, perhaps this approach overcounts in some cases.

Wait, but if I choose s such that the intervals overlap for multiple a_i's, and s - a_i are in [1,n], but it's possible that s - a_i equals s - a_j for different i and j, which would mean p_i = p_j, which is invalid.

So, the sweep line approach gives the potential maximum, but it doesn't account for the constraint that p_i's must be distinct.

Therefore, I need a way to ensure that among the a_i's that are chosen, their corresponding p_i = s - a_i are distinct.

This seems more complicated.

Is there a way to adjust the sweep line approach to account for this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the a_i's and assign p_i's in a way that s - a_i are distinct and within [1,n], maximizing the number of assignments.

This sounds similar to matching in bipartite graphs, where one set is a_i's and the other is p_i's, and there is an edge from a_i to p_i if p_i = s - a_i for some s.

But again, this seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a fixed s, the p_i's are determined as s - a_i, and they must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for a fixed s, the number of valid a_i's is the number of a_i's where s - a_i is in [1,n], and all s - a_i's are distinct.

Since p_i's must be a permutation of [1,n], the s - a_i's must be a subset of [1,n], with no duplicates.

Therefore, for a fixed s, the maximum number of a_i's that can be assigned a p_i = s - a_i is the number of a_i's where s - a_i is in [1,n], and these s - a_i's are all distinct.

But since p_i's must be distinct, the number of such a_i's is limited by the number of unique s - a_i's in [1,n].

Wait, but s - a_i must be unique for each a_i chosen.

So, the maximum number is the size of the largest subset of a_i's where s - a_i are distinct and in [1,n].

But s is variable, so I need to choose s such that as many a_i's as possible have distinct s - a_i in [1,n].

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the p_i's to be a permutation of [1,n], and try to maximize the frequency of a certain sum s in a_i + p_i.

But this seems similar to the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the differences between a_i's and see how they can be compensated by p_i's.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case:

n=2, a=[1,2]

Possible permutations p:

[1,2]: a'=[2,4]

[2,1]: a'=[3,3]

So, in this case, choosing p=[2,1] gives two elements equal to 3.

Hence, the answer is 2.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[7,1,4,1]

Possible p's:

[1,2,3,4]: a'=[8,3,7,5]

[1,2,4,3]: a'=[8,3,8,4]

Wait, a'=[8,3,8,4], so two 8's.

[1,3,2,4]: a'=[8,4,6,
