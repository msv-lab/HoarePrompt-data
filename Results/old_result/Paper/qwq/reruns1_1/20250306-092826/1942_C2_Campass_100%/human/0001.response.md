Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a regular polygon with n sides, and she's already chosen x vertices. I need to choose up to y additional vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. It's a polygon with all sides and angles equal, and its vertices are evenly spaced. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise manner.

Bessie has chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. The total number of vertices we can use is x + y. The goal is to draw non-intersecting diagonals using these vertices to form as many triangles as possible.

I need to maximize the number of triangular pieces. So, I should think about how to divide the polygon into triangles using the chosen vertices.

I recall that in a polygon, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is related to the number of sides. Specifically, for a convex polygon with k sides, the number of triangles formed by drawing diagonals is k - 2.

But in this problem, the polygon is regular, and we're choosing subsets of vertices to draw diagonals.

Wait, but the problem allows us to choose up to y additional vertices, and we need to maximize the number of triangles.

Maybe I should think about dividing the polygon into smaller polygons and count the triangles in each.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several sections, and in each section, I can form a certain number of triangles.

Given that the polygon is convex, any diagonals drawn between the chosen vertices will not intersect inside the polygon.

So, if I have a set of chosen vertices, they divide the polygon into several non-overlapping polygons, each of which can be triangulated.

I need to maximize the total number of triangles across all these smaller polygons.

Given that, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all the smaller polygons of (number of sides - 2).

So, my goal is to choose up to y additional vertices to maximize the sum of (sides - 2) for all the resulting polygons.

I need to find a way to choose y vertices that maximize this sum.

Let me think about how adding a vertex affects the number of triangles.

When I add a vertex to one of the sections, it splits that section into two smaller polygons, each of which can be triangulated separately.

Suppose I have a section with k sides. If I add a vertex on one of its edges, it splits that edge into two, increasing the number of sides of that polygon by one.

So, the number of triangles in that polygon would increase by one.

Wait, no. If I have a polygon with k sides and I add one vertex on one of its edges, splitting one edge into two, the new polygon has k + 1 sides.

The number of triangles in that polygon would be (k + 1) - 2 = k - 1, which is one more than the original k - 2.

So, adding one vertex to a polygon increases the number of triangles by one.

But, in reality, adding a vertex can split one polygon into two.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose I have a cycle of chosen vertices, and adding a vertex inside one of the edges splits that cycle into two separate cycles.

Each new cycle can then be triangulated separately.

So, adding one vertex can potentially split one polygon into two, each of which contributes (sides - 2) triangles.

So, the net effect would be:

Original: (k - 2) triangles.

After adding a vertex that splits the polygon into two with sides k1 and k2, where k1 + k2 = k + 2 (since the new vertex adds two new edges).

Then, the number of triangles becomes (k1 - 2) + (k2 - 2) = k1 + k2 - 4 = (k + 2) - 4 = k - 2.

Wait, that's the same as before.

So, adding a vertex in this way doesn't increase the total number of triangles.

Wait, but in the example provided, it seems like adding vertices does increase the number of triangles.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider a specific example.

Take n = 6, x = 3, y = 1.

Suppose Bessie chooses vertices 1, 3, 5.

These divide the polygon into three quadrilaterals, each of which can be triangulated into two triangles.

So, total triangles would be 3 * (4 - 2) = 6.

If I choose one additional vertex, say vertex 2, it splits one of the quadrilaterals into two triangles.

So, now I have two triangles instead of one quadrilateral in that section.

So, total triangles would be 2 (from the section where I added the vertex) plus 4 from the other two quadrilaterals, totaling 6.

Wait, that's the same as before.

But according to the problem, in some cases, adding vertices increases the number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider how the added vertex affects the division.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a cycle of chosen vertices, and adding a vertex inside one of the edges creates two new triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the dual graph or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the number of triangles per section and find a way to maximize the sum.

Given that, perhaps the best strategy is to choose vertices in such a way that maximizes the number of small polygons, since smaller polygons have a higher (sides - 2) per side.

Wait, but triangles are already formed, so maybe not.

Wait, no, triangles are the smallest polygons, and (3 - 2) = 1, while larger polygons have more triangles.

Wait, no, actually, for a polygon with k sides, the number of triangles is k - 2.

So, for k = 3, it's 1; for k = 4, it's 2; for k = 5, it's 3; and so on.

So, larger polygons contribute more triangles.

But adding vertices splits polygons into smaller ones, which might decrease the total number of triangles.

Wait, but in the example, it seems like adding vertices increases the number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that adding a vertex can create more triangles in a different way.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the diagonals can cross inside the polygon.

But the problem says the diagonals must be non-intersecting.

So, perhaps I need to think in terms of triangulations of the polygon.

In a triangulation of a convex polygon, the number of triangles is always n - 2, where n is the number of sides.

But in this problem, we have some vertices chosen, and we can choose up to y more, and we need to maximize the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the dual graph of the triangulation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each triangle corresponds to three chosen vertices that form a triangle.

But I need to make sure that the diagonals do not intersect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the chosen vertices form a subset of the polygon's vertices, and the number of triangles is related to the number of triangles that can be formed within the subset.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several non-overlapping polygons, and the total number of triangles is the sum of (sides - 2) for each of these polygons.

So, my goal is to maximize the sum of (sides - 2) over all the polygons formed by the chosen vertices.

Now, adding a vertex splits one polygon into two, and since (k - 2) + (m - 2) = k + m - 4, compared to the original (k + m - 2 - 2) = k + m - 4, it's the same.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have two polygons sharing an edge, and I add a vertex on that shared edge, splitting it into two edges, then each new polygon will have one more side.

So, if I had two polygons with k and m sides sharing an edge, and I add a vertex on that edge, then the new polygons will have k' = k + 1 and m' = m + 1 sides.

The total number of triangles would be (k' - 2) + (m' - 2) = (k + 1 - 2) + (m + 1 - 2) = k + m - 4 + 2 = k + m - 2.

But originally, it was (k - 2) + (m - 2) = k + m - 4.

So, by adding one vertex, the total number of triangles increases by 2.

Wait, that seems promising.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me consider a simple case.

Suppose n = 4, x = 2, y = 1.

Bessie chooses two vertices, say 1 and 3.

Then, the polygon is divided into two triangles.

So, total triangles is 2.

If I choose one additional vertex, say 2, then I can draw diagonals to form more triangles.

Wait, in this case, choosing vertex 2 would split one of the triangles into three triangles.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a quadrilateral with vertices 1,2,3,4, if Bessie chooses 1 and 3, then the polygon is divided into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 1-3-4.

If I choose vertex 2, I can draw diagonals from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3, forming three triangles: 1-2-3, 2-3-4, and 1-2-4.

Wait, but in this case, the total number of triangles is 3, which is more than the original 2.

So, adding one vertex increased the number of triangles by 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it should have increased by 2.

Hmm, perhaps my earlier reasoning was flawed.

Let me think again.

Suppose I have a polygon divided into several polygons by the chosen vertices.

Each time I add a vertex, I can split one polygon into two, each with one more side.

So, if I have a polygon with k sides, splitting it into two polygons with k1 and k2 sides, where k1 + k2 = k + 2.

Then, (k1 - 2) + (k2 - 2) = k + 2 - 4 = k - 2.

So, the total number of triangles remains the same.

Wait, that suggests that adding a vertex doesn't change the total number of triangles.

But in the earlier example, it did increase by 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the quadrilateral example, choosing two vertices divides it into two triangles.

Choosing a third vertex splits one of those triangles into three triangles, totaling three triangles.

So, it increased by one.

But according to the formula, it should remain the same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in that case, choosing the third vertex merges some polygons.

I need to think differently.

Maybe the total number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen triangles minus 2 times the number of polygons.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of chosen vertices minus the number of polygons minus 1.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me look for a general formula.

I recall that in a planar graph, the number of faces f is related to the number of vertices v and edges e by Euler's formula: f = e - v + 1 + h, where h is the number of holes.

But in this case, it's a convex polygon, so h = 0.

But perhaps that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of triangles formed by the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each triangle corresponds to three chosen vertices that form a triangle.

But I need to make sure that the diagonals do not intersect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles in a triangulation of the polygon.

In a triangulation of a convex polygon with n sides, the number of triangles is n - 2.

But in this problem, we have some chosen vertices and can choose up to y more.

I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by these chosen vertices.

Wait, maybe I need to maximize the number of triangles that can be formed by the chosen vertices, with the constraint that the diagonals do not intersect.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles that can be cut out from the polygon by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

Wait, maybe it's similar to triangulating the polygon with some constraints on the vertices used.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 1e9 and x can be up to 2e5 per test case, with t up to 1e4.

So, I need an O(x log x) per test case solution.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n = 8, x = 4, y = 2

Chosen vertices: 1,6,2,5

Output: 6

Second test case:

n = 7, x = 3, y = 1

Chosen vertices: 6,4,3

Output: 5

Third test case:

n = 4, x = 2, y = 2

Chosen vertices: 1,3

Output: 2

Looking at the first test case, with n=8, x=4, y=2, output is 6.

In a regular octagon, with x=4 vertices chosen, and y=2 additional vertices chosen, the maximum number of triangular pieces is 6.

Similarly, in the second test case, with n=7, x=3, y=1, output is 5.

In the third test case, with n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2.

Wait, in the third test case, with n=4, x=2, y=2, choosing 2 additional vertices would mean choosing all 4 vertices.

In a quadrilateral, with all 4 vertices chosen, the number of triangles is 2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, perhaps the formula is that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

Wait, in the first test case, x + y = 6, so 6 - 2 = 4, but the output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

In the second test case, x + y = 4, so 4 - 2 = 2, but output is 5.

So, that doesn't match either.

In the third test case, x + y = 4, so 4 - 2 = 2, and output is 2.

So, only sometimes it matches.

Therefore, that can't be the general formula.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the number of cycles formed by the chosen vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed by triples of chosen vertices, with no two triangles sharing an edge.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a convex polygon with x + y chosen vertices.

I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals to maximize the number of triangles.

I recall that in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is k - 2.

But in this problem, only some vertices are chosen, and I can choose up to y more.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the sum of (k - 2) over all the polygons formed by the chosen vertices.

But earlier, that didn't seem to work.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me consider that each time I add a vertex, I can split one polygon into two, increasing the number of triangles.

Wait, in the quadrilateral example, adding one vertex increased the number of triangles by one.

Similarly, in the first test case, with x=4 and y=2, the increase is from x - 2 to x + y - 2, which is 4 - 2 = 2 to 6 - 2 = 4, but the output is 6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each added vertex can create multiple triangles.

Wait, maybe for each added vertex, it can create a certain number of triangles based on where it's added.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider sorting the chosen vertices in clockwise order and computing the gaps between them.

So, if I have x chosen vertices, there are x gaps between them.

Each gap has a certain number of vertices that can be chosen.

I can choose up to y vertices in these gaps.

I need to decide how many vertices to choose in each gap to maximize the total number of triangles.

But how does the number of triangles relate to the gaps?

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as choosing how many vertices to add in each gap, subject to the total number of additional vertices being at most y, and then computing the total number of triangles based on the sizes of the gaps.

Let me consider that each gap has c vertices that can be chosen.

If I choose c' vertices in that gap, then the number of triangles contributed by that gap might be related to c'.

But I need to find the exact relationship.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each gap corresponds to a chord in the polygon, and adding vertices in that gap splits the chord into smaller segments, creating more triangles.

But I need a precise way to calculate this.

Let me look for a formula that relates the number of triangles to the number of vertices and the gaps between them.

Suppose I have a gap with c vertices.

If I choose c' vertices from this gap, how many triangles do I get?

Wait, perhaps for each gap, the number of triangles is equal to c' + (original polygon's contribution).

I need to find a formula for the number of triangles per gap.

Alternatively, perhaps for each gap with c vertices, and choosing c' vertices, the number of triangles is c' * 2.

Wait, in the quadrilateral example, with c=1, c'=1, triangles increase by 1, but according to c' * 2, it would be 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's c' * something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's c' * (c' + 1).

But in the quadrilateral example, that would be 1 * 2 = 2, which still doesn't match the observed increase of 1.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that adding c' vertices in a gap with c vertices splits the gap into c' + 1 smaller sections.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is k - 2.

So, if I have multiple polygons formed by the chosen vertices, the total number of triangles is the sum of (k_i - 2) for each polygon.

Therefore, to maximize the total number of triangles, I need to maximize the sum of (k_i - 2) over all polygons.

This is equivalent to maximizing the sum of k_i minus 2 times the number of polygons.

Now, the sum of k_i is equal to the total number of chosen vertices plus the number of polygons minus 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a planar graph, the sum of the degrees of the faces is equal to twice the number of edges.

But perhaps that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where the chosen vertices are nodes, and the edges are the sides of the polygon and the diagonals.

Then, the number of triangles is equal to the number of 3-cycles in this graph.

But counting the number of 3-cycles is not straightforward.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several non-overlapping polygons, and for each such polygon, the number of triangles is k - 2, where k is the number of vertices of that polygon.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is the sum over all such polygons of (k - 2).

So, my goal is to maximize this sum by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Now, how can I maximize the sum of (k - 2) over all polygons?

Wait, adding a vertex splits one polygon into two, so the sum changes by (k1 - 2) + (k2 - 2) - (k - 2) = k1 + k2 - k - 2.

Since k1 + k2 = k + 2, this change is (k + 2 - 2) - (k - 2) = k - (k - 2) = 2.

So, adding one vertex increases the total number of triangles by 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is x - 2 plus 2 times the number of additional vertices chosen, up to y.

But in the first test case, x = 4, y = 2, so triangles = 4 - 2 + 2 * 2 = 2 + 4 = 6, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, x = 3, y = 1, triangles = 3 - 2 + 2 * 1 = 1 + 2 = 3, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, in the second test case, with x=3 and y=1, choosing one additional vertex would split one of the polygons, increasing the number of triangles by 2, so total triangles would be (3 - 2) + 2 = 3, but the sample output is 5.

So, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the initial x vertices already form some triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of polygons formed by the initial x vertices.

If x vertices are chosen, they divide the polygon into some number of polygons.

I need to find the initial number of polygons and then see how adding vertices affects the total number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the number of polygons formed by the x chosen vertices.

In a convex polygon, choosing x vertices can divide the polygon into x - h - 1 polygons, where h is the number of holes or something.

But I need to find a precise formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the chosen vertices and compute the gaps between them.

Let me try that.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices in a convex polygon with n vertices.

I can sort them in clockwise order and compute the number of vertices between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices.

Let me denote the gaps as c1, c2, ..., cx, where c1 + c2 + ... + cx = n - x.

Each ci represents the number of vertices between the ith and (i+1)th chosen vertex.

Now, I can choose up to y additional vertices, distributing them among the gaps.

Let me denote that in the ith gap, I choose ci' additional vertices, with sum of ci' over all i <= y.

Now, I need to compute the total number of triangles based on the choices of ci'.

I need to find a way to maximize this sum.

I need to find a formula that expresses the total number of triangles in terms of the ci and ci'.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each gap with ci vertices and ci' chosen vertices results in a certain number of triangles.

I need to find out how many triangles are formed per gap.

Wait, perhaps for each gap, the number of triangles is ci' + 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a gap with ci vertices, choosing ci' vertices divides that gap into ci' + 1 smaller sections.

Each section corresponds to a polygon with a certain number of sides.

Wait, perhaps for each gap with ci vertices and ci' chosen vertices, the number of triangles is ci' * 2.

But earlier, that didn't match the sample.

Wait, perhaps it's ci' + 1.

In the quadrilateral example, ci = 1, ci' = 1, triangles increase by 1, which matches ci' + 1 = 2, but that's not correct because the total triangles are 3, which is an increase of 1 from the original 2.

Wait, perhaps it's ci' triangles per gap.

But then in the quadrilateral example, ci' = 1, triangles increase by 1, which matches.

Wait, but according to the
